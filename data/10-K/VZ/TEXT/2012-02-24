VERIZON WIRELESS

BACKGROUND

OUR VERIZON WIRELESS SEGMENT, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DOING BUSINESS AS VERIZON WIRELESS (VERIZON WIRELESS), IS A JOINT VENTURE FORMED IN APRIL 2000 BY THE COMBINATION OF THE U.S.

WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE). VERIZON OWNS A CONTROLLING 55% INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS, AND VODAFONE OWNS THE REMAINING 45%. VERIZON WIRELESS PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ACROSS ONE

OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS THE LARGEST THIRD-GENERATION (3G) AND FOURTH-GENERATION (4G) LONG-TERM EVOLUTION TECHNOLOGY (LTE) NETWORKS OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER.

VERIZON WIRELESS IS THE LARGEST WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES AS MEASURED BY RETAIL CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011, VERIZON WIRELESS HAD 92.2 MILLION RETAIL CUSTOMERS AND 2011 REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $70.2 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 63% OF VERIZONS 2011 AGGREGATE REVENUES.

IN 2010, WE LAUNCHED OUR 4G LTE MOBILE BROADBAND NETWORK, WHICH PROVIDES HIGHER DATA THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVED NETWORK

EFFICIENCIES. AS OF JANUARY 19, 2012, WE HAVE DEPLOYED 4G LTE IN 195 MARKETS COVERING MORE THAN 200 MILLION PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE EXPECT TO DEPLOY 4G LTE IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR CURRENT 3G NETWORK FOOTPRINT BY MID-2013.

WIRELESS SERVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS

OUR WIRELESS SERVICES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS RECEIVING SERVICE UNDER THE VERIZON WIRELESS BRAND. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS RECEIVE SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK ON A

WHOLESALE BASIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WIRELESS SERVICES

WE OFFER VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ON A POSTPAID AND PREPAID BASIS. POSTPAID CUSTOMERS REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL LINES OF SERVICE FOR WHICH A CUSTOMER IS BILLED AND PAYS IN ADVANCE A MONTHLY ACCESS CHARGE IN

RETURN FOR A MONTHLY VOICE AND/OR DATA SERVICE ALLOWANCE, AND USE OF ANY SERVICES BEYOND THE ALLOWANCE IS BILLED IN ARREARS. OUR PREPAID SERVICE ENABLES INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN WIRELESS DATA AND VOICE SERVICES WITHOUT A LONG-TERM CONTRACT OR CREDIT

VERIFICATION BY PAYING IN ADVANCE. APPROXIMATELY 95% OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS RECEIVED OUR DATA AND VOICE SERVICES ON A POSTPAID BASIS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011.

DATA SERVICES

AS WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO UPGRADE THEIR

NETWORKS TO ENHANCE DATA-CARRYING CAPABILITIES AND TO PERMIT HIGHER-SPEED DATA TRANSMISSION, THE DEMAND FOR FULL INTERNET BROWSING CAPABILITIES FOR PHONES AND THE PROLIFERATION OF WIRELESS DATA APPLICATIONS FOR WIRELESS-ENABLED LAPTOPS, PHONES AND

OTHER WIRELESS DEVICES IS INCREASING AND DRIVING WIRELESS DATA USAGE. THIS GROWING DEMAND FOR WIRELESS DATA SERVICES HAS, IN TURN, SPURRED THE DEMAND FOR STILL-HIGHER-SPEED NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARRAY OF MORE ADVANCED

WIRELESS DEVICES THAT INCLUDE MORE ROBUST DATA FUNCTIONALITY. OUR 4G LTE NETWORK PROVIDES US WITH HIGHER DATA THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVED NETWORK EFFICIENCIES COMPARED TO THOSE OFFERED BY 3G TECHNOLOGIES. DURING 2011, WE BEGAN OFFERING AN

ARRAY OF 4G-ENABLED DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, NETBOOKS, NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS AND DEVICES THAT PROVIDE A MOBILE WI-FI CONNECTION THAT WE REFER TO AS JETPACK DEVICES.

WE OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF VERIZON WIRELESS-BRANDED DATA SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS.



INTERNET ACCESS VIA OUR SMARTPHONES AND BASIC PHONES. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ACCESS THE INTERNET ON ALL OF OUR SMARTPHONES, AS WELL AS OUR BASIC PHONES

THAT INCLUDE HTML WEB-BROWSING CAPABILITY. OUR CUSTOMERS PAY FOR DATA ACCESS UNDER PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF DEVICE AND THE CUSTOMERS PREFERENCE FOR DATA USAGE. WE OFFER USAGE-BASED DATA PACKAGES AND DATA PLANS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER CONNECTION-RELATED SERVICES

WE PROVIDE DATA ACCESS AND ENHANCED VALUE ADDED SERVICES TO SUPPORT TELEMETRY-TYPE APPLICATIONS, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY

MACHINE-TO-MACHINE (M2M) WIRELESS CONNECTIONS THAT TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE A VOICE COMPONENT. OUR M2M SERVICES SUPPORT DEVICES USED BY A VARIETY OF VERTICAL MARKET SEGMENTS, SUCH AS HEALTHCARE, MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES, DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMER

PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, COMPANIES PURCHASE DATA ACCESS AND ENHANCED SERVICES FROM US IN ORDER TO CONNECT WITH AND MONITOR EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS MEDICAL DEVICES USED TO MONITOR PATIENTS, FLEET MANAGEMENT DEVICES THAT MONITOR COMPANY-OPERATED VEHICLES AND

UTILITY MONITORING DEVICES USED FOR SMART GRID APPLICATIONS. OTHER COMPANIES PURCHASE DATA ACCESS AND ENHANCED SERVICES FROM US TO SUPPORT DEVICES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN A SERVICE THEY IN TURN SELL TO END-USERS. WE PROVIDE DATA ACCESS AND ENHANCED

VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO SUPPORT TELEMATICS, WHICH GENERALLY INVOLVE THE INTEGRATION OF WIRELESS SAFETY AND SECURITY, DIAGNOSTICS, REMOTE UNLOCK/START-UP AND OTHER SERVICES IN VEHICLES. WE SUPPORT TELEMATICS SERVICES FOR SOME OF THE LARGEST

AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY THE NATIONAL PROVIDER OF WIRELESS SERVICE FOR ONSTAR, A SUBSIDIARY OF GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY.

WIRELESS DEVICES

WE OFFER SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF WIRELESS DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES AND BASIC PHONES, AS WELL AS TABLETS AND OTHER INTERNET ACCESS

DEVICES.

SMARTPHONES

. OUR DEVICE LINE-UP INCLUDES AN ARRAY OF SMARTPHONES THAT ARE ENABLED TO UTILIZE OUR 3G EV-DO

(REVISION A) OR 4G LTE HIGH-SPEED DATA SERVICES AND HAVE OPERATING PLATFORMS, SUCH AS GOOGLE ANDROID, APPLE IOS, BLACKBERRY OS, AND WINDOWS MOBILE.

BASIC PHONES

. SOME OF OUR BASIC PHONES ARE 3G EV-DO-ENABLED AND HAVE HTML-BROWSING CAPABILITY. ADDITIONALLY, WE OFFER A SELECTION OF BASIC PHONES THAT OPERATE VIA OUR CDMA-1XRTT SERVICE.

TABLETS AND OTHER INTERNET ACCESS DEVICES.

WE OFFER A VARIETY OF 4G LTE AND/OR 3G EV-DO-ENABLED TABLETS FROM MULTIPLE

MANUFACTURERS THAT RUN PRIMARILY ON EITHER THE APPLE IOS OR GOOGLE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEMS. THESE TABLETS ALSO PERMIT OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET VIA A WI-FI CONNECTION. IN ADDITION, WE OFFER DEDICATED DEVICES THAT PROVIDE A MOBILE WI-FI

4G LTE AND/OR 3G EV-DO CONNECTION, WHICH WE REFER TO AS JETPACK DEVICES, CAPABLE OF CONNECTING UP TO FIVE WI-FIENABLED DEVICES TO THE INTERNET AT ONE TIME. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO ACCESS THE INTERNET WIRELESSLY AT BROADBAND SPEEDS ON THEIR

COMPUTERS VIA DATA CARDS OR THROUGH THE USE OF CERTAIN LAPTOP COMPUTERS AND NETBOOKS WITH EMBEDDED 4G LTE AND 3G EV-DO MOBILE BROADBAND MODULES OFFERED BY ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS). DURING 2011, WE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE STRONG

SUBSCRIBER DEMAND FOR TABLETS AND JETPACK DEVICES, WHICH REPRESENTED A LARGER PROPORTION OF OUR DATA REVENUE GROWTH AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

WE PURCHASE WIRELESS DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES FROM A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS, WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR PURCHASES MADE FROM APPLE, MOTOROLA, SAMSUNG, LG ELECTRONICS, RIM, PALM AND PCD (THROUGH

WHICH WE PURCHASE PANTECH AND HTC DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES).

A KEY COMPONENT OF ALL WIRELESS DEVICES IS THE CHIPSET, WHICH

CONTAINS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE PHONE. MOST OF OUR WIRELESS DEVICE SUPPLIERS RELY ON QUALCOMM INCORPORATED (QUALCOMM) FOR MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLYING CDMA-1XRTT AND EV-DO CHIPSETS. WE ALSO SELL PHONES THAT INCLUDE CDMA-1XRTT AND EV-DO

CHIPSETS MANUFACTURED BY VIA TELECOM UNDER LICENSE FROM QUALCOMM. THE LTE CHIPSETS USED IN OUR 4G LTE-ENABLED DEVICES ARE MANUFACTURED BY VARIOUS COMPANIES, EACH USING ITS OWN 4G LTE CHIPSET TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER

COMPONENTS COMMON TO WIRELESS PHONES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELECTRONIC COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS THAT WE DO NOT DEAL WITH DIRECTLY.

STRATEGIC

INITIATIVES

WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE DEVICES, DATA SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE

TO RUN ON OUR NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



LTE INNOVATION CENTER

. WE OPERATE THE VERIZON LTE INNOVATION CENTER, WHICH WE BELIEVE SERVES AS A CATALYST FOR THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF

NON-TRADITIONAL DEVICES AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS FOR USE ON 4G LTE NETWORKS. THE CENTER WORKS WITH MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS REPRESENTING VARIOUS INDUSTRIES TO HELP THEM QUICKLY BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET.



APPLICATION INNOVATION CENTER

. THE VERIZON APPLICATION INNOVATION CENTER WAS ESTABLISHED TO ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO WORK ON APPLICATIONS

SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH NETWORK EXPERTS FROM VERIZON WIRELESS TO CREATE, OPTIMIZE AND POLISH THEIR IDEAS AND TURN THEM INTO VIABLE WIRELESS APPLICATIONS.



ISIS

. ISIS IS A JOINT VENTURE WITH AT&T AND T-MOBILE THAT IS DEVELOPING A MOBILE COMMERCE PLATFORM THAT WILL ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR

POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES VIA THEIR MOBILE PHONES USING NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY, RATHER THAN BY PAYING WITH CASH OR A CREDIT CARD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



COMCAST CORPORATION, TIME WARNER CABLE, BRIGHT HOUSE NETWORKS AND VERIZON WIRELESS HAVE FORMED A TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION JOINT VENTURE FOR THE

DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO BETTER INTEGRATE WIRELINE AND WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

NETWORK

OUR

NETWORK IS AMONG THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH LICENSED AND OPERATIONAL COVERAGE IN ALL OF THE TOP 100 MOST POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. OUR NETWORK COVERED A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 296 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011.

OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST NETWORK RELIABILITY FOR THE PROVISION OF DATA AND VOICE SERVICES. WE DESIGN AND DEPLOY OUR

DATA NETWORK IN A MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL DATA SESSIONS AND COMPLETIONS OF LARGE FILE DOWNLOADS AND UPLOADS WHILE DELIVERING ON OUR ADVERTISED THROUGHPUT SPEEDS, AND WE DESIGN AND DEPLOY OUR VOICE NETWORK IN A

MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF CALLS BY OUR CUSTOMERS THAT ARE CONNECTED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND COMPLETED WITHOUT BEING DROPPED. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT, EXPAND AND UPGRADE OUR NETWORK AND EXPLORE STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES

TO EXPAND OUR NATIONAL NETWORK COVERAGE THROUGH SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS OF WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND SPECTRUM LICENSES.

TECHNOLOGY

OUR PRIMARY NETWORK TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE 4G LTE AND 3G CDMA. 4G LTE PROVIDES HIGHER THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE AND

IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES FOR DATA SERVICES THAN 3G TECHNOLOGIES. WE LAUNCHED OUR 4G LTE NETWORK IN DECEMBER 2010, AND BY JANUARY 19, 2012 IT WAS DEPLOYED IN 195 MARKETS COVERING MORE THAN 200 MILLION PEOPLE. BY MID-2013, WE EXPECT THAT OUR 4G

LTE NETWORK WILL HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN VIRTUALLY OUR ENTIRE 3G CDMA NETWORK FOOTPRINT. WE ALSO PLAN TO EXPAND OUR 4G LTE COVERAGE BEYOND OUR EXISTING 3G CDMA FOOTPRINT THROUGH OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PROGRAM. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE ARE WORKING WITH

WIRELESS CARRIERS IN RURAL AREAS TO COLLABORATIVELY BUILD AND OPERATE A 4G LTE NETWORK USING EACH CARRIERS NETWORK ASSETS AND OUR CORE 4G LTE EQUIPMENT AND 700 MHZ SPECTRUM. WE CURRENTLY HAVE 15 COMMITTED PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE THE

POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE 4G LTE COVERAGE TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF OUR 4G LTE FOOTPRINT.

WHILE COMPETING

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO MIGRATING TO LTE TECHNOLOGY, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A TIME-TO-MARKET AND COVERAGE ADVANTAGE OVER THESE PROVIDERS.

OUR 3G CDMA NETWORK IS BASED ON SPREAD-SPECTRUM DIGITAL RADIO TECHNOLOGY. CDMA-1XRTT TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE CELL SITES IN OUR 3G CDMA NETWORK. IN ADDITION, EV-DO, A 3G PACKET-BASED

TECHNOLOGY INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR HIGH-SPEED DATA TRANSMISSION, IS DEPLOYED IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CELL SITES IN OUR 3G CDMA NETWORK.

OUR NETWORK INCLUDES VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF REDUNDANCY DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICE. POWER AND BACKHAUL TRANSPORT FACILITIES CAN OFTEN BECOME A NETWORKS VULNERABILITY.

CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE BATTERY BACKUP AT EVERY SWITCH AND VIRTUALLY EVERY CELL SITE IN OUR NETWORK. WE ALSO UTILIZE BACKUP GENERATORS AT A MAJORITY OF OUR CELL SITES AND AT EVERY SWITCH LOCATION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A FLEET OF PORTABLE BACKUP

GENERATORS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED TO CELL SITES IF NEEDED. WE FURTHER ENHANCE RELIABILITY BY USING A FULLY REDUNDANT BACKBONE MULTIPROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING NETWORK IN ALL CRITICAL LOCATIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, VERIZON WIRELESS IMPLEMENTED NETWORK OPTIMIZATION PRACTICES DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OUR

DATA CUSTOMERS ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE UNUSUALLY HIGH DATA CONSUMPTION OF A FEW DATA USERS. UNDER THESE CURRENT PRACTICES, THE TOP FIVE PERCENT OF OUR 3G SMARTPHONE DATA USERS WITH UNLIMITED DATA PLANS, AS WELL AS 3G DATA USERS

ROAMING ON OUR NETWORK, MAY EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN AVERAGE DATA SPEEDS WHEN CONNECTED TO A CONGESTED CELL SITE. IF A CELL SITE IS NOT CONGESTED, A USERS CONNECTION SPEED WILL NOT BE IMPACTED. NETWORK OPTIMIZATION HELPS TO ENSURE HIGH

QUALITY NETWORK PERFORMANCE FOR OUR ENTIRE CUSTOMER BASE.

SPECTRUM

THE SPECTRUM LICENSES WE HOLD CAN BE USED FOR MOBILE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WE HAVE LICENSES TO PROVIDE WIRELESS

SERVICES ON PORTIONS OF THE 800 MHZ BAND (ALSO KNOWN AS CELLULAR SPECTRUM) AND/OR 1800-1900 MHZ BAND (ALSO KNOWN AS PCS SPECTRUM) IN AREAS WHERE VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES RESIDES. IN PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES, WE ALSO

HAVE LICENSES FOR ADVANCED WIRELESS SERVICES (AWS) SPECTRUM IN SEGMENTS OF THE 1700 AND 2100 MHZ BANDS. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD LICENSES FOR PORTIONS OF THE 700 MHZ BAND, INCLUDING EIGHT LICENSES THAT CAN, TOGETHER, BE USED TO PROVIDE WIRELESS SERVICE

COVERAGE TO THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. WE PLAN ON USING BOTH OUR 700 MHZ AND AWS SPECTRUM TO PROVIDE ADVANCED BROADBAND SERVICES, AND IN LATE 2010 WE BEGAN USING CERTAIN OF OUR 700 MHZ LICENSES FOR THAT PURPOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LAUNCH OF OUR 4G

LTE NETWORK.

IN ADDITION TO OUR LICENSED COVERAGE, WE HAVE ROAMING AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO

ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE WIRELESS SERVICE IN VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WIRELESS SERVICE IS AVAILABLE. CERTAIN OF OUR ROAMING AGREEMENTS ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS NOTICE;

HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TERMINATION OF ANY OF THESE AT-WILL AGREEMENTS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. THIS INCREASING DEMAND IS BEING DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS AND USAGE OF WIRELESS BROADBAND SERVICES, WHICH USE MORE

BANDWIDTH AND REQUIRE EVER FASTER RATES OF SPEED TO STAY COMPETITIVE. WE CAN MEET SPECTRUM NEEDS BY ACQUIRING LICENSES OR LEASING SPECTRUM FROM OTHER LICENSEES, OR BY ACQUIRING NEW SPECTRUM LICENSES FROM THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC),

IF AND WHEN OFFERED BY THE FCC IN FUTURE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW SPECTRUM FOR

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL WIRELESS SERVICES AND THE POSSIBLE DATES OF FUTURE FCC SPECTRUM AUCTIONS ARE

UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, THE FCC AND THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN SEEKING THE RELEASE OF ADDITIONAL MOBILE USE SPECTRUM. IN ADDITION, CONGRESS HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL

PUBLIC SAFETY NETWORK AND THE REALLOCATION AND AUCTION, THROUGH THE USE OF VOLUNTARY INCENTIVE AUCTIONS, BY 2022 OF PORTIONS OF THE EXISTING BROADCAST SPECTRUM. THE TIMING AND NATURE OF THOSE AUCTIONS WILL BE DETERMINED BY FUTURE REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE AWS SPECTRUM LICENSES HELD BY SPECTRUMCO, LLC AND COX TMI WIRELESS. DURING 2011, WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF LEAP WIRELESS AND WITH SAVARY ISLAND WIRELESS, WHICH IS

MAJORITY-OWNED BY LEAP WIRELESS, FOR THE PURCHASE OF CERTAIN OF THEIR AWS AND PCS LICENSES IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH AND OUR 700 MHZ A BLOCK LICENSE IN CHICAGO. THE CONSUMMATION OF EACH OF THESE TRANSACTIONS IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING APPROVAL BY THE FCC.

AS WE AND COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SPECTRUM SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN

MARKETS AND HAVE SPECTRUM SURPLUSES IN OTHERS, WE HAVE AT TIMES ARRANGED SPECTRUM SWAPS, AND WE EXPECT TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM SPECTRUM LICENSE TRADES IN ORDER TO MEET CERTAIN OF OUR CAPACITY AND EXPANSION NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. THESE

SWAPS AS WELL AS ANY SPECTRUM PURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR THE TRANSFER OF SPECTRUM LICENSES IN EACH INSTANCE.

NETWORK EQUIPMENT AND BUILD-OUT

OUR PRIMARY CELL SITE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE VENDORS ARE ALCATEL-LUCENT, WHICH PROVIDES MORE THAN HALF OF OUR CELL SITE EQUIPMENT, AND MOTOROLA AND ERICSSON, WHICH TOGETHER PROVIDE NEARLY ALL OF OUR

REMAINING CELL SITE EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO RELY UPON ALCATEL-LUCENT, MOTOROLA AND ERICSSON FOR OUR SWITCHING EQUIPMENT. ALCATEL-LUCENT AND ERICSSON ARE CURRENTLY OUR PRIMARY NETWORK VENDORS FOR OUR LTE NETWORK DEPLOYMENTS.

AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD AND UPGRADE OUR EXISTING NETWORK, WE MUST COMPLETE A VARIETY OF STEPS, INCLUDING SECURING RIGHTS TO A LARGE

NUMBER OF CELL SITE AND SWITCH SITE LOCATIONS AND OBTAINING ZONING AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING THE NECESSARY SITE LEASES AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES AND THE ZONING APPROVALS

NEEDED TO CONSTRUCT NEW TOWERS. WE UTILIZE TOWER SITE MANAGEMENT FIRMS, SUCH AS CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION, AS LESSORS OR MANAGERS OF OUR EXISTING TOWER SITES UPON WHICH OUR OPERATIONS DEPEND.

MARKETING

WE FOCUS OUR

MARKETING STRATEGY ON OFFERING SOLUTIONS THAT ARE TARGETED TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR VARIOUS CUSTOMER MARKET GROUPS; PROMOTING OUR BRAND; LEVERAGING OUR EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; JOINTLY MARKETING WITH VODAFONE; AND JOINTLY MARKETING TO

ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS WITH VERIZONS WIRELINE BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH VERIZON ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS, A SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL OF VERIZONS SOLUTIONS FOR BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS GLOBALLY. OUR MARKETING

PLAN INCLUDES A COORDINATED PROGRAM OF TELEVISION, PRINT, RADIO, OUTDOOR SIGNAGE, INTERNET AND POINT-OF-SALE MEDIA PROMOTIONS DESIGNED TO PRESENT OUR MARKETING MESSAGE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL OF OUR MARKETS. OUR SALES STRATEGY IS TO USE A

COMBINATION OF DIRECT, INDIRECT AND ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN ORDER TO INCREASE CUSTOMER GROWTH WHILE REDUCING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS. WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS FOR DEVICE WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION.

COMPANY-OPERATED STORES ARE A CORE COMPONENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY. OUR DIRECT CHANNEL, WHICH INCLUDES OUR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION, IS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO HAVE A DEDICATED ORGANIZATION TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR LARGEST

CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND OUR FEDERAL AND OTHER LARGE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A TELEMARKETING SALES FORCE DEDICATED TO HANDLING INCOMING CALLS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND WE OFFER FULLY-AUTOMATED, END-TO-END WEB-BASED SALES OF WIRELESS

PHONES, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICE PLANS.

OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL INCLUDES AGENTS THAT SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT RETAIL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE INTERNET. THE MAJORITY OF THESE AGENTS SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND DO SO UNDER EXCLUSIVE SELLING ARRANGEMENTS WITH US. IN

ADDITION, WE UTILIZE HIGH-PROFILE, NATIONAL RETAILERS, SUCH AS BEST BUY, WAL-MART, RADIOSHACK AND TARGET, TO SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. STORES SUCH AS DOLLAR GENERAL, BIG LOTS AND VARIOUS DRUGSTORE CHAINS SELL OUR

PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN DECEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS WITH AFFILIATES OF COMCAST

CORPORATION, TIME WARNER CABLE, BRIGHT HOUSE NETWORKS AND COX COMMUNICATIONS INC. (THE CABLE COMPANIES). THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS, THE CABLE COMPANIES AND VERIZON WIRELESS BECAME AGENTS TO SELL ONE ANOTHERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND, OVER

TIME, THE CABLE COMPANIES WILL HAVE THE OPTION, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENTS TO SELL VERIZON WIRELESS SERVICE ON A WHOLESALE BASIS. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

COMPETITION

WE OPERATE

IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY. WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING AT&T, SPRINT NEXTEL CORPORATION AND T-MOBILE USA, AS WELL AS VARIOUS REGIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING US CELLULAR, METRO PCS

AND LEAP WIRELESS. WE ALSO COMPETE FOR RETAIL ACTIVATIONS WITH RESELLERS THAT BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM FACILITIES-BASED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR RESALE, INCLUDING THOSE THAT BUY FROM US. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF

CONTINUING INCREASES IN WIRELESS MARKET PENETRATION LEVELS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, NEW MARKET ENTRANTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM, BOTH LICENSED AND

UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. COMPETITION MAY ALSO INCREASE IF SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MERGE OR TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED AND MORE EXPERIENCED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES SEEKING TO INCREASE THEIR BRAND RECOGNITION AND CAPTURE CUSTOMER REVENUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, APPLE AND OTHERS, ARE OFFERING ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR MAKING WIRELESS

VOICE CALLS THAT, IN CERTAIN CASES, CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF THE WIRELESS PROVIDERS VOICE SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE

MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY.



NETWORK RELIABILITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE.

WE BELIEVE THAT A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE SERVICE

IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE U.S. MARKET AND A DRIVER OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. LOWER PRICES, IMPROVED SERVICE QUALITY AND NEW DATA SERVICE OFFERINGS HAVE LED TO INCREASED CUSTOMER USAGE OF WIRELESS SERVICES, WHICH IN TURN PUTS PRESSURE ON NETWORK

CAPACITY. IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY NEEDS AND OFFER HIGHLY RELIABLE NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR NETWORKS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR 4G LTE NETWORK WILL HELP US TO

KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR HIGHER SPEEDS.



PRICING.

SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PRICING PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE WIRELESS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. AS THE DEMAND FOR WIRELESS DATA SERVICES

CONTINUES TO GROW, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING SERVICE PLANS THAT INCLUDE BUNDLED DATA PACKAGES IN VARYING MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE SIZES OR, IN SOME CASES, UNLIMITED DATA USAGE. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO

OFFERING MINUTES-SHARING PLANS; FREE MOBILE-TO-MOBILE CALLING; OFFERINGS OF LARGER BUNDLES OF INCLUDED MINUTES AT ATTRACTIVE PRICE POINTS WITH NO ROAMING OR LONG DISTANCE CHARGES; CALLING GROUP FEATURES THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO PLACE AND RECEIVE

CALLS FROM A GROUP OF U.S. PHONE NUMBERS THEY DESIGNATE (INCLUDING LANDLINE NUMBERS) WITHOUT THE CALL TIME COUNTING AGAINST THEIR MINUTE ALLOTMENT; AND BOTH PREPAID AND POSTPAID PLANS OFFERING UNLIMITED VOICE AND DATA USAGE. WE SEEK TO COMPETE IN

THIS AREA BY OFFERING OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WILL REGARD AS THE BEST AVAILABLE VALUE FOR THE PRICE, AS WELL AS SERVICE PLANS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS FOR BOTH VOICE AND DATA SERVICES.



CUSTOMER SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH-QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY FACTOR IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING BOTH NEW-TO-WIRELESS

CUSTOMERS AND CUSTOMERS OF OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CONVENIENT AND EASY-TO-USE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS AND

MINIMIZE CHURN. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON IMPROVING IT.



PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT.

AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP AND WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS PROLIFERATE, CONTINUED CUSTOMER AND REVENUE

GROWTH WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED DATA PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND IN

COLLABORATION WITH APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH VARIOUS DEVICE MANUFACTURERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTINCTIVE SMARTPHONES AND OTHER WIRELESS DEVICES THAT CAN ACCESS THE GROWING ARRAY OF DATA APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT

AVAILABLE OVER THE INTERNET. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON INCREASING SMARTPHONE PENETRATION THROUGHOUT OUR CUSTOMER BASE. IN ADDITION TO THESE DEVICES, WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTERNATIONAL ROAMING AGREEMENTS AND OFFER SIGNIFICANT COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF

THE UNITED STATES FOR CUSTOMERS THAT REQUIRE A SOLUTION OVERSEAS.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION.

KEY TO ACHIEVING SALES SUCCESS IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF SALES CHANNELS AND DISTRIBUTION

POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ATTAINING THE OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF VARYING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING PROFITABILITY, AS MEASURED BY OPERATING INCOME. WE ENDEAVOR TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES,

OUTSIDE SALES TEAMS AND TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF RETAIL OUTLETS AND PREPAID REPLENISHMENT LOCATIONS AND NETBOOK AND NOTEBOOK OEMS. IN ADDITION,

WE SELL WIRELESS ACCESS TO BOTH TRADITIONAL RESELLERS, WHICH RESELL WIRELESS SERVICES TO THEIR END-USERS, AND TO VARIOUS COMPANIES TO ENABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FOR THEIR M2M DEVICES OR FOR THEIR PROVISION OF TELEMATICS SERVICES.



CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY AND COVERAGE OF THEIR NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AS DO SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW BUSINESS

MODELS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, REGULATORY CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PRICING STRATEGIES OF COMPETITORS.

NETWORK

IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WE OPERATE AN ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES AND

AROUND THE WORLD.

FIOS

. WE ARE WELL ON THE WAY TOWARD OUR GOAL OF BEING THE PREMIER BROADBAND AND

ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE PROVIDER IN OUR SERVICE AREAS, AND WE KNOW NETWORK RELIABILITY AND EXPANDED FUNCTIONALITY ARE KEY TO ACHIEVING THAT OBJECTIVE. WE OFFER AMERICAS FASTEST INTERNET WITH SPEEDS UP TO 150MBPS UTILIZING FIBER-TO-THE-PREMISE

(FTTP) ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES OVER FIBER OPTIC CABLES. OUR NETWORK ARCHITECTURE ALSO PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT OUR FACILITIES MORE EASILY TO FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW OPTICAL TERMINALS CAN BE ADDED TO THE FTTP NETWORK

PROVIDING GREATER BANDWIDTH AND NEW SERVICES WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FIELD CONSTRUCTION. FIELD TRIALS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED CONNECTION SPEEDS OF NEARLY 1 GIGABIT PER SECOND (GBPS) DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM, AND WHEN A MORE ADVANCED XG-PON2

A LAPTOP OR OTHER MOBILE DEVICE; REMOTELY SCHEDULING A DVR TO RECORD A FAVORITE TV SHOW; OR SHARING PHOTOS AND VIDEOS USING MEDIA MANAGER.

GLOBAL IP

. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR VIRTUAL PRIVATE LAN SERVICE TO EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC AND ADDITIONAL NORTH AMERICAN LOCATIONS. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE EXPANSION OF OUR PRIVATE IP NETWORK TO SERVE ALL

KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WITH QUALITY OF SERVICE-AWARE IP VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK MANAGED SERVICES. OUR PUBLIC IP NETWORK IS NOW INTERCONNECTED TO OUR PRIVATE IP NETWORK THROUGH SECURITY GATEWAY PLATFORMS THAT ALLOW BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO EXTEND THE

REACH OF THEIR PRIVATE VIRTUAL NETWORKS TO OFF-NET SITES, SUCH AS EMPLOYEES HOMES, SMALL BRANCH OFFICES AND MOBILE WORK FORCES. WE HAVE INSTALLED ADDITIONAL PRIVATE IP EDGE ROUTERS FOR A TOTAL OF 988 EDGE ROUTERS IN 251 SITES

THROUGHOUT 66 COUNTRIES. WE ALSO ACTIVATED MOST OF THE LINKS IN THE EUROPE INDIA GATEWAY SYSTEM IN 2011, LINKING COUNTRIES/TERRITORIES BETWEEN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND INDIA, THEREBY DELIVERING SIGNIFICANT NETWORK CAPACITY AND DIVERSITY INTO

EMERGING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

WE DEPLOYED THE INDUSTRYS FIRST COMMERCIAL 100G (GIGABITS PER SECOND)

ULTRA-LONG-HAUL OPTICAL SYSTEM FOR LIVE TRAFFIC ON OUR EUROPEAN OPTICAL CORE NETWORK IN 2010, AND FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH ANOTHER INDUSTRY FIRST IN 2011 WITH INITIAL DEPLOYMENTS OF 100G TECHNOLOGY ON OUR U.S. BACKBONE NETWORK. DURING 2012,

APPROXIMATELY 7,000 ADDITIONAL ROUTE MILES OF THE DOMESTIC ULTRA-LONG-HAUL BACKBONE NETWORK WILL BE UPGRADED TO 100G CAPABLE SYSTEMS.

FIBER-TO-THE-CELLSITE

. OUR FTTCS ETHERNET BACKHAUL INITIATIVE IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING THE SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH REQUIREMENTS OF EXPANDING 3G AND 4G LTE WIRELESS DATA NETWORKS NATIONWIDE. TO SUPPORT

THIS INITIATIVE, OVER 18,000 TOTAL CELL SITE CONNECTIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED SINCE THE START OF THIS PROGRAM.

IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE EVOLUTION OF OUR ACCESS PLANT, WE ARE ALSO TRANSITIONING OUR METRO (LOCAL) NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE FROM TRADITIONAL TDM/SONET (SYNCHRONOUS OPTICAL NETWORK)/ATM TECHNOLOGIES TO ETHERNET OVER DENSE WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (DWDM). THIS

NEW OPTICAL TRANSPORT NETWORK PROVIDES FEATURES OPTIMIZED FOR VIDEO DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND HIGH-SPEED DATA SERVICES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE LEVEL OF NETWORK RELIABILITY ACHIEVED WITH SONET.

TO LEVERAGE THIS NEW NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALLOW FOR THE MORE EFFICIENT SHARING OF OUR NETWORK ACROSS SERVICES, WE ARE UPGRADING OUR

MULTIPLEXING AND ROUTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO USE IP, ETHERNET AND MPLS TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE MIGRATING FROM TRADITIONAL TDM-BASED VOICE SWITCHING TO VOIP. THIS MIGRATION LOWERS THE COST OF CURRENT DATA AND VOICE SERVICES AND CREATES A

NETWORK THAT CAN OFFER FUTURE MULTI-MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY ADDING SERVICE PLATFORMS WITHOUT REQUIRING WIDESPREAD NETWORK UPGRADES. WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON GROWING OUR ETHERNET INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE FULL RANGE OF ETHERNET PRIVATE

LINE AND E-LAN SERVICES LOCALLY, DOMESTICALLY AND GLOBALLY. TO LOWER THE ACCESS COST AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT SERVICE FLEXIBILITY, WE ARE USING A CONVERGED PACKET ACCESS STRATEGY THAT REPLACES THE PRIVATE CIRCUIT-BASED CUSTOMER ACCESS AND AGGREGATES

TRAFFIC FROM MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS ONTO A SHARED ETHERNET AND MPLS NETWORK. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EMERGING OPTICAL TRANSPORT TECHNOLOGIES TO LOWER OVERALL COST AS WE INTEGRATE ETHERNET, SONET AND OPTICS AND ULTRA-LONG-HAUL TECHNOLOGIES.

COMPETITION

THE WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY FURTHER WITH TRADITIONAL,

NON-TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING PLAYERS SEEKING INCREASED MARKET SHARE. CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, OTHER DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, SATELLITE TELEVISION COMPANIES,

INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES AND MANAGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS.

IN THE MASS

MARKETS BUSINESS, CABLE OPERATORS ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS. CABLE OPERATORS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE AND DIGITAL CAPACITY OF THEIR NETWORKS SO THAT THEY CAN OFFER DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO MARKET COMPETITIVE BUNDLED OFFERINGS

THAT INCLUDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS, DIGITAL TELEVISION AND VOICE SERVICES. SEVERAL MAJOR CABLE OPERATORS ALSO OFFER BUNDLES WITH WIRELESS SERVICES THROUGH STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS.

IN ADDITION, WIRELESS SUBSTITUTION IS AN ONGOING COMPETITIVE TREND, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE AS WIRELESS COMPANIES POSITION THEIR

SERVICE AS A LANDLINE ALTERNATIVE. WE ALSO FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE VOIP SERVICES, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COMPANIES INCLUDING CABLE COMPANIES, AND NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROVIDERS. INTERNET PORTAL

PROVIDERS ARE ALSO ENTERING OUR COMPETITIVE SPACE.

AS A RESULT OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996, WHICH REQUIRES US TO

ALLOW POTENTIAL COMPETITORS TO PURCHASE OUR SERVICES FOR RESALE OR ACCESS COMPONENTS OF OUR NETWORK ON AN UNBUNDLED BASIS AT A PRESCRIBED COST, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN

REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS AT SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE SCOPE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD AND THE RATES WE RECEIVE ARE SUBJECT

TO ONGOING REVIEW AND REVISION BY THE FCC AND STATE REGULATORS. (SEE REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS IN THE 2011 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE BUSINESS, THE CUSTOMERS NEED TO REDUCE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY

COUPLED WITH THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY TECHNOLOGY CONVERGENCE IS DRIVING THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, CARRIERS AND HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN

IT SERVICES ARE EITHER MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR FORGING NEW ALLIANCES TO BE BETTER POSITIONED FOR A REBOUND IN TECHNOLOGY SPENDING. MOST NEW ALLIANCES AND ACQUISITIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON EMERGING FIELDS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, SOFTWARE DELIVERY,

COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER COMPUTING TASKS VIA THE NETWORK, RATHER THAN ON IN-HOUSE MACHINES. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO UTILIZED ACQUISITIONS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO ENTERPRISE OUTSOURCING MARKETS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN DOMINATED BY THE

MAJOR IT OUTSOURCERS.

GLOBAL WHOLESALE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL CARRIERS FOR LONG-HAUL, VOICE AND IP SERVICES. IN ADDITION,

MOBILE VIDEO AND DATA NEEDS ARE DRIVING A GREATER NEED FOR WIRELESS BACKHAUL. NETWORK PROVIDERS, CABLE COMPANIES AND NICHE PLAYERS ARE COMPETITORS FOR THIS NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITY.

IN ADDITION, COMPANIES WITH A GLOBAL PRESENCE INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH OUR WIRELINE BUSINESSES. A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH GLOBAL OPERATIONS SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, GLOBAL WHOLESALE MARKETS. WE COMPETE WITH THESE FULL OR NEAR-FULL SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR LARGE CONTRACTS TO

PROVIDE INTEGRATED SERVICES TO GLOBAL ENTERPRISES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION AND WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

REVENUE GROWTH.

WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND TRENDS IN THE WIRELINE INDUSTRY.



CUSTOMER SERVICE.

CUSTOMERS EXPECT INDUSTRY-LEADING SERVICE FROM THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES EVOLVE, THE ABILITY OF

A CARRIER TO EXCEL IN THIS AREA IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION. IN MASS MARKETS, WE COMPETE IN THIS AREA THROUGH OUR SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND ONLINE SUPPORT. IN GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH READY

ACCESS TO THEIR SYSTEM AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION AND WE CONDUCT PROACTIVE TESTING OF OUR NETWORK TO IDENTIFY MINOR ISSUES BEFORE THEY AFFECT CUSTOMERS. IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS, SERVICE IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED SYSTEM

AUTOMATION INITIATIVES.



NETWORK RELIABILITY AND BANDWIDTH (SPEED).

AS BOTH CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS LOOK TO LEVERAGE HIGH-SPEED CONNECTIONS FOR

ENTERTAINMENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY, WE EXPECT BROADBAND PENETRATION WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS ONLINE AND ONLINE-ENABLED ACTIVITIES INCREASE, SO WILL BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, BOTH DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM. TO

SUCCEED, WE AND OTHER NETWORK-BASED PROVIDERS MUST ENSURE THAT OUR NETWORKS CAN DELIVER AGAINST THESE INCREASING BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO MEET THIS FUTURE DEMAND. IN ADDITION, NETWORK RELIABILITY AND

SECURITY ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE BUSINESS.



PRICING.

CABLE, TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS USE PRICING TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE FROM INCUMBENTS. PRICING IS

ALSO A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR AS NON-TRADITIONAL MODES OF PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES EMERGE AND NEW ENTRANTS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, PORTAL-BASED AND VOIP CALLING IS FREE OR NEARLY FREE TO CUSTOMERS AND IS OFTEN SUPPORTED BY

ADVERTISING REVENUES.



PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

AS A RESULT OF PRICING PRESSURES, PROVIDERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE

SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS FROM ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS AND ARE SEEKING WAYS TO LEVERAGE THEIR BROADBAND AND VIDEO CONNECTIONS. CONVERGED FEATURES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED WIRELESS AND WIRELINE FUNCTIONALITY, ARE BECOMING SIMILARLY IMPORTANT, DRIVEN BY BOTH

CUSTOMER DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND

EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AND FROM EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNFAVORABLE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS A RECESSION OR ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR OTHER MAJOR MARKETS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE AFFORDABILITY OF AND DEMAND

FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMERS MAY SEEK TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BY FORGOING PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, ELECTING TO USE FEWER HIGHER MARGIN SERVICES OR OBTAINING LOWER-COST PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES OFFERED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SIMILARLY, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD MAY DELAY PURCHASING DECISIONS, DELAY FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE OFFERINGS OR REDUCE THEIR USE OF

SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF OUR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR SERVICES. IF THESE EVENTS WERE TO OCCUR, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION THAT MAY REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND LOWER OUR PROFITS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED THE

TRADITIONAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, WIRELESS, CABLE AND INTERNET COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND BROUGHT NEW COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE

PROVIDERS, APPLICATION AND DEVICE PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES HAVE ENABLED US TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN

COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NETWORK QUALITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE, THE PRICING OF OUR SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT, THE QUALITY OF OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, OUR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND

ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE REACH AND QUALITY OF OUR SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES. IT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING NEW

TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND FOR EXISTING SERVICES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES, WE COULD LOSE MARKET SHARE

AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

OUR INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING RAPID CHANGE AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR

COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN ORDER TO GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO

MEET FUTURE CHALLENGES FROM COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES IN OUR INDUSTRY REQUIRES US TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THE

VARIED AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING DEMANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS TO OUR INTRODUCTION OF

NEW SERVICES. IF OUR SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SELECTED LONG TERM EVOLUTION TECHNOLOGY (LTE) AS OUR NEXT-GENERATION WIRELESS

NETWORK ACCESS TECHNOLOGY. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEPLOY OUR 4G LTE NETWORK SUCCESSFULLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT OUR SUPPLIERS MAY BE UNABLE TO MANUFACTURE AND

DELIVER 4G LTE NETWORK EQUIPMENT ON SCHEDULE AND ACCORDING TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS. FURTHERMORE, OUR DEPLOYMENT OF 4G LTE MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE COST WE HAVE ESTIMATED. IF THESE RISKS MATERIALIZE, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE NEXT GENERATION WIRELESS SERVICES

TO OUR CUSTOMERS, TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, AND TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR CUSTOMER REVENUES COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION TO INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OFFERINGS, WE MUST PHASE OUT OUTDATED AND UNPROFITABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DO SO ON A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE

REDUCED PROFITS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DEPEND ON KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE DEPEND ON VARIOUS KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE US, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH OTHER SUPPLIERS, WITH EQUIPMENT AND

SERVICES, SUCH AS SWITCH AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT, HANDSETS AND OTHER DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT, THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR HANDSET AND OTHER DEVICE SUPPLIERS OFTEN RELY ON ONE

VENDOR FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, USED IN THEIR DEVICES. IF THESE SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS FAIL TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE ON A TIMELY BASIS OR FAIL TO MEET OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS AND WHEN REQUESTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE OUR NETWORKS. BECAUSE OF THE COSTS AND TIME LAGS THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING FROM ONE SUPPLIER TO

ANOTHER, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISRUPTED IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO, OR CHOSE TO, REPLACE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR SUPPLIERS WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, ESPECIALLY IF THE REPLACEMENT BECAME NECESSARY

ON SHORT NOTICE. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, DECREASE OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ON WHICH WE RELY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY ON WHICH WE DEPEND, INCLUDING

LITIGATION INVOLVING CLAIMS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT. SUCH CLAIMS HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY IN THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER OUR BUSINESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH LITIGATION. WE EXPECT OUR DEPENDENCE ON KEY

SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUE AS WE DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE MORE ADVANCED GENERATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY.

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH

WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE FCC AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE REGULATED BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE REGULATORY REGIMES FREQUENTLY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN OR

PROVIDE SPECIFIED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN DESIGNATED AREAS AND REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN LICENSES FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STANDARDS. WE ARE FREQUENTLY INVOLVED IN REGULATORY AND NON-REGULATORY

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS, OR THE REVIEWS BY FEDERAL OR STATE

COURTS OF REGULATORY RULINGS. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL AT OBTAINING THE LICENSES WE NEED TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR IN MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING LICENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FCC GRANTS WIRELESS LICENSES FOR TERMS GENERALLY LASTING 10 YEARS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. THE LOSS OF, OR

A MATERIAL LIMITATION ON, CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PLANS. NEW REGULATIONS COULD RESTRICT THE

WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN MANAGE OUR WIRELINE AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS, IMPAIR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, AND POTENTIALLY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE,

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS IP-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING VOIP AND SUPER HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND AND VIDEO, COULD BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING REGULATION BY THE FCC AND VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY.

AS THE HOLDER OF 700 MHZ C BLOCK

LICENSES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN OPEN ACCESS REGULATIONS THAT THE FCC HAS IMPOSED ON ALL LICENSEES OF 700 MHZ C BLOCK SPECTRUM. THESE RULES REQUIRE US TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEIR

CHOICE ON THE LTE NETWORK WE ARE DEPLOYING ON THAT SPECTRUM, INCLUDING THOSE OBTAINED FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN US OR OUR DISTRIBUTORS OR DEALERS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS ESTABLISHED BY US. IN ADDITION, ON DECEMBER 21, 2010, THE

FCC ADOPTED AN ORDER IN WHICH IT IMPOSED SO-CALLED NET NEUTRALITY RULES THAT IT DESCRIBES AS INTENDED TO PRESERVE THE OPENNESS OF THE INTERNET. THESE NEW RULES, WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN NOVEMBER 2011 AND ARE SUBJECT TO A PENDING APPEAL, WILL

LIMIT THE WAYS THAT A BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDER CAN MANAGE ITS NETWORK AND THE SERVICES IT CAN PROVIDE OVER THE NETWORK. GIVEN THAT THE SCOPE OF THE RESTRICTIONS AND MANY CRITICAL TERMS IN THE OPEN ACCESS AND NET

NEUTRALITY RULES ARE NOT FULLY DEFINED AND GIVEN THAT THE RULES CREATE PROCEDURAL MECHANISMS FOR PARTIES TO COMPLAIN OF VIOLATIONS, IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT LITIGATION TO RESOLVE AMBIGUITIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO YET FURTHER REGULATION. THE

REGULATION OF BROADBAND ACTIVITIES AND ANY RELATED COURT DECISIONS COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND LIMIT THE RETURN WE CAN EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ON PAST AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR BROADBAND NETWORKS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BREACHES OF NETWORK OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY, NATURAL DISASTERS OR TERRORIST

ATTACKS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER BREACHES OF NETWORK OR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY (IT) SECURITY, NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORIST ACTS OR ACTS OF WAR MAY CAUSE EQUIPMENT FAILURES OR DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF THESE EVENTS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. OUR INABILITY TO OPERATE OUR WIRELINE OR WIRELESS NETWORKS AS A RESULT OF SUCH EVENTS, EVEN FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND/OR

LOSS OF MARKET SHARE TO OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. IN PARTICULAR, BOTH UNSUCCESSFUL AND SUCCESSFUL CYBER ATTACKS ON COMPANIES HAVE INCREASED IN FREQUENCY, SCOPE AND POTENTIAL HARM IN RECENT YEARS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A MAJOR CYBER ATTACK

ON VERIZON COULD INCLUDE EXPENSIVE INCENTIVES OFFERED TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS TO RETAIN THEIR BUSINESS, INCREASED EXPENDITURES ON CYBER SECURITY MEASURES, LOST REVENUES FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LITIGATION AND DAMAGE TO OUR

REPUTATION. FURTHER, CERTAIN OF VERIZONS BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONING OF SECURITY SOLUTIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLOUD SERVICES TO BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR OWN NETWORKS IS

CALLED INTO QUESTION AS A RESULT OF A CYBER ATTACK. IN ADDITION, IF WE FAIL TO PREVENT THE THEFT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION SUCH AS FINANCIAL DATA, SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY

OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIAL DATA AGAINST BREACHES OF NETWORK OR IT SECURITY, IT COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CUSTOMER AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING

COSTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING.

WE REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE

FUND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS IN PART THROUGH BORROWINGS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CREDIT MARKETS. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON OUR PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CUSTOMARY

CREDIT METRICS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. A SEVERE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND SUCH INSTABILITY COULD AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING.

INCREASES IN COSTS FOR PENSION

BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 193,900 EMPLOYEES AND APPROXIMATELY 209,400 RETIREES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 PARTICIPATING IN VERIZONS

BENEFIT PLANS, THE COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR COSTS OF MAINTAINING THESE PLANS, AND THE FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE PLANS, ARE AFFECTED BY

SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS, DECREASES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS ON FUNDS HELD BY OUR PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLAN

TRUSTS AND CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUR BENEFIT PLANS, THOSE COSTS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING

COMMITMENTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS AND WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS OR

EXPERIENCE WORK STOPPAGES AS A RESULT OF THE RENEGOTIATION OF OUR LABOR CONTRACTS OR ADDITIONAL ORGANIZING ACTIVITY.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS. LABOR CONTRACTS COVERING MANY OF OUR UNION EMPLOYEES EXPIRED ON AUGUST 6, 2011, AT WHICH TIME VERIZON EXPERIENCED A 14-DAY WORK STOPPAGE. THE COMPANY

AND THE UNIONS THEN ENTERED INTO A RETURN TO WORK AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH THE EMPLOYEES RETURNED TO WORK UNDER THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PREVIOUS CONTRACTS INDEFINITELY; HOWEVER, EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE UNIONS MAY TERMINATE THE CONTRACT

EXTENSIONS AFTER PROVIDING SEVEN (7) DAYS NOTICE. WE CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR UNIONS REGARDING NEW CONTRACTS. DEPENDING ON THE COURSE OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS, WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND/OR EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL

WORK STOPPAGES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH A LOSS OF REVENUE AND STRAINED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE WORKFORCE OF OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY NON-UNION, WE CANNOT

PREDICT WHAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS UNIONS MAY HAVE IN ORGANIZING THIS WORKFORCE OR THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON OUR COSTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES OR SETTLEMENTS.

OUR BUSINESS FACES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FROM TIME TO TIME, PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS, ANTITRUST CLASS

ACTIONS, WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTIONS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO OUR ADVERTISING, SALES, BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS ALSO FACES PERSONAL INJURY AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATING

TO ALLEGED HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIRELESS PHONES OR RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSMITTERS, AND CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT CHALLENGE MARKETING PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURES RELATING TO ALLEGED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF HANDHELD WIRELESS PHONES. WE MAY INCUR

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OR SETTLEMENTS.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VERIZON AND A NUMBER OF OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES, HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MULTIPLE CLASS ACTION

SUITS CONCERNING THEIR ALLEGED PARTICIPATION IN INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING ACTIVITIES ALLEGEDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENTS POST-SEPTEMBER 11

PROGRAM TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. PLAINTIFFS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT VERIZON HAS PARTICIPATED BY PERMITTING THE GOVERNMENT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE CONTENT OF ITS SUBSCRIBERS TELEPHONE CALLS AND/OR RECORDS CONCERNING THOSE CALLS AND THAT SUCH

ACTION VIOLATES FEDERAL AND/OR STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LAW. RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE CASES INCLUDES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS FEES, AND STATUTORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON AUGUST 9, 2006, THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION (PANEL) ORDERED THAT THESE ACTIONS BE TRANSFERRED, CONSOLIDATED AND COORDINATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THE PANEL SUBSEQUENTLY ORDERED THAT A NUMBER OF TAG ALONG ACTIONS ALSO BE

TRANSFERRED TO THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. VERIZON BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT. ON JULY 10, 2008, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008, WHICH PROVIDES FOR DISMISSAL OF THESE SUITS BY THE

COURT BASED ON SUBMISSION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF A SPECIFIED CERTIFICATION. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE SUCH A SUBMISSION IN THE CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDINGS. BASED ON THIS SUBMISSION, THE COURT ORDERED

DISMISSAL OF THE COMPLAINTS ON JUNE 3, 2009. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THIS DISMISSAL, AND BY DECISION ISSUED DECEMBER 29, 2011, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL. PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT PETITIONED THE

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW THE DECISION, BUT THEIR TIME TO DO SO HAS NOT YET EXPIRED.

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2010,

THE U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (U.S. BANK), AS LITIGATION TRUSTEE FOR THE IDEARC INC. LITIGATION TRUST (LITIGATION TRUST), FILED SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AGAINST VERIZON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES CHALLENGING

THE NOVEMBER 2006 SPIN-OFF OF VERIZONS FORMER DIRECTORIES BUSINESS THEN KNOWN AS IDEARC INC. U.S. BANK, WHICH REPRESENTS A GROUP OF CREDITORS WHO FILED CLAIMS IN THE IDEARC INC. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, ALLEGES THAT IDEARC INC. WAS INSOLVENT AT

THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF OR BECAME INSOLVENT SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE LITIGATION TRUST SEEKS OVER $9 BILLION IN DAMAGES. DISCOVERY IN THE CASE IS UNDERWAY, WITH A TRIAL SET FOR OCTOBER 2012.

ON OCTOBER 25, 2011, A LITIGATION TRUST CREATED DURING THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS OF FAIRPOINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FILED A

COMPLAINT IN STATE COURT IN MECKLENBURG COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA, AGAINST VERIZON AND OTHER RELATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING VERIZON WIRELESS. THE COMPLAINT CLAIMS THAT FAIRPOINTS ACQUISITION OF VERIZONS LANDLINE OPERATIONS IN MAINE, NEW

HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT IN MARCH 2008 WAS STRUCTURED AND CARRIED OUT IN A WAY THAT LEFT FAIRPOINT INSOLVENT OR LEAD TO ITS INSOLVENCY SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND ULTIMATELY TO ITS OCTOBER 2009 BANKRUPTCY. THE LITIGATION TRUST SEEKS APPROXIMATELY $2

BILLION IN DAMAGES. VERIZON REMOVED THE CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA IN NOVEMBER 2011. A TRIAL DATE HAS NOT YET BEEN SET AND NEITHER MOTION PRACTICE NOR DISCOVERY HAS BEGUN.

AND RELATED ACTIVITIES IN 14 STATES.

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2011, THE BOARD APPROVED A SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WHICH AUTHORIZED

THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO 100 MILLION SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK TERMINATING NO LATER THAN THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 28, 2014. THE BOARD ALSO DETERMINED THAT NO ADDITIONAL SHARES WERE TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY

AUTHORIZED BUYBACK PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM PERMITS VERIZON TO REPURCHASE SHARES OVER TIME, WITH THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASES DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CORPORATE NEEDS. THE BOARD MAY ALSO ENTER INTO RULE 10B5-1 PLANS FROM TIME TO TIME

TO FACILITATE REPURCHASES OF ITS SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN PERMITS THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE SHARES AT TIMES WHEN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PREVENTED FROM DOING SO, PROVIDED THE PLAN IS ADOPTED WHEN THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF

MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, VERIZON DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON

STOCK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT COULD BE PURCHASED BY OR ON BEHALF OF VERIZON UNDER OUR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WAS 100 MILLION.
