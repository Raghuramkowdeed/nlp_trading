OF OPERATIONS ON PAGES 15 THROUGH 20 AND IN NOTE 20 ON PAGES 63 THROUGH 64 OF

THE 2002 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

DOMESTIC TELECOM

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTING OUR WIRELINE TELEPHONE

OPERATIONS, PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 60% OF 2002 TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES. OUR

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS PRESENTLY SERVE A TERRITORY CONSISTING OF 135.8 MILLION

ACCESS LINE EQUIVALENTS IN 29 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THIS

SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDES LONG DISTANCE AND OTHER TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES.

DOMESTIC TELECOM PROVIDES MAINLY TWO TYPES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.



EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE

IS THE TRANSMISSION OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMONG CUSTOMERS LOCATED WITHIN A LOCAL CALLING AREA

WITHIN A LOCAL ACCESS AND TRANSPORT AREA (LATA). EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INCLUDE SWITCHED LOCAL RESIDENTIAL AND

BUSINESS SERVICES, LOCAL PRIVATE LINE VOICE AND DATA SERVICES AND

CENTREX SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE TOLL SERVICES WITHIN A LATA

(INTRALATA LONG DISTANCE) AND TOLL SERVICES OUTSIDE A LATA (INTERLATA

LONG DISTANCE).



EXCHANGE ACCESS SERVICE

LINKS A CUSTOMERS PREMISES AND THE

TRANSMISSION FACILITIES OF OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS,

GENERALLY INTERLATA CARRIERS. EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE ACCESS SERVICES

INCLUDE SWITCHED ACCESS AND SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES.

WE HAVE ORGANIZED OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT INTO FIVE MARKETING UNITS

OPERATING ACROSS OUR TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES. THE UNITS FOCUS ON SPECIFIC

MARKETS. WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER. OUR TELEPHONE

OPERATIONS REMAIN RESPONSIBLE WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE AREAS FOR THE

PROVISION OF TELEPHONE SERVICES, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND REGULATORY MATTERS.

THE

ENTERPRISE

UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND

SERVICES TO LARGE BUSINESSES AND TO DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES AND OFFICES OF THE

EXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS. THESE SERVICES INCLUDE VOICE SWITCHING/PROCESSING SERVICES (E.G.,

DEDICATED PRIVATE LINES, CUSTOM CENTREX, CALL MANAGEMENT AND VOICE MESSAGING),

END-USER NETWORKING (E.G., CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AND PERSONAL

COMPUTER-BASED CONFERENCING, INCLUDING DATA AND VIDEO), INTERNETWORKING

(ESTABLISHING LINKS BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPARATE NETWORKS OF TWO OR

MORE COMPANIES OR WITHIN THE SAME COMPANY), NETWORK OPTIMIZATION (DISASTER

AVOIDANCE, 911 SERVICE AND INTELLIGENT VEHICLE HIGHWAY SYSTEMS) AND OTHER

COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SUCH AS DISTANCE LEARNING, TELEMEDICINE,

VIDEOCONFERENCING AND INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS. THE ENTERPRISE UNIT

ALSO INCLUDES OUR NETWORK INTEGRATION GROUP WHICH PROVIDES

1

DATA TRANSMISSION,

INTERNET AND NETWORK INTEGRATION SERVICES (INTEGRATING MULTIPLE GEOGRAPHICALLY

DISPARATE NETWORKS INTO ONE SYSTEM) AND OUR SELECT SERVICES UNIT WHICH OPERATES

AS A PROVIDER OF INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES, NETWORK MONITORING SERVICES

AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SALES TO MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES.

REVENUES IN 2002 WERE APPROXIMATELY $6.8 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY

17% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

THE

RETAIL

UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL

CUSTOMERS AND TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES WITHIN OUR TERRITORY,

INCLUDING OUR LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES. SOME OF OUR

LONG DISTANCE SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE AS A RESELLER OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND PROVIDE SERVICE IN ALL 50 STATES TO RESIDENTIAL AND

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING LONG DISTANCE SERVICES, CALLING CARDS, 800/888

SERVICES AND OPERATOR SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS. UNDER THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

ACT OF 1996 (1996 ACT), OUR ABILITY TO OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE SERVICES

IN THE STATES WHERE THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE AS

LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SATISFYING PRESCRIBED

REQUIREMENTS. SEE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 BELOW. THIS UNIT ALSO

PROVIDES OPERATOR AND PAY TELEPHONE SERVICES. THE RETAIL UNIT INCLUDES VERIZON

AVENUE, A SUBSIDIARY THAT MARKETS TO CUSTOMERS LOCATED IN MULTI-TENANT

BUILDINGS AND TELEPRODUCTS, A SUBSIDIARY THAT MARKETS CUSTOMER PREMISES

EQUIPMENT TO THE END-USER. REVENUES IN 2002 WERE APPROXIMATELY $23.9 BILLION,

REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 59% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES. THESE

REVENUES WERE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE PROVISION OF TELEPHONE SERVICES TO

RESIDENTIAL USERS.

THE

WHOLESALE

UNIT MARKETS OUR NETWORK OPERATIONS, WHICH PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES

OUR CARRIER ACCESS AND TELECOM INDUSTRY SERVICES. REVENUES IN 2002 WERE

APPROXIMATELY $8.9 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 22% OF DOMESTIC

TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES. APPROXIMATELY 34% OF TOTAL WHOLESALE REVENUES

WERE DERIVED FROM INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS (CALCULATED USING WHOLESALES SWITCHED

ACCESS REVENUE OVER TOTAL WHOLESALE REVENUE). MOST OF THE REMAINING REVENUES

CAME FROM BUSINESS CUSTOMERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH THEIR OWN SPECIAL

ACCESS NETWORK CONNECTIONS, WIRELESS COMPANIES AND OTHER LOCAL EXCHANGE

CARRIERS WHICH RESELL NETWORK CONNECTIONS TO THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS.

THE

NETWORK

UNIT PRINCIPALLY MANAGES OUR SWITCHED AND SPECIAL ACCESS TO THE

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS LOCAL EXCHANGE NETWORKS. REVENUES IN 2002 WERE

APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 1% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS

AGGREGATE REVENUES.

THE

NATIONAL OPERATIONS

UNIT MARKETS OUR CONNECTED SOLUTIONS SERVICES THAT

SUPPLY INSTALLATION AND REPAIR LABOR AND MANAGES OUR SUPPLY UNIT THAT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY AND SUPPLIES FOR

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. OUR SUPPLY UNIT ALSO

SELLS MATERIAL AND LOGISTIC SERVICES TO THIRD PARTIES. REVENUES IN 2002 (AFTER

ELIMINATIONS AND COMBINED WITH ALL OTHER DOMESTIC TELECOM REVENUES) WERE

APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 1% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS

AGGREGATE REVENUES.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996

WE FACE INCREASING COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. THE 1996 ACT,

REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL ACTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE

TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO FEWER

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT DEFINITIVELY THE IMPACT THAT

THE ONGOING CHANGES IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE ON

OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FINANCIAL

IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS

OF COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS, THE TIMING AND OUTCOME OF VARIOUS REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS AND ANY APPEALS, AND THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS OF OUR PURSUIT

OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES RESULTING FROM THE 1996 ACT AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.

IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE

WE OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICE THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE COUNTRY, EXCEPT IN

MARYLAND, WEST VIRGINIA AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET

RECEIVED AUTHORITY TO OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICE UNDER THE 1996 ACT, AND IN

ALASKA. UNDER THE 1996 ACT, OUR ABILITY TO OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE

SERVICES IN THE REGIONS WHERE THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES

OPERATE AS LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SATISFYING SPECIFIED

REQUIREMENTS. THE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE A 14-POINT COMPETITIVE CHECKLIST OF

STEPS WHICH WE MUST TAKE TO HELP COMPETITORS OFFER LOCAL SERVICES THROUGH

RESALE, THROUGH PURCHASE OF UNBUNDLED NETWORK ELEMENTS (UNES), OR BY

INTERCONNECTING THEIR OWN NETWORKS TO OURS. WE MUST ALSO DEMONSTRATE TO THE

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) THAT OUR ENTRY INTO THE IN-REGION LONG

DISTANCE MARKET WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

WE NOW HAVE AUTHORITY TO OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE SERVICE IN 11 STATES IN

THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TERRITORY, ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE

LINES SERVED BY THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC. THESE STATES ARE NEW YORK,

MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT, PENNSYLVANIA, RHODE ISLAND, VERMONT, MAINE, NEW

JERSEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE, DELAWARE AND VIRGINIA. THE PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY

ORDERS ARE CURRENTLY ON APPEAL TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS. THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS HAS REMANDED THE MASSACHUSETTS ORDER TO THE FCC FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION

ON ONE ISSUE, BUT LEFT OUR LONG DISTANCE AUTHORITY IN EFFECT. IN DECEMBER

2002, WE FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE FCC FOR PERMISSION TO ENTER THE

IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE MARKET IN MARYLAND, WEST VIRGINIA AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA. THE FCC MUST ACT ON THIS APPLICATION BY MARCH 19, 2003.

FCC REGULATION AND INTERSTATE RATES

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FCC WITH

RESPECT TO INTERSTATE SERVICES AND RELATED MATTERS. IN 2002, THE FCC CONTINUED

TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS TO THE INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGE SYSTEM AND TO IMPLEMENT

THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1996 ACT.

2

ACCESS CHARGES AND UNIVERSAL SERVICE

ON MAY 31, 2000, THE FCC ADOPTED THE COALITION FOR AFFORDABLE LOCAL AND LONG

DISTANCE SERVICES (CALLS) PLAN AS A COMPREHENSIVE FIVE-YEAR PLAN FOR REGULATION

OF INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGES. THE CALLS PLAN HAS THREE MAIN COMPONENTS.

FIRST, IT ESTABLISHES A PORTABLE INTERSTATE ACCESS UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT OF

$650 MILLION FOR THE INDUSTRY. THIS EXPLICIT SUPPORT REPLACES IMPLICIT SUPPORT

EMBEDDED IN INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGES. SECOND, THE PLAN SIMPLIFIES THE

PATCHWORK OF COMMON LINE CHARGES INTO ONE SUBSCRIBER LINE CHARGE (SLC) AND

PROVIDES FOR DE-AVERAGING OF THE SLC BY ZONES AND CLASS OF CUSTOMERS IN A

MANNER THAT WILL NOT UNDERMINE COMPARABLE AND AFFORDABLE UNIVERSAL SERVICE.

THIRD, THE PLAN SETS INTO PLACE A MECHANISM TO TRANSITION TO A SET TARGET OF

$0.0055 PER MINUTE FOR SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES. ONCE THAT TARGET RATE IS

REACHED, LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO MAKE FURTHER ANNUAL

PRICE CAP REDUCTIONS TO THEIR SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES. THE ANNUAL REDUCTIONS

LEADING TO THE TARGET RATE, AS WELL AS ANNUAL REDUCTIONS FOR THE SUBSET OF

SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO PRICE CAP REGULATION WAS SET AT

6.5% PER YEAR.

ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT RULED ON

AN APPEAL OF THE FCC ORDER ADOPTING THE PLAN. THE COURT UPHELD THE FCC ON

SEVERAL CHALLENGES TO THE ORDER, BUT REMANDED TWO ASPECTS OF THE DECISION BACK

TO THE FCC ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY LACKED SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION. THE COURT

REMANDED BACK TO THE FCC FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION ITS DECISION SETTING THE

ANNUAL REDUCTION FACTOR AT 6.5% MINUS AN INFLATION FACTOR AND THE SIZE OF THE

NEW UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND AT $650 MILLION. THE ENTIRE PLAN (INCLUDING THESE

ELEMENTS) WILL CONTINUE IN EFFECT PENDING THE FCCS FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF

ITS JUSTIFICATION OF THESE COMPONENTS.

AS A RESULT OF TARIFF ADJUSTMENTS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2002,

APPROXIMATELY 98% OF OUR ACCESS LINES REACHED THE $0.0055 BENCHMARK.

THE FCC HAS ADOPTED RULES FOR SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES THAT PROVIDE FOR PRICING

FLEXIBILITY AND ULTIMATELY THE REMOVAL OF SERVICES FROM PRICE REGULATION WHEN

PRESCRIBED COMPETITIVE THRESHOLDS ARE MET. IN ORDER TO USE THESE RULES,

CARRIERS MUST FOREGO THE ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PROVISIONS IN THE CURRENT

RULES THAT PROVIDE RELIEF IN THE EVENT EARNINGS FALL BELOW PRESCRIBED

THRESHOLDS. WE HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO REMOVE SPECIAL ACCESS AND DEDICATED

TRANSPORT SERVICES FROM PRICE CAPS IN 36 METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSAS)

IN THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TERRITORY AND IN 17 ADDITIONAL MSAS IN THE FORMER

GTE TERRITORY. IN ADDITION, THE FCC HAS FOUND THAT IN 20 MSAS WE HAVE MET THE

STRICTER STANDARDS TO REMOVE SPECIAL ACCESS CONNECTIONS TO END-USER CUSTOMERS

FROM PRICE CAPS. APPROXIMATELY 55% OF SPECIAL ACCESS REVENUES ARE NOW REMOVED

FROM PRICE REGULATION. WE ALSO HAVE AN APPLICATION PENDING THAT, IF GRANTED,

WOULD REMOVE AN ADDITIONAL THREE MSAS, AND SPECIAL ACCESS CONNECTIONS TO

END-USER CUSTOMERS IN TWO ADDITIONAL MSAS, FROM PRICE CAP REGULATION.

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC ADOPTED A NEW MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING UNIVERSAL

SERVICE SUPPORT TO HIGH COST AREAS SERVED BY LARGE LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES.

THIS FUNDING MECHANISM PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICES

IN SEVERAL STATES SERVED BY OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS. THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN

SUPPLEMENTED BY THE NEW FCC ACCESS CHARGE PLAN DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON JULY 31,

2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT REVERSED AND REMANDED TO

THE FCC FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT THE FCC HAD FAILED

TO ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN SOME ASPECTS OF ITS DECISION AND HAD FAILED TO ADDRESS

ANY NEED FOR A STATE UNIVERSAL SERVICE MECHANISM. THE CURRENT UNIVERSAL

SERVICE MECHANISM REMAINS IN PLACE PENDING THE OUTCOME OF ANY FCC REVIEW AS A

RESULT OF THESE APPEALS.

UNBUNDLING OF NETWORK ELEMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION SETTING FORTH NEW UNBUNDLING

REQUIREMENTS, ELIMINATING ELEMENTS THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED TO BE

UNBUNDLED, LIMITING THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE OTHERS AND ADDING NEW ELEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE UNBUNDLING REQUIREMENTS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC

RELEASED AN ORDER IN A SEPARATE PROCEEDING IN DECEMBER 1999, REQUIRING

INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE COMPANIES ALSO TO UNBUNDLE AND PROVIDE TO COMPETITORS

THE HIGHER FREQUENCY PORTION OF THEIR LOCAL LOOP. THIS PROVIDES COMPETITORS

WITH THE ABILITY TO PROVISION DATA SERVICES ON TOP OF INCUMBENT CARRIERS VOICE

SERVICES.

IN JULY 2000, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT FOUND THAT SOME

ASPECTS OF THE FCCS REQUIREMENTS FOR PRICING UNES WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE

1996 ACT. IN PARTICULAR, IT FOUND THAT THE FCC WAS WRONG TO REQUIRE INCUMBENT

CARRIERS TO BASE THESE PRICES NOT ON THEIR REAL COSTS BUT ON THE IMAGINARY

COSTS OF THE MOST EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT AND THE MOST EFFICIENT NETWORK

CONFIGURATION. THIS PORTION OF THE COURTS DECISION WAS STAYED PENDING REVIEW

BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. ON MAY 13, 2002, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT REVERSED

THAT DECISION AND UPHELD THE FCCS PRICING RULES.

ON MAY 24, 2002, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT RELEASED AN

ORDER THAT OVERTURNED THE MOST RECENT FCC DECISION ESTABLISHING WHICH NETWORK

ELEMENTS WERE REQUIRED TO BE UNBUNDLED. IN PARTICULAR, THE COURT FOUND THAT

THE FCC DID NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS OF THE NECESSARY AND

IMPAIR STANDARDS OF THE 1996 ACT WHEN IT CHOSE NATIONAL RULES FOR UNBUNDLING

AND THAT IT FAILED TO CONSIDER THE RELEVANCE OF COMPETITION FROM OTHER TYPES OF

SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CABLE AND SATELLITE. THE COURT ALSO VACATED A

SEPARATE ORDER THAT HAD AUTHORIZED AN UNBUNDLING REQUIREMENT FOR LINE SHARING

WHERE A COMPETING CARRIER PURCHASES ONLY A PORTION OF THE COPPER CONNECTION TO

THE END-USER IN ORDER TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICES USING DSL

TECHNOLOGY. SEVERAL PARTIES, INCLUDING THE FCC, PETITIONED THE COURT FOR

REHEARING OF THE COURT ORDER. THE COURT REJECTED THE PETITIONS THAT ASKED IT

TO CHANGE ITS DECISION ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2002. THE COURT DID, HOWEVER, STAY ITS

ORDER VACATING THE FCCS RULES UNTIL FEBRUARY 20, 2003, TO PROVIDE THE FCC TIME

TO COMPLETE AN ONGOING RULEMAKING TO DETERMINE WHAT ELEMENTS SHOULD BE

UNBUNDLED. SEVERAL CARRIERS HAVE SOUGHT U.S. SUPREME COURT REVIEW OF THE

UNDERLYING COURT DECISION. THAT REQUEST REMAINS PENDING.

3

ON OCTOBER 25, 2002, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT RELEASED AN

ORDER UPHOLDING THE FCCS DECISIONS THAT ESTABLISHED INTERIM LIMITS ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF COMBINATIONS OF UNES KNOWN AS ENHANCED EXTENDED LINKS OR

EELS. EELS CONSIST OF UNBUNDLED LOOPS AND TRANSPORT ELEMENTS. THE FCC

DECISIONS LIMITED ACCESS TO EELS TO CARRIERS THAT WOULD USE THEM TO PROVIDE A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LOCAL TRAFFIC, AND NOT JUST USE THEM AS SUBSTITUTES FOR

SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES.

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THESE ORDERS FROM THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

D.C. CIRCUIT, THE FCC HAD ALREADY BEGUN A REVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF ITS UNBUNDLING

REQUIREMENT THROUGH A RULEMAKING REFERRED TO AS THE TRIENNIAL REVIEW OF UNES.

THIS RULEMAKING REOPENS THE QUESTION OF WHAT NETWORK ELEMENTS MUST BE MADE

AVAILABLE ON AN UNBUNDLED BASIS UNDER THE 1996 ACT AND WILL REVISIT THE

UNBUNDLING DECISIONS MADE IN THE ORDER OVERTURNED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT. IN THIS RULEMAKING, THE FCC ALSO WILL ADDRESS OTHER

PENDING ISSUES RELATING TO UNBUNDLED ELEMENTS, INCLUDING THE QUESTION OF

WHETHER COMPETING CARRIERS MAY SUBSTITUTE COMBINATIONS OF UNBUNDLED LOOPS AND

TRANSPORT FOR ALREADY COMPETITIVE SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES. ON FEBRUARY 20,

2003, THE FCC ANNOUNCED A DECISION IN ITS TRIENNIAL REVIEW, BUT THE ORDER HAS

NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.

COMPENSATION FOR INTERNET TRAFFIC

ON APRIL 27, 2001, THE FCC RELEASED AN ORDER ADDRESSING INTERCARRIER

COMPENSATION FOR DIAL-UP CONNECTIONS FOR INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC. THE FCC FOUND

THAT INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC IS INTERSTATE AND SUBJECT TO THE FCCS

JURISDICTION. MOREOVER, THE FCC AGAIN FOUND THAT INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC IS NOT

SUBJECT TO RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 251(B)(5) OF THE 1996 ACT.

INSTEAD, THE FCC ESTABLISHED FEDERAL RATES PER MINUTE FOR THIS TRAFFIC THAT

DECLINE FROM $0.0015 TO $0.0007 OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THE FCC ORDER ALSO

SETS CAPS ON THE TOTAL MINUTES OF THIS TRAFFIC THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANY

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION AND REQUIRES THAT INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS

MUST OFFER TO BOTH BILL AND PAY RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL TRAFFIC AT

THE SAME RATE AS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC. ON MAY 3,

2002, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT REJECTED PART OF THE FCCS

RATIONALE FOR ITS APRIL 27, 2001 ORDER, BUT DECLINED TO VACATE THE ORDER WHILE

IT IS ON REMAND.

SEVERAL PARTIES REQUESTED REHEARING, ASKING THE COURT TO VACATE THE UNDERLYING

ORDER. THOSE REQUESTS WERE DENIED IN A SERIES OF ORDERS RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER

24, 2002 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2002. ONE CARRIER HAS SOUGHT U.S. SUPREME COURT

REVIEW OF THAT DENIAL. IN THE MEANTIME, PENDING FURTHER ACTION BY THE FCC, THE

FCCS UNDERLYING ORDER REMAINS IN EFFECT.

STATE REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES

STATE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS REGULATE OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT

TO INTRASTATE RATES AND SERVICES AND OTHER MATTERS. IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THE

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE RATE OF RETURN REGULATION WITH

PRICE REGULATION PLANS.

VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC.

ARIZONA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN ARIZONA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

CALIFORNIA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE OPERATED UNDER THE NEW

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (NRF) SINCE 1990. THE NRF ALLOWS FOR A GRADUAL TRANSITION

TO LESS REGULATION ON A SERVICE-BY-SERVICE BASIS. THE NRF IS REVIEWED EVERY

THREE YEARS AND CURRENTLY HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES.



EARNINGS CEILING: THE CEILING IS SUSPENDED.



PRICE CAP INDEX: BY SETTING INFLATION EQUAL TO PRODUCTIVITY, THE

CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (CPUC) HAS SUSPENDED THE PRICE

CAP INDEX. LIMITED EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE ALLOWED. GENERALLY,

EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE CHANGES UNIQUE TO OR SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO A

COMPANY THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL (IN THIS CASE, CHANGES ARE

PERMITTED ONLY FOR MATTERS MANDATED BY THE CPUC OR CHANGES IN TOTAL

INTRASTATE COST RECOVERY RESULTING FROM CHANGES BETWEEN FEDERAL AND

STATE JURISDICTIONS).



PRICE FLEXIBILITY: SERVICES FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES.

CATEGORY I SERVICES CANNOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT CPUC APPROVAL.

CATEGORY II SERVICES ARE PARTIALLY COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE ADJUSTED WITHIN

A CEILING/FLOOR RANGE. THE CURRENT PRICE (EFFECTIVELY THE CEILING) CANNOT

BE INCREASED WITHOUT A FORMAL APPLICATION.

CATEGORY III SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED ON SHORT NOTICE.



NEW SERVICES: NEW SERVICES CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS CATEGORY II OR III. IF INTRODUCED AS CATEGORY III, VERIZON CALIFORNIA

MUST DEMONSTRATE INSIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER.

THE CPUC WILL REVIEW NRF FEATURES

DURING 2003  2004.

NEVADA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN NEVADA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

4

VERIZON DELAWARE INC.

SINCE 1994, VERIZON DELAWARE HAS BEEN REGULATED UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE

REGULATION PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT

ACT OF 1993 (DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT). THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

ACT PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING.



THE PRICES OF BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICES (E.G., DIAL TONE AND LOCAL USAGE) WILL REMAIN REGULATED AND CANNOT CHANGE IN ANY ONE YEAR

BY MORE THAN THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT  PRICE INDEX (GDP-PI) LESS 3%.



THE PRICES OF DISCRETIONARY SERVICES

(E.G., IDENTA RING

(SM)

AND CALL WAITING) CANNOT INCREASE MORE THAN 15% PER YEAR PER SERVICE.



THE PRICES OF COMPETITIVE SERVICES (E.G., VOICE MESSAGING AND MESSAGE TOLL SERVICE) ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TARIFF OR REGULATION.



VERIZON DELAWARE WILL DEVELOP A TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT PLAN WITH A COMMITMENT TO INVEST A MINIMUM OF $250 MILLION IN DELAWARES

TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE PLAN.

IN APRIL 2001, THE DELAWARE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVED VERIZON

DELAWARES REQUEST FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN

UNTIL ONE YEAR AFTER VERIZON DELAWARE OBTAINS AUTHORITY TO ENTER THE LONG

DISTANCE MARKET, OR MARCH 2004, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST. IN EXCHANGE FOR THE

EXTENSION, VERIZON DELAWARE AGREED TO CAP BASIC RATES UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2002.

ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2002, THE FCC GRANTED VERIZON DELAWARES APPLICATION TO ENTER

THE LONG DISTANCE MARKET. IN 2002, VERIZON DELAWARE ADVISED THE DELAWARE

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION THAT IT ELECTS TO REMAIN REGULATED UNDER THE DELAWARE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT, WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS. NO ACTION ON THIS REQUEST

HAS YET BEEN SCHEDULED.

VERIZON FLORIDA INC.

FLORIDA STATUTES GOVERN THE PRICE CAP PLAN. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2001, VERIZON

FLORIDA WAS ABLE TO RAISE BASIC LOCAL RATES ON 30 DAYS NOTICE ONCE IN ANY

12-MONTH PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED THE GDP-PI LESS 1%. VERIZON FLORIDA MAY INCREASE

RATES FOR NON-BASIC SERVICES BUT INCREASES FOR ANY CATEGORY CANNOT EXCEED 6% IN

ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD UNLESS ANOTHER COMPANY IS PROVIDING SERVICE IN A GIVEN

EXCHANGE, AT WHICH TIME VERIZON FLORIDA CAN INCREASE ITS PRICE UP TO 20% IN A

12-MONTH PERIOD. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED.

VERIZON HAWAII INC.

VERIZON HAWAIIS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

VERIZON MARYLAND INC.

IN 1996, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND APPROVED A PRICE CAP PLAN

FOR REGULATING THE INTRASTATE SERVICES PROVIDED BY VERIZON MARYLAND. UNDER THE

PLAN, SERVICES ARE DIVIDED INTO SIX CATEGORIES: ACCESS; BASIC-RESIDENTIAL;

BASIC-BUSINESS; DISCRETIONARY; COMPETITIVE; AND MISCELLANEOUS. RATES FOR

ACCESS, BASIC-RESIDENTIAL, BASIC-BUSINESS AND DISCRETIONARY SERVICES CAN BE

INCREASED OR DECREASED ANNUALLY UNDER A FORMULA THAT IS BASED UPON CHANGES IN

THE GDP-PI MINUS A PRODUCTIVITY OFFSET BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE RATE OF

INFLATION AS REFLECTED IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI). RATES FOR

COMPETITIVE SERVICES MAY BE INCREASED WITHOUT REGULATORY LIMITS. REGULATION OF

PROFITS IS ELIMINATED. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND IS CURRENTLY

REVIEWING THE INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN. VERIZON MARYLAND HAS SOUGHT TO

ELIMINATE THE PRICE CAP FORMULA AND TO MOVE ALL BUSINESS SERVICES INTO THE

COMPETITIVE CATEGORY.

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND INC.

MAINE

IN JUNE 2001, THE MAINE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (PUC) ORDERED THE

CONTINUATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF REGULATION (AFOR) FOR VERIZON MAINE FOR

A SECOND FIVE-YEAR TERM. KEY ASPECTS OF THE NEW PLAN.



ELIMINATES ANNUAL FILINGS TO ADJUST RATES OF CORE SERVICES;



ELIMINATES THE 4.5% PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR APPLIED IN THE INITIAL AFOR TERM;



PROVIDES TOTAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL SERVICES EXCEPT LOCAL SERVICE, OPERATOR SERVICES AND DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE;



ALLOWS AN INCREASE IN LOCAL SERVICE RATES THAT OFFSETS (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) A LEGISLATIVELY REQUIRED ACCESS CHARGE REDUCTION;



REJECTS PROPOSALS TO INSTITUTE OVER 9,000 RETAIL SERVICE QUALITY MEASURES AND INSTEAD CONTINUES THE CURRENT SERVICE QUALITY

PLAN WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS; AND

5



REQUIRES MONITORING OF VERIZON MAINES TOLL RATE/REVENUE REDUCTIONS TO INSURE THAT TOLL USERS BENEFIT FROM THE ACCESS

REDUCTIONS, EITHER IN REDUCED TOLL RATES FROM VERIZON MAINE, OR IN TOLL SAVINGS FROM ALTERNATIVE CARRIERS. AT THE END OF A

TWO-YEAR MONITORING PERIOD THAT BEGAN DECEMBER 31, 2000, VERIZON MAINES TOLL RATES/REVENUES MUST BE $19.8 MILLION LOWER, OR

ADDITIONAL CUTS IN TOLL RATES WILL BE REQUIRED. THEREAFTER, TOLL RATES ARE UNRESTRICTED. ON FEBRUARY 6, 2003, VERIZON MAINE

FILED WITH THE PUC PROOF THAT THE REQUIRED REDUCTION IN TOLL REVENUES HAD OCCURRED AND THAT NO FURTHER REGULATION OF TOLL

PRICES IS REQUIRED. PUC CONSIDERATION OF VERIZON MAINES FILING IS PENDING.

THE MAINE PUBLIC ADVOCATE APPEALED THE PUCS AFOR DECISION TO THE MAINE SUPREME

JUDICIAL COURT, CLAIMING THAT ANY EXTENSION TO THE AFOR MUST BE PRECEDED BY AN

INVESTIGATION OF VERIZON MAINES COSTS AND EARNINGS UTILIZING TRADITIONAL RATE

OF RETURN PRINCIPLES. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2003, THE COURT RULED THAT WHILE STATE

LAW REQUIRES THAT TELEPHONE RATES UNDER AN AFOR ARE NO HIGHER THAN UNDER RATE

OF RETURN REGULATION, THE PUC HAS BROAD DISCRETION IN MAKING SUCH A

DETERMINATION THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE A FULL RATE OF RETURN INQUIRY.

HOWEVER, THE COURT VACATED AND REMANDED THE DECISION TO THE PUC FOR ITS

FAILURE TO EXPRESSLY MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE THAT IF

SUCH A SHOWING CANNOT BE MADE, THAT IT NONETHELESS REMAINS IN THE BEST INTEREST

OF RATEPAYERS TO PROCEED WITH AN AFOR. NO CHANGE IN ANY OF VERIZON MAINES

RATES IS REQUIRED BY THE COURTS DECISION WHILE THE REMAND PROCEEDING IS

PENDING.

MASSACHUSETTS

IN APRIL 2001, VERIZON NEW ENGLAND FILED WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY (DTE) A PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN TO

REPLACE THE PRICE REGULATION PLAN THAT WAS TO EXPIRE IN AUGUST 2001. ON MAY 8,

2002, THE DTE ISSUED ITS DECISION IN PHASE I OF THE CASE IN WHICH IT FOUND THAT

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND HAD DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENT COMPETITION

FOR MOST OF ITS RETAIL BUSINESS SERVICES AND GRANTED VERIZON NEW ENGLAND

PRICING FLEXIBILITY ON THE SERVICES. PRICE INCREASES ARE NOT CONSTRAINED.

PRICE DECREASES ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLOOR REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DTE

RULED THAT VERIZON NEW ENGLAND SHOULD REDUCE STATE SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES TO

INTERSTATE LEVELS ON A REVENUE NEUTRAL BASIS BY INCREASES IN RESIDENCE DIAL

TONE RATES. WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENCE SERVICES, THE DTE TENTATIVELY CONCLUDED

THAT VERIZON NEW ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR NON-BASIC SERVICES

BUT THAT INCREASES IN BASIC SERVICES SHOULD BE LIMITED. THE DTE DIRECTED

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND TO FILE PROPOSALS CONSISTENT WITH ITS FINDINGS. THESE

PROPOSALS ARE UNDER REVIEW BY THE DTE IN PHASE II OF THE CASE, AND A DECISION

IS PENDING.

ON JULY 11, 2002, THE DTE ISSUED A COMPREHENSIVE ORDER IN WHICH IT RULED ON THE

COST STUDIES USED FOR SETTING VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS PRICES FOR UNES. VERIZON

NEW ENGLAND AND OTHER PARTIES FILED MOTIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OF VARIOUS

PORTIONS OF THE ORDER. ON JANUARY 14, 2003, THE DTE ISSUED ITS RULING ON THE

MOTIONS AND DIRECTED VERIZON NEW ENGLAND TO FILE NEW COST STUDIES CONSISTENT

WITH THE RULINGS WITHIN 30 DAYS.

ON DECEMBER 20, 2002, THE DTE ISSUED ITS DECISION IN RESPONSE TO A REMAND BY

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS IN

AN APPEAL BROUGHT BY WORLDCOM INC. AND GLOBAL NAPS INC. RELATED TO SEVERAL

ORDERS OF THE DTE DATING BACK TO MAY 1999. THE COURT RULED IN AN AUGUST 2002

DECISION THAT DTE ORDERS FINDING THAT RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION WAS NOT OWED ON

INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC DID NOT COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE THE DTE HAD NOT

RESTED ITS RULINGS ON THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THE INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS.

IN ITS LATEST DECISION, THE DTE RULED THAT THE PLAIN TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS

EXCLUDED INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC FROM THE SCOPE OF THE RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION

PROVISIONS, AND THEREFORE, VERIZON NEW ENGLAND HAD NO OBLIGATION TO PAY

RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION ON SUCH TRAFFIC. GLOBAL NAPS AND WORLDCOM HAVE

APPEALED THE DTES DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN

DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.

NEW HAMPSHIRE

VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS OPERATIONS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO RATE

OF RETURN REGULATION.

RHODE ISLAND

PURSUANT TO A DIRECTIVE OF THE RHODE ISLAND PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

(RIPUC), VERIZON RHODE ISLAND FILED IN JULY 2002 A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW

ALTERNATIVE REGULATION PLAN TO REPLACE THE EXISTING PRICE CAP PLAN THAT WAS TO

EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2002. FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN THE

CASE, VERIZON RHODE ISLAND AND THE RHODE ISLAND DIVISION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES

AND CARRIERS (DIVISION) FILED A STIPULATION ON DECEMBER 6, 2002 RESOLVING ALL

ISSUES IN THE CASE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE STIPULATED PLAN ARE.



NO INDEX OR PRICE CAP FORMULA;



PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL BUSINESS SERVICES, SUBJECT TO A LONG-RUN INCREMENTAL COST (LRIC)-BASED PRICE FLOOR;



THE COMPANY MAY INCREASE RESIDENTIAL BASIC EXCHANGE RATES BY $1 PER YEAR IN YEARS ONE AND TWO. AN ADDITIONAL $1 INCREASE

IN YEAR THREE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RIPUC AND DIVISION REVIEW;



THE COMPANY MAY PASS THROUGH EXOGENOUS CHANGES, SUBJECT TO A $2.5 MILLION ANNUAL CAP, BUT MUST ABSORB THE FIRST $1 MILLION

IN EXOGENOUS CHANGES IN THE YEAR IN WHICH APPROVAL IS SOUGHT;



THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE ITS VOLUNTARY FUNDING OF A DISCOUNT PROGRAM FOR INTERNET ACCESS FOR SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES AT UP

TO $2 MILLION PER YEAR UNTIL THE EARLIER OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, OR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM

(E.G., LEGISLATION);



THE CURRENT RETAIL SERVICE QUALITY PLAN IS MAINTAINED WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS; AND



THE TERM OF THE PLAN IS THREE YEARS.

6

AFTER FURTHER HEARING AND BRIEFING, THE RIPUC APPROVED THE STIPULATION AT AN

OPEN MEETING ON JANUARY 10, 2003, WITH TWO MODIFICATIONS. FIRST, THE RIPUC

IMPOSED LIMITS ON PRICE INCREASES FOR ALL OTHER NON-BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICES

AS FOLLOWS.

FOR SERVICES PRICED AT $5 OR LESS, RATES MAY INCREASE 15% PER YEAR

FOR SERVICES PRICED AT $5.01 TO $10, RATES MAY INCREASE 10% PER YEAR

FOR SERVICES PRICED OVER $10, RATES MAY INCREASE 5% PER YEAR

SECOND, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FILE QUARTERLY REPORTS SHOWING FOR EACH WIRE

CENTER IN THE STATE THE NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES SERVED BY THE COMPANY AND THE

NUMBER AND TYPE OF ACCESS LINES SERVED BY COMPETITORS. THE RIPUC IS EXPECTED

TO ENTER A WRITTEN ORDER SHORTLY.

VERMONT

IN 2000, THE VERMONT PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD APPROVED A FIVE-YEAR INCENTIVE

REGULATION PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE VERIZON NEW ENGLAND WITH INCREASED

FLEXIBILITY TO INTRODUCE AND PRICE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE PLAN ALSO

REMOVES MOST RESTRICTIONS ON VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS EARNINGS FROM VERMONT

OPERATIONS DURING THE LIFE OF THE PLAN AND CONTAINS NO PRODUCTIVITY ADJUSTMENT.

THE PLAN LIMITS VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES ON EXISTING

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND REQUIRES REVENUE REDUCTIONS OF $16.5 MILLION AT THE

OUTSET OF THE PLAN, $6.5 MILLION DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PLAN AND

APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION OVER THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF THE PLAN. THE PLAN

ALSO REQUIRES SOME SERVICE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL PENALTY.

VERIZON NEW JERSEY INC.

THE 1992 NEW JERSEY TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT CLASSIFIES TELECOMMUNICATIONS

SERVICES AS COMPETITIVE OR PROTECTED. PROTECTED TELEPHONE SERVICES

INCLUDE BASIC RESIDENCE, TOUCH-TONE, ACCESS SERVICES OTHER THAN THOSE OTHERWISE

DEEMED COMPETITIVE BY THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITIES (NJBPU),

BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH FOUR LINES OR LESS, AND THE ORDERING,

INSTALLATION AND RESTORATION OF THESE SERVICES. VERIZON NEW JERSEY PROVIDES

PROTECTED TELEPHONE SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING VERTICAL SERVICES

(RATE-REGULATED SERVICES), UNDER A PLAN FOR ALTERNATIVE FORM OF REGULATION,

WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2002, PURSUANT TO A DECISION ANNOUNCED BY THE

NJBPU ON JUNE 19, 2002.

THE NEW PLAN ELIMINATES THE PRIOR EARNINGS SHARING PROVISIONS.

ON JULY 15, 2002, THE NJBPU ANNOUNCED AN ORDER ON RECONSIDERATION OF ITS

DECEMBER 17, 2001 DECISION IN WHICH IT PRESCRIBED NEW RATES, TERMS AND

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH VERIZON NEW JERSEY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ITS NETWORK

AVAILABLE TO COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (CLECS). MANY OF THESE RATES

CONSTITUTE SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS TO VERIZON NEW JERSEYS PRIOR UNE RATES.

VERIZON NEW JERSEY FILED SUIT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ON NOVEMBER 7, 2002, SEEKING JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THESE

RATES AND COMPENSATION FOR THE TAKING THEY EFFECTED. THE CASE IS PRESENTLY

PENDING.

VERIZON NEW YORK INC.

THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (NYSPSC) HAS ADOPTED A NEW

INCENTIVE PLAN TO REGULATE THE SERVICES OF VERIZON NEW YORK, EFFECTIVE MARCH 1,

2002. THE PLAN PROVIDES PRICING FLEXIBILITY, ADOPTS NEW SERVICE QUALITY

STANDARDS AND DOES NOT RESTRICT VERIZON NEW YORKS EARNINGS. THE PLAN WILL

EXPIRE IN 2004, EXCEPT THAT THE SERVICE QUALITY PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN WILL

EXPIRE IN 2005.

THE NEW PLAN.



PERMITS VERIZON NEW YORK TO INCREASE ITS RETAIL RATES BY 3% OF ITS

INTRASTATE REVENUES PER YEAR IN EACH OF THE TWO YEARS OF THE PLAN,

BUT LIMITS ANY INCREASE ON RESIDENCE SERVICE FIRST LINES TO $1.85

IN 2002 AND $.65 IN 2003, AND FREEZES RATES AND LOWERS SERVICE

CONNECTION CHARGES FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS;



ESTABLISHES STATE-WIDE SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS, WITH THE

POTENTIAL FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND RESTRICTIONS ON VERIZON NEW

YORKS PRICING FLEXIBILITY IF IT FAILS TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS;



ESTABLISHES THAT THE RATES PROVIDED IN THE NYSPSCS JANUARY 2002

ORDER ON PRICING OF UNES WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF

THE PLAN; AND



REQUIRES VERIZON NEW YORK TO TRANSITION TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ACCOUNTING FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES, OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

ON JANUARY 28, 2002, THE NYSPSC ISSUED AN ORDER MANDATING SUBSTANTIAL

REDUCTIONS IN THE RATES THAT VERIZON NEW YORK MAY CHARGE ITS LOCAL EXCHANGE

COMPETITORS FOR ACCESS TO UNES.

ON JANUARY 22, 2003, THE NYSPSC, NOTING THAT CURRENT FCC AND NYSPSC COST

ALLOCATION AND ACCOUNTING SAFEGUARDS IMPOSED ON VERIZON NEW YORK OFFER STRONG

PROTECTION AGAINST ABUSIVE AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS, GRANTED OUR REQUEST TO

TERMINATE AN 11-YEAR OLD SET OF STRUCTURAL SAFEGUARDS THAT RESTRICTED

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN VERIZON NEW YORK AND ITS AFFILIATES.

7

VERIZON NEW YORKS OPERATIONS IN CONNECTICUT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RATE OF

RETURN REGULATION. IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITY CONTROL

ADOPTED AN INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN PROPOSED BY VERIZON NEW YORK, WHICH

ELIMINATES REGULATION OF EARNINGS AND PROVIDES OTHER DEREGULATORY BENEFITS.

VERIZON NORTH INC.

ILLINOIS

VERIZON NORTHS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN ILLINOIS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION. OPTIONAL TOLL PLANS, INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK (ISDN),

FRAME RELAY, PAYPHONES, CENTRANET

®

, AND OTHER DATA SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED

DEREGULATED AND HAVE TOTAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY.

INDIANA

VERIZON NORTHS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN INDIANA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

MICHIGAN

SINCE THE MICHIGAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT WAS PASSED IN 1991, A FORM OF

REGULATION THAT FOCUSES ON SERVICES, PRICES AND COSTS HAS REPLACED RATE OF

RETURN REGULATION. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED. ALL RATES FOR REGULATED

SERVICES MUST MEET A COST FLOOR. VERIZON NORTH MAY INCREASE LOCAL RATES

ANNUALLY UP TO 1% LESS THAN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ANY RATE INCREASES ABOVE

THAT AMOUNT MUST BE APPROVED BY THE MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (MPSC)

AS JUST AND REASONABLE. THE MPSC MAY ONLY APPROVE RATE INCREASES BASED UPON

ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING 5 FACTORS: TOTAL SERVICE LRIC; COMPARISON TO OTHER

PROVIDER RATES; WHETHER A NEW FUNCTION, FEATURE OR CAPABILITY IS OFFERED;

INCREASE IN COSTS TO PROVIDE LOCAL SERVICE; AND WHETHER FURTHER INVESTMENT IS

ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED. THE MPSC HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER NUMEROUS UNREGULATED

SERVICES. OTHER SERVICES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY.

ON JULY 17, 2000, SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO THE MICHIGAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED VERIZON NORTHS LOCAL RATES BY APPROXIMATELY $26

MILLION AND PROHIBITED ANY RATE INCREASES FOR THREE YEARS. ON SEPTEMBER 4,

2000, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN ISSUED AN

ORDER THAT TEMPORARILY STOPPED THE RATE FREEZE FROM GOING INTO EFFECT PENDING

FURTHER PROCEEDINGS, BUT REFUSED TO ISSUE AN ORDER TO STOP THE RATE REDUCTION

FROM GOING INTO EFFECT. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2000, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE SIXTH CIRCUIT ISSUED AN ORDER TO TEMPORARILY STOP THE RATE REDUCTION FROM

GOING INTO EFFECT, PENDING FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. ON DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN APPROVED A

SETTLEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT REDUCED VERIZONS $3.50 END USER COMMON

LINE CHARGE BY $.25 PROSPECTIVELY. PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT, THE PENDING

PROCEEDING BEFORE THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT IS BEING

WITHDRAWN AND THIS MATTER IS CLOSED.

OHIO

VERIZON NORTHS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN OHIO ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

PENNSYLVANIA

ON JULY 26, 2001, THE PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION (PPUC) REJECTED,

IN PART, AND ACCEPTED, IN PART, A PROPOSED PRICE CAP PLAN FILED BY VERIZON

NORTH. THE PPUC ACCEPTED, WITH SOME MODIFICATION, THAT PART OF THE PLAN THAT

PROVIDED FOR THE DEREGULATION OF THE PRICING OF COMPETITIVE SERVICES;

ELIMINATION OF EARNINGS SHARING; ADOPTION OF A PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR BASED ON

INFLATION; A PROVISION TO ADJUST RATES FOR EXOGENOUS EVENTS; AND A PRICE CAP OF

RATES OF PROTECTED SERVICES. THE PPUC REJECTED THAT PART OF VERIZON NORTHS

PLAN THAT PROVIDED FOR IMPROVEMENT OF VERIZON NORTHS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE.

IN 2002, THE PPUC APPROVED A REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN FOR VERIZON NORTH.

WISCONSIN

VERIZON NORTH ENTERED A PRICE CAP PLAN IN 1995. THE PLAN DOES NOT REGULATE

EARNINGS AND PRICE CAP INDEX INCREASES CAN BE ACCUMULATED AND DEFERRED UP TO

THREE YEARS. THE MAXIMUM INCREASE FOR ANY NON-BASIC RATE ELEMENT IS 10% OR THE

INCREASE IN THE GDP-PI, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. BASIC LOCAL SERVICE IS LIMITED

TO GDP-PI LESS 2%. INTRASTATE ACCESS SERVICE MIRRORS INTERSTATE RATES. THERE

ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER SERVICES AS LONG AS THEY COVER LRICS. RATE

CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE ON ONE DAYS NOTICE AFTER CUSTOMER NOTICE AND NEW

SERVICES TAKE EFFECT AFTER TEN DAYS. THE STATUTE REQUIRES THAT NO EARLIER THAN

SIX YEARS, AND NO MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE PUBLIC

SERVICE COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN MAY BY RULE INCREASE OR DECREASE THE GDP-PI

PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR IN ANY TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD TO REFLECT ANY STATEWIDE CHANGES

IN THE PRODUCTIVITY EXPERIENCE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THE

PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR IS UNDER REVIEW.

VERIZON NORTHWEST INC.

CALIFORNIA

VERIZON NORTHWESTS CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

IDAHO

VERIZON NORTHWESTS IDAHO OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

OREGON

VERIZON NORTHWESTS OREGON OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

PRICING FLEXIBILITY IS PERMITTED IN COMPETITIVE ZONES AND VERIZON NORTHWEST

CURRENTLY HAS DIGITAL CHANNEL SERVICE, ISDN, PBX TRUNKS (TELEPHONE SWITCHING

EQUIPMENT ON CUSTOMER PREMISES), DID TRUNKS (TRUNKS FROM THE CUSTOMER PREMISES

SWITCHES TO THE CENTRAL OFFICE) AND SINGLE LINE BUSINESS SERVICE OFFERINGS IN

THESE ZONES. BILLING AND COLLECTION AND CENTRANET

®

ARE IN A COMPETITIVE CLASS

AND ARE FLEXIBLY PRICED.

8

WASHINGTON

VERIZON NORTHWESTS WASHINGTON OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION. INTRALATA TOLL AND BILLING AND COLLECTION ARE FLEXIBLY PRICED.

VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA INC.

THE PPUC REGULATES VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA UNDER AN ALTERNATIVE REGULATION PLAN

APPROVED IN 1994. THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR A PURE PRICE CAP PLAN WITH NO SHARING

OF EARNINGS WITH CUSTOMERS AND REPLACES RATE BASE, RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

COMPETITIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING TOLL, DIRECTORY ADVERTISING, BILLING SERVICES,

CENTREX SERVICE, PAGING, SPEED CALLING, REPEAT CALLING, AND HICAP (HIGH

CAPACITY PRIVATE LINE) AND BUSINESS SERVICES PROVIDED TO LARGER CUSTOMERS ARE

PRICE DEREGULATED. ALL NON-COMPETITIVE SERVICES ARE PRICE REGULATED.

THE PLAN.



PERMITS ANNUAL PRICE INCREASES UP TO, BUT NOT EXCEEDING, THE GDP-PI MINUS 2.93%;



REQUIRES ANNUAL PRICE DECREASES WHEN THE GDP-PI FALLS BELOW 2.93%;



CAPS PRICES FOR PROTECTED SERVICES, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS BASIC EXCHANGE SERVICES, SPECIAL ACCESS AND

SWITCHED ACCESS, THROUGH 1999; AND



PERMITS REVENUE-NEUTRAL RATE RESTRUCTURING FOR NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES.

THE PPUCS ORDER APPROVING THE BELL ATLANTIC-GTE MERGER EXTENDED THE CAP ON

RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS BASIC EXCHANGE SERVICES THROUGH 2003.

THE PLAN REQUIRES VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA TO PROVIDE A LIFELINE SERVICE FOR

RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. THE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES DEPLOYMENT OF A UNIVERSAL

BROADBAND NETWORK, WHICH MUST BE COMPLETED IN PHASES: 20% BY 1998, 50% BY 2004,

AND 100% BY 2015. DEPLOYMENT MUST BE REASONABLY BALANCED AMONG URBAN, SUBURBAN

AND RURAL AREAS.

IN MAY 2002, THE PPUC FOUND THAT THE

PLAN REQUIRED VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA TO DEPLOY A BROADBAND NETWORK

CAPABLE OF PROVIDING 45 MEGABITS PER SECOND SERVICE WITHIN 5 DAYS OF

A CUSTOMER REQUEST. VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA HAS REQUESTED

RECONSIDERATION OF THIS RULING AND HAS FILED A PETITION TO CLARIFY

ITS NETWORK DEPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS. A FINAL DECISION ON THE PETITION

IS EXPECTED BY MID-2003.

IN 2002, VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA PROPOSED THAT ALL BUSINESS SERVICES BE

RECLASSIFIED AS COMPETITIVE. THAT PETITION IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY

THE PPUC.

VERIZON SOUTH INC.

NORTH CAROLINA

VERIZON SOUTHS OPERATIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN UNDER A PRICE CAP PLAN

SINCE 1996 THAT IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW IN 2002  2003. EARNINGS ARE NOT

REGULATED AND LOCAL RATES CAN BE INCREASED BY GDP-PI LESS 2%. RATE INCREASES

ARE EFFECTIVE ON FOURTEEN DAYS NOTICE. VERIZON SOUTH HAS COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY

TO INCREASE RATES FOR BILLING AND COLLECTION, CENTREX, AND ENHANCED DIGITAL

SWITCH SERVICE. THE PRICE PLAN IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW.

SOUTH CAROLINA

VERIZON SOUTHS SOUTH CAROLINA PRICE CAP PLAN STARTED DURING 2000. UNDER THE

STATUTE, EXISTING RATES ARE DEEMED JUST AND REASONABLE ON THE DATE OF

NOTIFICATION. RESIDENTIAL AND SINGLE-LINE BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE RATES ARE

CAPPED FOR TWO YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ELECTION. AFTER TWO YEARS, THESE RATES

MAY BE ADJUSTED ANNUALLY PURSUANT TO AN INFLATION-BASED INDEX. RATES FOR OTHER

SERVICES ARE FLEXIBLY PRICED. PRICE DECREASES ARE EFFECTIVE IN SEVEN DAYS.

PRICE INCREASES AND NEW SERVICES PRICES ARE EFFECTIVE IN FOURTEEN DAYS.

VIRGINIA

ON DECEMBER 21, 2000, THE VIRGINIA STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION (VSCC) APPROVED

A PRICE CAP PLAN FOR VERIZON SOUTH THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO VERIZON

VIRGINIAS PLAN DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE NEW PLAN WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001 AND HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE.

VERIZON SOUTHWEST

THE TEXAS PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION REGULATES VERIZON SOUTHWEST UNDER A PRICE

CAP PLAN WITH NO CAP ON EARNINGS PURSUANT TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY ACT

(PURA). THE PLAN PLACES SERVICES INTO FOUR CATEGORIES.



BASIC SERVICES  THESE INCLUDE BASIC LOCAL RESIDENTIAL CHARGES SUCH AS

SERVICE CONNECTION, MANDATORY EXPANDED CALLING PLANS AND RESIDENTIAL

CALL WAITING. PRICE INCREASES PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2005 ARE ONLY

ALLOWED TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN FCC SEPARATIONS THAT AFFECT NET

INCOME BY AT LEAST 10% AND FOR RATE GROUP RECLASSIFICATIONS DUE TO

ACCESS LINE GROWTH. AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2005, PRICE INCREASES REQUIRE

APPROVAL. FULL PACKAGING (AN INTEGRATED OFFERING OF SOME OR ALL OF

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES) IS ALLOWED.

9



NON-BASIC SERVICES  THIS CATEGORY ONLY INCLUDES SWITCHED ACCESS,

WHICH IS PRICE-CAPPED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2005. DECREASES CAN BE MADE

TO THE LRIC. THE STATUTE CONTAINS NO EXPIRATION PROVISION.



PRICE-CAPPED NON-BASIC SERVICES  THESE SERVICES INCLUDE BASIC LOCAL

BUSINESS CHARGES SUCH AS SERVICE CONNECTION AND BRI-ISDN (BASIC RATE

INTERFACE  INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK). THESE SERVICES ARE

PRICE-CAPPED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2005. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE

LRIC. FULL PACKAGING IS ALLOWED.



NON-BASIC SERVICES WITHOUT CAPS  THIS CATEGORY REPRESENTS ALL OTHER

REGULATED SERVICES, INCLUDING INTRALATA TOLL, CUSTOM CALLING FEATURES

(EXCEPT RESIDENTIAL CALL WAITING), SPECIAL ACCESS, OPERATOR SERVICES,

PBX AND ISDN SERVICES. THESE SERVICES HAVE UNLIMITED UPWARD PRICING

FLEXIBILITY. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE LRIC (WITH IMPUTATION) OR

THE PRICES IN EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1999, WHICHEVER IS LESS. FULL

PACKAGING IS ALLOWED.

VERIZON VIRGINIA INC.

EFFECTIVE IN 1995, THE VSCC APPROVED AN ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN THAT

REGULATES VERIZON VIRGINIAS NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES ON A PRICE CAP BASIS AND

DOES NOT REGULATE VERIZON VIRGINIAS COMPETITIVE SERVICES. THE PLAN DOES NOT

REGULATE PROFITS. IN JUNE 2001, THE VSCC MODIFIED THE PLAN AND EXTENDED THE

MORATORIUM ON RATE INCREASES FOR BASIC LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE UNTIL 2004. THE

PLAN HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE.

VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC INC.

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2002, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION

(DCPSC) APPROVED A NEW PRICE CAP PLAN FOR LOCAL RETAIL SERVICES PROVIDED BY

VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC. KEY PROVISIONS OF THE 2002 PLAN INCLUDE.



A TWO YEAR TERM;



NO EARNINGS RESTRICTIONS, SERVICE PENALTIES OR REVENUE SHARING;



FOUR SERVICE CATEGORIES: BASIC RESIDENTIAL, BASIC BUSINESS, DISCRETIONARY AND COMPETITIVE;



A CAP ON RESIDENTIAL DIAL TONE LINE RATES FOR THE TERM OF THE PLAN AND A REDUCTION IN RESIDENTIAL SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGES;



ANNUAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL OTHER BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, WITH THE INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES FROM THESE SERVICES

LIMITED TO THE ANNUAL INFLATION RATE (AS MEASURED BY THE CHANGE IN GDP-PI) AND INCREASES FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL SERVICE IN THE

CATEGORY LIMITED TO 10%;



CLASSIFICATION OF ALL BUSINESS SERVICES AS COMPETITIVE WITH COMPLETE PRICING FLEXIBILITY EXCEPT FOR BASIC BUSINESS DIAL TONE

LINES, PBX TRUNKS, LOCAL DIRECTORY SERVICE AND MESSAGE UNITS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO A 10% ANNUAL LIMIT ON ANY RATE INCREASE;



PRICING FLEXIBILITY ON DISCRETIONARY SERVICES, WITH A 15% ANNUAL LIMIT ON ANY RATE INCREASE;



FLEXIBILITY TO BUNDLE OR PACKAGE EXISTING SERVICES; AND



ASSISTANCE BY VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT TO SET UP 211 DIALING FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SOCIAL SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND ONE-TIME CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS.

VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA INC.

ON OCTOBER 3, 2001, THE WEST VIRGINIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WVPSC)

APPROVED VERIZON WEST VIRGINIAS NEW INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN (IRP). THE NEW

IRP CONTINUES, UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FLEXIBLE PRICE REGULATION OF

COMPETITIVE SERVICES, CAPS ON BASIC RATES, INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITMENTS AND

UNLIMITED EARNINGS FREEDOM THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 1988. IN ADDITION,

LONG DISTANCE, WIDE AREA TELEPHONE SERVICE AND NATIONAL DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE

WILL BE RATE-DEREGULATED, AND VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA MAY PETITION FOR THE RATE

DEREGULATION OF ANY OTHER SERVICE, EXCEPT BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICE, AS EARLY

AS JANUARY 1, 2002.

IN ADDITION, VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA WILL PHASE-IN AN ANNUAL RATE DECREASE OF

$19.2 MILLION BY JULY 2004. CUMULATIVE RATE REDUCTIONS WILL BE $91.7 MILLION

OVER THE FIVE-YEAR LIFE OF THE IRP, AND TOTAL ANNUAL REDUCTIONS BY THE END OF

THE IRP WILL BE $26 MILLION.

COMPETITION

CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES INCLUDE LONG

DISTANCE COMPANIES, OTHER LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDERS, FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES,

INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES.

MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION AND

EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING

COMPETITION AND MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH.

10

LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES

THE ABILITY TO OFFER LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS. APPLICATIONS FROM COMPETITORS TO

PROVIDE AND RESELL LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN EVERY

JURISDICTION IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. THE 1996 ACT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS.

ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE 1996 ACT WAS TO ENSURE, AND ACCELERATE, THE

EMERGENCE OF COMPETITION IN LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS. TOWARD THIS END, THE 1996

ACT REQUIRES MOST EXISTING LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE

CARRIERS, OR ILECS), INCLUDING OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS, TO PERMIT POTENTIAL

COMPETITORS (CLECS) TO.



PURCHASE SERVICE FROM THE ILEC FOR RESALE TO CLEC CUSTOMERS;



PURCHASE UNES FROM THE ILEC; AND/OR



INTERCONNECT THE CLECS NETWORK WITH THE ILECS NETWORK.

AS A RESULT, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES TO INCREASE.

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO CLECS

AT DISCOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY 51% FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. A NUMBER OF OUR STATE REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY

MANDATED REDUCTIONS IN THE RATES WE CHARGE LOCAL EXCHANGE COMPETITORS FOR

ACCESS TO UNES AND OTHERS ARE INITIATING SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS. SEE STATE

REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES.

LONG DISTANCE SERVICES

WE OFFER INTRALATA AND INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES. INTRALATA TOLL CALLS

ORIGINATE AND TERMINATE WITHIN THE SAME LATA, BUT GENERALLY COVER A GREATER

DISTANCE THAN A LOCAL CALL. STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS RATHER THAN FEDERAL

AUTHORITIES GENERALLY REGULATE THESE SERVICES. FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE

JURISDICTION OVER INTERSTATE TOLL SERVICES. ALL OF OUR STATE REGULATORY

COMMISSIONS (EXCEPT IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WHERE INTRALATA TOLL SERVICE

IS NOT PROVIDED) PERMIT OTHER CARRIERS TO OFFER INTRALATA TOLL SERVICES WITHIN

THE STATE. INTERLATA TOLL CALLS TERMINATE OUTSIDE THE LATA OF ORIGINATION. WE

OFFER INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES NATIONWIDE, EXCEPT IN THOSE REGIONS

SERVED BY THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET

RECEIVED AUTHORITY TO OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICE UNDER THE 1996 ACT AND IN

ALASKA. A NUMBER OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE LONG DISTANCE BUSINESS HAVE

STRONG BRAND RECOGNITION AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

ALTERNATIVE ACCESS SERVICES

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS REVENUES FROM BUSINESS AND

GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS IS DERIVED FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE,

MULTIPLE-LINE SUBSCRIBERS.

WE FACE COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, CONSTRUCTED BY

LARGE END-USERS, INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS AND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS VENDORS, WHICH

ARE CAPABLE OF ORIGINATING AND/OR TERMINATING CALLS WITHOUT THE USE OF OUR

PLANT. THE FCCS ORDERS REQUIRING US TO OFFER COLLOCATED INTERCONNECTION FOR

SPECIAL AND SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES HAVE ENHANCED THE ABILITY OF SUCH

ALTERNATIVE ACCESS PROVIDERS TO COMPETE WITH US.

OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF COMPETITION INCLUDE CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS, SHARED

TENANT SERVICES AND OTHER NONCARRIER SYSTEMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF BYPASSING OUR

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS LOCAL PLANT, EITHER PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY, THROUGH

SUBSTITUTION OF SPECIAL ACCESS FOR SWITCHED ACCESS OR THROUGH CONCENTRATION OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ON FEWER OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS LINES.

WIRELESS SERVICES

WIRELESS SERVICES ALSO CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COMPETITION TO OUR

WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, ESPECIALLY AS WIRELESS CARRIERS

(INCLUDING VERIZON WIRELESS) EXPAND AND IMPROVE THEIR NETWORK COVERAGE AND

CONTINUE TO LOWER THEIR PRICES TO END-USERS. AS A RESULT, MORE END-USERS ARE

SUBSTITUTING WIRELESS SERVICES FOR BASIC WIRELINE SERVICE. WIRELESS TELEPHONE

SERVICES CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DATA TRANSMISSION.

PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES

THE GROWTH OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED USAGE OF

PUBLIC TELEPHONES, AS MORE CUSTOMERS ARE SUBSTITUTING WIRELESS SERVICES FOR

PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER

PROVIDERS OF PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES.

OPERATOR SERVICES

OUR OPERATOR SERVICES PRODUCT LINE FACES COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE OPERATOR

SERVICES PROVIDERS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.

11

DOMESTIC WIRELESS

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC WIRELESS SEGMENT PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES, PAGING

SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH VERIZON

WIRELESS.

VERIZON WIRELESS IS THE LEADING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER IN THE UNITED

STATES IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS, NETWORK COVERAGE AND REVENUES.

VERIZON WIRELESS HAS THE LARGEST CUSTOMER BASE OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS PROVIDER,

WITH 32.5 MILLION WIRELESS SUBSCRIBERS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND PROVIDES

WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. APPROXIMATELY 252

MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE IN AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH WE HAVE FCC

LICENSES TO OFFER OUR SERVICES AND 228 MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE IN AREAS COVERED

BY OUR SERVICE. WE PROVIDE DIGITAL COVERAGE IN AREAS WHERE APPROXIMATELY 220

MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE, INCLUDING IN ALMOST EVERY MAJOR U.S. CITY.

BACKGROUND

IN SEPTEMBER 1999, BELL ATLANTIC AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC AGREED TO COMBINE THEIR

U.S. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION BUSINESSES AND FORM VERIZON WIRELESS. IN APRIL

2000, VODAFONE CONTRIBUTED U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS (AIRTOUCH) AND ITS INTEREST

IN PRIMECO PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS, L.P. (PRIMECO) TO VERIZON WIRELESS IN

EXCHANGE FOR A 65.1% ECONOMIC INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS. BELL ATLANTIC

CONTRIBUTED ITS U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND ITS INTEREST IN PRIMECO TO VERIZON

WIRELESS. IN JULY 2000, AFTER THE MERGER OF BELL ATLANTIC AND GTE, VERIZON

CONTRIBUTED GTES U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS TO VERIZON WIRELESS, INCREASING

VERIZONS ECONOMIC INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS FROM 34.9% TO 55%.

VERIZON WIRELESS BROUGHT TOGETHER THE OPERATIONS OF FOUR WELL-RECOGNIZED U.S.

WIRELESS CARRIERS: BELL ATLANTIC MOBILE, GTE WIRELESS, AIRTOUCH AND PRIMECO,

RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORK IN THE UNITED

STATES.

BELL ATLANTIC MOBILE

BELL ATLANTIC MOBILE, BASED IN BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY, HAD 8.0 MILLION

CUSTOMERS AS OF MARCH 31, 2000. IT OPERATED IN 18 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA AND 12 OF THE TOP 50 U.S. MARKETS, INCLUDING BALTIMORE, BOSTON, NEW

YORK CITY, PHILADELPHIA AND WASHINGTON, D.C.

GTE WIRELESS

GTE WIRELESS HAD MORE THAN 7.0 MILLION U.S. WIRELESS CUSTOMERS IN JUNE 2000.

IT OPERATED IN 19 STATES AND 18 OF THE TOP 50 UNITED STATES MARKETS, INCLUDING

CHICAGO, CLEVELAND, HOUSTON, SAN FRANCISCO AND ST. LOUIS. GTE WIRELESS WAS

BASED IN ALPHARETTA, GEORGIA AND A SUBSIDIARY OF GTE CORPORATION.

AIRTOUCH

AIRTOUCH, BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA AND OWNED BY VODAFONE, SERVED

NEARLY 10 MILLION WIRELESS CUSTOMERS AND 3.5 MILLION PAGING CUSTOMERS IN THE

UNITED STATES AS OF MARCH 31, 2000. IT OPERATED BROADBAND WIRELESS NETWORKS IN

22 STATES AND 18 OF THE TOP 50 U.S. MARKETS, INCLUDING ATLANTA, DETROIT, LOS

ANGELES, PHOENIX, SAN DIEGO AND SEATTLE.

PRIMECO

PRIMECO WAS FORMED IN OCTOBER 1994 AS A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP TO PROVIDE ADVANCED

WIRELESS DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OVER AN ALL-DIGITAL WIRELESS NETWORK.

AS OF MARCH 31, 2000, PRIMECO HAD MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS.

IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE PARTNERSHIP, PRIMECO WAS A

PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN BELL ATLANTIC AND VODAFONE. BASED IN WESTLAKE, TEXAS,

PRIMECO OPERATED IN NINE STATES AND 13 OF THE TOP 50 UNITED STATES MARKETS,

INCLUDING DALLAS, MIAMI, SAN ANTONIO AND TAMPA.

THE PRECEDING CUSTOMER NUMBERS INCLUDE OVERLAPPING MARKETS THAT HAVE BEEN

SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD.

RECENT ACQUISITION

PRICE COMMUNICATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2001, VERIZON WIRELESS AND PRICE COMMUNICATIONS CORP. (PRICE)

ANNOUNCED THAT AN AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED TO COMBINE PRICES WIRELESS

BUSINESS WITH A PORTION OF VERIZON WIRELESS IN A TRANSACTION VALUED AT

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION, INCLUDING $550 MILLION OF NET DEBT. THE

TRANSACTION CLOSED ON AUGUST 15, 2002 AND THE ASSUMED DEBT WAS REDEEMED ON

AUGUST 16, 2002. THE RESULTING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IS CONTROLLED AND MANAGED BY

VERIZON WIRELESS. IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS CONTRIBUTED ASSETS, PRICE RECEIVED A

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE NEW

12

PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS EXCHANGEABLE INTO

COMMON STOCK OF VERIZON WIRELESS IF AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF THAT STOCK

OCCURS, OR INTO THE COMMON STOCK OF VERIZON ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE

ASSET CONTRIBUTION DATE IF THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF VERIZON WIRELESS

COMMON STOCK DOES NOT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEN. THE PRICE OF THE VERIZON COMMON

STOCK USED IN DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF VERIZON COMMON SHARES RECEIVED IN AN

EXCHANGE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM AMOUNT.

COMPETITION

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY.

WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE

INDUSTRY, THE ENTRY OF NEW COMPETITORS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE AUCTION OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM AND REGULATORY

CHANGES. OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS SERVE EACH OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

COMPETE. WE CURRENTLY PROVIDE SERVICE TO 49 OF THE TOP 50 MARKETS IN THE U.S.,

AND THESE 49 MARKETS HAVE AN AVERAGE OF FIVE OTHER COMPETING WIRELESS

PROVIDERS. COMPETITION ALSO MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT SMALLER,

STAND-ALONE WIRELESS PROVIDERS TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED

AND MORE EXPERIENCED WIRELESS PROVIDERS.

WE COMPETE AGAINST FIVE OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS: AT&T

WIRELESS, CINGULAR WIRELESS, NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS, SPRINT PCS AND T-MOBILE

(FORMERLY VOICESTREAM). IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE AGAINST SEVERAL REGIONAL

WIRELESS COMPANIES IN MARKETS WHERE WE PROVIDE SERVICE. ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS

ARE SEEKING TO ENTER THE MARKET USING NEW TYPES OF SPECTRUM. THE WIRELESS

COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, AND THIS TREND MAY CONTINUE. THIS CONSOLIDATION TREND COULD ENHANCE THE

ABILITY OF WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL,

MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES TO COMPETE WITH OUR OFFERINGS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR

INDUSTRY.

BRAND RECOGNITION.

WE INTRODUCED THE VERIZON WIRELESS BRAND NAME IN APRIL 2000

AND BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED STRONG BRAND RECOGNITION.

NETWORK COVERAGE.

IN RECENT YEARS, COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY HAS LED TO

LOWER PRICES AND TO THE POPULARITY OF PRICING PLANS THAT DO NOT CHARGE FOR

ROAMING. AS A RESULT, THE ABILITY TO OFFER NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH A

COMPANYS OWN NETWORK IS IMPORTANT, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO ENSURE UNIFORM

PERFORMANCE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FEATURES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AS MANY

FEATURES ARE NOT FULLY AVAILABLE THROUGH ROAMING PARTNERS.

DIGITAL SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY.

DIGITAL SERVICE OFFERS BENEFITS TO THE

CUSTOMER AND ALSO PERMITS A NETWORK TO HAVE GREATER CAPACITY.

CUSTOMER SERVICE.

QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CARE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE

THAT EXISTING CUSTOMERS DO NOT TERMINATE SERVICE AND TO OBTAIN NEW CUSTOMERS.

CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IN ORDER TO EXPAND AND BUILD-OUT NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE

NEXT GENERATION SERVICES, WIRELESS PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

RESOURCES.

AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION, WE MAY ENCOUNTER FURTHER MARKET PRESSURES TO REDUCE

OUR SERVICE PRICES, RESTRUCTURE OUR SERVICE PACKAGES TO OFFER MORE VALUE, OR

RESPOND TO PARTICULAR SHORT-TERM, MARKET-SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE,

SPECIAL INTRODUCTORY PRICING OR PACKAGES THAT MAY BE OFFERED BY NEW PROVIDERS

LAUNCHING THEIR SERVICE IN A PARTICULAR MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL SPENDING TO RESPOND TO COMPETITION.

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR MARKETING

EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS COMPETITIVE

FACTORS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, NEW

SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS,

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PRICING STRATEGIES BY COMPETITORS.

INDIRECTLY WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF VERIZON AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED

OWNERSHIP OF THAT SUBSIDIARY TO A NEWLY CREATED TRUST FOR CTI EMPLOYEES. THIS

DECREASED OUR OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE IN CTI FROM 65% TO 48%. WE ALSO REDUCED OUR

REPRESENTATION ON CTIS BOARD OF DIRECTORS FROM FIVE OF NINE MEMBERS TO FOUR OF

NINE (SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED TO

13

ONE OF FIVE MEMBERS). AS A RESULT OF THESE

ACTIONS THAT SURRENDER CONTROL OF CTI, WE CHANGED OUR METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

THIS INVESTMENT FROM CONSOLIDATION TO THE EQUITY METHOD. ON JUNE 3, 2002, AS A

RESULT OF AN OPTION EXERCISED BY TELFONE (BVI) LIMITED, A CTI SHAREHOLDER,

VERIZON ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 5.3 MILLION ADDITIONAL CTI SHARES. ALSO ON JUNE

3, 2002 WE TRANSFERRED OWNERSHIP OF A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF VERIZON THAT

HELD 5.4 MILLION CTI SHARES TO A SECOND INDEPENDENT TRUST LEAVING US WITH AN

APPROXIMATELY 48% NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CTI. SINCE WE HAVE NO OTHER

FUTURE COMMITMENTS OR PLANS TO FUND CTIS OPERATIONS AND WE HAVE WRITTEN OUR

INVESTMENT DOWN TO ZERO, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS, WE ARE NO LONGER RECORDING OPERATING INCOME OR LOSSES

RELATED TO CTIS OPERATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING

DYNAMIC CHANGES AS NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORMS EMBRACE

COMPETITION.

IN VENEZUELA, CANTVS WIRELESS OPERATIONS HAVE FACED COMPETITION FOR SEVERAL

YEARS. IN LATE 2000, THE GOVERNMENT OPENED THE BASIC TELEPHONY MARKET FOR

LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICE TO COMPETITION AND

ISSUED NEW GUIDELINES GOVERNING INTERCONNECTION AND THE USE OF WIRELESS

SPECTRUM. HOWEVER, CANTV CONTINUES TO BE VENEZUELAS PRINCIPAL

TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER.

IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, CODETEL FACES BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS

COMPETITORS. WHILE THE COMPETITION HAS SLOWED BOTH ACCESS LINE AND WIRELESS

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH, CODETEL REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL PROVIDER OF LOCAL, NATIONAL

AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE, WIRELESS AND INTERNET SERVICES.

THE MEXICAN WIRELESS AND LONG DISTANCE MARKETS EACH HAVE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT

COMPETITORS. IUSACELL HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARDS ITS GOAL OF

ACHIEVING A NATIONAL WIRELESS OPERATING FOOTPRINT WITH ITS FOURTH QUARTER 2001

ACQUISITION OF GRUPO PORTATEL, S.A. DE C.V., A WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN

SOUTHERN MEXICO, AND THE CONTINUED BUILD-OUT OF ITS PCS NETWORK IN NORTHEASTERN

AND NORTHWESTERN MEXICO. WITH RESPECT TO REGULATORY MATTERS, MEXICOS LEGAL

SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OR ENFORCE EFFECTIVE DOMINANT

CARRIER REGULATION AGAINST TELÉFONOS DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V., THE DOMINANT

LOCAL WIRELINE AND LONG DISTANCE CARRIER, AND RADIOMOVIL DIPSA, S.A. DE C.V.,

THE DOMINANT WIRELESS PROVIDER.

IN PUERTO RICO, FIVE OTHER FACILITIES-BASED PROVIDERS OPERATE IN THE WIRELESS

MARKET. ALL WIRELINE SERVICES, INCLUDING LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, INTERNET ACCESS

AND DATA, HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED NEW COMPETITION. NEVERTHELESS, TELPRI

CONTINUES TO BE THE PRINCIPAL PROVIDER OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN PUERTO

RICO TO BOTH THE BUSINESS AND CONSUMER MARKETS. WITH RESPECT TO REGULATORY

MATTERS, THE PUERTO RICO TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY BOARD ISSUED ORDERS IN

OCTOBER 2001 AND FEBRUARY 2002, WHICH CALLED FOR CASH REFUNDS AND SUBSTANTIAL

REDUCTIONS IN ACCESS RATES FOR INTRA-ISLAND LONG DISTANCE SERVICE. TELPRI

APPEALED THE ORDER WITH THE PUERTO RICO CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WHICH STAYED

THE ORDERS AND IS HEARING THE APPEAL. ORAL PRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT ARE

SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN FIRST QUARTER 2003.

15

IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, EUROTEL PRAHA WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THE

THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE SPECTRUM IN DECEMBER 2001.

IN THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC, EUROTEL BRATISLAVA WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THE

THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE SPECTRUM IN JULY 2002.

IN ITALY, VODAFONE OMNITEL WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE

SPECTRUM IN 2000, WHICH WAS EXTENDED FROM A 15-YEAR LIFE TO A 20-YEAR LIFE IN

NOVEMBER 2001. IT IS EXPECTED THAT VODAFONE OMNITEL WILL BEGIN ROLLING OUT THE

3G NETWORK DURING 2003. IN ADDITION, THE ITALIAN REGULATOR CONTINUED TO BE

ACTIVE IN THE ITALIAN MARKET DURING 2002 INTRODUCING MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY

MID-YEAR AND REDUCTIONS IN THE FIXED TO MOBILE TARIFFS.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

VERIZON WIRELESS

FCC AUCTION

ON JANUARY 29, 2001, THE BIDDING PHASE OF THE FCC REAUCTION OF 1.9 GHZ C AND F

BLOCK BROADBAND PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (PCS) SPECTRUM LICENSES, WHICH

BEGAN DECEMBER 12, 2000, OFFICIALLY ENDED. VERIZON WIRELESS WAS THE WINNING

BIDDER FOR 113 LICENSES. THE TOTAL PRICE OF THESE LICENSES WAS $8,781 MILLION,

$1,822 MILLION OF WHICH HAD BEEN PAID. THERE WERE NO LEGAL CHALLENGES TO OUR

QUALIFICATIONS TO ACQUIRE THESE LICENSES. WE WERE AWARDED 33 OF THE 113

LICENSES IN AUGUST 2001 AND PAID APPROXIMATELY $82 MILLION FOR THEM. HOWEVER,

THE REMAINING LICENSES FOR WHICH WE WERE THE HIGH BIDDER HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT

OF LITIGATION BY THE ORIGINAL LICENSEES, WHOSE LICENSES HAD BEEN CANCELLED BY

THE FCC. IN JUNE 2001, A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULED THAT THE FCCS

CANCELLATION OF THE LICENSES VIOLATED THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW. IN MARCH

2002, THE FCC ORDERED A REFUND OF 85% OF THE PAYMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2002,

PURSUANT TO AN FCC ORDER, WE DISMISSED OUR APPLICATIONS FOR THE LICENSES,

RECEIVED OUR REMAINING PAYMENT AND WERE RELIEVED OF ALL OF OUR REMAINING

OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE FCC REAUCTION. ON JANUARY 27, 2003, THE U.S.

SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE FCCS CANCELLATION OF THE LICENSES VIOLATED

FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW.

TIMING OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

SINCE AUGUST 2000, WHEN THE VERIZON WIRELESS INC. REGISTRATION STATEMENT WAS

INITIALLY FILED WITH THE SEC, WE PERIODICALLY REITERATED THAT THE INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING WOULD OCCUR WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE. ON JANUARY

29, 2003, VERIZON WIRELESS WITHDREW THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT BECAUSE IT

CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

ADDRESSED.

NORTHCOAST SPECTRUM PURCHASE

IN DECEMBER 2002, VERIZON WIRELESS ANNOUNCED THAT IT SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH

NORTHCOAST COMMUNICATIONS LLC TO PURCHASE 50 PCS LICENSES AND RELATED NETWORK

THE U.S. INCLUDING SUCH MARKETS AS NEW YORK, NY, BOSTON, MA, MINNEAPOLIS, MN,

COLUMBUS, OH, PROVIDENCE, RI, ROCHESTER, NY AND HARTFORD, CT. THE TRANSACTION

IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2003.

NEW YORK RECOVERY FUNDING

IN AUGUST 2002, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL

PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE U.S.

SENATE. THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL INCLUDES $5.5 BILLION IN NEW YORK

RECOVERY FUNDING. OF THAT AMOUNT, APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION HAS BEEN

ALLOCATED TO COVER THE UNINSURED LOSSES OF BUSINESSES (INCLUDING THE

RESTORATION OF UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE) AS A RESULT OF THE SEPTEMBER 11TH

TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE LOWER MANHATTAN

DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION FOLLOWING AN APPLICATION PROCESS.
