GENERAL

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. (VERIZON, OR THE COMPANY)

IS ONE OF THE WORLDS LEADING PROVIDERS OF COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. FORMERLY KNOWN AS BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION, WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1983 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. WE BEGAN DOING BUSINESS AS VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. ON

JUNE 30, 2000 FOLLOWING OUR MERGER WITH GTE CORPORATION. WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF ALLTEL CORPORATION (ALLTEL) ON JANUARY 9, 2009, MAKING VERIZON THE LARGEST WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.) IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND REVENUES. STRESSING DIVERSITY AND COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WE HAVE A HIGHLY DIVERSE WORKFORCE OF APPROXIMATELY 222,900 EMPLOYEES.

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT 140 WEST STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10007 (TELEPHONE NUMBER 212-395-1000).

WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, DOMESTIC WIRELESS AND WIRELINE, WHICH WE OPERATE AND MANAGE AS STRATEGIC BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ORGANIZE BY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE

SEGMENTS AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING.

DOMESTIC WIRELESS

DOMESTIC WIRELESSS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES INCLUDE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT SALES ACROSS THE U.S.

WIRELINE

WIRELINES COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE VOICE,

INTERNET ACCESS, BROADBAND VIDEO AND DATA, NEXT GENERATION INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP) NETWORK SERVICES, NETWORK ACCESS, LONG DISTANCE AND OTHER SERVICES. WE PROVIDE THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS TO CARRIERS, BUSINESSES

AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS BOTH IN THE U.S. AND IN 150 OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.

THE FOLLOWING PORTIONS OF THE 2009

VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT.

DOMESTIC WIRELESS

BACKGROUND

OUR DOMESTIC WIRELESS SEGMENT, CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DOING BUSINESS AS VERIZON WIRELESS (VERIZON WIRELESS), IS A JOINT VENTURE FORMED IN APRIL

2000 BY THE COMBINATION OF THE U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE). VERIZON OWNS A CONTROLLING 55% INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS, AND VODAFONE OWNS THE REMAINING 45%. IN 2009, DOMESTIC WIRELESS REVENUES

WERE $62,131 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 58% OF VERIZONS AGGREGATE REVENUES. DOMESTIC WIRELESS IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER.

ALLTEL ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION

ON JUNE 5, 2008, VERIZON WIRELESS ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN

OF MERGER WITH ALLTEL, A PROVIDER OF WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES TO CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN 34 STATES, AND ITS CONTROLLING STOCKHOLDER, ATLANTIS HOLDINGS LLC, TO ACQUIRE, IN AN ALL-CASH MERGER, 100% OF THE EQUITY OF ALLTEL FOR CASH

CONSIDERATION OF $5.9 BILLION AND THE ASSUMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY $24 BILLION OF AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ALLTEL DEBT. VERIZON WIRELESS CLOSED THE TRANSACTION ON JANUARY 9, 2009. SEE  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

AS A CONDITION OF THE REGULATORY APPROVALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) THAT WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE ALLTEL ACQUISITION, VERIZON WIRELESS IS REQUIRED TO DIVEST OVERLAPPING

WIRELESS PROPERTIES IN 105 OPERATING MARKETS IN 24 STATES (ALLTEL DIVESTITURE MARKETS). THESE MARKETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ALLTEL OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO INCLUDE A SMALL NUMBER OF PRE-MERGER OPERATIONS OF VERIZON WIRELESS. AS A RESULT OF THESE

DIVESTITURE REQUIREMENTS, WE PLACED THE WIRELESS LICENSES AND ASSETS IN THE ALLTEL DIVESTITURE MARKETS IN A MANAGEMENT TRUST THAT WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE PROPERTIES UNDER THEIR CURRENT BRANDS UNTIL THEY ARE SOLD. IN MAY 2009, VERIZON WIRELESS

ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH AT&T MOBILITY LLC (AT&T MOBILITY), A SUBSIDIARY OF AT&T INC. (AT&T) PURSUANT TO WHICH AT&T MOBILITY AGREED TO ACQUIRE 79 OF THE 105 ALLTEL DIVESTITURE MARKETS, INCLUDING LICENSES AND

NETWORK ASSETS FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION IN CASH. IN JUNE 2009, VERIZON WIRELESS ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ATLANTIC TELE-NETWORK, INC. PURSUANT TO WHICH IT AGREED TO ACQUIRE THE REMAINING 26 ALLTEL DIVESTITURE MARKETS THAT WERE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION WITH AT&T MOBILITY, INCLUDING LICENSES AND NETWORK ASSETS FOR $200 MILLION IN CASH. VERIZON WIRELESS EXPECTS TO CLOSE BOTH TRANSACTIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2010. COMPLETION OF EACH OF THE FOREGOING TRANSACTIONS

IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF REGULATORY APPROVALS FROM THE DOJ AND THE FCC.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ALLTEL MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO DIVESTITURE HAVE BEEN RE-BRANDED TO 

VERIZON WIRELESS

. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF ALLTEL, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED COST SAVINGS FROM REDUCED ROAMING COSTS, THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATE FACILITIES AND REDUCED OVERALL

EXPENSES RELATING TO ADVERTISING, OVERHEAD AND HEADCOUNT. WE ALSO EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE REDUCED OVERALL COMBINED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF GREATER ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND THE REDEPLOYMENT OF REDUNDANT NETWORK ASSETS. OUR NETWORK AND

ALLTELS NETWORK BOTH EMPLOY CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS (CDMA) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS FACILITATING THE INTEGRATION OF ALLTELS NETWORK OPERATIONS WITH OURS. WE CANNOT, HOWEVER, ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED

COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONS

VERIZON WIRELESS PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ACROSS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS IN THE U.S. AND HAS THE LARGEST THIRD GENERATION (3G) NETWORK OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDER. VERIZON WIRELESS IS THE INDUSTRYLEADING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE U.S., IN TERMS OF OPERATING INCOME. WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF ALLTEL, VERIZON WIRELESS BECAME THE LARGEST WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES,

AS MEASURED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND REVENUES.

COMPETITION

IN THE U.S., WE COMPETE PRIMARILY AGAINST THREE OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS: AT&T, SPRINT NEXTEL AND T-MOBILE. IN ADDITION, IN MANY MARKETS WE ALSO COMPETE WITH

REGIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS U.S. CELLULAR, METROPCS AND LEAP WIRELESS. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING INCREASES IN WIRELESS MARKET PENETRATION LEVELS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, NEW MARKET ENTRANTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM, BOTH LICENSED AND UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. SEVERAL HIGHER-SPEED WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY VARIOUS WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHILE OTHERS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DEVELOPED TO MEET THE GROWING CUSTOMER APPETITE FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS IN BOTH FIXED AND FULLY MOBILE ENVIRONMENTS. WE HAVE DEPLOYED THE LARGEST 3G WIRELESS NETWORK IN THE UNITED

STATES. OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEPLOYING THEIR OWN 3G NETWORKS, AND FOURTH GENERATION (4G) TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED. IN ADDITION, SOME MUNICIPALITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

DEPLOYING NETWORKS OF SMALL WI-FI ACCESS POINTS. COMPETITION MAY ALSO INCREASE IF SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MERGE OR TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED AND MORE EXPERIENCED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO

COMPETE WITH RESELLERS THAT BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM FACILITIES-BASED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR RESALE.

THE

WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING TO INCREASE THEIR BRAND RECOGNITION AND CAPTURE CUSTOMER REVENUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER PARTICIPANTS

IN THE WIRELESS VALUE CHAIN, INCLUDING DATA APPLICATION AND CONTENT PROVIDERS AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS, ARE INTRODUCING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DIRECTLY TO WIRELESS CONSUMERS, RATHER THAN THROUGH WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, IN ORDER TO COMPETE MORE

EFFECTIVELY FOR WIRELESS DATA REVENUES. ALSO, SEVERAL DEVICE MAKERS ARE MAKING THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE BY BUNDLING THEM WITH THEIR PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, APPLE INC. IS PACKAGING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT WITH ITS

PHONES, AND GOOGLE INC. (GOOGLE) HAS DEVELOPED AN OPEN OPERATING SYSTEM AND RELATED APPLICATIONS FOR MOBILE DEVICES THAT HAS BEEN DEPLOYED ON PHONES THAT WE AND CERTAIN OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OFFER. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2010,

GOOGLE BEGAN SELLING ITS OWN BRANDED PHONE DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS VIA ITS WEB STORE. THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS SKYPE, ARE ALSO NOW OFFERING ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR MAKING WIRELESS VOICE CALLS THAT, IN CERTAIN CASES, CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF THE WIRELESS

PROVIDERS VOICE SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY.



NETWORK RELIABILITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE.

WE BELIEVE THAT A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE SERVICE

IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE U.S. MARKET AND A DRIVER OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. LOWER PRICES, IMPROVED SERVICE QUALITY AND NEW DATA SERVICE OFFERINGS HAVE LED TO INCREASED CUSTOMER USAGE OF WIRELESS SERVICES, WHICH IN TURN IMPACTS NETWORK

CAPACITY. IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY NEEDS AND OFFER HIGHLY RELIABLE NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR NETWORKS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE NATIONS MOST RELIABLE WIRELESS

VOICE AND DATA NETWORK. THIRD-PARTY STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 SHOW THAT, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, WE HAVE THE FEWEST DROPPED CALLS AND THE FEWEST INEFFECTIVE ATTEMPTS AMONG THE NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE 100 MOST

POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR NETWORK THROUGH THE BUILD-OUT OF OUR EXISTING SPECTRUM AND THE ACQUISITION OF NEW OPERATING MARKETS.



PRICING

. SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PRICING PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE WIRELESS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, AS EVIDENCED BY INCREASES IN THE

MARKETING OF MINUTES-SHARING PLANS, FREE MOBILE-TO-MOBILE CALLING, OFFERINGS OF LARGER BUNDLES OF INCLUDED MINUTES AT ATTRACTIVE PRICE POINTS WITH NO ROAMING OR LONG DISTANCE CHARGES, CALLING GROUP FEATURES THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO PLACE AND RECEIVE

CALLS FROM A GROUP OF U.S. PHONE NUMBERS THEY DESIGNATE (INCLUDING DOMESTIC LANDLINE NUMBERS) WITHOUT THE CALL TIME COUNTING AGAINST THEIR MINUTE ALLOTMENT, AND BOTH PREPAID AND POSTPAID PLANS OFFERING UNLIMITED VOICE AND DATA USAGE. WE SEEK TO

COMPETE IN THIS AREA BY OFFERING OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WILL REGARD AS THE BEST AVAILABLE VALUE FOR THE PRICE, AS WELL AS SERVICE PLANS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS FOR BOTH VOICE AND DATA SERVICES. IN JANUARY 2010, WE LAUNCHED A

STREAMLINED GROUP OF VOICE PLANS AND DATA PACKAGES, INCLUDING POSTPAID AND PREPAID PLANS WITH UNLIMITED MINUTES AND MESSAGING, WHICH PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH SIMPLIFIED PRICING OPTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SIMPLIFIED APPROACH WILL BE ATTRACTIVE

TO OUR CUSTOMERS, DRIVE GREATER ADOPTION OF DATA SERVICES AND RESULT IN EVEN HIGHER CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.



CUSTOMER SERVICE

. WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY FACTOR IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND IN ATTRACTING BOTH NEW-TO-WIRELESS

CUSTOMERS AND CUSTOMERS OF OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS. WE CONTINUALLY FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.



PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

. AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP AND WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS PROLIFERATE, CONTINUED CUSTOMER AND REVENUE GROWTH WILL

BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE DEVICES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND IN

COLLABORATION WITH APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS, AND TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS DISTINCTIVE WIRELESS DEVICES AND SERVICES THAT CAN ACCESS THE GROWING ARRAY OF DATA APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE OVER THE

INTERNET.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION.

KEY TO ACHIEVING SALES SUCCESS IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF SALES CHANNELS AND DISTRIBUTION

POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ATTAINING THE OPTIMAL MIX OF DIRECT, INDIRECT AND WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING PROFITABILITY, AS MEASURED BY OPERATING INCOME. WE ENDEAVOR TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR

COMPANY-OPERATED STORES, OUTSIDE SALES TEAMS AND TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF RETAIL OUTLETS AND PREPAID REPLENISHMENT LOCATIONS AND PORTABLE

COMPUTER ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE VARIOUS RESELLERS WHO BUY OUR SERVICE ON A WHOLESALE BASIS.

CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY AND COVERAGE OF THEIR NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND

RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW BUSINESS MODELS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, REGULATORY CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND

PRICING STRATEGIES OF COMPETITORS.

NETWORK

OUR NETWORK IS AMONG THE LARGEST IN THE U.S., WITH LICENSED AND OPERATIONAL COVERAGE IN ALL OF THE TOP 100 MOST POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. OUR NETWORK COVERS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY

290 MILLION AND PROVIDES SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE OF NEARLY 91.2 MILLION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

A KEY

PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST NETWORK RELIABILITY. WE ARE FOCUSED ON DESIGNING AND DEPLOYING OUR NETWORK IN A MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT ARE CONNECTED AND COMPLETED BY OUR CUSTOMERS ON THE

FIRST ATTEMPT. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT, EXPAND AND UPGRADE OUR NETWORK AND EXPLORE STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR NATIONAL NETWORK COVERAGE THROUGH SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS OF WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND SPECTRUM LICENSES.

OUR PRIMARY NETWORK TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS CDMA, BASED ON SPREAD-SPECTRUM DIGITAL RADIO TECHNOLOGY. CDMA-1XRTT TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED IN

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR CELL SITES IN OUR CDMA NETWORK. IN ADDITION, EV-DO, A THIRD-GENERATION PACKET-BASED TECHNOLOGY INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR HIGH-SPEED DATA TRANSMISSION, IS DEPLOYED IN APPROXIMATELY 94% OF THE CELL SITES IN OUR CDMA NETWORK, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009. ADDITIONAL EV-DO DEPLOYMENT IS ONGOING, AS IS THE INTEGRATION OF THE ALLTEL PORTION OF OUR NETWORK. WE ALSO PROVIDE GSM SERVICE AND FULFILL GSM ROAMING OBLIGATIONS IN CERTAIN MARKETS AS A RESULT OF OUR PURCHASES OF RURAL

CELLULAR CORPORATION AND ALLTEL.

OUR NETWORK INCLUDES VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF REDUNDANCY DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY OF

OUR SERVICE. POWER AND TRANSPORT FACILITIES CAN OFTEN BECOME A NETWORKS VULNERABILITY. CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE BATTERY BACKUP AT EVERY SWITCH AND VIRTUALLY EVERY CELL SITE IN OUR NETWORK. WE ALSO UTILIZE BACKUP GENERATORS AT A MAJORITY OF OUR

CELL SITES AND AT EVERY SWITCH LOCATION. WE FURTHER ENSURE RELIABILITY BY PROVIDING SECONDARY TRANSPORT FACILITIES FOR CRITICAL LINKS IN THE NETWORK.

COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE CHOSEN GSM OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AS THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS FOR THEIR 3G NETWORKS. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR 3G CDMA TECHNOLOGY OFFERS MANY ADVANTAGES COMPARED TO

GSM, SUCH AS MORE EFFICIENT SPECTRUM USAGE AND LOWER OVERALL OPERATING COSTS, GSM SUBSTANTIALLY LEADS IN WORLDWIDE MARKET SHARE, AFFORDING ITS USERS CERTAIN SCALE ADVANTAGES.

IN 2009, WE CONTINUED TO DEVELOP OUR FOURTH GENERATION (4G) WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK USING LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) TECHNOLOGY. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY FOLLOWS GSMS

EVOLUTIONARY PATH BUT IS DIFFERENT FROM, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT UPON, THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF BOTH GSM AND CDMA-BASED DIGITAL RADIO TECHNOLOGIES. LTE NETWORKS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HIGHER THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVED

EFFICIENCIES FOR 4G WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES. WE PLAN TO LAUNCH OUR LTE NETWORK IN 25 TO 30 MARKETS IN 2010, AND TO COVER VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR CURRENT 3G NETWORK FOOTPRINT BY THE END OF 2013. MANY OTHER MAJOR WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, BOTH

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN, HAVE ALSO SELECTED LTE AS THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR 4G DEPLOYMENTS AND, IN DECEMBER 2009, ONE SUCH PROVIDER, TELIASONERA, LAUNCHED COMMERCIAL LTE SERVICE IN NORWAY AND SWEDEN. WE BELIEVE THAT LTE WILL PROVIDE US WITH THE

OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT AN ACCESS PLATFORM WITH GLOBAL SCALE.

CONCURRENT WITH ONGOING LTE STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT, WE ARE

PRESENTLY CONDUCTING TESTS OF LTE TECHNOLOGY WITH VENDORS. THESE TESTS ARE BEING CONDUCTED AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN FEBRUARY 2009, WE SELECTED ERICSSON AND ALCATEL-LUCENT AS PRIMARY NETWORK VENDORS FOR OUR INITIAL LTE NETWORK

DEPLOYMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE CONTINUE TO CONDUCT VALIDATION TESTING IN CONJUNCTION WITH INITIAL COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS. WE EXPECT THAT TECHNOLOGY TESTING AND ASSESSMENTS WILL CONTINUE AS THE LTE TECHNOLOGY AND STANDARDS ARE ADVANCED.

WE HAVE ALSO CREATED THE VERIZON WIRELESS LTE INNOVATION CENTER, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL SERVE AS A CATALYST FOR THE EARLY

DEVELOPMENT OF NON-TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS FOR USE ON LTE NETWORKS. THE CENTER WILL WORK WITH SEVERAL OF OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HELP THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY QUICKLY BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

OPEN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

AS PART OF OUR OPEN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM INTENDED TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO USE, ON OUR NETWORK, DEVICES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS THAT WE DO NOT SELL, IN 2008, WE PUBLISHED THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE STANDARDS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT

COMMUNITY IS USING IN ORDER TO DESIGN SUCH DEVICES. IN AUGUST 2009, WE PUBLISHED UPDATED STANDARDS THAT DEVELOPERS WILL NEED TO DESIGN SUCH DEVICES THAT CAN RUN ON THE LTE NETWORK THAT WE PLAN TO LAUNCH IN 25 TO 30 MARKETS IN 2010. IN ADDITION, WE

HAVE CERTIFIED THREE INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES TO PERFORM TESTING OF THIRD-PARTY DEVICES TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONFORM TO OUR TECHNICAL INTERFACE STANDARDS IN ORDER TO OPERATE ON OUR NETWORK.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPEN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WILL SPUR INNOVATION, EXPAND CUSTOMER CHOICES AND PRODUCE AN ARRAY OF NEW PRODUCTS FOR USE ON OUR NETWORK AND, AS A RESULT, INCREASE

CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS TO OUR NETWORK. SINCE JULY 2008, WE HAVE CERTIFIED NUMEROUS THIRD-PARTY DEVICES TO RUN ON OUR NETWORK.

ADDITIONALLY, IN AUGUST 2009, WE CONSUMMATED THE FORMATION OF A JOINT VENTURE COMPANY, NPHASE, WHICH WE OWN EQUALLY WITH QUALCOMM INCORPORATED (QUALCOMM). NPHASE IS EXPECTED TO FACILITATE OUR PROVISION OF MACHINE-TO-MACHINE WIRELESS

COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS TO A VARIETY OF VERTICAL MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING HEALTHCARE, MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES, DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SPECTRUM

WE HAVE LICENSES TO PROVIDE WIRELESS SERVICES ON PORTIONS OF THE 800 MHZ AND/OR 1800-1900 MHZ SPECTRUM BANDS IN AREAS WHERE APPROXIMATELY 99% OF THE ESTIMATED U.S. POPULATION RESIDE, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE OBTAINED OUR SPECTRUM ASSETS THROUGH FCC LOTTERIES, AUCTIONS AND ALLOTMENTS, AND ACQUISITIONS FROM AND EXCHANGES WITH PRIVATE PARTIES. IN PARTS OF THE U.S., WE ALSO HAVE LICENSES FOR AWS SPECTRUM IN SEGMENTS OF THE 1700

AND 2100 MHZ BANDS.

IN ADDITION, IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FCC GRANTED US 109 LICENSES FOR PORTIONS OF THE 700 MHZ BAND FOR

WHICH WE WERE THE WINNING BIDDER IN FCC AUCTION 73. CERTAIN OF THESE LICENSES CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE WIRELESS SERVICE COVERAGE TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE U.S. (EXCEPT ALASKA). THE SPECTRUM WE HOLD CAN BE USED FOR MOBILE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA

COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING TEXT AND MULTI-MEDIA MESSAGING, LOCATION BASED SERVICES, MACHINE-TO-MACHINE SERVICES AND BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS. WE PLAN TO USE THE AWS AND 700 MHZ SPECTRUM MAINLY FOR ADVANCED BROADBAND WIRELESS SERVICES

UTILIZING LTE TECHNOLOGY. WHEN COMBINED, THE VARIOUS BANDS DESCRIBED ABOVE GIVE US A NATIONAL AVERAGE SPECTRUM DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 88 MHZ, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF OUR MARKETS TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. WE CAN MEET SPECTRUM NEEDS BY ACQUIRING LICENSES OR LEASING SPECTRUM

FROM OTHER LICENSEES, OR BY ACQUIRING NEW SPECTRUM LICENSES IF AND WHEN OFFERED BY THE FCC IN FUTURE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS. THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW SPECTRUM FOR COMMERCIAL WIRELESS SERVICES AND THE POSSIBLE DATES OF FUTURE FCC SPECTRUM AUCTIONS ARE

UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME. AS WE AND COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SPECTRUM SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND HAVE SPECTRUM SURPLUSES IN OTHERS, WE HAVE AT TIMES ARRANGED SPECTRUM SWAPS, AND WE EXPECT TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE

THE BENEFICIAL TRADING OF SPECTRUM LICENSES IN ORDER TO MEET CERTAIN OF OUR CAPACITY AND EXPANSION NEEDS IN THE FUTURE, SUBJECT TO OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR THE TRANSFER OF SPECTRUM LICENSES IN EACH INSTANCE.

WIRELESS OFFERINGS

WE

BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE VALUE OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS TO CUSTOMERS WILL HELP US TO RETAIN OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS AND INCREASE CUSTOMER USAGE, ALL OF WHICH WILL, IN TURN DRIVE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH. IN

JANUARY 2010, WE LAUNCHED A STREAMLINED GROUP OF NEW VOICE PLANS, INCLUDING POSTPAID AND PREPAID PLANS WITH UNLIMITED MINUTES AND MESSAGING, WHICH PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH SIMPLIFIED PRICING OPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE THEY WILL FIND ATTRACTIVE. AS

PART OF THIS LAUNCH, WE ALSO INTRODUCED SIMPLIFIED TIERED DATA PACKAGES OF VARYING SIZES FOR OUR POSTPAID PLANS  UNLIMITED USAGE, REQUIRED FOR CUSTOMERS USING OUR 3G SMARTPHONES; A 25-MEGABYTE PACKAGE REQUIRED FOR USERS OF OUR 3G MULTIMEDIA

PHONES; AND USAGE ON A PAY-PER-MEGABYTE BASIS FOR USERS OF OUR SIMPLE FEATURE PHONES. BOTH OUR 3G MULTIMEDIA PHONE AND SIMPLE FEATURE PHONE USERS HAVE THE OPTION OF UPGRADING TO A HIGHER TIER DATA PACKAGE.

WE PURCHASE WIRELESS DEVICES AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS FROM A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS, WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR

PURCHASES MADE FROM LG ELECTRONICS, SAMSUNG, MOTOROLA, RIM, PALM, PCD, PANTECH, HTC AND NOKIA.

A KEY COMPONENT OF ALL

WIRELESS PHONES IS THE CHIPSET, WHICH CONTAINS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE PHONE. MOST OF OUR PHONE SUPPLIERS RELY ON QUALCOMM FOR MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLYING CDMA-1XRTT AND EV-DO CHIPSETS. WE DO, HOWEVER, SELL PHONES THAT INCLUDE CDMA-1XRTT

CHIPSETS MANUFACTURED BY VIA TELECOM, UNDER LICENSE FROM QUALCOMM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPONENTS COMMON TO WIRELESS PHONES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELECTRONIC COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS THAT WE DO NOT DEAL WITH DIRECTLY. WE DEPEND UPON

A NUMBER OF KEY SUPPLIERS AND, IF ANY OF THEM FAIL TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES OR MAINTAIN AND UPGRADE OUR NETWORK.

WE HAVE DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIPS WITH NEW BREED LOGISTICS, INC., AND COMMUNICATIONS TEST DESIGN, INC., FOR OUR PHONE AND OTHER PRODUCT WAREHOUSING, DISTRIBUTION AND DIRECT CUSTOMER FULFILLMENT. WE DO NOT

OWN A SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR PRIMARY CELL SITE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE VENDORS

ARE ALCATEL-LUCENT, WHICH PROVIDES MORE THAN HALF OF OUR CELL SITE EQUIPMENT, MOTOROLA AND TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET LM ERICSSON (ERICSSON), WHICH TOGETHER CURRENTLY PROVIDE NEARLY ALL OF OUR REMAINING CELL SITE EQUIPMENT. UNTIL NOVEMBER 2009, NORTEL

PROVIDED US WITH THE CELL SITE EQUIPMENT NOW PROVIDED BY ERICSSON. IN JANUARY 2009, NORTEL AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS BANKRUPTCY, IN NOVEMBER 2009 THE

NORTEL BUSINESS UNIT THAT SUPPLIES CDMA WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE TO US WAS SOLD TO ERICSSON. WE ALSO RELY UPON ALCATEL-LUCENT, MOTOROLA AND, AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED SALE, ERICSSON FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SWITCHING EQUIPMENT.

MARKETING

WE FOCUS OUR MARKETING STRATEGY ON OFFERING SOLUTIONS THAT ARE TARGETED TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR VARIOUS CUSTOMER MARKET SEGMENTS, SUCH AS YOUNG ADULTS, SENIORS, FAMILIES AND SMALL TO LARGE BUSINESSES; PROMOTING OUR BRAND; LEVERAGING OUR

EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; AND CROSS-MARKETING WITH VERIZONS OTHER BUSINESS UNITS AND VODAFONE.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

WE UTILIZE A MIX OF DIRECT, INDIRECT AND ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN ORDER TO INCREASE CUSTOMER GROWTH WHILE REDUCING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS.

OUR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL INCLUDES OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES, A CORE COMPONENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN

THAT CUSTOMERS THAT WE OBTAIN THROUGH THIS DIRECT CHANNEL ARE LESS LIKELY TO CANCEL THEIR SERVICE THAN THOSE WE OBTAIN THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE OPERATED APPROXIMATELY 2,300 COMPANY-OPERATED STORES AND KIOSKS. WE

WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ALL OF OUR STORES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE OPTIMALLY LOCATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR DISTRIBUTION OBJECTIVES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE CEASED OPERATING APPROXIMATELY 335 STORES LOCATED IN THE ALLTEL MARKETS THAT WE

ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DIVEST. CERTAIN OTHER STORES MAY BE TRANSITIONED TO LOCAL AGENTS FOR THEIR MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OUR DIRECT CHANNEL ALSO INCLUDES OUR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS A

TELEMARKETING SALES FORCE DEDICATED TO HANDLING INCOMING CALLS FROM CUSTOMERS. IN OCTOBER 2009, WE ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF A DEDICATED ORGANIZATION TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR LARGE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND OUR

GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS. THIS ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING TO THESE CUSTOMERS INTEGRATED, INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS TO MEET THEIR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. WE ALSO OFFER FULLY-AUTOMATED, END-TO-END WEB-BASED SALES OF WIRELESS PHONES,

ACCESSORIES AND SERVICE IN ALL OF OUR MARKETS.

OUR INDIRECT RETAIL CHANNEL CONSISTS OF AGENTS THAT SELL OUR POSTPAID AND/OR

PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT THEIR RETAIL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. IN ADDITION, NATIONAL RETAILERS, SUCH AS BEST BUY, WAL-MART, COSTCO AND TARGET, SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ALSO SELL WIRELESS

CAPACITY ON A WHOLESALE BASIS, WHICH INVOLVES THE SALE OF WHOLESALE ACCESS, MINUTES AND DATA SERVICES TO INDEPENDENT COMPANIES THAT RESELL WIRELESS SERVICES TO END-USERS. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW SUBSCRIBERS AND OUR REVENUE COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY OF OUR NATIONAL INDIRECT DISTRIBUTORS WERE TERMINATED OR IF THEY SHIFTED THE MIX OF THEIR BUSINESS TO FAVOR OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION

WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH QUALITY

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR BECAUSE IT INCREASES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND REDUCES CUSTOMER CHURN, THE RATE AT WHICH CUSTOMERS DISCONNECT INDIVIDUAL LINES OF SERVICE. THEREFORE, SATISFYING AND RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS IS CRITICAL TO

THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF OUR STRATEGY. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CONVENIENT AND EASY-TO-USE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IN

ORDER TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS AND MINIMIZE CHURN. THIRD-PARTY STUDIES CONDUCTED IN 2009 SHOW THAT WE PLACED HIGHEST IN OVERALL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AMONG THE NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

WHILE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE AVAILABLE DURING OUR NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS, WE ALSO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES AVAILABLE

24-HOURS-A-DAY, 7-DAYS-A-WEEK TO ASSIST WITH EMERGENCY AND TECHNICAL CUSTOMER ISSUES. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS CAN DO BUSINESS WITH US AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEAK WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE, THROUGH OUR ENHANCED SELF-SERVICE

APPLICATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE OUR INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEM, THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, AND VIA APPLICATIONS ACCESSIBLE FROM CUSTOMER HANDSETS.

UNDER OUR ENHANCED WORRY FREE GUARANTEE, A NATIONAL CUSTOMER RETENTION AND LOYALTY INITIATIVE, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH AN EXTENSIVE AND ADVANCED NETWORK, RESPONSIVE CUSTOMER

SERVICE WITH END-TO-END RESOLUTION, THE OPTION TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME TO ANY QUALIFYING WIRELESS SERVICE PLAN WITHOUT PAYING ANY ADDITIONAL FEES OR REQUIRING ANY CONTRACT EXTENSION, AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE THAT DECREASES AFTER EACH FULL MONTH THAT A

CUSTOMER REMAINS ON THEIR CONTRACT, AND A HANDSET UPGRADE CREDIT EVERY TWO YEARS, PROVIDED THAT THE CUSTOMER SIGNS A NEW TWO-YEAR CONTRACT FOR A CALLING PLAN WITH AT LEAST A $35 MONTHLY ACCESS CHARGE. IN ADDITION, OUR MY VERIZON ADVANTAGE PROGRAM

OFFERS EACH CUSTOMER WHO REGISTERS WITH OUR MY VERIZON WEBSITE FREE BACK-UP PROTECTION FOR THE CUSTOMERS PHONE CONTACT LIST, AN ANNUAL HANDSET UPGRADE OPTION FOR QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS AND PERIODIC NOTIFICATION IF THE CUSTOMER EXCEEDS HIS OR HER

PLAN ALLOWANCE. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT RETENTION AND LOYALTY PROGRAM IS THE CUSTOMER LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH WE CONTACT CUSTOMERS AT KEY TIMES DURING THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP ABOUT TARGETED OFFERS AND TO PROVIDE PROACTIVE RATE PLAN

ANALYSIS.

WIRELINE

BACKGROUND

THE WIRELINE SEGMENT PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT INCLUDE VOICE, INTERNET ACCESS, BROADBAND VIDEO AND

DATA, NEXT GENERATION IP NETWORK SERVICES, NETWORK ACCESS, LONG DISTANCE AND OTHER SERVICES. WE PROVIDE THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS TO CARRIERS, BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS BOTH IN THE U.S. AND IN 150

OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.

IN 2009, WE CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WIRELINE SEGMENT REPORTS OPERATING REVENUES TO

ALIGN OUR FINANCIAL PRESENTATION TO THE CONTINUED EVOLUTION OF THE WIRELINE BUSINESS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE FOUR REVENUE-PRODUCING LINES OF BUSINESS WITHIN THE WIRELINE SEGMENT: MASS MARKETS, GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, GLOBAL WHOLESALE AND OTHER. IN 2009,

WIRELINE REVENUES WERE $46,080 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 43% OF VERIZONS AGGREGATE REVENUES. OUR WIRELINE SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER.

ACCESS LINE SPIN-OFF

ON MAY 13, 2009, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SPIN OFF

A NEWLY FORMED SUBSIDIARY OF VERIZON (SPINCO) TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. SPINCO WILL HOLD DEFINED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE LOCAL EXCHANGE BUSINESS AND RELATED LANDLINE ACTIVITIES OF VERIZON IN ARIZONA, IDAHO, ILLINOIS, INDIANA, MICHIGAN, NEVADA,

NORTH CAROLINA, OHIO, OREGON, SOUTH CAROLINA, WASHINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA AND WISCONSIN, AND IN PORTIONS OF CALIFORNIA BORDERING ARIZONA, NEVADA AND OREGON, INCLUDING INTERNET ACCESS AND LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND BROADBAND VIDEO PROVIDED TO

DESIGNATED CUSTOMERS IN THOSE AREAS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SPIN-OFF, SPINCO PLANS TO MERGE WITH FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (FRONTIER) PURSUANT TO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH FRONTIER, AND FRONTIER WILL BE THE SURVIVING

CORPORATION. THE TRANSACTIONS DO NOT INVOLVE ANY ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF VERIZON WIRELESS. THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN FRONTIER ACQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 4 MILLION ACCESS LINES AND CERTAIN RELATED BUSINESSES FROM VERIZON, WHICH

COLLECTIVELY GENERATED ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION FOR VERIZON'S WIRELINE SEGMENT.

DEPENDING ON THE TRADING

PRICES OF FRONTIER COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, VERIZON STOCKHOLDERS WILL COLLECTIVELY OWN BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 66% AND 71% OF FRONTIERS OUTSTANDING EQUITY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, AND FRONTIER

STOCKHOLDERS WILL COLLECTIVELY OWN BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 29% AND 34% OF FRONTIERS OUTSTANDING EQUITY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER (IN EACH CASE, BEFORE ANY CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS). THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK TO BE ISSUED BY FRONTIER IN THE MERGER WILL BE CALCULATED BASED UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF FRONTIER COMMON STOCK DURING A PRE-CLOSING MEASURING PERIOD (SUBJECT TO A COLLAR) AND OTHER CLOSING

ADJUSTMENTS. VERIZON WILL NOT OWN ANY SHARES OF FRONTIER AFTER THE MERGER.

BOTH THE SPIN-OFF AND MERGER ARE EXPECTED TO

QUALIFY AS TAX-FREE TRANSACTIONS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT CASH IS PAID TO VERIZON STOCKHOLDERS IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPIN-OFF, VERIZON EXPECTS TO RECEIVE FROM SPINCO APPROXIMATELY $3.3 BILLION IN VALUE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF A SPECIAL CASH PAYMENT TO VERIZON, A REDUCTION IN VERIZONS CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS, AND, IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ISSUANCE TO VERIZON OF DEBT SECURITIES OF SPINCO. IN THE MERGER, VERIZON STOCKHOLDERS ARE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION OF FRONTIER COMMON STOCK, ASSUMING THE AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF FRONTIER COMMON STOCK

DURING THE PRE-CLOSING MEASURING PERIOD IS WITHIN THE COLLAR AND NO CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS.

THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO THE

SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING RECEIPT OF STATE AND FEDERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY APPROVALS. IF THE CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED, WE EXPECT THIS TRANSACTION TO CLOSE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010.

OPERATIONS

MASS MARKETS

MASS MARKETS OPERATIONS PROVIDE LOCAL EXCHANGE (BASIC SERVICE AND END-USER ACCESS), LONG DISTANCE (INCLUDING REGIONAL TOLL), BROADBAND

SERVICES (INCLUDING HIGH-SPEED INTERNET AND FIOS INTERNET) AND FIOS TV SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL BUSINESS SUBSCRIBERS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DIRECTV, VERIZON ALSO OFFERS SATELLITE TELEVISION SERVICE TO ENABLE DOUBLE- AND TRIPLE-PLAY OFFERS IN

NON-FIOS MARKETS. IN 2009, MASS MARKETS REVENUES WERE $19,755 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 43% OF WIRELINES AGGREGATE REVENUES.

TO DIFFERENTIATE THE FIOS PLATFORM FROM ITS COMPETITORS, INITIATIVES ARE UNDER WAY TO LEVERAGE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER VIDEO APPLICATIONS, WIDGETS, AND INTERACTIVITY WITH TELEVISION,

INCLUDING ACCESS TO SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES, AND ACCESS TO INTERNET VIDEO SITES.

GLOBAL ENTERPRISE

GLOBAL ENTERPRISE OFFERS VOICE, DATA AND INTERNET

COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATIONS, AND STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. WE OFFER COMMUNICATIONS AND IT SOLUTIONS, COMBINING PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE WITH EXTENSIVE IP NETWORKS TO DELIVER

COMMUNICATIONS, IT, INFORMATION SECURITY AND NETWORK SOLUTIONS. WE SECURELY CONNECT TODAY'S EXTENDED ENTERPRISES WITH THEIR WIDE-SPREAD CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND HIGHLY MOBILE EMPLOYEESENABLING THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY,

EFFICIENCY AND THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL VOICE AND DATA SERVICES, GLOBAL ENTERPRISE OFFERS MANAGED AND ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR STRATEGIC SERVICES. THIS ENCOMPASSES OUR FOCUS AREAS OF

GROWTH, INCLUDING IP SERVICES AND VALUE-ADDED SOLUTIONS THAT MAKE COMMUNICATIONS MORE SECURE, RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT. GLOBAL ENTERPRISE ALSO PROVIDES MANAGED NETWORK SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS THAT OUTSOURCE ALL OR PORTIONS OF THEIR COMMUNICATIONS AND

INFORMATION PROCESSING OPERATIONS AND DATA SERVICES SUCH AS PRIVATE IP, PRIVATE LINE, FRAME RELAY AND ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE (ATM) SERVICES, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. OVER 80% OF OUR FRAME RELAY CUSTOMERS HAVE CONVERTED TO PRIVATE

IP. CUSTOMERS CAN NOW CHOOSE AN ON-DEMAND CONSUMPTION MODEL FOR THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE RATHER THAN INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING DEDICATED ENVIRONMENTS. IN ADDITION, GLOBAL ENTERPRISE OFFERS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES IN MORE THAN 30 COUNTRIES

AROUND THE WORLD, SUPPORTING A RANGE OF SOLUTIONS INCLUDING NETWORK SERVICES, MANAGING A MOVE TO IP-BASED UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AND PROVIDING APPLICATION PERFORMANCE SUPPORT. IN 2009, GLOBAL ENTERPRISE REVENUES WERE $14,988 MILLION, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 32% OF WIRELINES AGGREGATE REVENUES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL WHOLESALE

GLOBAL WHOLESALE OFFERS SWITCHED ACCESS AND SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES PRIMARILY TO LONG DISTANCE AND OTHER CARRIERS WHO USE OUR FACILITIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. SWITCHED ACCESS REVENUES

ARE GENERATED FROM FIXED AND USAGE-BASED CHARGES PAID BY CARRIERS FOR ACCESS TO OUR LOCAL NETWORK, INTEREXCHANGE WHOLESALE TRAFFIC SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY DESTINED TRAFFIC THAT ORIGINATES IN THE U.S. SPECIAL ACCESS

REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM CARRIERS THAT BUY DEDICATED LOCAL EXCHANGE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THEIR PRIVATE NETWORKS. GLOBAL WHOLESALE SERVICES ALSO INCLUDE LOCAL WHOLESALE REVENUES FROM UNBUNDLED NETWORK ELEMENTS AND INTERCONNECTION REVENUES FROM

COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS AND WIRELESS CARRIERS. A PORTION OF GLOBAL WHOLESALE REVENUES IS GENERATED BY A FEW LARGE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES, MANY OF WHOM COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH US. IN 2009, GLOBAL WHOLESALE REVENUES WERE $9,637 MILLION,

REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 21% OF WIRELINES AGGREGATE REVENUES. MAJOR INITIATIVES THAT ARE UNDER WAY, SUCH AS FIBER-TO-THE-CELL SITES, GLOBAL DATA GROWTH, AN INCREASED FOCUS ON HIGH-YIELD INTERNATIONAL VOICE ROUTES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

SEGMENTS, WILL FURTHER DIFFERENTIATE GLOBAL WHOLESALE FROM ITS COMPETITORS.

AS CONSUMER DEMAND FOR SMARTPHONES AND BANDWIDTH

INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS GROW, WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE LOOKING FOR NETWORK SOLUTIONS TO CARRY INCREASING VOLUMES OF TRAFFIC. OUR SERVICE ALLOWS VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED CAPACITY AND ENABLES WIRELESS CARRIERS TO OFFER NEXT GENERATION APPLICATIONS TO THEIR

CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED MORE THAN 2,300 CELL SITES IN 2009 WITH FIBER ETHERNET SERVICE ACROSS MOST CARRIERS AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO FULLY SUPPORT VERIZON WIRELESS LTE LAUNCH IN 2010.

GLOBAL WHOLESALE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO CAPITALIZE ON VOICE TRAFFIC GROWTH TO HIGH-YIELD DESTINATIONS WHERE WE HAVE VOLUME (MINUTES) GOING TO

KEY DESTINATIONS AROUND THE GLOBE. NEW OPPORTUNITIES ARE BEING DRIVEN BY MACHINE-TO-MACHINE APPLICATIONS, MANAGED SERVICES, AND DIGITAL CONTENT WHICH PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND REPRESENT THE LARGEST GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. GLOBAL

WHOLESALES INITIATIVES ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING VALUE AND TARGETING THESE GROWTH SERVICES.

OTHER

OTHER SERVICES INCLUDE SUCH SERVICES AS LOCAL EXCHANGE AND LONG DISTANCE SERVICES FROM FORMER MCI MASS MARKET CUSTOMERS, OPERATOR SERVICES,

PAY PHONE, CARD SERVICES AND SUPPLY SALES, AS WELL AS DIAL AROUND SERVICES INCLUDING 10-10-987, 10-10-220, 1-800-COLLECT AND PREPAID CARDS. IN 2009, OTHER REVENUES WERE $1,700 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 4% OF WIRELINES AGGREGATE

REVENUES.

COMPETITION

THE WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY FURTHER WITH TRADITIONAL, NON-TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING PLAYERS SEEKING INCREASED MARKET SHARE. CURRENT

AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, OTHER DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, SATELLITE TELEVISION COMPANIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES AND

MANAGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS. COMPANIES WITH A GLOBAL PRESENCE PROVIDE A THREAT TO THE WIRELINE SEGMENT. CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, GLOBAL WHOLESALE, LOOKING FOR REACH AND ACCESS AROUND THE WORLD, CAN

LOOK TO A HANDFUL OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT OPERATE GLOBALLY. THESE FULL (OR NEAR-FULL) SERVICE PROVIDERS SERVE AS COMPETITORS IN OUR EFFORTS TO WIN LARGE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED SERVICES TO GLOBAL

ENTERPRISES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION AND WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH.

IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE BUSINESS, THE CUSTOMERS NEED TO REDUCE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY COUPLED WITH THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY

TECHNOLOGY CONVERGENCE IS DRIVING THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, CARRIERS, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS.

SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN IT SERVICES ARE EITHER MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR FORGING NEW ALLIANCES TO BE BETTER POSITIONED FOR A REBOUND IN TECHNOLOGY SPENDING. MOST NEW ALLIANCES AND ACQUISITIONS HAVE

FOCUSED ON EMERGING FIELDS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, SOFTWARE DELIVERY, COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER COMPUTING TASKS VIA THE NETWORK RATHER THAN ON IN-HOUSE MACHINES. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO UTILIZED ACQUISITIONS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO

ENTERPRISE OUTSOURCING MARKETS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN THE WELL-DEFENDED TURF OF THE MAJOR IT OUTSOURCERS.

WE BELIEVE THAT CABLE

OPERATORS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO OUR WIRELINE BUSINESS. CABLE OPERATORS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE AND DIGITAL CAPACITY OF THEIR NETWORKS SO THAT THEY CAN OFFER DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO MARKET COMPETITIVE BUNDLED

OFFERINGS THAT INCLUDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS, DIGITAL TELEVISION AND VOICE SERVICES. SEVERAL MAJOR CABLE OPERATORS ALSO OFFER BUNDLES WITH WIRELESS SERVICES THROUGH STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS.

WIRELESS SUBSTITUTION IS AN ONGOING COMPETITIVE TREND, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE AS WIRELESS COMPANIES POSITION THEIR SERVICE AS A

LANDLINE ALTERNATIVE. WE ALSO FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (VOIP) SERVICES. THESE SERVICES USE THE INTERNET OR PRIVATE BROADBAND NETWORKS TO TRANSMIT VOICE COMMUNICATIONS. VOIP SERVICES ARE

AVAILABLE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COMPANIES INCLUDING CABLE COMPANIES, AND NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROVIDERS. INTERNET PORTAL PROVIDERS ARE ALSO ENTERING OUR COMPETITIVE SPACE.

AS A RESULT OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996, WHICH REQUIRES US TO ALLOW POTENTIAL COMPETITORS TO PURCHASE OUR SERVICES FOR RESALE, OR ACCESS COMPONENTS OF OUR NETWORK ON AN

UNBUNDLED BASIS AT A PRESCRIBED COST, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS AT SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS FROM THE PRICES

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE SCOPE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD AND THE RATES WE RECEIVE, ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REVIEW AND REVISION BY THE FCC AND STATE REGULATORS. SEE REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE

TRENDS IN THE 2009 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

GLOBAL WHOLESALE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL CARRIERS FOR

LONG-HAUL, VOICE AND IP SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, MOBILE VIDEO AND DATA NEEDS ARE DRIVING A GREATER NEED FOR WIRELESS BACKHAUL. NETWORK PROVIDERS, CABLE COMPANIES AND NICHE PLAYERS ARE COMPETITORS FOR THIS NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITY.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARRIERS CONTINUE TO STRATEGICALLY INVEST CAPITAL TO BUILD THEIR NETWORKS FURTHER INTO OUR

FRANCHISE MARKETS. CONSOLIDATION CONTINUES TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES  IT HAS HELPED TO STRENGTHEN THE WHOLESALE MARKET BY DECREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS AND CONTRIBUTING TO PRICE STABILIZATION. THE LANDSCAPE FOR WHOLESALE SERVICES IS ALSO

CONSTANTLY CHANGING, AND IS DRIVING NEW REQUIREMENTS, AND THE NATURE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS CAN QUICKLY MOVE FROM A RETAIL MODEL TO A WHOLESALE MODEL.

WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND TRENDS IN THE WIRELINE INDUSTRY.



CUSTOMER SERVICE

: CUSTOMERS EXPECT INDUSTRY LEADING SERVICE FROM THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES EVOLVE, THE

REQUIREMENT OF THE CARRIER TO EXCEL IN THIS AREA IS CRUCIAL FOR CUSTOMER RETENTION. PROVIDING EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS BUILDS INTEGRITY IN VERIZON ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE. RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE THIS THROUGH OUR SERVICE

REPRESENTATIVES AND ONLINE SUPPORT, RECENTLY RECOGNIZED AS INDUSTRY LEADING BY AN INDEPENDENT SURVEY ORGANIZATION. OUR AWARD-WINNING VERIZON ENTERPRISE CENTER PROVIDES OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS WITH READY ACCESS TO THEIR SYSTEM AND PERFORMANCE

INFORMATION. PROACTIVE TESTING OF THE NETWORK HELPS IDENTIFY MINOR ISSUES BEFORE THEY BECOME SIGNIFICANT, ALLOWING US TO FIX THEM BEFORE THE CUSTOMER EVEN NOTICES. WE EXPECT THAT OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL BE A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE

ENTERPRISE BUSINESS. IN A 2009 ANNUAL STUDY, J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES DETERMINED THAT VERIZON IS THE TOP PERFORMER IN OVERALL SATISFACTION IN THE LARGE ENTERPRISE SEGMENT. IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS, SERVICE IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH

CONTINUED SYSTEM AUTOMATION INITIATIVES. OUR ONLINE TOOLS ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO INTERFACE WITH THEIR PROVISIONING AND MAINTENANCE TRANSACTIONS ELECTRONICALLY, IMPROVING SELF-SERVICE AND FURTHER DIFFERENTIATING US FROM OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS.



NETWORK RELIABILITY AND BANDWIDTH (SPEED).

AS BOTH CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS LOOK TO LEVERAGE HIGH SPEED CONNECTIONS FOR

ENTERTAINMENT, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PRODUCTIVITY, WE EXPECT BROADBAND PENETRATION WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS ONLINE AND ONLINE-ENABLED ACTIVITIES INCREASE, SO WILL BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, BOTH DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM.

TO SUCCEED, WE AND OTHER NETWORK-BASED PROVIDERS MUST ENSURE THAT OUR NETWORKS CAN DELIVER AGAINST THESE INCREASING BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD OUT OUR NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO MEET THIS FUTURE DEMAND.



PRICING

: CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS USE PRICING TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE FROM INCUMBENTS. PRICING

IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT AS NON-TRADITIONAL MODES OF PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES EMERGE AND NEW ENTRANTS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, PORTAL-BASED AND VOIP CALLING IS FREE OR NEARLY FREE TO CUSTOMERS AND IS OFTEN SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISING

REVENUES.



PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION

: AS A RESULT OF PRICING PRESSURES, PROVIDERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCTS. CUSTOMERS ARE SHIFTING FROM AN

ACCESS TO AN APPLICATIONS MINDSET AND ARE FOCUSED ON HOW THEY CAN LEVERAGE THEIR BROADBAND AND VIDEO CONNECTIONS. CONVERGED FEATURES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED WIRELESS AND WIRELINE FUNCTIONALITY, ARE BECOMING SIMILARLY IMPORTANT, ENABLED BY BOTH CUSTOMER

DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

NETWORK

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY IS TO BE THE PREMIER BROADBAND AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE MASS MARKET. NETWORK RELIABILITY IS ALSO A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. WE

ARE EXECUTING ON THIS STRATEGY BY DEPLOYING FIBER-TO-THE-PREMISE (FTTP) ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES OVER FIBER OPTIC CABLES. FTTP PROVIDES THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE BANDWIDTH TO THE CUSTOMER PREMISE, BASED ON CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND ALLOWS US THE FLEXIBILITY TO

ADAPT OUR FACILITIES MORE EASILY TO FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. NEW OPTICAL TERMINALS CAN BE ADDED TO THE FTTP NETWORK, PROVIDING GREATER BANDWIDTH AND NEW SERVICES WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FIELD CONSTRUCTION. AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR DEPLOYMENT

OF THE MOST ADVANCED FIBER OPTIC NETWORK WE ARE ENHANCING IT WITH GIGABIT PASSIVE OPTICAL NETWORK (GPON) TECHNOLOGY. GPON TECHNOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE SERVICES WE OFFER TODAY, WHILE ALLOWING FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES THROUGH

IMPROVED DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM CAPACITY.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EVOLUTION OF OUR ACCESS PLANT, WE ARE ALSO TRANSITIONING

OUR METRO (LOCAL) NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE FROM TRADITIONAL TIME DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (TDM)/SONET (SYNCHRONOUS OPTICAL NETWORK)/ATM TECHNOLOGIES TO ETHERNET OVER DENSE WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (DWDM). IN 2009 WE CONTINUED TO DEPLOY

RECONFIGURABLE OPTIC ADD DROP MULTIPLEXER (ROADM) NODES IN THE TRANSPORT NETWORK. AS A RESULT, THE NEW OPTICAL TRANSPORT NETWORK PROVIDES FEATURES OPTIMIZED FOR VIDEO DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND HIGH SPEED DATA SERVICES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE LEVEL OF

NETWORK RELIABILITY ACHIEVED WITH SONET.

TO FULLY LEVERAGE THIS NEW NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALLOW FOR THE MORE EFFICIENT

SHARING OF OUR NETWORK ACROSS SERVICES, WE ARE UPGRADING OUR MULTIPLEXING AND ROUTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO USE IP, ETHERNET AND MPLS (MULTI PROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING) TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE MIGRATING FROM TRADITIONAL TDM-BASED VOICE SWITCHING

TO VOIP. THIS MIGRATION LOWERS THE COST OF CURRENT DATA AND VOICE SERVICES AND CREATES A NETWORK WHICH CAN OFFER FUTURE MULTI-MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY ADDING SERVICE PLATFORMS WITHOUT REQUIRING WIDESPREAD NETWORK UPGRADES. IN KEEPING WITH

OUR STRATEGY OF LEADING IN NETWORK RELIABILITY, OUR SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE UTILIZES OUR MANAGED QUALITY OF SERVICE-ENABLED RESILIENT IP NETWORK RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC INTERNET.

WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON GROWING OUR ETHERNET INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE FULL RANGE OF ETHERNET PRIVATE LINE AND E-LAN SERVICES LOCALLY, DOMESTICALLY AND GLOBALLY. TO LOWER THE

ACCESS COST AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT SERVICE FLEXIBILITY, WE ARE USING A CONVERGED PACKET ACCESS STRATEGY THAT REPLACES THE PRIVATE CIRCUIT-BASED CUSTOMER ACCESS AND AGGREGATES TRAFFIC FROM MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS ONTO A SHARED ETHERNET AND MPLS NETWORK.

WE HAVE ALSO FOCUSED ON THE EXPANSION OF THE PRIVATE IP NETWORK (PIP) TO SERVE ALL KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WITH MANAGED QUALITY OF SERVICE-AWARE IP VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (VPN) SERVICES. OUR PUBLIC IP NETWORK IS NOW INTERCONNECTED TO PIP THROUGH

SECURITY GATEWAY PLATFORMS THAT ALLOW BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO EXTEND THE REACH OF THEIR PRIVATE VIRTUAL NETWORKS TO OFF-NET SITES, SUCH AS EMPLOYEES HOMES, SMALL BRANCH OFFICES AND MOBILE WORK FORCES. THESE ENHANCEMENTS EXTEND OUR IP

SERVICES REACH ACROSS THE GLOBE.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EMERGING OPTICAL TRANSPORT TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPANSION OF OUR NETWORK

TO LOWER OVERALL COST. WE ARE INTEGRATING ETHERNET, SONET AND OPTICS, AND ULTRA-LONG-HAUL TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE DEPLOYED A NEW, NEXT GENERATION UNDERSEA CABLE TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE TRANS-PACIFIC EXPRESS (TPE) CONNECTING THE WEST COAST

OF THE U.S. TO CHINA, KOREA AND TAIWAN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CONTINUE TO WIDEN AND DEEPEN OUR GLOBAL SCOPE AND CAPABILITIES. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR

VIRTUAL PRIVATE LAN SERVICE TO EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC, AND ADDITIONAL NORTH AMERICAN LOCATIONS. WE ALSO DEPLOYED THE INDUSTRYS FIRST COMMERCIAL 100G (GIGABITS PER SECOND) ULTRA-LONG-HAUL OPTICAL SYSTEM FOR LIVE TRAFFIC ON OUR EUROPEAN OPTICAL

CORE NETWORK; ADDED A JAPAN LANDING TO OUR TPE SUBMARINE CABLE SYSTEM; AND INSTALLED 106 PRIVATE IP EDGE ROUTERS FOR A TOTAL OF 753 EDGE ROUTERS IN 212 SITES IN 59 COUNTRIES.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK

FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT

FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AND FROM EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNFAVORABLE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS A RECESSION OR ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. OR IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR OTHER MAJOR MARKETS,

COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE AFFORDABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMERS MAY SEEK TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BY FORGOING PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, ELECTING TO USE FEWER HIGHER

MARGIN SERVICES OR OBTAINING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER LOWER-COST PROGRAMS OFFERED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SIMILARLY, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD MAY DELAY PURCHASING DECISIONS, DELAY FULL

IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE OFFERINGS OR REDUCE THEIR USE OF SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF OUR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR SERVICES. IF THESE EVENTS WERE TO OCCUR,

IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION THAT MAY REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND

LOWER OUR PROFITS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES

AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED THE TRADITIONAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, WIRELESS, CABLE AND INTERNET COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND BROUGHT NEW COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION AND DEVICE PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES HAVE ENABLED US TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO

BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NETWORK QUALITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE, THE PRICING OF OUR SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT, THE QUALITY OF OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE,

OUR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE REACH AND QUALITY OF OUR SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES. IT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING OUR

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO MORE REGULATION AND HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES THAN MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS, DUE IN PART TO THE

PRESENCE OF A UNIONIZED WORKFORCE AND A LARGE RETIREE POPULATION IN OUR WIRELINE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE WORKFORCE OF OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY NON-UNION, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS UNIONS MAY HAVE IN ORGANIZING

THIS WORKFORCE OR THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH LABOR ORGANIZING ON OUR COSTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO PROFITABLY OFFER SERVICES AT LOWER PRICES. THE RESULTING PRESSURE ON THE PRICE OF SERVICES WE PROVIDE MAY RESULT IN

REDUCED REVENUES AND PROFITS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ON A

TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN A DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES OR MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.

OUR INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING RAPID CHANGE AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN ORDER TO GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO FUTURE CHANGES IN

TECHNOLOGY, TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET FUTURE ADVANCES IN COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, WE COULD LOSE

CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES IN OUR INDUSTRY REQUIRES US TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THE VARIED AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING DEMANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT TECHNOLOGICAL

TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS TO OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES. IF THESE SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SELECTED LONG TERM EVOLUTION TECHNOLOGY (LTE) AS OUR NEXT-GENERATION WIRELESS NETWORK ACCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE EXPECT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE US TO OFFER A MOBILE DATA

NETWORK WITH HIGHER SPEEDS AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES. OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR PLANS TO ADOPT LTE AS THEIR NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGY, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BECOME THE PRINCIPAL NEXT-GENERATION GLOBAL STANDARD.

THERE ARE RISKS, HOWEVER, THAT THESE OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY DELAY THEIR DEPLOYMENT OF LTE OR CHANGE THEIR SELECTION AND ADOPT DIFFERENT NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH OURS. AS A RESULT,

LTE MAY NOT BECOME THE PRINCIPAL NEXT-GENERATION GLOBAL STANDARD AND MAY NOT PROVIDE US WITH THE GLOBAL SCALE, COMPATIBILITY AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT WE EXPECT IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO DEPLOY LTE ON OUR NETWORK

SUCCESSFULLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT OUR SUPPLIERS MAY BE UNABLE TO MANUFACTURE AND DELIVER LTE DEVICES AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT ON SCHEDULE AND ACCORDING TO OUR

SPECIFICATIONS. FURTHERMORE, OUR DEPLOYMENT OF LTE MAY NOT OCCUR, OR OCCUR AT THE COST WE HAVE ESTIMATED. IF THESE RISKS MATERIALIZE, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE NEXT GENERATION WIRELESS SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, AND TO

MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR CUSTOMER REVENUES COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE DEPEND ON KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE

EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE DEPEND UPON VARIOUS KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE US WITH THE

EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. IF THESE SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS FAIL TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE TO US ON A TIMELY BASIS OR FAIL TO MEET OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN A

COMPETITIVE MANNER OR CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE OUR NETWORKS. BECAUSE OF THE COSTS AND TIME LAGS THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING FROM ONE SUPPLIER TO ANOTHER, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISRUPTED IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO, OR

CHOSE TO, REPLACE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR SUPPLIERS WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, ESPECIALLY IF THE REPLACEMENT BECAME NECESSARY ON SHORT NOTICE. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, DECREASE OUR

OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ON WHICH WE RELY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO

TECHNOLOGY ON WHICH WE DEPEND, INCLUDING LITIGATION INVOLVING CLAIMS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT. SUCH CLAIMS HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY IN THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER OUR BUSINESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH LITIGATION.

WE EXPECT OUR DEPENDENCE ON KEY SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUE AS WE DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE MORE ADVANCED GENERATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY.

CHANGES IN THE

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR

DOMESTIC OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FCC AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE REGULATED BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE REGULATORY REGIMES FREQUENTLY

RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN OR PROVIDE SPECIFIED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN DESIGNATED AREAS, REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN LICENSES FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STANDARDS. WE ARE FREQUENTLY INVOLVED IN

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR PROVISION OF RETAIL OR WHOLESALE SERVICES, OR THE

REVIEWS BY FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF REGULATORY RULINGS. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, WE CANNOT

GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AT OBTAINING THE LICENSES WE NEED TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR IN MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING LICENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FCC GRANTS WIRELESS LICENSES FOR TERMS GENERALLY LASTING 10 YEARS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

RENEWAL. THE LOSS OF, OR A MATERIAL LIMITATION ON, CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PLANS. NEW REGULATIONS

COULD RESTRICT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN MANAGE OUR WIRELINE AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS, IMPAIR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, AND POTENTIALLY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO US AND OUR

CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS INTERNET PROTOCOL-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING VOIP AND SUPER HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND AND VIDEO, COULD BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING REGULATION BETWEEN THE FCC AND VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL

AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE FCC HAS SEVERAL PROCEEDINGS PENDING THAT ARE CONSIDERING THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON

WIRELINE AND WIRELESS SERVICES. FOR INSTANCE, ON OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE FCC INITIATED A PROCEEDING IN WHICH IT PROPOSES TO ADOPT SO-CALLED NET NEUTRALITY RULES THAT IT DESCRIBES AS INTENDED TO PRESERVE THE OPENNESS OF THE INTERNET.

THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD LIMIT THE WAYS THAT A BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDER COULD MANAGE ITS NETWORK AND THE SERVICES IT COULD PROVIDE OVER THE NETWORK. THESE RESTRICTIONS WOULD INCLUDE LIMITATIONS RELATED TO DEVICES THAT COULD CONNECT

TO THE NETWORK, SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS PROVIDED OVER THE NETWORK AND PRIORITY OF TRAFFIC MOVING OVER THE NETWORK. THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD APPLY TO ALL PROVIDERS OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES, WHETHER WIRELINE OR WIRELESS, BUT WOULD NOT

APPLY TO PROVIDERS OF APPLICATIONS, CONTENT OR OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING MANY COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE. IF FINAL RULES ARE ADOPTED THAT LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING OUR BROADBAND NETWORKS AND DELIVERING BROADBAND

SERVICES, THESE RULES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BROADBAND BUSINESS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND LIMIT THE RETURN WE CAN EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ON PAST AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR BROADBAND NETWORKS.

INCREASES IN COSTS FOR PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING

COMMITMENTS.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 222,900 EMPLOYEES AND APPROXIMATELY 213,000 RETIREES PARTICIPATING IN VERIZONS

BENEFIT PLANS, THE COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR COSTS OF MAINTAINING THESE PLANS, AND THE FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE PLANS, ARE AFFECTED BY

SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS, DECREASES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS ON FUNDS HELD BY OUR PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS AND CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES. IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BENEFIT PLANS, THOSE COSTS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CONSIDERING VARIOUS PROPOSALS FOR LEGISLATION TO REFORM

THE U.S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THERE ARE ALSO VARIOUS HEALTHCARE REFORM PROPOSALS BEING CONSIDERED AT THE STATE LEVEL. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHICH HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES, IF ANY, WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE FEDERAL OR

STATE LEVEL, SUCH REGULATION MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORIST

ACTS, ACTS OF WAR, CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER BREACHES OF NETWORK OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY MAY CAUSE EQUIPMENT FAILURES OR DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF THESE EVENTS, THE

POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. OUR INABILITY TO OPERATE OUR WIRELINE OR WIRELESS NETWORKS AS A RESULT OF SUCH EVENTS, EVEN FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME, MAY RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND/OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE TO OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS AND

THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING.

WE REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE FUND OUR

CAPITAL NEEDS IN PART THROUGH BORROWINGS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CREDIT MARKETS. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN

FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON OUR PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CUSTOMARY CREDIT

METRICS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. A SEVERE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF RECENT YEARS COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND SUCH INSTABILITY COULD AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES

OR SETTLEMENTS.

OUR BUSINESS FACES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FROM TIME TO TIME, PATENT INFRINGEMENT

LAWSUITS, ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS, WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTIONS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO OUR ADVERTISING, SALES, BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS ALSO FACES PERSONAL INJURY AND CONSUMER

CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATING TO ALLEGED HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIRELESS PHONES OR RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSMITTERS, AND CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT CHALLENGE MARKETING PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURES RELATING TO ALLEGED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF HANDHELD WIRELESS

PHONES. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OR SETTLEMENTS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ALLTEL INTO OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THIS ACQUISITION.

WE HAVE REALIZED CERTAIN BENEFITS FROM THE ALLTEL ACQUISITION, INCLUDING INCREASED REVENUES, MARKET PENETRATION IN ALLTELS SERVICE AREAS, EXPANSION OF OUR NETWORK FOOTPRINT AND CERTAIN OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES AND SYNERGIES. AS WE CONTINUE OUR INTEGRATION EFFORTS, WE MAY FACE CHALLENGES, SUCH AS THE COMBINATION AND SIMPLIFICATION OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, CUSTOMER PLANS AND SALES AND MARKETING APPROACHES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND

DEPLOYMENT OF NEXT GENERATION WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE COMBINED NETWORK. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MEET THESE VARIOUS CHALLENGES AND CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE ALLTEL IN A TIMELY AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED

BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VERIZON, AND A NUMBER OF OTHER

TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES, HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MULTIPLE CLASS ACTION SUITS CONCERNING ITS ALLEGED PARTICIPATION IN INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING ACTIVITIES ALLEGEDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE

UNITED STATES, AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENTS POST-SEPTEMBER 11 PROGRAM TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. PLAINTIFFS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT VERIZON HAS PARTICIPATED BY PERMITTING THE GOVERNMENT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE CONTENT OF ITS

SUBSCRIBERS TELEPHONE CALLS AND/OR RECORDS CONCERNING THOSE CALLS AND THAT SUCH ACTION VIOLATES FEDERAL AND/OR STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LAW. RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE CASES INCLUDES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS FEES, AND STATUTORY

AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON AUGUST 9, 2006, THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (PANEL) ORDERED THAT THESE ACTIONS BE TRANSFERRED, CONSOLIDATED AND COORDINATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA. THE PANEL SUBSEQUENTLY ORDERED THAT A NUMBER OF TAG ALONG ACTIONS ALSO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. VERIZON BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT. ON JULY 10, 2008, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED

INTO LAW THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008, WHICH PROVIDES FOR DISMISSAL OF THESE SUITS BY THE COURT BASED ON SUBMISSION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF A SPECIFIED CERTIFICATION. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE

SUCH A SUBMISSION IN THE CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDINGS. BASED ON THIS SUBMISSION, THE COURT ORDERED DISMISSAL OF THE COMPLAINTS ON JUNE 3, 2009. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THIS DISMISSAL, AND THE APPEAL REMAINS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

VERIZON WIRELESS HAS CONCLUDED AN AUDIT OF ITS CELL SITE, SWITCH AND NON-RETAIL BUILDING

FACILITIES UNDER AN AUDIT AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA). THE AUDIT IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF VARIOUS LAWS GOVERNING HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE REPORTING, AIR PERMITTING AND SPILL PLAN PREPARATION. A CONSENT

AGREEMENT RELATING TO THE AUDIT WAS APPROVED ON NOVEMBER 24, 2009 BY THE EPA. WHILE VERIZON WIRELESS DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS HAS RESULTED IN A RELEASE OR THREATENED RELEASE, VERIZON WIRELESS PAID AGGREGATE PENALTIES

OF $468,600.

FEBRUARY 7, 2008, THE BOARD APPROVED A SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WHICH AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO 100 MILLION COMMON SHARES TERMINATING NO LATER THAN THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 28, 2011. THE PROGRAM PERMITS VERIZON TO

REPURCHASE SHARES OVER TIME, WITH THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASES DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CORPORATE NEEDS. THE BOARD ALSO AUTHORIZED VERIZON TO ENTER INTO RULE 10B5-1 PLANS FROM TIME TO TIME TO FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF ITS

SHARES. A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN PERMITS THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE SHARES AT TIMES WHEN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PREVENTED FROM DOING SO, PROVIDED THE PLAN IS ADOPTED WHEN THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, VERIZON RECEIVED 5 MILLION COMMON SHARES IN PARTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THE PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT

PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO WITH A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT MAY BE PURCHASED BY OR ON BEHALF OF VERIZON UNDER OUR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WAS 60,015,938.
