ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE

FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THESE

CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, VERY

NEGATIVELY.

IN 2008 AND THROUGH EARLY 2009, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF

NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY.

THIS WAS INITIALLY TRIGGERED BY DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF

SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, BUT SPREAD TO ALL MORTGAGE AND REAL ESTATE

ASSET CLASSES, TO LEVERAGED BANK LOANS AND TO NEARLY ALL ASSET

CLASSES, INCLUDING EQUITIES. THE GLOBAL MARKETS DURING THIS

PERIOD WERE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED VOLATILITY

AND

SHORT-SELLING

AND AN OVERALL LOSS OF INVESTOR AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. THE

DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES CAUSED INCREASES IN MARGIN CALLS FOR

INVESTORS, REQUIREMENTS THAT DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTIES POST

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AND REDEMPTIONS BY MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUND

INVESTORS, ALL OF WHICH INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ASSET

VALUES AND OUTFLOWS OF CLIENT FUNDS ACROSS THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. WHILE THE MARKETS HAVE GENERALLY STABILIZED

AND IMPROVED SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, ASSET VALUES FOR

MANY ASSET CLASSES HAVE NOT RETURNED TO PREVIOUS LEVELS.

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY

UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, LENDING ACTIVITIES AND THE HOUSING MARKETS,

CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE EVENTS OF RECENT YEARS.

MARKET CONDITIONS LED TO THE FAILURE OR MERGER OF A NUMBER OF

PROMINENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FAILURES

OR NEAR-FAILURES RESULTED IN FURTHER LOSSES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF

DEFAULTS ON SECURITIES ISSUED BY THEM AND DEFAULTS UNDER

BILATERAL DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO WITH SUCH

ENTITIES AS COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHERMORE, DECLINING ASSET VALUES,

DEFAULTS ON MORTGAGES AND CONSUMER LOANS, AND THE LACK OF MARKET

AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS, COMBINED TO

INCREASE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP SPREADS, TO CAUSE RATING AGENCIES

TO LOWER CREDIT RATINGS, AND TO OTHERWISE INCREASE THE COST AND

DECREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY, DESPITE VERY SIGNIFICANT

DECLINES IN CENTRAL BANK BORROWING RATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT

ACTIONS.

BANKS AND OTHER LENDERS HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND

SOME HAVE BECOME RELUCTANT TO LEND, EVEN ON A SECURED BASIS, DUE

TO THE INCREASED RISK OF DEFAULT, THE IMPACT OF DECLINING ASSET

VALUES ON THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL AND THE IMPACT OF

RISKY ASSETS AND TRANSACTIONS ON CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, SOME FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

UNWILLING TO SELL ASSETS WHERE THE VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS ARE NOT

MARKED-TO-MARKET

AND WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD AT A LOSS BECAUSE THEY ARE WORTH

SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THEIR CURRENT BOOK VALUE. THE MARKETS

FOR SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS,

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS, WHICH FOR THE MOST

PART WERE CLOSED DURING 2008 AND THE BEGINNING OF 2009, HAVE

VERY RECENTLY BEGUN TO REOPEN.

SINCE 2008, GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO

INCREASE LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR AND PUBLIC

CONFIDENCE. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OR PROPOSED TO DEAL WITH

WHAT REGULATORS, POLITICIANS AND OTHERS BELIEVE TO BE THE ROOT

CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMPENSATION

PRACTICES, PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF

ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO

ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS

WELL AS PROPOSALS CALLING FOR INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND

COORDINATION WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND

MARKETS. IT IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR WHICH OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL

BE ADOPTED AND IN WHAT FORM AND WHETHER THE NET EFFECT OF SUCH

PROPOSALS WILL IN FACT BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE FOR THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS OVER EITHER THE SHORT OR

LONG-TERM.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2009, THE ECONOMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND

JAPAN EXPERIENCED A RECESSION. BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS A WIDE

RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED AND

MANY COMPANIES WERE, AND SOME CONTINUE TO BE, IN SERIOUS

DIFFICULTY DUE TO REDUCED CONSUMER SPENDING AND LOW LEVELS OF

LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

ARE FACING DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS DUE TO SIGNIFICANT

REDUCTIONS IN TAX REVENUES, PARTICULARLY FROM CORPORATE AND

PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS INCREASED OUTLAYS FOR

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE

COST OF STIMULUS PROGRAMS.

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY, GENERAL

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC AND MARKET ACTIVITIES AND A LACK OF

CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT BANKING,

MERCHANT BANKING, ASSET MANAGEMENT, LEVERAGED LENDING AND EQUITY

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESSES.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID

AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND STRONG

BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH,

BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE;

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF

CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES,

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC

COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL

INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR

PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT BECAME GENERALLY MORE FAVORABLE AFTER

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THESE CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEAR OR LONG TERM. IF THEY

DO NOT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET

VALUES.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES,

OUR MORTGAGES, LEVERAGED LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS BUSINESSES IN

OUR FICC SEGMENT, AND OUR EQUITY PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESS,

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS,

DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY) AND

MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO

FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR

EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES, COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN TRADING

POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS

CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES. BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF

THESE INVESTING AND TRADING POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND

IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY

HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND

PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY

TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY

NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY

REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE

ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING

MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR

EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY REQUIRE

US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

IN OUR EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN

AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING

MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN

VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RECEIVE

ASSET-BASED

MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME

CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN

TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE

COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. WHEN

THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL DECLINES, THE PARTY

POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION

WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF

ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF

FUNDING TRADING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF TRADING

POSITIONS IS DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL

THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF

WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID

MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD

TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE

LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK

TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING

ADEQUATE COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER

COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR

ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO

IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY

ISSUING

LONG-TERM

DEBT, PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER, BY ACCEPTING

DEPOSITS AT OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR

LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A

SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND

MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR

AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF

FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING

AND TAKING PRINCIPAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON

ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE

THEIR TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED

COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING

OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION

TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE

TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

DUE SOLELY TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR

ISSUE.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET

VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED

VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS,

ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY VAR AND MAY EXPOSE US TO

INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

THESE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING

THE SIZE OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS AND INVESTING BUSINESSES CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY, EVEN THOUGH SPREADS ARE WIDENING AND WE MAY EARN

MORE ON EACH TRADE. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING,

BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MAY NOT BE

POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO

SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO

EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN ORDER TO

DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE

THE LEVEL OF OUR RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS WHICH IN TURN INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS.

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG

INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET

CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO

CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES

IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES

BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING

VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN

DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING VOLUMES

OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO

TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR

THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES,

PRINCIPALLY IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT

CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM IN

PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTING

BUSINESSES MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF

OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO

EITHER GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (AGAINST

THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR OF OUR COMPETITORS) BY FUNDS OR

ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR

SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS.

THIS COULD AFFECT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT

WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE

EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED

NOTES OR DERIVATIVES.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO CERTAIN OF OUR

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN DIFFICULT MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND, AT

OUR DISCRETION, WE MAY DECIDE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE FOR

REPUTATIONAL OR BUSINESS REASONS, INCLUDING THROUGH EQUITY

INVESTMENTS OR CASH INFUSIONS.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND

STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK

AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND

LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW

PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY

A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK

MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT

ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES.

THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

MARKET CONDITIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED

DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING

HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES

REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK

THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009,

PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR

CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN

DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT

TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND

HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO

IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED

WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS

WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. IN

THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK

POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR

WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS FOR

CERTAIN ASSETS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY

THROUGH VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SECURITIES, INCLUDING

PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING

MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR

HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND

THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS. IN

ADDITION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN OUR MERCHANT BANKING,

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS, AND LIMITATIONS

ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN

THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS,

MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES

RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

OUR LIQUIDITY,

PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS

OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR

INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY

THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO

WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED

PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS

TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES

MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD

RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE

SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO

OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION,

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE

SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL,

INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER

IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR COST OF OBTAINING

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME MATURITY

THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS

FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS,

MARKET-DRIVEN,

AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE

MOVEMENTS. CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS

OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE

INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR

LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS IS RELATIVELY NEW,

ALTHOUGH VERY LARGE, AND IT HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE

AND CURRENTLY LACKS A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

GROUP INC.

IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS

FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS

ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR

BROKER-DEALER,

BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT

RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO

BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO

GROUP INC. IN ADDITION, OUR

BROKER-DEALER,

BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON

THEIR ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON

THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN BROKERAGE OR

BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS

ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN

BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN

REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF

GROUP INC. AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR

REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT

GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION,

GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF

ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION IS

SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT

OBLIGATIONS OF GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT

ASSETS TO GS BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. IN

ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF

ITS OTHER CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A

TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION

BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY

REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS

TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A

TIME WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS

OWN OBLIGATIONS. SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION

IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR

BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS

BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS

OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN

CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD

PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSETS. THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON

COLLATERAL MAY SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF

OUR RIGHTS. DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH

COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE

SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENT

POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR

MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION

OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO

THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

TRADING, INVESTING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE

OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY

SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT

EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND

LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING

OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF

MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING

DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS

THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR

LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, AND A FAILURE

OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY

IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY

WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE

TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT

FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US

TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY

EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS,

COMMERCIAL BANKS, CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT

FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION

WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY. TO THE EXTENT REGULATORY OR

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS LEAD TO AN INCREASED CENTRALIZATION OF

TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL

AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, THIS MAY INCREASE OUR CONCENTRATION OF RISK

WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS

MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. THIS

TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO

NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE

COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD

VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN

OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A

COST-EFFECTIVE

MANNER OR AT ALL, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS

ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND

PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT

APPLY TO ALL OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, HAVE

CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING

PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND

OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE.

WE FACE

ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US

TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND

EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. THESE BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL

CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED

COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED

CREDIT-RELATED,

SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN

WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED

RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND

NON-STANDARDIZED,

WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS

DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO

THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE

DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR

OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS

DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS

WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS

INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY

BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES

ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A

TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR

DURING ANY DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY

FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, AS

NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A

WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES

ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH

COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK

EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS.

ANY REGULATORY EFFORT TO CREATE AN EXCHANGE OR TRADING PLATFORM

FOR CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, OR A

MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP

DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

OURSELVES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS

OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY

TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR

BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES

AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. COMPETITION

FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES

OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES

HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN

EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS 

REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION 

COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K,

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE

STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL

AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON

COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR

COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC OR OTHER

REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPOSED

BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION OR THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS PROPOSAL ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

POLICIES, MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN

WAYS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPENSATION OF

EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING

NON-EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS, IN A MANNER THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTS IN THE

IDENTITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES AND THEIR COMPENSATION BEING MADE

PUBLIC. ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EMPLOYEE

COMPENSATION MAY ALSO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESSES

AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE

REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER

THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME

OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS

ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY

HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH

THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. IN

ADDITION, RECENT MARKET DISRUPTIONS HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS

PROPOSALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FOR CHANGES

IN THE REGULATION AND TAXATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING INCREASED CAPITAL OR NEW LIQUIDITY OR

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES

IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING TAX BURDENS AND

COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS, COULD BE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET

OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES,

GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY.

THE IMPACT OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY

IN THE AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT UNECONOMIC FOR US

TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING

OUR BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR

EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING

CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS

OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

WE MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY

SCRUTINY OR NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO

COMPENSATION, OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER

MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC

SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS ADVERSE

STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR ELECTED OFFICIALS. PRESS

COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ASSERT SOME FORM OF

WRONGDOING, REGARDLESS OF THE FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE ASSERTIONS

BEING MADE, OFTEN RESULTS IN SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BY

REGULATORS,

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS.

RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING, IS TIME CONSUMING AND

EXPENSIVE AND CAN DIVERT THE TIME AND EFFORT OF OUR SENIOR

MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY

IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO ADVANCE OR

SUPPORT LEGISLATION TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR

REPUTATION AND ON THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

A FAILURE IN

OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES,

RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS

AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS

AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO

CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS

WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND

OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR

OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY

CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER

OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR

BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION

VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE

TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY

UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH. THIS

UPDATING ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATES RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM WITH EXISTING

ONES.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE,

TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING

AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS,

AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE

INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT

TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN

SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND

CLEARING HOUSES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL

FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND

COST-EFFECTIVE

ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET

PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF

OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE

INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES,

AND THE INCREASED CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES UNDER PROPOSED

AND POTENTIAL REGULATION, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL

FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS,

SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR

CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET,

TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES

WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR THE BUILDINGS

OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER

IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE

BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING

THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG,

TOKYO AND BANGALORE, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN

ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN

BUSINESS CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST

CONCENTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN

AREA, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A

CATASTROPHIC EVENT IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA

OFFICES COULD VERY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A

DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT

LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR

TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT

WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON

COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS

CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE

OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE

OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL

AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED

THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE

INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE

VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED

AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE

PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP

SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE

UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR

CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER

THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD

PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE

PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN

LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY

AND DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE INCREASINGLY MUST ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A

PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS

CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF

ANOTHER CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC

INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN

THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY

WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP. IN

ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO

HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS

BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE SEEN AS AFFILIATES OF

OURS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE

DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR

REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE

DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MIGHT ARISE MAY BE

AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY AND DEAL

APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL

OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBSTANTIAL

LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US

COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US

SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY

HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS

AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS INCREASE IN PERIODS WHEN WE HAVE

REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR

PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO

PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BEEN AND MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

THE GROWTH OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TRADING

TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE

COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED

USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF

LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO

TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE

DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF

THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE

HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE

SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT,

PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM

ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR

COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR POWER GENERATION

INTERESTS AND OUR PHYSICAL COMMODITIES BUSINESSES, SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US

TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

WE ENGAGE IN, OR INVEST IN ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN, THE

PRODUCTION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING AND TRADING OF

NUMEROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL

GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, METALS

(BASE AND PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING URANIUM), EMISSION

CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND RELATED

PRODUCTS AND INDICES. THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE

AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS,

AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND

HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS

CAN LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT MAY INCREASE THE

OPERATING COSTS AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR

FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED

BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES

AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE US TO

COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,

INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, RENOVATION OF

STORAGE

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND

CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF,

PERMITS AND LICENSES. OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE

ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES,

TRANSPORT VESSELS, STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR

PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS, FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS

OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED

LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL

DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION,

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM

THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE ON THEIR PART,

INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE

PRICES OR TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE

TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE

INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM

PERFORMING UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS, MAY IMPAIR OUR

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION,

REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

IN CONDUCTING

OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT

IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES

AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE

UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET.

ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE

EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR

REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK

THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO

NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS,

AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET

COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT,

CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE

GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE

CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND

INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR

NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING

THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY

(OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY),

TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC

AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL

DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR

OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES, AND COULD EXPOSE OUR

INSURANCE BUSINESSES TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.
