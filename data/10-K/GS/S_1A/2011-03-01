RISK

FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE

FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THESE

CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, VERY

NEGATIVELY. IN 2008 AND THROUGH EARLY 2009, THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY WERE

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE

VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF

LIQUIDITY.

SINCE 2008, GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO

INCREASE LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR AND PUBLIC

CONFIDENCE. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEAL WITH WHAT

REGULATORS, POLITICIANS AND OTHERS BELIEVE TO BE THE ROOT

CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

COMPENSATION PRACTICES, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES

IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE, AND

GENERALLY INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY. IN SOME CASES,

ADDITIONAL TAXES HAVE BEEN (OR HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO BE) IMPOSED

ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT

ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT RECENTLY ADOPTED LEGISLATION

(INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ARE STILL BEING DRAFTED OR ARE

NOT YET IN EFFECT; THEREFORE, THE EXACT IMPACT THAT THESE

REGULATIONS WILL HAVE ON OUR BUSINESSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND CASH FLOWS IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR.

BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS

HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED AND MANY COMPANIES WERE, AND SOME

CONTINUE TO BE, IN SERIOUS DIFFICULTY DUE TO REDUCED CONSUMER

SPENDING AND LOW LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS.

NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FACING DIFFICULT FINANCIAL

CONDITIONS DUE TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TAX REVENUES,

PARTICULARLY FROM CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, AS WELL

AS INCREASED OUTLAYS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGH

UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE COST OF STIMULUS PROGRAMS.

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY, REDUCED

VOLATILITY, GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC AND MARKET

ACTIVITIES AND A LACK OF CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE

HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID

AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND STRONG

BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH,

BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE;

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF

CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES,

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC

COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL

INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR

PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT CONTINUED TO IMPROVE DURING 2010,

ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SEVERAL PERIODS OF MARKET DISRUPTION, BUT

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE IN

THE NEAR OR LONG TERM. IF THEY DO NOT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE

BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS,

RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR

POST COLLATERAL.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN

DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS, DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES

(INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE) AND MOST OTHER ASSET

CLASSES. THESE INCLUDE POSITIONS WE TAKE WHEN WE ACT AS A

PRINCIPAL TO FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

OUR EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES, OR COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN

POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS

THROUGH OUR CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES ACTIVITIES.

BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF THESE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN

ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS,

UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO

SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE

CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES

THAT ARE NOT FREELY TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID

TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE

SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE

INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM

INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND

SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY

CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS,

WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH

ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS

REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN SUCH POSITIONS AND THE

DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

IN OUR EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN

AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING

MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN

VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED

FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE

ASSET-BASED

MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME

CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN

TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE

COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CLIENT EXECUTION

BUSINESSES. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL

DECLINES, THE PARTY POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING

POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A

MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT.

THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ASSET CLASSES USED AS

COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF FUNDING POSITIONS IS

INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF POSITIONS IS DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE

PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING

COLLATERAL, THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING

THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID MARKETS INCREASE THE

DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD TO COSTLY AND

TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE LEVEL OF

REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK TO THE

RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING ADEQUATE

COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO

CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR

ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO

IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY

ISSUING

LONG-TERM

DEBT, PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER, BY ACCEPTING

DEPOSITS AT OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR

LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A

SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND

MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR

AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF

FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING

AND MARKET MAKING.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON

ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE

THEIR TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED

COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING

OF     OUR     CLIENTS

MERGER AND     ACQUISITION

TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY

LARGE TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

DUE SOLELY TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR

ISSUE.

OUR

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE

LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND

ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR CLIENTS, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED

VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS,

ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY

VALUE-AT-RISK

(VAR) AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH

OUR

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING THE

SIZE OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY, EVEN THOUGH

SPREADS ARE WIDENING AND WE MAY EARN MORE ON EACH TRADE. IN

PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING, BUT ASSET VALUES ARE

DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS

AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS.

IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON

ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR.

IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF OUR

RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, BOTH

OF WHICH IN TURN INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING, CLIENT EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY

CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK

OF CONFIDENCE AMONG INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES

IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC,

GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE

TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO

CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES

IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR CLIENT EXECUTION

BUSINESSES BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY

DECREASING VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND

EVEN DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING

VOLUMES OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO

TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR

THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES,

PRINCIPALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT

THAT CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM

IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE

POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS,

DUE TO EITHER GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE

(RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS OR TO BENCHMARKS) BY FUNDS OR

ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR

SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS.

THIS COULD AFFECT THE MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE EARN

ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE EARN FOR

SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED NOTES OR

DERIVATIVES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK

AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND

LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW

PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM

MARKET-MAKING,

INVESTING OR LENDING POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL

LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK

MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND

THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE

EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING

OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES,

INCUR LOSSES. MARKET CONDITIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE INVOLVED

UNPRECEDENTED DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS

INHERENT IN USING HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES

REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK

THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER

MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009,

PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR

CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN

DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT

TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND

HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO

IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED

WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS

WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. IN

THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK

POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR

WIDESPREAD MARKET

DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE

DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE POSITIONS THROUGH OUR

MARKET-MAKING

OR ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OR WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY

THROUGH OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN SECURITIES, INCLUDING

PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING

MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR

HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND

THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS. IN

ADDITION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN PRIVATE EQUITY, DEBT,

REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE AND LIMITATIONS ON

OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE

FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS, MAY

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES

RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

OUR LIQUIDITY, PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL

MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT

RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR

INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY

THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO

WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED

PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS

TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING AND

LENDING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS

FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR

POSITIONS.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE

SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET

CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE

INTERACT MAY EXERCISE

SET-OFF

RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING

IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED

FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES

COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR

REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR

TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO

SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO

FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH

PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. CERTAIN RATING AGENCIES HAVE

INDICATED THAT THE

DODD-FRANK

ACT COULD RESULT IN THE RATING AGENCIES REDUCING THEIR ASSUMED

LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND THEREFORE RESULT IN RATINGS

DOWNGRADES FOR CERTAIN LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

GOLDMAN SACHS.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME

MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES

IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR

COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE

CONTINUOUS,

MARKET-DRIVEN,

AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE

MOVEMENTS. CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS

OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS

MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS

OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR

LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, ALTHOUGH VERY

LARGE, HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND CURRENTLY LACKS A

HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO

APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE INCREASINGLY MUST ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A

PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS

CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF

ANOTHER CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC

INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN

THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY

WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

IN ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO

HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN

GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE VIEWED AS

AFFILIATES OF OURS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE

DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR

REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE

DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS WITH US MAY BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO

FAIL, TO IDENTIFY, DISCLOSE AND DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED

CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

THEIR ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON

THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN BROKERAGE OR

BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS

ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN

BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN

REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF

GROUP INC. AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR

REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT

GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION,

GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF

ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION IS

SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT

OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING

GS&CO., GS BANK USA, GS BANK EUROPE AND GOLDMAN

SACHS EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT ASSETS TO GS BANK

USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. IN ADDITION,

GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A

TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION

BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY

REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS

TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A

TIME WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS

OWN OBLIGATIONS. SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION

IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

FORM 10-K

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR

DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER

ASSETS OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN

CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD

PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY

SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS.

DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO

THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF

MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING AND PRIME BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES, WE

FINANCE OUR CLIENTS POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS.

ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES

AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT

TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE NUMBER AND

SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN A GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK,

WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT

EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND

LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL REQUIRE ISSUERS OF

ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES AND ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES AND INITIATES AN

ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES TRANSACTION TO RETAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET,

WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST TO US OF ENGAGING IN

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT

RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS,

INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR

BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES

ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, AND A FAILURE

OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY

IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY

WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE

TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT

FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US

TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY

EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES

ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BROKERS AND

DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND

INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT

CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE COUNTERPARTIES. PROVISIONS

OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT ARE EXPECTED TO LEAD TO INCREASED

CENTRALIZATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING

HOUSES, CENTRAL AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR

CONCENTRATION OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE

INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE

COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION,

REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE. OVER TIME, THERE HAS

BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER

RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET

ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO

HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO

SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS

AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE

EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS,

REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS

AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATIONS, IMPOSED TAXES

OR OTHERWISE PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT HAVE OR MAY

IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A

COST-EFFECTIVE

MANNER OR AT ALL IN CERTAIN OR ALL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING

PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN

WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE. THESE OR

OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL OUR

U.S. OR

NON-U.S. COMPETITORS,

COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR BUSINESSES HAVE

CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING

PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND

OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US

TO TRANSACT WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES

AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND

EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE

ARE INCREASINGLY TRANSACTING BUSINESS AND INVESTING IN NEW

REGIONS, INCLUDING A WIDER RANGE OF EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS.

FURTHERMORE, IN A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING WHERE WE

MAKE MARKETS, INVEST AND LEND, WE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN

INTERESTS IN, OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP

AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS, TOLL ROADS

AND SHIPPING PORTS, AS WELL AS POWER GENERATION FACILITIES,

PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND OTHER COMMODITIES INFRASTRUCTURE

COMPONENTS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. RECENT

MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITIES TO

ACQUIRE DISTRESSED ASSETS AND WE MAY DETERMINE OPPORTUNISTICALLY

TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO THESE TYPES OF ASSETS.

THESE ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES,

REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS

SOPHISTICATED COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY

SCRUTINY OF THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED

CREDIT-RELATED,

SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN

WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE

US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND

NON-STANDARDIZED,

WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS

DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO

THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE

DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR

OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS

DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS

WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS

INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM. DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO

INVOLVE THE RISK THAT THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATE FOR

A COUNTERPARTY, THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY

EXECUTED OR THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE

AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY

BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES

ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A

TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR

DURING ANY DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY

FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, AS

NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A

WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES

ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH

COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK

EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRING CENTRAL CLEARING

OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVES, OR A MARKET

SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP

DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

OURSELVES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE

TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS

OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY

TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR

BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW TALENTED

AND DIVERSE EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES. FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

SUCH EMPLOYEES INCLUDE OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OUR

REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITH A CULTURE OF FAIRLY

HIRING, TRAINING AND PROMOTING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM

BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE

IN EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY

GREATER PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS 

REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION AND

REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN

PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

FORM 10-K,

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE

STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL

AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON

COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR

COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FSA, THE FDIC OR

OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY

IMPOSED BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION,

MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN WAYS THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

TALENTED EMPLOYEES. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES,

INCLUDING

NON-EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS, IN A MANNER THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTS IN THE

IDENTITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES AND THEIR COMPENSATION BEING MADE

PUBLIC. ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EMPLOYEE

COMPENSATION MAY ALSO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER

THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME

OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS

ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY

HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH

THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES

IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING TAX BURDENS AND

COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS, COULD BE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET

OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES,

GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY.

THE IMPACT OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY

IN THE AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT UNECONOMIC FOR US

TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING

OUR BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR

EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING

CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS

OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND

REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO

COMPENSATION, OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER

MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC

SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS

ADVERSE STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS. PRESS COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT

ASSERT SOME FORM OF WRONGDOING OFTEN RESULT IN SOME TYPE OF

INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORS, LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS. RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND

LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING,

IS TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE AND CAN DIVERT THE TIME AND

EFFORT OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND

FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN

REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO ADVANCE OR SUPPORT LEGISLATION

TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. ADVERSE PUBLICITY,

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN

ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ON THE MORALE

AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR

THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR

BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL

INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS

AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS

AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO

CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS

WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS.

AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS,

DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND

INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL,

ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND

FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS

THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE

IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO

PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST

CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND

GROWTH AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN REGULATIONS AND MARKETS.

THIS UPDATING ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATES RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM

WITH EXISTING ONES.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE,

TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING

AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS,

AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE

INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT

TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG

CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES AND AN INCREASING

NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE

WILL BE CLEARED ON EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE

TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF

THE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND

COST-EFFECTIVE

ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET

PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF

OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE

INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES,

AND THE INCREASED CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES, INCREASES THE

RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY

MAY CAUSE AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS,

SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR

CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET,

TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES

WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS OR

THOSE OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A

BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE

BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING

THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, LONDON, BANGALORE, HONG KONG,

TOKYO AND SALT LAKE CITY, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE

ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS

TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND

THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK

METROPOLITAN AREA, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF

THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK

METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES COULD VERY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR

EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR

COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO

SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND

ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS

CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE

OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE

OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES

CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND

TRANSMITTED THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR

OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR

CLIENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES

OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES

OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND

SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE

MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR

OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND

FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT

FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE

PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP

SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE

UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR

CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER

THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD

PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE

PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN

LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY

ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS

OR CAUSE US SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD

SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS

FORM 10-K

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS

AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS INCREASE IN PERIODS WHEN WE HAVE

REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES, INVOLVING

ACTUAL OR ALLEGED FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK

THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. THIS MISCONDUCT HAS

INCLUDED AND MAY INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE THE THEFT OF PROPRIETARY

SOFTWARE. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT

THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BEEN AND MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL

CASES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF

NEW TRADING TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY

INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH US, PARTICULARLY OUR EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED

USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF

LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO

TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE

DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF

THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE

HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE

SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT,

PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM

ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR POWER

GENERATION INTERESTS AND OUR PHYSICAL COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES,

SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY

EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

WE ENGAGE IN, OR INVEST IN ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN, THE

PRODUCTION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING AND TRADING OF

NUMEROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL

GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, METALS (BASE AND

PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING URANIUM), EMISSION CREDITS, COAL,

FREIGHT, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES.

THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER

QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND

SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS MAY LEAD TO

ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT COULD INCREASE THE OPERATING COSTS

AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR

FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED

ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES

AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE US TO

COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,

INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, RENOVATION OF

STORAGE FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION

FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING

OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES.

OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK

OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE

OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER

GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES, TRANSPORT VESSELS,

STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER

MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS, FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS OR RELEASE OF

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF

OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR

OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON

THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE ON THEIR PART, INCLUDING

THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR TO

SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE INSURANCE THAT WE

HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM

PERFORMING UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS, MAY IMPAIR OUR

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION,

REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER

RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES

AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE

UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET.

ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE

EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR

REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK

THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO

NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING AND GROWTH

MARKETS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING

AND GROWTH MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF

THEIR CURRENCIES, DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN

DEBT, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR

NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY

ACTIVITY OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF

THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND

INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WHILE BUSINESS AND OTHER PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DIFFER,

OUR PRINCIPAL LEGAL ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT IN THEIR OPERATIONS

WORLDWIDE TO RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORRUPT AND

ILLEGAL PAYMENTS AND MONEY LAUNDERING, AS WELL AS LAWS RELATING

TO DOING BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND

COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT,

THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND U.K. BRIBERY ACT. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED

AND CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND IN

COMPLIANCE MONITORING, THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY OF OUR

OPERATIONS, EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE

VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT WE DEAL WITH, GREATLY

INCREASES THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF SUCH

RULES OR REGULATIONS AND ANY SUCH VIOLATION COULD SUBJECT US TO

SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC,

TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING

THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY

(OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY),

TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC

AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL

DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR

OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES, AND COULD EXPOSE OUR

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.
