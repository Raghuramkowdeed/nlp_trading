ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE

SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET,

LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. OUR

BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS. THE

FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

WE HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS PER

COMMON SHARE IN EACH OF OUR LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS, REFLECTING A

FAVORABLE TRADING ENVIRONMENT IN FICC, AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE

TRADING ENVIRONMENT FOR EQUITIES AND AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT

BANKING ACTIVITY. AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THESE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY AND THESE CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND

DRAMATICALLY. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ADVERSELY

AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE

FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH

CHANGES ARE RAPID, MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE

OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE INCURRED

SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF MARKET TURBULENCE. CONVERSELY, CERTAIN OF

OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE

OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM

OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE

TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE CONTINUED, EVEN AS THE VOLUME AND

NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS HAVE INCREASED. IN ADDITION, THE TREND IN

THE UNDERWRITING BUSINESS TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND CO-MANAGERS HANDLING

TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE BOOK RUNNER, MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS ALSO TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS.

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF

BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND

IN THE INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND

OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE BLOCKS OF SECURITIES ARE INCREASINGLY

BEING SOLD IN BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A MARKETED BASIS, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK

THAT GOLDMAN SACHS MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE PURCHASED SECURITIES AT FAVORABLE

PRICES AND MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AS A RESULT. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF

CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO

LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH

TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND AS A SPECIALIST OR

MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM

COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND OTHER INDUSTRY

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE INCREASING USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING,

COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE

ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY

PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF

SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN THE

CONTEXT OF BLOCK TRADES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR

RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY

FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING

SYSTEMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR

ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF

RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES

AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT

ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS

AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR

ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR

BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO SELL

ASSETS OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION

MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL,

SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT

AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS

MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL

SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND BUSINESSES IN MANY WAYS.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO

OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER

OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR

TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE

PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERMINATE

CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY

BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

AN INABILITY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A

HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS

AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO., ARE

SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE

THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO

FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN

ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (OR ANY

OTHER ENTITY) HOLDS EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS REGULATED OR

UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, ITS RIGHTS AS AN EQUITY HOLDER TO THE

ASSETS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE

CLAIMS OF THE CREDITORS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD

PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT

PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR

RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL

CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD

RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR

LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES

HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAS THE

BREADTH OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. THE

SCOPE OF OUR LENDING BUSINESSES HAS ALSO BEEN EXPANDING AND

INCLUDES LOANS TO SMALL AND MID-SIZE BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE NOT

TRADITIONAL GOLDMAN SACHS CLIENTS. AS A CLEARING MEMBER FIRM, WE

FINANCE OUR CLIENT POSITIONS AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR

THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR

THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK

TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT

BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION,

CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

MANDATORY PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LOSSES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER THE UNDERLYING SECURITY OR OBLIGATION.

LIKE MANY PARTICIPANTS IN THE

DERIVATIVES MARKETPLACE, WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES, THAT REQUIRE

THAT WE DELIVER TO THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY OR

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO

NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY OR OBLIGATION AND MAY HAVE

DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING

SECURITY OR OBLIGATION THROUGH THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF OTHER

TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE SECURITY OR OBLIGATION WITHIN THE

REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO

FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN

SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM. THE DERIVATIVES INDUSTRY IS

WORKING ON VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. A FAILURE OF

THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE COULD RESULT IN AN UNWILLINGNESS

OF COUNTERPARTIES TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN TYPES OF DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

UNCONFIRMED DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND UNAUTHORIZED ASSIGNMENTS OF DERIVATIVES BY COUNTERPARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER

TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS

CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE

TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND

IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE THE CONTRACT. THE GROWTH IN THE

DERIVATIVES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER SWAP

TRANSACTIONS, HAS ALSO EXPOSED US AND OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

TO AN INCREASING INCIDENCE OF COUNTERPARTIES SEEKING TO

UNILATERALLY ASSIGN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT REQUIRED PRIOR NOTICE AND

CONSENT. ALTHOUGH INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO

ELIMINATE THIS PRACTICE AND ITS EFFECTS ON A GOING-FORWARD BASIS,

INCLUDING THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2005 ISDA NOVATION PROTOCOL,

IT IS NOT YET CLEAR HOW EFFECTIVE THESE EFFORTS WILL BE, AND THE

STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE INDUSTRY DO NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE

FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO.

UNAUTHORIZED ASSIGNMENTS COULD INTRODUCE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

STATUS OF A TRANSACTION, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE CREDIT RISK

AND IMPEDE TRADE RECONCILIATIONS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A HIGHER

NUMBER OF FAILED TRANSACTIONS AND COLLATERAL CALL DEFAULTS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR

INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS COULD LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL LOSS, DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES,

LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR

ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES. THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX AND OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS

WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING,

DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL

TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT

ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS. THE INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS

TO ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO

CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR TERMINATION OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES,

CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO

FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR

INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE WILL INCREASINGLY FACE

THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS

SYSTEMS. ANY SUCH FAILURE OR TERMINATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS AND MANAGE OUR

EXPOSURE TO RISK.

DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND

FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE

ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE

LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL,

COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN

SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE

DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT

AFFECT ONLY THE BUILDINGS OF GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES,

OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT ON THE CITIES WHERE

THOSE BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR

PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING NEW YORK, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG

AND TOKYO, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE

BUILDINGS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES

IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE

WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND

INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON

COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE

PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER

INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE

PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES

WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE

VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER

MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT.

IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD

JEOPARDIZE OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS

OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD

PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO

INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE

EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY

INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST

IMPORTANT ASSETS. AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND OUR CLIENT BASE, WE INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO OUR PROPRIETARY

ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CONFLICTS MAY ARISE BETWEEN OUR POSITION

AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR IN A MERGER TRANSACTION AND A PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENT WE HOLD IN ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION. IN

ADDITION, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS ARE AN INCREASINGLY

IMPORTANT PORTION OF OUR CLIENT BASE, AND ALSO COMPETE WITH US IN A

NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS

THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. HOWEVER,

APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND

DIFFICULT AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR

TO FAIL, TO DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

IN ADDITION, THE SEC AND OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JUNE 2005, THE

NASD FILED WITH THE SEC PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES TO BE CONTAINED IN FAIRNESS OPINIONS, AND WOULD MANDATE

SPECIFIC PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED BY MEMBER FIRMS IN CONNECTION

WITH ISSUING THESE OPINIONS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

OF INTEREST ARE APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY

OF, AND LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL

MAKE OUR CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH

SUCH A CONFLICT MAY OCCUR, AND WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION

IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE

FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

OR SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN

ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESS OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SEC HAS ADOPTED RULES REQUIRING THE

REGISTRATION OF CERTAIN HEDGE FUNDS ADVISERS UNDER THE INVESTMENT

ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, AND THE SEC OR OTHER REGULATORS MAY SEEK TO

FURTHER REGULATE HEDGE FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

THESE OR OTHER FUTURE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS RULES MAY HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR TRADING, PRIME BROKERAGE AND OTHER

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEDGE FUNDS, OR ON THE GROWTH OF OUR

PRIME BROKERAGE AND SECURITIES LENDING BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION,

UNDER THE EUROPEAN UNIONS TRANSPARENCY DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2004/109/EC),

WHICH IS DUE TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY MEMBER STATES BY

JANUARY 2007, ISSUERS OF SECURITIES ADMITTED TO LISTING ON

REGULATED MARKETS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION MAY, DEPENDING UPON THE

MANNER OF IMPLEMENTATION, BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPANDED ONGOING

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

ABILITY OR THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR NON-EUROPEAN UNION-BASED

CLIENTS TO MAINTAIN THE LISTING OF THESE SECURITIES OR TO CONDUCT

SECURITIES OFFERINGS IN EUROPE. FURTHERMORE, THE SECS REGULATION NMS,

WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN 2005 AND IS EXPECTED TO BECOME

EFFECTIVE IN 2006, INTRODUCES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE REGULATION

OF TRADING ON SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND MARKETPLACES. WHILE IT IS

TOO EARLY TO PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT REGULATION NMS WILL HAVE,

IT COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ON

OUR TRADING BUSINESSES AND ALTER THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH THESE BUSINESSES FUNCTION.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE OPERATING IN AN UNCERTAIN AND DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENALTIES

AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS LED

SOME OF OUR CLIENTS TO BE LESS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS

THAT MAY CARRY A RISK OF INCREASED SCRUTINY BY REGULATORS. IN

ADDITION, WHILE THE FIRM ALWAYS STRIVES TO FULLY COMPLY WITH ALL

LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THIS REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT

ENVIRONMENT HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO A NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN ENTERED INTO BY FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR FIRM, AND THAT WERE GENERALLY

BELIEVED TO BE PERMISSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS

LED US AND OUR COMPETITORS TO MODIFY TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND, IN

SOME CASES, TO LIMIT OR CEASE OUR EXECUTION OF SOME TYPES OF

TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN

OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND

PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH.

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESSES HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO NEW REQUIREMENTS AND LITIGATION.

AS DISCUSSED UNDER BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K,

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE BEEN AND

REMAIN THE SUBJECT OF REGULATORY SCRUTINY THAT HAS LED TO

RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS

AND INVESTMENT BANKING PERSONNEL AT SECURITIES FIRMS. GS&CO. HAS

AGREED TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO EQUITY

RESEARCH ANALYSTS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST PURSUANT TO WHICH

GS&CO. HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS.

CERTAIN OF THESE REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS HAVE IMPOSED

ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF COMPLEX, STRUCTURED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS REMAIN HIGH.

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES, CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE COMPLEX, STRUCTURED

FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST A

NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

TRANSACTIONS. IN SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, CLIENTS OF THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY ENGAGED IN ACCOUNTING, DISCLOSURE

OR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS, AND THE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY FACILITATED THESE IMPROPRIETIES BY ENTERING

INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH THE CLIENTS. WE SEEK TO CREATE INNOVATIVE

SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS NEEDS, AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO,

AND CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO, STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS.

WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO

ENSURE THAT THE STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS WE ENTER INTO ARE

APPROPRIATELY REVIEWED AND COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN OF THESE TRANSACTIONS

COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND LITIGATION IN

CONNECTION WITH, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS WILL MAKE OUR

CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS, AND WILL

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN THIS AREA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO MARKET TIMING, LATE TRADING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INVOLVING MUTUAL FUNDS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN

INDUSTRY-WIDE AND OTHER INVESTIGATIONS BY FEDERAL AND STATE

AUTHORITIES CONCERNING MARKET TIMING, LATE TRADING AND OTHER

ACTIVITIES INVOLVING MUTUAL FUNDS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS. FEDERAL

AND STATE AUTHORITIES HAVE MADE INFORMATIONAL REQUESTS REGARDING

TRADING PRACTICES BROADLY ACROSS ALL OF THE MAJOR FUND COMPANIES

AND BROKER-DEALERS. GOLDMAN SACHS HAS RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION AND HAS BEEN FULLY COOPERATING WITH THOSE AUTHORITIES.

WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE REASONABLE MEASURES TO

DETECT AND DETER DISRUPTIVE AND ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES AND

COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE CANNOT

PREDICT THE COURSE THAT THESE INQUIRIES AND AREAS OF FOCUS MAY TAKE

OR THE IMPACT THAT ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING MUTUAL

FUNDS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND CIVIL ACTIONS.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO BEEN CONDUCTING

INVESTIGATIONS INTO CERTAIN TRADING PRACTICES OF SPECIALIST FIRMS,

INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST UNIT. IN MARCH 2004, CERTAIN NYSE

SPECIALIST FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST UNIT, AGREED TO A GLOBAL

SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC AND NYSE TO RESOLVE CHARGES THAT THE FIRMS

VIOLATED CERTAIN FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND NYSE RULES IN

CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACTIVITIES AS NYSE SPECIALISTS DURING THE

YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2003. THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT INVOLVES, AMONG

OTHERS, RESTITUTION AND PENALTIES, A CENSURE, CEASE AND DESIST

ORDER AND CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS WITH RESPECT TO OUR SPECIALIST

UNITS SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES. THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT RESOLVE THE

RELATED CIVIL ACTIONS DISCUSSED UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

SPECIALIST MATTERS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM 10-K, OR POTENTIAL REGULATORY CHARGES AGAINST

INDIVIDUALS. AS A RESULT OF THIS GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND ANY RELATED

DEVELOPMENTS, OTHER INVESTIGATIONS OR ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS

GOVERNING SPECIALISTS, OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED AND THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPAIRED.

EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND PREVENT AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY

PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE

RISK THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS

POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE

PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESSES.

FINANCIAL SCANDALS IN RECENT YEARS

HAVE LED TO INSECURITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

CONTRIBUTED TO DECLINES IN CAPITAL MARKETS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE

SCANDALS, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE RULES OF THE SEC,

NYSE AND NASDAQ HAVE NECESSITATED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. THESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY APPLY

TO COMPANIES WITH SECURITIES LISTED ON U.S. SECURITIES

EXCHANGES, AND SOME PROVISIONS APPLY TO NON-U.S. ISSUERS WITH

SECURITIES TRADED ON U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGES. TO THE EXTENT

THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES, TO AVOID BECOMING SUBJECT TO THESE

REQUIREMENTS, DECIDE TO FORGO INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, OUR EQUITY

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY EXIT SOME OF OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SIMILARLY, THE IMPOSITION OF THOSE PROVISIONS

ON NON-U.S. ISSUERS HAS MADE THESE ISSUERS LESS LIKELY TO LIST

THEIR SECURITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OR UNDERTAKE MERGER OR

ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD RESULT IN THEIR SECURITIES

BEING LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE MEASURES MAY RESULT IN

LESS ACTIVITY BY NON-U.S. ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND, AS

A RESULT, THE U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PROVISIONS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY

ACT OF 2002 AND THE NYSE AND NASDAQ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RULES HAVE

IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE COSTS ON PUBLIC COMPANIES AND HAVE

INCREASED THE COST OF CONDUCTING MANY TYPES OF CAPITAL MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES OFFERINGS AND ACQUISITION AND

DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, COMPANIES THAT ARE OR ARE

PLANNING TO BE PUBLIC ARE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN

COMPLYING WITH THE SEC AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATING TO

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND COMPANIES THAT

DISCLOSE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN SUCH CONTROLS UNDER THE NEW

STANDARDS MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

THESE FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO ADOPTED OR PROPOSED ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE CHANGES, MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY 

AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE

EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. U.S. FEDERAL

LEGISLATION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES

PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK, MAY

ACCELERATE THIS CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASE COMPETITION.

THIS TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR COMPETITORS.

THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES

AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS.

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR

BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND

PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS

TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR

OWN SYSTEMS AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT

APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL

CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED USE

BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT

ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN

COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT

ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS.

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION WITH BUSINESSES

OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, FOR THE MOST HIGHLY

SKILLED INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN INTENSE. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT MAY CAUSE US TO MOVE

EMPLOYEES FROM ONE BUSINESS TO ANOTHER OR TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES; THIS MAY CAUSE TEMPORARY

DISRUPTIONS AS OUR EMPLOYEES ADAPT TO NEW ROLES AND MAY REDUCE OUR

ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS (INCLUDING LAWS

RELATING TO IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING) MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY

TO MOVE RESPONSIBILITIES OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO

ANOTHER. THIS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES OR POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FULLY INTEGRATE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES INTO OUR BUSINESSES AND SYSTEMS.

WE EXPECT TO GROW IN PART THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES. WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN JOINT VENTURES,

INCLUDING IN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA, AND MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL

JOINT VENTURES FROM TIME TO TIME. TO THE EXTENT WE MAKE

ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO COMBINATIONS OR JOINT VENTURES, WE FACE

NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COMBINING OR INTEGRATING THE

RELEVANT BUSINESSES AND SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE NEED TO COMBINE

ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND

TO INTEGRATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. IN

THE CASE OF JOINT VENTURES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES IN THAT WE MAY BE DEPENDENT UPON, AND SUBJECT TO

LIABILITY, LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE RELATING TO, SYSTEMS,

CONTROLS AND PERSONNEL THAT ARE NOT UNDER OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION,

CONFLICTS OR DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND OUR JOINT VENTURE

PARTNERS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE BENEFITS TO BE ACHIEVED BY THE

JOINT VENTURE.

OUR POWER GENERATION INTERESTS SUBJECT US TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.

WE OWN INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES. AS A RESULT OF THESE INTERESTS AND FUTURE

INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY MAKE IN THE POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY, WE

FACE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

WE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW ENTRANT TO

THE ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LESS

EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE IN OWNING AND MANAGING POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES THAN MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS AND WE MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL IN OWNING AND MANAGING OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.

IN PARTICULAR, IN THE FUTURE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES.

THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES MAY BE DISRUPTED. THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES INVOLVES MANY RISKS, INCLUDING THE BREAKDOWN

OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR

OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS

OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY. ALTHOUGH OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES

CONTAIN VARIOUS REDUNDANCIES AND BACKUP MECHANISMS, A BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE MAY PREVENT THE AFFECTED FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER

APPLICABLE POWER SALES AGREEMENTS OR OTHERWISE OPERATING AS PLANNED.

THE POWER COMPANIES IN WHICH WE OWN

INTERESTS ARE PARTIES TO NUMEROUS AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES,

INCLUDING LENDERS, SUPPLIERS OF RAW MATERIALS, SERVICE PROVIDERS

AND UTILITIES, WHICH IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ON THE POWER

COMPANIES. SOME OF THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE POWER

COMPANIES TO SATISFY, DEPENDING, IN SOME CASES, ON MARKET

CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2004 WE FACED

DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING AND RETAINING ADEQUATE COAL INVENTORIES

AT MANY POWER GENERATION FACILITIES DUE TO SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS ON

COAL AND A RATIONING OF SERVICES BY RAILROADS. ANY FAILURE BY THE

POWER COMPANY TO SATISFY OR OBTAIN WAIVERS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS

UNDER ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS COULD CAUSE THEM TO LOSE THE BENEFITS

PROVIDED BY THE AGREEMENTS, SUBJECT THEM TO LITIGATION, RESULT IN

REPUTATIONAL HARM OR IMPAIR THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN ADDITION, THE OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE POWER

COMPANIES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE OF ANY OF

THESE THIRD PARTIES TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE

POWER COMPANIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND

EVOLVING ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INTENSIFIED SCRUTINY OF THE

ENERGY MARKET BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE

PUBLIC HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING ENERGY COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE ENGAGED IN ELECTRIC

POWER GENERATION. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POWER

GENERATION, AND OUR OVERALL BUSINESSES AND REPUTATION MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT

OF OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR POWER

GENERATION ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS,

AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, NATURAL

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESOURCES,

SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO COMMIT

SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION

OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES, AND

APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES AT OUR POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CEASE OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS

OF ONE OR MORE OF THE POWER GENERATION FACILITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE

AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THE ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS

AND PROVISIONS OF THE PERMITS AND LICENSES MAY RESULT IN THE

ASSESSMENT OF SEVERE CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITIES AGAINST US AND

THE NEED TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR COMPLIANCE OR

REMEDIATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

RECENTLY ISSUED THE CLEAN AIR INTERSTATE RULE, WHICH IMPOSES

ADDITIONAL CONTROLS OVER POWER GENERATION FACILITY EMISSIONS AND

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OF EMISSIONS BY 2010 (FOR PHASE I)

AND 2015 (FOR PHASE II). WE ARE ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS

LEGISLATION, BUT IT MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ON OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. OTHER LEGISLATION,

RULES AND REQUIREMENTS MAY BE IMPOSED ON OUR POWER GENERATION

ACTIVITIES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ONE OR MORE STATES.

INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS WITH RESPECT

TO OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE

PROCEEDS FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY, IF ANY, MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO

COVER OUR LIABILITIES IN A PARTICULAR INCIDENT. AS A RESULT, OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL OR A HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEM AT ONE

OF OUR FACILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF

UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE MAY

NOT HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST THESE RISKS, AND, IN CASES IN WHICH WE

DO HAVE INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS MAY BE INADEQUATE TO

COVER OUR LOSSES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND

MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS,

CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE

GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN

MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE

SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND

EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. OUR INABILITY TO REMAIN

IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN MARKET COULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES

IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT

NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER

WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY, OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF

SUCH AN EMERGENCY, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS

IN EMERGING MARKETS AND OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND COULD

LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS)

THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE

WORLD. IN ADDITION, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING

HEALTH EMERGENCIES, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD

EXPOSE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY INVOLVED IN EMERGING MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND

WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS,

VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC

AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF

THEIR CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW

OR NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS

OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.
