ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTOR

S

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL,

REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE

BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. THESE CONDITIONS CAN CHANGE SUDDENLY AND NEGATIVELY.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, REGULATORY AND MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH RESULT IN TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, CLEAR REGULATIONS AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: CONCERNS ABOUT SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS; UNCERTAINTY IN U.S. FEDERAL FISCAL OR MONETARY POLICY, THE U.S.

FEDERAL DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT; THE EXTENT OF AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND NATURE OF REGULATORY REFORMS; DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON

THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; ILLIQUID MARKETS; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE OR BASIC COMMODITY PRICE VOLATILITY OR DEFAULT RATES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY

OR UNCERTAINTY, SUCH AS BREXIT; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM, ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

BREXIT, AND ABOUT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS OR ACTUAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS IN CHINA, HAVE RESULTED, AT TIMES, IN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY WHILE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTING THE LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY.

GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND MARKET ACTIVITIES, AND THE SCOPE, TIMING AND

FINAL IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATORY REFORM, AS WELL AS WEAK CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE RESULTING IN LARGE PART FROM SUCH UNCERTAINTY, CONTINUES TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT CLIENT ACTIVITY, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES. PERIODS

OF LOW VOLATILITY AND PERIODS OF HIGH VOLATILITY COMBINED WITH A LACK OF LIQUIDITY, HAVE AT TIMES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES.

OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AND THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CAPITAL,

ADDITIONAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY, LEVERAGE, MINIMUM LIQUIDITY AND LONG-TERM FUNDING LEVELS, REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING, DERIVATIVES CLEARING AND MARGIN RULES AND LEVELS OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS

ON WHICH AND, IF PERMITTED, HOW CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY BE CARRIED OUT BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH INTEREST RATES ARE AT OR NEAR HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION RETURNS HAVE ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED

FUNDING COSTS DUE IN PART TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF PERCEIVED GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE FINANCIAL CRISES. IN ADDITION, LIQUIDITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND

MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES ADJUST TO NEW REGULATIONS.

THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE AND OTHER CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

WILL HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE FINAL INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW REGULATIONS, THE MANNER IN WHICH MARKETS, MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ADAPT TO THE NEW

LANDSCAPE, AND THE PREVAILING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT SUCH CHANGES WILL, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM, CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON

EQUITY AT OUR FIRM AND AT OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION AROUND THE

WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. IN MANY CASES, OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO

OVERLAPPING AND DIVERGENT REGULATION IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS OR PRIVATE PARTIES CHALLENGING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR

BUSINESSES OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. SUCH LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE IMPACT ON THE SCOPE AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, DAY-TO-DAY COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ADOPTED SINCE 2008, HAS INVOLVED AND WILL, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF SUCH REGULATIONS ARE EVENTUALLY MODIFIED OR OTHERWISE REPEALED, CONTINUE TO INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TIME,

INCLUDING THAT OF OUR SENIOR LEADERS AND THAT OF AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DEDICATED COMPLIANCE AND OTHER REPORTING AND OPERATIONAL PERSONNEL, ALL OF WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

IF THERE ARE NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR

CLIENTS, INCLUDING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE, LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS ON LEVERAGED LENDING OR OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RECOVERY AND

RESOLUTION PLANNING, TAX BURDENS AND COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS, THAT ARE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES, GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), COMPLIANCE WITH THESE NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR CHANGES

IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY. IN ADDITION, REGULATION IMPOSED ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR MARKET

PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY, SUCH AS TAXES ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LEVELS OF MARKET ACTIVITY MORE BROADLY, AND THUS IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT

UNECONOMIC FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING OUR BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES AND OUR EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS

AND CREDITORS.

U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND BASEL III, HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY.

AMONG THE ASPECTS OF

THE DODD-FRANK ACT THAT HAVE AFFECTED OR MAY IN THE FUTURE AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES ARE: INCREASED CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; LIMITATIONS ON ACTIVITIES IN WHICH WE MAY ENGAGE; INCREASED REGULATION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON OTC

DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATIONS ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION; LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS; REQUIREMENTS TO REORGANIZE OR LIMIT ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANNING; INCREASED DEPOSIT INSURANCE

ASSESSMENTS; AND INCREASED STANDARDS OF CARE FOR BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE LCR, THE NSFR, REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO LONG-TERM DEBT AND TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING

CAPACITY AND THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING AND THE SPONSORSHIP OF, OR INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS BY THE VOLCKER RULE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY IF THESE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY EQUALLY

TO OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS.

AS DESCRIBED UNDER BUSINESS 

REGULATION  CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS  PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K, GROUP INC.S PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS AND CAPITAL PLAN ARE REVIEWED BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AS PART OF THE CCAR PROCESS. IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OBJECTS TO OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN, GROUP INC. COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM TAKING SOME OR ALL OF THE PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING

INCREASING OR PAYING DIVIDENDS ON COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK OR REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK OR OTHER CAPITAL SECURITIES. OUR INABILITY TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVENT US FROM RETURNING CAPITAL TO OUR

SHAREHOLDERS AND IMPACT OUR RETURN ON EQUITY.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY OF THE INFORMATION OF

CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHERS, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY AND/OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESSES ARE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO SURVEILLANCE, ENCRYPTION

AND DATA ON-SHORING IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY FOR INFORMATION SECURITY, WHICH COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE US MORE

VULNERABLE TO CYBER ATTACKS AND MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF INFORMATION OR TECHNOLOGY.

INCREASINGLY, REGULATORS AND COURTS

HAVE SOUGHT TO HOLD FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIABLE FOR THE MISCONDUCT OF THEIR CLIENTS WHERE SUCH REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE DETECTED THAT THE CLIENT WAS ENGAGED IN WRONGDOING, EVEN THOUGH THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAD NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY ITS CLIENT. REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE ALSO INCREASINGLY FOUND LIABILITY AS A CONTROL PERSON FOR ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR

FUNDS CONTROLLED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN INVESTMENT, BUT WHICH THEY DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS AND COURTS CONTINUE TO SEEK TO ESTABLISH FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES TO WHICH NO SUCH DUTY HAD BEEN

ASSUMED TO EXIST. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COST OF, AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH, ENGAGING IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, MARKET-MAKING, PRIME BROKERAGE, INVESTING AND OTHER SIMILAR ACTIVITIES COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. TO

THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ACTING AS A FINANCIAL ADVISER, INVESTMENT ADVISER OR IN OTHER ROLES FOR INDIVIDUAL, INSTITUTIONAL, SOVEREIGN OR INVESTMENT FUND CLIENTS, ANY BREACH, OR EVEN AN ALLEGED BREACH, OF SUCH

OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE MATERIALLY NEGATIVE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS

PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS, RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS, DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE

EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE) AND MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. THESE INCLUDE POSITIONS WE TAKE WHEN WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, OR COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, EQUITIES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF CREDIT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LEVERAGED LOANS, AND PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT

ARE NOT FREELY TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM

INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS.

THE INABILITY TO SELL OR EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY OR LEVERAGE RATIOS, INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS AND GENERALLY

REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

IN OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO

MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SECURITIES IN A DECLINING MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE ASSET-BASED MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR

INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN TURN REDUCE

THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS

OF OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL OR THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PARTY POSTING COLLATERAL DECLINE, THE PARTY POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO

PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN

THAT EITHER THE COST OF FUNDING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF POSITIONS IS DECREASED.

IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL,

THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS

LIQUID MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS

IN RECEIVING ADEQUATE COLLATERAL. IN CASES WHERE WE FORECLOSE ON COLLATERAL, WE HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE FORECLOSURE WAS NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS, WAS CONDUCTED IN AN IMPROPER MANNER OR CAUSED A

CLIENT OR COUNTERPARTY TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS,

INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES

IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT, BY ACCEPTING DEPOSITS AT OUR

BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BY ISSUING HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS. ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO

OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS

MERGER AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS, PARTICULARLY LARGE TRANSACTIONS, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

OUR CREDIT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN CREDIT MARKETS. A LACK OF LIQUIDITY

REDUCES PRICE TRANSPARENCY, INCREASES PRICE VOLATILITY AND DECREASES TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND SIZE, ALL OF WHICH CAN INCREASE TRANSACTION RISK OR DECREASE THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH BUSINESSES.

OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET

VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES TO

OUR CLIENTS, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS, ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED

BY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING THE SIZE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING, BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE

MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO REALIZE LOSSES IN ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF OUR RWAS, WHICH INCREASES OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING, CLIENT EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER

ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS,

WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE

TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES IN

MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING

VOLUMES OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET

VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW

THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OR A CLIENT PREFERENCE FOR PRODUCTS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH WE OFFER.

POOR

INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO EITHER GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS OR TO BENCHMARKS) BY FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR SELL,

AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS. THIS COULD AFFECT THE MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION OR THE COMMISSIONS AND NET SPREADS THAT

WE EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED NOTES OR DERIVATIVES. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR CLIENTS CHOOSE TO INVEST IN PRODUCTS THAT WE DO NOT CURRENTLY OFFER, WE WILL SUFFER OUTFLOWS AND A LOSS OF MANAGEMENT FEES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY

FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM MARKET-MAKING, INVESTING OR LENDING

POSITIONS, AND UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES, WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT

ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES. MARKET CONDITIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE

LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THOSE THAT OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009, AND TO SOME EXTENT SINCE

2011, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND

HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS.

IN THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS

FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

IN ADDITION, THE USE OF MODELS IN CONNECTION WITH RISK MANAGEMENT AND NUMEROUS OTHER CRITICAL ACTIVITIES PRESENTS

RISKS THAT SUCH MODELS MAY BE INEFFECTIVE, EITHER BECAUSE OF POOR DESIGN OR INEFFECTIVE TESTING, IMPROPER OR FLAWED INPUTS, AS WELL AS UNPERMITTED ACCESS TO SUCH MODELS RESULTING IN UNAPPROVED OR MALICIOUS CHANGES TO THE MODEL OR ITS INPUTS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE POSITIONS THROUGH OUR MARKET-MAKING OR ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OR WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, MAY CAUSE US TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKETS,

WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING OR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR LIQUIDITY, PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE

DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY

IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR OTHERWISE ALLOCATE LIQUIDITY OPTIMALLY ACROSS OUR FIRM, AN INABILITY

TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD

PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH

WE ARE A PARTY ARE OFTEN COMPLEX, AND THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE

ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS.

FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THERE IS NOT GENERALLY A LIQUID MARKET FOR SUCH ASSETS, AS WELL AS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR OTHERWISE GENERALLY LIQUID ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR

IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS OR IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES TO RULES OR REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE, WE ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO SELL OUR INTERESTS IN ILLIQUID FUNDS BY JULY 2017. IF OUR REQUEST FOR AN

EXTENSION IS NOT GRANTED, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL SUCH INTERESTS BY JULY 2017 AND WE WILL LIKELY RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE FOR THOSE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE

SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER

THESE PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH US OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

AS OF

DECEMBER 2016, IN THE EVENT OF A ONE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD HAVE CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS

IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $677 MILLION AND $2.22 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF US AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE

IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RISK MANAGEMENT  LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RATINGS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS, MARKET-DRIVEN, AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE MOVEMENTS. OUR CREDIT SPREADS ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY MARKET

PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY

VOLATILE AND AT TIMES HAS LACKED A HIGH DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY.

REGULATORY CHANGES RELATING TO LIQUIDITY MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND COMPETITIVE POSITION. RECENTLY, NUMEROUS REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR PROPOSED, AND ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION, TO INTRODUCE MORE STRINGENT LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE REGULATIONS AND

OTHERS BEING CONSIDERED ADDRESS, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING, MINIMUM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WHOLESALE FUNDING, LIMITATIONS ON THE ISSUANCE OF SHORT-TERM DEBT AND STRUCTURED NOTES AND PROHIBITIONS ON PARENT GUARANTEES THAT ARE

SUBJECT TO CROSS-DEFAULTS. THESE MAY OVERLAP WITH, AND BE IMPACTED BY, OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES, INCLUDING NEW RULES RELATING TO MINIMUM LONG-TERM DEBT REQUIREMENTS AND TLAC, GUIDANCE ON THE TREATMENT OF BROKERED DEPOSITS AND THE CAPITAL, LEVERAGE

AND RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY FRAMEWORKS APPLICABLE TO LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GIVEN THE OVERLAP AND COMPLEX INTERACTIONS AMONG THESE NEW AND PROSPECTIVE REGULATIONS, THEY MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CUMULATIVE EFFECTS, AND THEIR FULL IMPACT WILL REMAIN

UNCERTAIN UNTIL IMPLEMENTATION OF POST-FINANCIAL CRISIS REGULATORY REFORM IS COMPLETE.

A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

DUE TO THE BROAD SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE REGULARLY ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER CLIENT, AS

WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN

ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

IN ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND INCREASED

REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE VIEWED AS AFFILIATES OF OURS AND, UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE, TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GOLDMAN SACHS AND CERTAIN COVERED

FUNDS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST

IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH US MAY BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY, DISCLOSE AND DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL OR

PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE,

OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS HUMAN ERROR, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

HIGHLY COMPLEX AND OCCUR AT HIGH VOLUMES AND FREQUENCIES, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC

GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS.

MANY RULES AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE GOVERN OUR OBLIGATIONS TO REPORT TRANSACTIONS

AND OTHER INFORMATION TO REGULATORS, EXCHANGES AND INVESTORS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LEGAL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CAN BE CHALLENGING, AND THE FIRM AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY FINES AND PENALTIES FOR FAILING TO

REPORT TIMELY, ACCURATE AND COMPLETE INFORMATION. AS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS EXPAND, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS HAS BECOME MORE CHALLENGING.

AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPAND AND THE VOLUME, SPEED, FREQUENCY AND COMPLEXITY OF TRANSACTIONS, ESPECIALLY ELECTRONIC

TRANSACTIONS (AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SUCH TRANSACTIONS ON A REAL-TIME BASIS TO CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND EXCHANGES) INCREASE, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING, AND THE RISK

OF SYSTEMS OR HUMAN ERROR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS INCREASES, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ERRORS DUE TO THE SPEED AND VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVED AND THE POTENTIAL DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH DISCOVERING SUCH ERRORS

QUICKLY ENOUGH TO LIMIT THE RESULTING CONSEQUENCES.

OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL

TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST

CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN REGULATIONS AND MARKETS, AND INVEST HEAVILY IN SYSTEMIC CONTROLS AND TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS DO NOT VIOLATE APPLICABLE RULES AND

REGULATIONS OR, DUE TO ERRORS IN PROCESSING SUCH TRANSACTIONS, ADVERSELY AFFECT MARKETS, OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES OR THE FIRM.

SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND UPDATES, AS WELL AS THE REQUISITE TRAINING, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESSES, ENTAIL

SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM WITH EXISTING ONES.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE

PROLIFERATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY-BASED RISK AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, OUR BUSINESSES ULTIMATELY RELY ON PEOPLE AS OUR GREATEST RESOURCE, AND, FROM TIME-TO-TIME, THEY MAKE MISTAKES THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS CAUGHT IMMEDIATELY BY OUR TECHNOLOGICAL

PROCESSES OR BY OUR OTHER PROCEDURES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PREVENT AND DETECT SUCH ERRORS. THESE CAN INCLUDE CALCULATION ERRORS, MISTAKES IN ADDRESSING EMAILS, ERRORS IN SOFTWARE OR MODEL DEVELOPMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION, OR SIMPLE ERRORS IN JUDGMENT.

WE STRIVE TO ELIMINATE SUCH HUMAN ERRORS THROUGH TRAINING, SUPERVISION, TECHNOLOGY AND BY REDUNDANT PROCESSES AND CONTROLS. HUMAN ERRORS, EVEN IF PROMPTLY DISCOVERED AND REMEDIATED, CAN RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES AND LIABILITIES FOR THE FIRM.

IN ADDITION, WE FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING

HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS

SYSTEMS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND

CLEARING HOUSES AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL BE CLEARED ON EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, AND THE INCREASED

CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CONSTRAINT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, SATELLITE, UNDERSEA CABLE OR OTHER

COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES FACILITIES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR

SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NATURAL DISASTERS, WAR, CIVIL UNREST,

TERRORISM, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, PANDEMICS AND WEATHER EVENTS.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA,

LONDON, BENGALURU, HONG KONG, TOKYO AND SALT LAKE CITY, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR

EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, AND OUR TWO PRINCIPAL OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE NEW YORK AREA BOTH ARE LOCATED ON THE WATERFRONT OF THE HUDSON RIVER, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT

IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES, INCLUDING A TERRORIST ATTACK, EXTREME WEATHER EVENT OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENT, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT

LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON

COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

A FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, NETWORKS AND INFORMATION, AND OUR CLIENTS INFORMATION, AGAINST CYBER

ATTACKS AND SIMILAR THREATS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND

NETWORKS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, CONSUMER-BASED COMPANIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS REPORTING THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT, CUSTOMER OR OTHER CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IN RECENT

YEARS, AS WELL AS CYBER ATTACKS INVOLVING THE DISSEMINATION, THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF CORPORATE INFORMATION OR OTHER ASSETS, AS A RESULT OF FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROCEDURES BY EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS OR AS A RESULT OF ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES,

INCLUDING ACTIONS BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN SEVERAL HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES WHERE HACKERS HAVE REQUESTED RANSOM PAYMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR NOT DISCLOSING CUSTOMER INFORMATION.

WE ARE REGULARLY THE TARGET OF ATTEMPTED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS, AND

MUST CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR AND DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA FROM MISAPPROPRIATION OR CORRUPTION. WE MAY FACE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATTEMPTED CYBER ATTACKS AS WE EXPAND OUR MOBILE- AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS OUR USAGE OF MOBILE AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES AND AS WE PROVIDE MORE OF THESE SERVICES TO A GREATER NUMBER OF RETAIL CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, CENTRAL AGENTS,

EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF ANY OF THEM IS SUBJECT TO A SUCCESSFUL CYBER ATTACK OR OTHER INFORMATION SECURITY EVENT.

DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE, DETECT OR IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE

PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL CYBER THREATS, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED ARE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED, CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND ARE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED. CYBER ATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING

THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR ARE INVOLVED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME OR TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. THIRD PARTIES MAY ALSO ATTEMPT TO PLACE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE FIRM OR INDUCE EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS OR OTHER USERS OF OUR SYSTEMS

TO DISCLOSE SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR PROVIDE ACCESS TO OUR DATA OR THAT OF OUR CLIENTS, AND THESE TYPES OF RISKS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR PREVENT.

ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE

VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF OUR SYSTEMS, THE PROCESS OF ENHANCING OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES CAN

ITSELF CREATE A RISK OF SYSTEMS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY ISSUES.

IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE

OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSACT WITH US OR OTHERWISE RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

THE INCREASED USE OF MOBILE AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES CAN HEIGHTEN THESE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL

RISKS. WE EXPECT TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, BUT THESE MEASURES MAY BE INEFFECTIVE AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE SECURITY OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE OR BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND THE FAILURE BY MOBILE

TECHNOLOGY AND CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ADEQUATELY SAFEGUARD THEIR SYSTEMS AND PREVENT CYBER ATTACKS COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A

RISK THAT ENCRYPTION AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES, DESPITE THEIR SOPHISTICATION, MAY BE DEFEATED, PARTICULARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT NEW COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES VASTLY INCREASE THE SPEED AND COMPUTING POWER AVAILABLE.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND

WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES AND PROTECT AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH

ALL OF OUR CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION,

MISUSE OR MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO

FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC.

IN ADDITION, OUR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR

ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL

RESTRICTIONS ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO

MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., INCLUDING UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS SOURCE OF STRENGTH POLICY, AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD

IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION

OR REORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS INCREASED REGULATION

AND SUPERVISION OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THOSE SUBSIDIARIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS. CONCERNS ABOUT PROTECTING CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY PERSONS

OR ENTITIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ENTITIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS HAVE CAUSED OR MAY CAUSE A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO RING FENCE OR MAINTAIN INTERNAL TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING

CAPACITY AT SUCH ENTITIES IN ORDER TO PROTECT CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF SUCH ENTITIES IN THE EVENT OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES INVOLVING SUCH ENTITIES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY AMONG OUR AFFILIATED ENTITIES, THEREBY INCREASING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIRED BY US ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO. AND GS BANK USA, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE

SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OWN OBLIGATIONS.

FORM 10-K

FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

THE APPLICATION OF REGULATORY STRATEGIES AND REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS TO FACILITATE THE ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD CREATE GREATER RISK OF LOSS FOR GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS.

AS DESCRIBED UNDER BUSINESS  REGULATION  BANKING SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS RECEIVER UNDER OLA, THE RIGHTS OF GROUP INC.S CREDITORS WOULD BE DETERMINED UNDER OLA, AND SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES EXIST IN THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS BETWEEN OLA

AND THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC UNDER OLA TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON DEBTHOLDERS.

THE FDIC HAS ANNOUNCED THAT A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY STRATEGY MAY BE A DESIRABLE STRATEGY UNDER

OLA TO RESOLVE A LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SUCH AS GROUP INC. IN A MANNER THAT WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE LOSSES ON SHAREHOLDERS, DEBTHOLDERS AND OTHER CREDITORS OF THE TOP-TIER HOLDING COMPANY (IN OUR CASE, GROUP INC.), WHILE THE HOLDING

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES MAY CONTINUE TO OPERATE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY STRATEGY UNDER OLA, IN WHICH GROUP INC. WOULD BE THE ONLY LEGAL ENTITY TO ENTER RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS (AND ITS MATERIAL

BROKER-DEALER, BANK AND OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES WOULD NOT ENTER RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS), WOULD RESULT IN GREATER LOSSES TO GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS (INCLUDING HOLDERS OF OUR FIXED RATE, FLOATING RATE AND INDEXED DEBT SECURITIES), THAN THE

LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE APPLICATION OF A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR A DIFFERENT RESOLUTION STRATEGY, SUCH AS A MULTIPLE POINT OF ENTRY RESOLUTION STRATEGY FOR GROUP INC. AND CERTAIN OF ITS MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES.

ASSUMING GROUP INC. ENTERED RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS AND THAT SUPPORT FROM GROUP INC. TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE

SUBSIDIARIES TO REMAIN SOLVENT, LOSSES AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO GROUP INC. AND ULTIMATELY BORNE BY GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS, THIRD-PARTY CREDITORS OF GROUP INC.S SUBSIDIARIES WOULD RECEIVE FULL RECOVERIES ON

THEIR CLAIMS, AND GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS (INCLUDING OUR SHAREHOLDERS, DEBTHOLDERS AND OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS) COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. IN THAT CASE, GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS WOULD FACE LOSSES WHILE THE THIRD-PARTY

CREDITORS OF GROUP INC.S SUBSIDIARIES WOULD INCUR NO LOSSES BECAUSE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND WOULD NOT ENTER RESOLUTION OR BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT AND

HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S OTHER DEBT SECURITIES COULD FACE LOSSES AHEAD OF ITS OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED CREDITORS IN A RESOLUTION UNDER OLA IF THE FDIC EXERCISED ITS RIGHT, DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS.

OLA ALSO PROVIDES THE FDIC WITH AUTHORITY TO CAUSE CREDITORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY SUCH AS GROUP INC. IN RECEIVERSHIP

TO BEAR LOSSES BEFORE TAXPAYERS ARE EXPOSED TO SUCH LOSSES, AND AMOUNTS OWED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD GENERALLY RECEIVE A STATUTORY PAYMENT PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF PRIVATE CREDITORS, INCLUDING SENIOR CREDITORS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

IN ADDITION, UNDER OLA, CLAIMS OF CREDITORS (INCLUDING DEBTHOLDERS) COULD BE SATISFIED THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR OTHER SECURITIES IN A BRIDGE ENTITY TO WHICH GROUP INC.S ASSETS ARE TRANSFERRED. IF SUCH A SECURITIES-FOR-CLAIMS EXCHANGE WERE IMPLEMENTED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES OF THE BRIDGE

ENTITY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY OR SATISFY ALL OR ANY PART OF THE CREDITOR CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE SECURITIES WERE EXCHANGED. WHILE THE FDIC HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT OLA, NOT ALL ASPECTS OF HOW THE FDIC MIGHT EXERCISE THIS AUTHORITY ARE

KNOWN AND ADDITIONAL RULEMAKING IS LIKELY.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE U.K. AND THE E.U., HAVE IMPLEMENTED, OR ARE

CONSIDERING, CHANGES TO RESOLUTION REGIMES TO PROVIDE RESOLUTION AUTHORITIES WITH THE ABILITY TO RECAPITALIZE A FAILING ENTITY BY WRITING DOWN ITS UNSECURED DEBT OR CONVERTING ITS UNSECURED DEBT INTO EQUITY. SUCH BAIL-IN POWERS ARE

INTENDED TO ENABLE THE RECAPITALIZATION OF A FAILING INSTITUTION BY ALLOCATING LOSSES TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND UNSECURED DEBTHOLDERS. U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REQUIREMENTS THAT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF LARGE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS MAINTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY THAT WOULD PASS LOSSES UP FROM THE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE TOP-TIER HOLDING COMPANY AND, ULTIMATELY, TO SECURITY HOLDERS OF THE TOP-TIER HOLDING COMPANY IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE.

THE APPLICATION OF GROUP INC.S PROPOSED RESOLUTION STRATEGY COULD RESULT IN GREATER LOSSES FOR GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS, AND

FAILURE TO ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IN OUR RESOLUTION PLAN COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

IN OUR RESOLUTION

PLAN, GROUP INC. WOULD BE RESOLVED UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE STRATEGY DESCRIBED IN OUR RESOLUTION PLAN IS A VARIANT OF THE SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY STRATEGY: GROUP INC. WOULD RECAPITALIZE AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CERTAIN MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES,

INCLUDING THROUGH THE FORGIVENESS OF INTERCOMPANY INDEBTEDNESS, THE EXTENSION OF THE MATURITIES OF INTERCOMPANY INDEBTEDNESS AND THE EXTENSION OF ADDITIONAL INTERCOMPANY LOANS. IF THIS STRATEGY WERE SUCCESSFUL, CREDITORS OF SOME OR ALL OF GROUP

INC.S MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES WOULD RECEIVE FULL RECOVERIES ON THEIR CLAIMS, WHILE GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

IN THAT CASE, GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS COULD FACE LOSSES WHILE THE THIRD-PARTY

CREDITORS OF GROUP INC.S MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES WOULD INCUR NO LOSSES BECAUSE THOSE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND NOT ENTER RESOLUTION OR BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. AS PART OF THE STRATEGY, GROUP INC. COULD ALSO SEEK TO ELEVATE THE

PRIORITY OF ITS GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO ITS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS SO THAT CROSS-DEFAULT AND EARLY TERMINATION RIGHTS WOULD BE STAYED UNDER THE ISDA PROTOCOL, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S

ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT AND HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S OTHER DEBT SECURITIES INCURRING LOSSES AHEAD OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THOSE GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS.

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES COULD INCUR LOSSES AHEAD OF OTHER

SIMILARLY SITUATED CREDITORS. IF GROUP INC.S PROPOSED RESOLUTION STRATEGY WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL, GROUP INC.S FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS, INCLUDING DEBTHOLDERS, MAY AS A

CONSEQUENCE BE IN A WORSE POSITION THAN IF THE STRATEGY HAD NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IN ALL CASES, ANY PAYMENTS TO DEBTHOLDERS ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS AND ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO OUR CREDIT RISK.

IN APRIL 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON THE 2015 RESOLUTION PLANS OF EIGHT SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT

DOMESTIC BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND PROVIDED GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS. WHILE OUR PLAN WAS NOT JOINTLY FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT (I.E., NON-CREDIBLE OR TO NOT FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE),

THE FDIC IDENTIFIED CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES AND BOTH THE FDIC AND FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO IDENTIFIED CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS. IN RESPONSE TO THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED, IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE SUBMITTED A STATUS REPORT ON OUR ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE

SHORTCOMINGS AND A SEPARATE PUBLIC SECTION THAT EXPLAINS THESE ACTIONS AT A HIGH LEVEL, WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AS DESCRIBED UNDER AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN, WHICH IS DUE BY JULY 1, 2017, IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT GROUP INC. DID NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC COULD, AFTER ANY PERMITTED RESUBMISSION, FIND OUR RESOLUTION PLAN NOT CREDIBLE AND

REQUIRE US TO HOLD MORE CAPITAL, CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRUCTURE OR DISPOSE OF BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO RETURN CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

AS A RESULT OF OUR RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANNING PROCESSES, INCLUDING INCORPORATING FEEDBACK

FROM OUR REGULATORS, WE MAY INCUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL, FUNDING OR OTHER COSTS AND FACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO STRUCTURE OUR INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OR ENGAGE IN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE DEEM MOST

OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR

DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED

TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. A

FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, DETERIORATION

IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD, INCLUDING A DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY THIRD PARTIES TO SECURE THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US UNDER DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS AND LOAN AGREEMENTS, COULD

RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES.

A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. WHILE IN MANY CASES WE

ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND

THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS. DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND

ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING AND PRIME BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENTS POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING,

UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING, UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR CREDIT

ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

RULES ADOPTED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRE ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES AND

INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTION TO RETAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET, WHICH IS LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST TO US OF ENGAGING IN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING,

SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE

BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE

SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER, ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR GROUP OF RELATED COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE E.U., AND A FAILURE OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. PROVISIONS OF

THE DODD-FRANK ACT HAVE LED TO INCREASED CENTRALIZATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OUR CONCENTRATION OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES. WHILE OUR

ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES, COUNTERPARTIES AND COUNTRIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS,

CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS BOTH HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INTERRELATED.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS

OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE. THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS.

AS A RESULT, WE HAVE

HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATIONS, IMPOSED TAXES, ADOPTED COMPENSATION

RESTRICTIONS OR OTHERWISE PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT HAVE OR MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER OR AT ALL IN CERTAIN OR ALL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON

THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE. THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR RULES, MANY OF WHICH DO NOT APPLY TO ALL OUR U.S. OR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS

MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS

WE TAKE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY INTERRELATED IN THAT A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AMONG A LIMITED NUMBER

OF MEMBERS OF THAT INDUSTRY. MANY TRANSACTIONS ARE SYNDICATED TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OFTEN COUNTERPARTIES IN TRANSACTIONS. THIS HAS LED TO CLAIMS BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND REGULATORS THAT SUCH

INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLUDED IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE MARKETS OR MARKET PRICES, INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS THAT ANTITRUST LAWS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. WHILE WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT SUCH ACTIVITIES,

ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY BY REGULATORS, CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE REPUTATIONAL IMPACT AND CAN SUBJECT US TO LARGE FINES AND SETTLEMENTS, AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES, INCLUDING TREBLE DAMAGES.

WE FACE ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS

INITIATIVES AND EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONTINUE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS AND INVEST IN NEW REGIONS, INCLUDING A WIDE RANGE OF EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS. FURTHERMORE, IN A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING WHERE WE MAKE MARKETS, INVEST AND LEND, WE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

OWN INTERESTS IN, OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS, TOLL ROADS AND SHIPPING PORTS, AS WELL AS PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND COMMODITIES INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE

THE U.S.

WE HAVE RECENTLY INCREASED AND INTEND TO FURTHER INCREASE OUR CONSUMER-ORIENTED DEPOSIT-TAKING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. TO THE

EXTENT WE ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIVITIES OR SIMILAR CONSUMER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES, WE COULD FACE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK, INCREASED REPUTATIONAL RISK AND INCREASED OPERATIONAL RISK DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER TRANSACTION

VOLUMES AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RETENTION AND TRANSMISSION OF CUSTOMER AND CLIENT INFORMATION.

NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES EXPOSE US TO

NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED CLIENTS, COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THESE ACTIVITIES,

INCREASED CREDIT-RELATED, MARKET, SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD OR IN WHICH WE INTERACT WITH THESE

COUNTERPARTIES.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND NON-STANDARDIZED, WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE TO

US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE RISK THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY EXECUTED, THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE

ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY, OR THAT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE NETTED AGAINST OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, COUNTERPARTIES MAY CLAIM THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS WERE NOT

APPROPRIATE OR AUTHORIZED.

AS A SIGNATORY TO THE ISDA PROTOCOL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE REMEDIES AGAINST COUNTERPARTIES AND, AS

THIS NEW REGIME HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED, WE MAY SUFFER RISKS OR LOSSES THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED TO SUFFER IF WE COULD IMMEDIATELY CLOSE OUT TRANSACTIONS UPON A TERMINATION EVENT. VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED

IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE ISDA PROTOCOL, AND THOSE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXERCISE REMEDIES AGAINST COUNTERPARTIES. THE ISDA PROTOCOLS IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICE AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.

DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR DURING ANY

DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS.

IN ADDITION, AS NEW COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF

UNDERLYING CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS. THE PROVISIONS

OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRING CENTRAL CLEARING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVES, OR A MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND TO HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW TALENTED AND DIVERSE EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SUCH EMPLOYEES INCLUDE OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OUR REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITH A CULTURE OF FAIRLY HIRING, TRAINING AND PROMOTING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. AS A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE COMPENSATION THAT WE PAY TO OUR EMPLOYEES IS IN THE FORM OF YEAR-END DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WHICH IS IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED EQUITY-RELATED AWARDS, DECLINES IN OUR PROFITABILITY, OR IN THE OUTLOOK FOR OUR

FUTURE PROFITABILITY, AS WELL AS REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION LEVELS AND TERMS, CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES HAS

OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. RECENTLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED COMPETITION IN HIRING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES TO ADDRESS THE DEMANDS OF NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE IN EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

CHANGES IN LAW OR REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED THAT AFFECT

TAXES ON OUR EMPLOYEES INCOME, OR THE AMOUNT OR COMPOSITION OF COMPENSATION, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS  REGULATION COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

FORM 10-K,

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON

COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE PRA, THE FCA, THE FDIC AND OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPOSED BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION OR

REGULATION, MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN WAYS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO COMPENSATION, OUR

BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS ADVERSE STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. PRESS COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ASSERT SOME FORM OF WRONGDOING (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, PRESS COVERAGE AND PUBLIC

STATEMENTS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVE US) OFTEN RESULT IN SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORS, LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS.

RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING, IS TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE AND CAN

DIVERT THE TIME AND EFFORT OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO

COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO ADVANCE OR SUPPORT LEGISLATION TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ON

THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE NOTE 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED AND NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS INCREASE

FOLLOWING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE REDUCED OUR STAFF. ADDITIONALLY, GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES HAVE BEEN AND ARE PLAINTIFFS IN CERTAIN OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, AND WE MAY FACE FUTURE ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BY THE SAME OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, AS WELL AS FOLLOW-ON CIVIL LITIGATION THAT IS OFTEN COMMENCED AFTER REGULATORY SETTLEMENTS.

RECENTLY, SIGNIFICANT

SETTLEMENTS BY SEVERAL LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, US, WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED. THE TREND OF LARGE SETTLEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OUTCOMES FOR OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN SIMILAR ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHERE GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE LARGE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE USED AS THE BASIS OR A TEMPLATE FOR OTHER SETTLEMENTS. THE UNCERTAIN REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT MAKES IT

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE PROBABLE LOSSES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL DISPARITIES BETWEEN LEGAL RESERVES AND SUBSEQUENT ACTUAL SETTLEMENTS OR PENALTIES.

CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE RECENTLY REQUIRED ADMISSIONS OF WRONGDOING, AND, IN SOME CASES, CRIMINAL PLEAS, AS PART OF THE RESOLUTIONS

OF MATTERS BROUGHT BY THEM AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ANY SUCH RESOLUTION OF A MATTER INVOLVING THE FIRM COULD LEAD TO INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CIVIL LITIGATION, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON

OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS AND COULD HAVE OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ANNOUNCED A POLICY OF REQUIRING COMPANIES TO

PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH ALL RELEVANT FACTS RELATING TO THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR ANY COOPERATION CREDIT IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF CORPORATE WRONGDOING, WHICH MAY RESULT IN OUR

INCURRING INCREASED FINES AND PENALTIES IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DETERMINES THAT WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT APPLICABLE INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION, AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS IN RESPONDING TO DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES WILL ADOPT SIMILAR POLICIES.

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING

AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TRADING TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS

FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY

OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH US, PARTICULARLY

OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING

MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE

INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY

GIVEN THE GENERALLY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR PHYSICAL COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION AND INVOLVE CERTAIN POTENTIAL RISKS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

AS PART OF OUR COMMODITIES BUSINESS, WE PURCHASE AND SELL CERTAIN PHYSICAL COMMODITIES, ARRANGE FOR THEIR STORAGE AND TRANSPORT, AND ENGAGE IN

MARKET MAKING OF COMMODITIES. THE COMMODITIES INVOLVED IN THESE ACTIVITIES MAY INCLUDE CRUDE OIL, OIL REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, METALS (BASE AND PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING

UNENRICHED URANIUM), EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES.

IN OUR INVESTING AND LENDING BUSINESSES, WE MAKE

INVESTMENTS IN AND FINANCE ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF NUMEROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING MANY OF THE COMMODITIES REFERENCED ABOVE.

THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US AND/OR THE ENTITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL,

ANTITRUST AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE

REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT COULD INCREASE THE OPERATING COSTS AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

THERE MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND

INVESTMENTS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS OF CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, RENOVATION OF STORAGE FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND

APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES.

COMMODITIES INVOLVED IN OUR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE

RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO BE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF TRANSPORT VESSELS, STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL

MALFUNCTIONS, FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN

ADDITION, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE ON THEIR PART, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES,

COULD EXPOSE US TO COSTS OR LOSSES. ALSO, WHILE WE SEEK TO INSURE AGAINST POTENTIAL RISKS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM PERFORMING UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS, MAY IMPAIR OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION, REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DIVEST

OR DISCONTINUE CERTAIN OF THESE ACTIVITIES FOR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RECENTLY PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON CERTAIN COMMODITY-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

IF THAT OCCURS, WE MAY RECEIVE A VALUE THAT IS LESS THAN THE THEN CARRYING VALUE, AS WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EXIT THESE ACTIVITIES IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL,

OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND

SUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE IN RECENT YEARS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BY THE U.S. AND THE E.U. ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES IN RUSSIA. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY

MARKET. ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND

NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. FURTHER, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY SUBJECT THE FIRM AND ITS PERSONNEL NOT ONLY TO CIVIL ACTIONS BUT ALSO

CRIMINAL ACTIONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

IN JUNE 2016, A REFERENDUM WAS PASSED FOR THE U.K. TO EXIT THE E.U. (BREXIT). THE EXIT OF THE U.K. FROM THE E.U. WILL LIKELY CHANGE THE

ARRANGEMENTS BY WHICH U.K. FIRMS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES INTO THE E.U., WHICH MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE OPERATE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN EUROPE AND COULD REQUIRE US TO RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS. THE

OUTCOME OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE E.U. IN CONNECTION WITH BREXIT IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. SUCH UNCERTAINTY HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, MARKET VOLATILITY AND MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CONFIDENCE OF INVESTORS AND

CLIENTS.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN

EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES, DEFAULTS OR

THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY, CIVIL UNREST OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS

INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WHILE BUSINESS AND OTHER PRACTICES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DIFFER, OUR PRINCIPAL LEGAL ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT IN THEIR OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE TO RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL PAYMENTS, HIRING PRACTICES AND MONEY LAUNDERING, AS WELL AS LAWS RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS

WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND U.K. BRIBERY ACT. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED AND CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING,

THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY OF OUR OPERATIONS, EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT WE DEAL WITH, GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF SUCH RULES OR REGULATIONS AND ANY SUCH

VIOLATION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY

PUBLICIZED CASES AROUND THE WORLD, INVOLVING ACTUAL OR ALLEGED FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. THIS MISCONDUCT HAS INCLUDED AND MAY

INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE THE THEFT OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BEEN AND MAY NOT

BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC,

TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, SUCH AS THE EBOLA OR ZIKA VIRUSES, OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY (OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY), TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME TERRESTRIAL OR SOLAR WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL

DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, AND COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES.
