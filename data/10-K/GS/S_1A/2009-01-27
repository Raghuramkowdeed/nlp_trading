ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME

OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY. IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, THESE

CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND NEGATIVELY.

SINCE MID-2007, AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008,

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS

GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT

DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A

SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. THIS WAS INITIALLY TRIGGERED BY

DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, BUT SPREAD TO ALL

MORTGAGE AND REAL ESTATE ASSET CLASSES, TO LEVERAGED BANK LOANS

AND TO NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES, INCLUDING EQUITIES. THE GLOBAL

MARKETS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED

VOLATILITY AND

SHORT-SELLING

AND AN OVERALL LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, INITIALLY IN

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT MORE RECENTLY IN COMPANIES IN A

NUMBER OF OTHER INDUSTRIES AND IN THE BROADER MARKETS. THE

DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES HAS CAUSED INCREASES IN MARGIN CALLS FOR

INVESTORS, REQUIREMENTS THAT DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTIES POST

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AND REDEMPTIONS BY MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUND

INVESTORS, ALL OF WHICH HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

ASSET VALUES AND OUTFLOWS OF CLIENT FUNDS ACROSS THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED REDEMPTIONS AND

UNAVAILABILITY OF CREDIT HAVE REQUIRED HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHERS TO

RAPIDLY REDUCE LEVERAGE, WHICH HAS INCREASED VOLATILITY AND

FURTHER CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES.

MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE ALSO LED TO THE FAILURE OR MERGER OF A

NUMBER OF PROMINENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION FAILURES OR NEAR-FAILURES HAVE RESULTED IN FURTHER

LOSSES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DEFAULTS ON SECURITIES ISSUED BY THEM

AND DEFAULTS UNDER BILATERAL DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CONTRACTS

ENTERED INTO WITH SUCH ENTITIES AS COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHERMORE,

DECLINING ASSET VALUES, DEFAULTS ON MORTGAGES AND CONSUMER

LOANS, AND THE LACK OF MARKET AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AS WELL

AS OTHER FACTORS, HAVE ALL COMBINED TO INCREASE CREDIT DEFAULT

SWAP SPREADS, TO CAUSE RATING AGENCIES TO LOWER CREDIT RATINGS,

AND TO OTHERWISE INCREASE THE COST AND DECREASE THE AVAILABILITY

OF LIQUIDITY, DESPITE VERY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN CENTRAL BANK

BORROWING RATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. BANKS AND OTHER

LENDERS HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND HAVE BECOME

RELUCTANT TO LEND, EVEN ON A SECURED BASIS, DUE TO THE INCREASED

RISK OF DEFAULT AND THE IMPACT OF DECLINING ASSET VALUES ON THE

VALUE OF COLLATERAL. THE MARKETS FOR SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS

BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER

ASSETS HAVE FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CLOSED.

IN 2008, GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO INCREASE

LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, BUT ASSET VALUES

HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE AND ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY CONTINUES TO

BE VERY LIMITED.

WE HAVE LONG PROPRIETARY POSITIONS IN A NUMBER OF

OUR BUSINESSES. THESE POSITIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE,

AND THE DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF ASSETS HAVE HAD A DIRECT AND

LARGE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2008. REVENUES

FROM OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES WERE

ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF ASSETS

MANAGED FOR OUR CLIENTS.

THE ONGOING LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS INCREASED OUR COST OF FUNDING AND

LIMITED OUR ACCESS TO SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF

LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED BORROWINGS.

WHILE THE NUMEROUS STEPS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND

CENTRAL BANKS HAVE HELPED REDUCE THESE FUNDING COSTS SOMEWHAT

AND INCREASE OUR ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL AND NEW SOURCES OF

LIQUIDITY, INCREASES IN FUNDING COSTS AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY HAVE

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR EARNINGS AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2008,

WE WERE UNABLE TO RAISE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED DEBT IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF

THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC UNDER THE

TLGP. WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE OUTSTANDING APPROXIMATELY

$35 BILLION OF DEBT UNDER THE TLGP THAT IS ISSUED PRIOR TO

JUNE 30, 2009. IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN WE WILL REGAIN

ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS ON CUSTOMARY TERMS OR WHETHER ANY SIMILAR

PROGRAM WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE TLGPS SCHEDULED

JUNE 2009 EXPIRATION. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS

TO

SHORT-TERM

FUNDING AND TO A NUMBER OF SOURCES OF SECURED FUNDING, BOTH IN

THE PRIVATE MARKETS AND THROUGH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL

BANK SPONSORED INITIATIVES. IN DECEMBER 2008, MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE DOWNGRADED OUR

LONG-TERM

DEBT CREDIT RATING AND STANDARD & POORS

DOWNGRADED BOTH OUR

LONG-TERM

AND

SHORT-TERM

DEBT CREDIT RATINGS, IN EACH CASE WITH AN OUTLOOK OF

NEGATIVE.

WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL 2008. OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS (OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT POSITIONS

MAINTAINED TO ENSURE

SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY) AND OUR CAPITAL RATIOS ARE AT LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER THAN IN THE PAST. NEVERTHELESS, OUR CREDIT SPREADS HAVE

WIDENED AND THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR NEW FUNDING HAS

DECREASED. RECENTLY, WE HAVE RELIED TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT FOR

OUR

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING ON EMERGENCY FUNDING PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED BY

GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKS. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR FOR HOW

LONG THESE FACILITIES WILL BE EXTENDED AND WHAT IMPACT

TERMINATION OF THESE FACILITIES COULD HAVE ON OUR ABILITY TO

ACCESS FUNDING. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

FURTHERMORE, THE INCREASED RISKINESS OF ASSETS DUE TO INCREASES

IN THE VOLATILITY OF ASSET PRICES, COUPLED WITH MARKET CONCERNS

ABOUT THE LEVELS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION LEVERAGE RATIOS, AS

WELL AS FEWER ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, HAVE CAUSED US

TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE SIZE OF OUR BALANCE SHEET AND TO

INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS. BOTH OF THESE STEPS

MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY, UNTIL REVERSED.

CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PROFITABILITY AND SOLVENCY

AS A RESULT OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS, TOGETHER WITH THE FORCED MERGER OR FAILURE OF A

NUMBER OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANKS, HAVE AT TIMES

CAUSED A NUMBER OF OUR CLIENTS TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS

THAT THEY DO WITH US, EITHER BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE

SAFETY OF THEIR ASSETS HELD BY US OR SIMPLY ARISING FROM A

DESIRE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR RISK OR FOR OTHER REASONS. SOME

CLIENTS HAVE WITHDRAWN SOME OF THE FUNDS HELD AT OUR FIRM OR

TRANSFERRED THEM FROM DEPOSITS WITH GS BANK USA TO OTHER TYPES

OF ASSETS (IN MANY CASES LEAVING THOSE ASSETS IN THEIR BROKERAGE

ACCOUNTS HELD WITH US). SOME COUNTERPARTIES HAVE AT TIMES

REFUSED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

LONG-TERM

TRANSACTIONS WITH US OR HAVE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

THESE INSTANCES WERE MORE PREVALENT DURING PERIODS WHEN THE LACK

OF CONFIDENCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WAS MOST WIDESPREAD AND

HAVE BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FREQUENT IN RECENT MONTHS IN THE

WAKE OF GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANK ACTIONS, GREATER

UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENT ACCOUNT PROTECTIONS AND HIGHER LIMITS OF

FDIC INSURANCE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ACQUIRED SOME NEW CLIENTS

AS A RESULT OF THE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED BY OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE RAISED $20.75 BILLION

IN EQUITY, COMPRISED OF A $5.75 BILLION PUBLIC COMMON STOCK

OFFERING, A $5 BILLION PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANT ISSUANCE

TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES AND A

$10 BILLION PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANT ISSUANCE UNDER THE

U.S. TREASURYS TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. WHILE THIS

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL PROVIDES FURTHER FUNDING TO OUR BUSINESS AND

WE BELIEVE HAS IMPROVED INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION, IT HAS INCREASED OUR EQUITY AND THE NUMBER

OF ACTUAL AND DILUTED OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS

WELL AS OUR PREFERRED DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WILL REDUCE

OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE AND THE RETURN ON OUR EQUITY UNLESS OUR

EARNINGS INCREASE SUFFICIENTLY.

IN ADDITION, AS OF THE END OF 2008, THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE

AND JAPAN ARE ALL IN A RECESSION. BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS A

WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS IS GREATLY REDUCED AND

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MANY COMPANIES ARE IN SERIOUS DIFFICULTY

DUE TO THE LACK OF CONSUMER SPENDING AND

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. WHILE LOWER INTEREST RATES, INCREASED

VOLATILITY AND SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN TRADING VOLUMES HAVE

POSITIVELY IMPACTED EARNINGS IN A NUMBER OF OUR TRADING

BUSINESSES, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC AND MARKET ACTIVITIES AND A

LACK OF CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE HAVE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED MANY OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING, MERCHANT BANKING, ASSET MANAGEMENT, CREDIT

PRODUCTS, MORTGAGE, LEVERAGED LENDING AND EQUITY PRINCIPAL

STRATEGIES BUSINESSES. IN PARTICULAR, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

BUSINESS HAS BEEN AFFECTED DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS BY THE

DECREASE IN EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITINGS AND THE DECLINE IN

BOTH ANNOUNCED AND COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID

AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND STRONG

BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH,

BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE;

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF

CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES,

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC

COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL

INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR

PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

OVERALL, DURING FISCAL 2008, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN

EXTREMELY ADVERSE FOR MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE IN THE NEAR TERM.

UNTIL THEY DO, WE EXPECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING

ASSET VALUES.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES,

OUR MORTGAGES, LEVERAGED LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS BUSINESSES IN

OUR FICC SEGMENT, AND OUR EQUITY PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESS,

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS,

DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY) AND

MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO

FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN TRADING POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS,

AS WELL AS CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES. BECAUSE NEARLY

ALL OF THESE INVESTING AND TRADING POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND

IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY

HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND

PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY

TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY

NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY

REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE

ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING

MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR

EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY INCREASE

OUR

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND

INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS.

IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE

RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING

SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE

DECLINING AND IN VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN TRADING

LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE

ASSET-BASED

MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME

CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN

TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE

COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. WHEN

THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL DECLINES, THE PARTY

POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION

WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF

ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF

FUNDING TRADING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF TRADING

POSITIONS IS DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL

THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF

WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID

MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD

TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE

LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK

TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING

ADEQUATE COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO

CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO

BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO

SO. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING

COMMERCIAL PAPER, PROMISSORY NOTES AND

LONG-TERM

DEBT, OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO

FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR LESS LIQUID ASSETS, ON

A SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAKE IT HARDER AND

MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR

AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF

FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING

AND TAKING PRINCIPAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON

ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE

THEIR TRANSACTIONS. THE LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT AND THE

INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME

AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION

TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE

TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

DUE SOLELY TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR

ISSUE.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE

LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED

VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS,

ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY VAR AND MAY EXPOSE US TO

INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

THESE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING

THE SIZE OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS AND INVESTING BUSINESSES CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY, EVEN THOUGH SPREADS ARE WIDENING AND WE MAY EARN

MORE ON EACH TRADE. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING,

BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY (AS HAS BEEN THE

CASE RECENTLY), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS AT ALL OR

IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH

CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK

OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION,

INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF OUR RISK WEIGHTED

ASSETS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCREASES OUR

FUNDING COSTS.

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG

INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET

CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO

CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN

PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE

TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS

WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES

IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES

BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING

VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN

DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING VOLUMES

OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO

TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR

THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES,

PRINCIPALLY IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT

CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM IN

PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTING

BUSINESSES MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF

OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO

EITHER GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (AGAINST

THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR OF OUR COMPETITORS) BY FUNDS OR

ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR

SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS.

THIS COULD AFFECT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT

WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE

EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED

NOTES OR DERIVATIVES.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO CERTAIN OF OUR

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN DIFFICULT MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND, AT

OUR DISCRETION, WE MAY DECIDE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE FOR

REPUTATIONAL OR BUSINESS REASONS, INCLUDING THROUGH EQUITY

INVESTMENTS OR CASH INFUSIONS.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND

STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK

AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND

LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW

PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY

A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK

MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT

ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES.

THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED

DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING

HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES

REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK

THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008, PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY

PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT

DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES

LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND HAVE

CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE

EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR

TRADING MODELS WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR

TO OURS. IN THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR

NO MARKET EXISTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAKE

INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES IN

SECURITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN

ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE

OUR POSITIONS AND THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN OUR

MERCHANT BANKING, ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE

FUNDS, AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF

OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL

OR OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL

THE RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

OUR LIQUIDITY,

PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS

OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR

INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY

THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO

WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND

THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY

AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS

FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR

POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED

IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS

AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER

MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE

INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS,

WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME MATURITY

THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS

FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS,

MARKET-DRIVEN,

AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE

MOVEMENTS. CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS

OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE

INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS IS RELATIVELY NEW,

ALTHOUGH VERY LARGE, AND IT HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE

AND CURRENTLY LACKS A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

GROUP INC. IS

A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS

FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS

ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR

BROKER-DEALER,

BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT

RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO

BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO

GROUP INC. RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD

IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON

ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN

A DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR

REORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE

SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS

OF GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT ASSETS TO GS

BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. THESE GUARANTEES

MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS TO

ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS AND COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME

WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OWN

OBLIGATIONS. SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN

PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR

BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS

BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS

OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN

INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAVE THE BREADTH AND

SIZE OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. WE ARE

EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN

CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD

PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY

SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS.

DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO

THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF

MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENT

POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR

MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION

OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO

THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING

BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE CLIENT-DRIVEN

BUSINESS. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE

OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR

COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT

DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR

ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART

OF OUR CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE

OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE

POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY

OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES

ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER, AND A FAILURE OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT

BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS

MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR

THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES,

INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT FUNCTION AS WE HAVE

ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT

INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL

BANKS, AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT

CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY.

THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR AS A

RESULT OF NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS

AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE

EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS,

REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, HAVE

CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING

PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND

OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE.

WE FACE

ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US

TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND

EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. THESE BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL

CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED

COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED

CREDIT-RELATED,

SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN

WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND

NON-STANDARDIZED,

WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING THE POSITION

DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO

THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE

DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR

OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS

DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS

WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS

INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH

THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES ON

A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, WE

ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE

EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE THE

CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE

PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING

CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE

UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY

TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND

SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS. ANY REGULATORY EFFORT TO CREATE

AN EXCHANGE OR TRADING PLATFORM FOR CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, OR A MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED

DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT

OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF

OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.

A FAILURE IN

OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES,

RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS

AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS

AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO

CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS

WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND

OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR

OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY

CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER

OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR

BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION

VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE

TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO

FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING

HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE

OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH

OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS. IN RECENT

YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING

AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR

EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE

USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND

COST-EFFECTIVE

ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET

PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF

OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE

INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS. FURTHERMORE, THE

INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH

CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES INCREASES THE RISK

THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION MAY CAUSE AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS,

SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR

CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET,

TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES

WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR THE BUILDINGS

OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER

IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE

BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR

PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA,

LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG, TOKYO AND BANGALORE, WORK IN CLOSE

PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY,

GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR

EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, DEPENDING ON

THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT

IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES COULD VERY

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE

LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY

OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS,

OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER,

AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY

PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE

AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR

MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED

THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE

INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE

VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED

AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE

PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP

SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE

UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR

CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER

THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD

PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE

PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN

LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY

AND DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE INCREASINGLY MUST ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A

PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS

CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF

ANOTHER CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC

INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN

THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY

WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

OUR REGULATORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCRUTINIZE OUR ACTIVITIES FOR

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THROUGH DETAILED

EXAMINATIONS OF SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS. OUR STATUS AS A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND

INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH

RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT

ARE OR COULD BE SEEN AS AFFILIATES OF OURS.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE

DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR

REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE

DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MIGHT ARISE MAY BE

AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY AND DEAL

APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL

OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES

AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE

REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT

OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED,

PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR

SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

IN RECENT YEARS, FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE

BEEN OPERATING IN A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. THE

INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENALTIES

AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN

REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT

OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR

THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. RECENT

MARKET DISRUPTIONS HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN

THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL REGULATION. REGULATORY CHANGES COULD LEAD

TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, COULD IMPACT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT

WE HOLD OR THE SCOPE OR PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, COULD REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES AND COULD EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING

COMPLIANCE COSTS) AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL HARM,

AND, TO THE EXTENT THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY CONTROL THE

ACTIVITIES OF FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS, MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO DISTINGUISH OURSELVES FROM COMPETITORS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR BUSINESSES

ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN

PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE OPERATION OF OUR

LENDING AND OTHER BUSINESSES THROUGH GS BANK USA SUBJECT US TO

ADDITIONAL REGULATION AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ACTIVITIES, AS

DESCRIBED IN BUSINESS  REGULATION 

BANKING REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K,

AS WELL AS SOME REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AS WE APPLY BANKING

REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES. THE

APPLICATION OF THESE REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES MAY PRESENT US

AND OUR REGULATORS WITH NEW OR NOVEL ISSUES.

OUR FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AT A

NUMBER OF LEVELS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I,

ITEM 1 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS BASED ON BASEL I AS OPPOSED TO THE REQUIREMENTS

BASED ON BASEL II THAT APPLIED TO US AS A CSE. COMPLYING WITH

THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY REQUIRE US TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR RAISE

CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS

OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

IN ADDITION, FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CAN

INITIATE CERTAIN MANDATORY AND POSSIBLY ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY

ACTIONS BY REGULATORS THAT, IF UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A DIRECT

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR AGREEMENTS

WITH THE U.S. TREASURY AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. IMPOSE

RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS ON US THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

INCREASE DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED

STOCK AND ACCESS THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS.

IN OCTOBER 2008, WE ISSUED PREFERRED STOCK AND A WARRANT TO

PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK TO THE U.S. TREASURY AS PART OF

ITS TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. PRIOR TO

OCTOBER 28, 2011, UNLESS WE HAVE REDEEMED ALL OF THE

PREFERRED STOCK OR THE U.S. TREASURY HAS TRANSFERRED ALL OF

THE PREFERRED STOCK TO A THIRD PARTY, THE CONSENT OF THE

U.S. TREASURY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR US TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS,

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASE OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OR REPURCHASE OUR COMMON

STOCK OR OTHER PREFERRED STOCK (WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS,

INCLUDING THE REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO OFFSET SHARE

DILUTION FROM

EQUITY-BASED

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AWARDS). WE HAVE ALSO GRANTED REGISTRATION

RIGHTS AND OFFERING FACILITATION RIGHTS TO THE

U.S. TREASURY AND TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. PURSUANT TO

WHICH WE HAVE AGREED TO

LOCK-UP

PERIODS DURING WHICH WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO ISSUE EQUITY

SECURITIES.

SUBSTANTIAL

LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US

COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US

SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY

HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

PART I, ITEM 3 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS

AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN. IN ADDITION,

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS TYPICALLY INCREASE IN PERIODS WHEN WE

HAVE REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR

PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO

PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL

CASES.

THE GROWTH OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE

COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE

INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF

LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO

TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE

DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF

THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

NYSES ADOPTION AND CONTINUED REFINEMENT OF ITS HYBRID

MARKET FOR TRADING SECURITIES MAY INCREASE PRESSURE ON OUR

EQUITIES BUSINESS AS CLIENTS EXECUTE MORE OF THEIR NYSE-RELATED

TRADES ELECTRONICALLY. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES

INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO

CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES

GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR

INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS

ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS

OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY

TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR

BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES

AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. COMPETITION

FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES

OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES

HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN

EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FISCAL 2008, WE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COMPENSATION LEVELS. IN

ADDITION, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

DECLINED VERY SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE YEAR. A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF OUR ANNUAL BONUS COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR SENIOR

EMPLOYEES HAS IN RECENT YEARS BEEN PAID IN THE FORM OF

EQUITY-BASED

AWARDS. IN ADDITION, WE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ACROSS

NEARLY ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF THE

YEAR. THE COMBINATION OF THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR POWER

GENERATION INTERESTS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES.

THE POWER GENERATION FACILITIES THAT WE OWN AND THOSE THAT WE

OPERATE, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER POWER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, ARE

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE

MANAGEMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND

SAFETY.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS (INCLUDING BEING REQUIRED TO

CEASE OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES) IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION AND

WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS,

INCLUDING HAVING TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL

EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES,

AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES AT OUR

POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES ARE

ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR

OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS,

PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY,

TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION, THESE FACILITIES COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE OF ANY OF OUR THIRD PARTY

SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS

NECESSARY FOR OPERATION AT REASONABLE PRICES. MARKET CONDITIONS

OR OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE A FAILURE TO SATISFY OR OBTAIN

WAIVERS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING LENDERS

AND UTILITIES, WHICH IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR

SUBSIDIARIES THAT OWN SUCH FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT

HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISKS THAT SUCH FACILITIES FACE OR

THE INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT THE AFFECTED

FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER APPLICABLE POWER SALES

AGREEMENTS, MAY IMPAIR THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

IN CONDUCTING

OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT

IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES

AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE

UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET.

ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE

EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR

REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK

THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO

NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS,

AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT,

CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE

GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE

CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND

INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR

NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING

THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY

(OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY),

TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC

AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL

DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR

OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES, AND COULD EXPOSE OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.
