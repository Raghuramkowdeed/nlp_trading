ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME

OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS. WHILE WE HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE IN EACH OF OUR LAST FOUR FISCAL YEARS, REFLECTING A

FAVORABLE TRADING AND INVESTING ENVIRONMENT AND AN INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY, AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THESE MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, AND

THESE CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY. A

FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH,

STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND

EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE

OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED

BY: OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY;

DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR

BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR

INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN

INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT

RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR

OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL

MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE OR OTHER FACTORS, HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE

FUTURE ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY

WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES

AND/OR

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH CHANGES ARE RAPID,

MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES, AND MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT WE ISSUE OR HOLD. FOR EXAMPLE, BEGINNING IN THE

SECOND HALF OF 2007, DIFFICULTIES IN THE MORTGAGE AND BROADER

CREDIT MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE RESULTED IN A

RELATIVELY SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN FUNDING

COSTS. CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED SIGNIFICANTLY, AFFECTING

VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES AND

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS. THIS NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED PRICES OF THESE SECURITIES AND LOANS (AS WELL AS

COMMITMENTS FOR THESE LOANS), AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SOUGHT

TO DO SO, OUR ABILITY TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND LOANS (AND

LOAN COMMITMENTS). THE SUDDEN DECLINE IN LIQUIDITY AND PRICES OF

THESE TYPES OF SECURITIES AND LOANS MADE IT GENERALLY MORE

DIFFICULT TO VALUE THEM. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE PERSISTED THROUGH

THE END OF 2007 AND WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW LONG THESE CONDITIONS

WILL EXIST OR HOW OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE AFFECTED.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST

AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS, AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING

INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW

TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT

TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF MARKET TURBULENCE. CONVERSELY,

CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, SUCH AS OCCURRED IN

THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A

SECURED OR UNSECURED BASIS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE SEEK TO FINANCE OUR LESS

LIQUID ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT

MARKETS ARE LIKELY TO MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO FUND

THESE ASSETS. IN DIFFICULT CREDIT MARKETS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO

FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST OR WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

RAISE AS MUCH FUNDING AS WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES AND COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH

COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.



OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF

UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDUCE

EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR

UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS. OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED

CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR TRANSACTIONS. THE LACK OF

AVAILABLE CREDIT OR INCREASED COST OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER

AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE

TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.



WE RECEIVE ASSET-BASED MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS AND, IN SOME CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE

INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY

MARKETS OR INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE

OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE

FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS. INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR

ATTRACTIVE CONDITIONS IN OTHER INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE OUR

CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER

PRODUCTS. EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE

ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR

ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR

COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THROUGH REDEMPTIONS, AND IN THE INCENTIVE

AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE AND MIGHT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

TO ATTRACT NEW INVESTORS.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS



MARKET VOLATILITY HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS,

ALTHOUGH IT GENERALLY INCREASED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007. AN

INCREASE IN VOLATILITY INCREASES OUR MEASURED RISK, WHICH MIGHT

CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR TO REDUCE

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS OR OUR EXPOSURE IN A

TIMELY, COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OR IN A MANNER SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET

THE INCREASE IN MEASURED RISK.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND

AS A SPECIALIST OR MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE

THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES

TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN

A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS

AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON

MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES

AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.



THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH

EMERGENCY, OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN

EMERGENCY, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS IN

EMERGING MARKETS AND OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND COULD

LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS)

THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES AROUND

THE WORLD. IN ADDITION, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING HEALTH EMERGENCIES, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL

DISASTERS, COULD EXPOSE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND

STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK

AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND

LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW

PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY

A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK

MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT

ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES.

THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES

REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK

THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS, AND IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN

CIRCUMSTANCES PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME

CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY

MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. IN THE PAST, THESE TYPES OF MARKET

MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING

STRATEGIES AND HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND

THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN

BE EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR

TRADING MODELS WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR

TO OURS. IN THESE CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK

POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE INCREASINGLY INVESTING OUR OWN CAPITAL IN OUR

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS, AND

LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR

OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE

RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR LIQUIDITY,

PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS,

BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INABILITY OF THE

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM

OUR INVESTMENTS, OR

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY

ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL,

SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM

THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION

AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER

LIQUIDITY RISK. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE

CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AS

WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND

OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT

HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY

STRESS. GROWTH OF OUR PROPRIETARY INVESTING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD

TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT

LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS

MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL

SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A

LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS

OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN

DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND,

THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER

PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO

FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO.,

ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR

REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN

SACHS GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE

ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE

PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS.

OUR

BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS

BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS

OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN

INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH AND

SIZE OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. WE ARE

EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST

THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY

SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS.

DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO

THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF MARKET

STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR

CLIENT POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY

REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES

AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE

BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR

A DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT

LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

CONCENTRATION

OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING,

BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING AND LENDING

BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL

TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF

SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

GIVEN PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE, WE REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE

TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING LARGE

BLOCKS OF SECURITIES SOLD IN BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A

MARKETED BASIS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE

MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND

LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING

OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

POSITIONS, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH

SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND

COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS,

INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, RESULTING IN

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER.

THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE

WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING PRICES. OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, WHICH

SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS

AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK, HAS ACCELERATED THIS

CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASED COMPETITION. THIS TREND

TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS

TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. AS WE EXPAND INTO NEW

BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE

COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO EXPAND.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, HAVE

CONTINUED TO INCREASE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TREND IN THE

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND

CO-MANAGERS HANDLING TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD

HAVE BEEN A SINGLE BOOK RUNNER, HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR

BUSINESS AND REDUCED OUR REVENUES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS

SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

FINALLY, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND OTHER INDUSTRY FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE INCREASING USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING, HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE A

REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE

ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET

CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT BASE AND EXPOSE US TO NEW

ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RECENT YEARS WE

HAVE BEGUN PROVIDING LOANS TO SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES,

ORIGINATING AND ACQUIRING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AND

ORIGINATING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, AND WE ARE INCREASINGLY

TRANSACTING BUSINESS AND INVESTING IN NEW REGIONS, INCLUDING A

WIDER RANGE OF EMERGING MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE

INCREASINGLY OFFERING COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

SECURITIZED DERIVATIVES, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS TO A WIDER

INVESTOR BASE, INCLUDING RETAIL INVESTORS, BOTH DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. FURTHERMORE, A NUMBER

OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR PROPRIETARY INVESTING AND

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, CAUSE US TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

OWN INTERESTS IN, OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE

OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF, PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS,

TOLL ROADS, SHIPPING PORTS, ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES

AND OTHER COMMODITIES INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS, BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY

TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE DISTRESSED

ASSETS, AND WE MAY DETERMINE OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO INCREASE OUR

EXPOSURE TO THESE TYPES OF ASSETS. THESE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL

CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED

COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED CREDIT-RELATED AND OPERATIONAL

RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND

REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE

BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO THE

COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO NOT

HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION AND MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION THROUGH THE

PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE

SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION WITHIN THE REQUIRED

CONTRACTUAL TIME FRAME FOR DELIVERY, PARTICULARLY IF DEFAULT

RATES INCREASE FROM THE HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE

TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH

THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED

COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH

THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES ON

A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, WE

ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE

EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE THE

CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE

PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING

CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE

UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY

TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND

SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS.

A FAILURE IN

OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES,

RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR

SYSTEMS COULD LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL

LOSS, DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS,

REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. OUR BUSINESSES

ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A

DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO

CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY

STANDARDS. AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH

EXPANDS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND

INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL,

ACCOUNTING,

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY

FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF

EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS

A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY

TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. THE

INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES,

CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO

FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR

INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE WILL INCREASINGLY

FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR

CLIENTS SYSTEMS. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN

SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND

CLEARING HOUSES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL

FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE

EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT. ANY SUCH

FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS AND MANAGE

OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK.

DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION

OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR, FOR

EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY THE BUILDINGS OF

GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS

WITH A BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES

WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES

IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN

AREA, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG, TOKYO AND BANGALORE, WORK IN

CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY,

GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR

EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, DEPENDING ON

THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT

IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES COULD VERY

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE

LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY

OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS,

OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER,

AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY

PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE

AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR

MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED

THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE

INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE

VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED

AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO

DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE,

AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL

OF OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. AN INTERCEPTION OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT OR COUNTERPARTY COULD

RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL

HARM. WE ARE EXPOSED TO SIMILAR RISKS ARISING FROM THE

INTERCEPTION OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY

CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY

AND DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS. AS WE HAVE

EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT BASE, WE

INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,

INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT

OR OUR OWN PROPRIETARY INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT,

OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER

CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT

MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM.

THE SEC, THE NYSE, FINRA, OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS AND

REGULATORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED

THEIR SCRUTINY OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING

THROUGH DETAILED EXAMINATIONS OF SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS. THERE

IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS HAVE ALSO BEEN

FILED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SPECIFIC CLUB DEAL

TRANSACTIONS WHICH NAME THE RELEVANT CLUB DEAL

PARTICIPANTS AMONG THE DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS

AFFILIATES IN SEVERAL CASES, AND GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE

TRANSACTIONS CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BY THE TARGET

COMPANY AND THAT THE CLUB PARTICIPANTS AIDED AND

ABETTED SUCH BREACH. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE

LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY, AND WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO

FURTHER LITIGATION OR REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN THE FUTURE IN THIS

REGARD.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE

DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR

REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO

ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MIGHT ARISE MAY

BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY AND DEAL

APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL

OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES

AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE

REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS

AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION

BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED,

PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR

SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING

LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR

CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. REGULATORY

CHANGES COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, COULD REQUIRE US TO

CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD EXPOSE US TO

ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL HARM.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AT A

NUMBER OF LEVELS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I,

ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL STANDARDS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. A NUMBER OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO., GSEC, GSI, GS BANK USA, OUR

IRISH BANKING ENTITIES, GSJCL AND GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

OHG, ARE SEPARATELY SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN MINIMUM CAPITAL

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES. COMPLYING

WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE US TO LIMIT OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR REQUIRE US TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE RAISE

CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND

CREDITORS. WHILE WE CURRENTLY DISCLOSE THESE RATIOS TO THE SEC

AND THE FSA AND TO RATING AGENCIES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED OR MAY

DETERMINE TO DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OUR GROUP-WIDE CONSOLIDATED

SUPERVISED ENTITY CAPITAL RATIOS BEGINNING IN MID-2008. IT IS

UNCLEAR HOW OUR RATIOS WILL COMPARE TO THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS,

OR HOW OUR INVESTORS, COUNTERPARTIES OR CLIENTS MAY REACT TO ANY

DIFFERENCE, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN SUCH RATIOS.

FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN

A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED

INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY

IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, CONTINUE

TO SCRUTINIZE COMPLEX, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE

BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS. WE SEEK TO

CREATE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS NEEDS,

AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO, AND CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO, STRUCTURED

TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS.

THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS LED SOME OF OUR CLIENTS TO BE LESS WILLING

TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY CARRY A RISK OF INCREASED

SCRUTINY BY REGULATORS AND HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT

TO A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN ENTERED

INTO BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR FIRM, AND THAT

WERE GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE PERMISSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. THIS

ENVIRONMENT ALSO HAS LED US AND OUR COMPETITORS TO MODIFY

TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND, IN SOME CASES, TO LIMIT OR CEASE OUR

EXECUTION OF SOME TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE

TRANSACTIONS WE ENTER INTO ARE APPROPRIATELY REVIEWED AND COMPLY

WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR THAT THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND

LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH, TRANSACTIONS WILL MAKE OUR

CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS WITH US,

AND WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

SUBSTANTIAL

LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN

SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE

SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN

COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

PART I, ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR

PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO

PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL

CASES.

THE GROWTH OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE

COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE

INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING

SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. AS

OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE DIRECTLY IN

THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR USE

OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

NYSES ADOPTION AND CONTINUED REFINEMENT OF ITS HYBRID

MARKET FOR TRADING SECURITIES MAY INCREASE PRESSURE ON OUR

EQUITIES BUSINESS AS CUSTOMERS EXECUTE MORE OF THEIR

NYSE-RELATED TRADES ELECTRONICALLY. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT

RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND

EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY

LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM

BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, SUCH AS

HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, FOR

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN

EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION. OUR

PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF

HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW

BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS (INCLUDING LAWS

RELATING TO IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING) MAY RESTRICT OUR

ABILITY TO MOVE RESPONSIBILITIES OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE

JURISDICTION TO ANOTHER. THIS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES.

OUR POWER

GENERATION INTERESTS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES.

THE POWER GENERATION FACILITIES THAT WE OWN AND THOSE THAT WE

OPERATE, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER POWER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, ARE

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE

MANAGEMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND

SAFETY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INTENSIFIED SCRUTINY OF THE

ENERGY MARKET BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE

PUBLIC HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING COMPANIES ENGAGED IN ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND

NATURAL GAS.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POWER

GENERATION, INCLUDING HAVING TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION

CONTROL EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER

TAXES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES

AT OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES,

COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US

TO CEASE OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES.

OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF

UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE

MAY NOT HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST THESE RISKS OR OTHER RISKS,

INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, THAT SUCH FACILITIES FACE, AND,

IN CASES IN WHICH WE DO HAVE INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS

MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES. OUR OVERALL BUSINESSES

AND REPUTATION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS, ARISING OUT OF OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS, AS WELL

AS BY THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR

NEGATIVE PUBLICITY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR POWER-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

THE OPERATION OF OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY BE

DISRUPTED FOR MANY REASONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OUR

CONTROL, INCLUDING THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION

EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES,

AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OR EFFICIENCY. IN ADDITION, THESE FACILITIES COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE OF ANY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR

SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR

OPERATION AT REASONABLE PRICES. MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER

FACTORS COULD CAUSE A FAILURE TO SATISFY OR OBTAIN WAIVERS UNDER

AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING LENDERS AND UTILITIES,

WHICH IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT

OWN SUCH FACILITIES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY

PREVENT THE AFFECTED FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER APPLICABLE

POWER SALES AGREEMENTS, MAY IMPAIR THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

IN CONDUCTING

OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT

IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN MANY

COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES

AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS

IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY

BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL

LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT

WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL

LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE

WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN

THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE

MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO

NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS,

AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET

COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR

NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS

OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS

GENERALLY.
