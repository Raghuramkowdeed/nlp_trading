ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN

THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. SINCE 2008, THESE CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, VERY NEGATIVELY. IN 2008 AND THROUGH

EARLY 2009, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SINCE 2011, CONCERNS ABOUT

EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM, AND ABOUT U.S. GROWTH AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING U.S. FEDERAL FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES, THE U.S. FEDERAL DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

HAVE RESULTED, AT TIMES, IN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY WHILE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY.

SINCE 2008,

GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. IN ADDITION, NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO

DEAL WITH WHAT REGULATORS, POLITICIANS AND OTHERS BELIEVE TO BE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES,

RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE, AND GENERALLY INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY. ADDITIONAL TAXES HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, IMPOSED ON US AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

AND ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ENGAGE. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGISLATION (INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT YET IN EFFECT; THEREFORE, THE EXACT IMPACT THAT THESE

REGULATIONS WILL HAVE ON OUR BUSINESSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR. CERTAIN OF THESE REGULATIONS HAVE OR WILL SOON COME INTO EFFECT, AND LIQUIDITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AND MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES ADJUST TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS.

NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO FACE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS DUE TO

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TAX REVENUES, PARTICULARLY FROM CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS INCREASED OUTLAYS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE COST OF STIMULUS PROGRAMS.

GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND MARKET ACTIVITIES, AND THE TIMING AND FINAL DETAILS OF REGULATORY REFORM, AS WELL AS A

LACK OF CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE RESULTING IN LARGE PART FROM SUCH UNCERTAINTY, CONTINUES TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT CLIENT ACTIVITY WHICH, TOGETHER WITH LOW LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON EQUITY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW 2007 LEVELS, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE POST-2008 ECONOMIC,

FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS (INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUTURE REGULATIONS) AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE MARKETS AND THE LEVEL OF CLIENT ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AND THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MINIMUM LIQUIDITY LEVELS AND LEVELS OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPE OF AND MANNER IN WHICH CERTAIN BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES MAY BE CARRIED OUT BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION RETURNS HAVE ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED FUNDING COSTS DUE IN PART TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF PERCEIVED GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE EVENT OF

FUTURE FINANCIAL CRISES.

THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE AND OTHER CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WILL HAVE A LONG-TERM

IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE FINAL INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW REGULATIONS, THE MANNER IN WHICH MARKETS, MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ADAPT TO THE NEW LANDSCAPE, AND THE

PREVAILING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A RISK THAT SUCH CHANGES WILL, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR-TERM, CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON EQUITY AT OUR FIRM AND AT

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES

OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CERTAINTY AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: CONCERNS ABOUT SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS; UNCERTAINTY IN U.S. FEDERAL FISCAL OR MONETARY POLICY, THE U.S.

FEDERAL DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT; UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND NATURE OF REGULATORY REFORMS; DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY

OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR

OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS, RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS, DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE

EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE) AND MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. THESE INCLUDE POSITIONS WE TAKE WHEN WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, OR COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, EQUITIES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND PRIVATE

EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY OR LEVERAGE RATIOS, INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS AND GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

IN OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY

PURCHASING SECURITIES IN A DECLINING MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE ASSET-BASED MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES IN

CONNECTION WITH OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL DECLINES, THE PARTY POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF FUNDING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF POSITIONS IS

DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED

CREDIT RISK TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING ADEQUATE COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS,

INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT, BY

ACCEPTING DEPOSITS AT OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BY ISSUING HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY

ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST,

THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR

TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR

LOSSES DUE SOLELY TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR ISSUE, WHICH MAY IN TURN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL RATIOS.

OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET

VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE

OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR CLIENTS, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS, ALSO INCREASES

RISK AS MEASURED BY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING THE

SIZE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING, BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL

ASSETS AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL

OF OUR RWAS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, BOTH OF WHICH IN TURN INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING,

CLIENT EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OTHER

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO THE U.S. DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT

MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY

AFFECT OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING VOLUMES OR HIGHER SPREADS

OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE

OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY

MAY INVEST THEM IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO EITHER GENERAL MARKET

CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS OR TO BENCHMARKS) BY FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL

ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS. THIS COULD AFFECT THE MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION OR THE COMMISSIONS AND NET SPREADS THAT WE EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED NOTES OR

DERIVATIVES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY

FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM MARKET-MAKING, INVESTING OR LENDING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES. MARKET CONDITIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING

HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009, AND TO SOME EXTENT SINCE 2011,

PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS WITH

ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. IN THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET

VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE POSITIONS THROUGH OUR

MARKET-MAKING OR ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OR WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR HEDGING, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE

FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE

INVESTMENTS.

PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, MAY CAUSE US TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO

COUNTERPARTIES, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKETS, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING OR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR LIQUIDITY, PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS

THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD

PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE OFTEN COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS, AND THESE COMPLEX

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC

MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS.

FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN

PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN

SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US

TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. CERTAIN RATING AGENCIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE DODD-FRANK ACT COULD RESULT IN THE RATING AGENCIES REDUCING THEIR ASSUMED LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

AND THEREFORE RESULT IN RATINGS DOWNGRADES FOR CERTAIN LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, EACH OF STANDARD & POORS RATINGS SERVICES AND RATINGS AND INVESTMENT INFORMATION, INC. HAD ISSUED

A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK ON OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, IN THE EVENT OF A ONE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD HAVE CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS RELATED TO

OUR NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $911 MILLION AND $2.99 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF THE FIRM AT THE TIME

OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RATINGS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE

SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS, MARKET-DRIVEN, AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY

VOLATILE MOVEMENTS. OUR CREDIT SPREADS ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, ALTHOUGH VERY LARGE, HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND AT TIMES MAY LACK A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

DUE TO THE BROAD SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE REGULARLY ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER CLIENT, AS

WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN

ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

IN ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND

INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE VIEWED AS AFFILIATES OF OURS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG OUR BUSINESSES.

HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH US MAY

BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY, DISCLOSE AND DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR BROKER-DEALER AND

BANK SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. IN ADDITION, OUR

BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN

BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL

AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., INCLUDING UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS SOURCE OF STRENGTH POLICY, AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH

SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO

PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

AS A RESULT OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS INCREASED REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS. CONCERNS ABOUT PROTECTING CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY PERSONS OR ENTITIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ENTITIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS HAVE

CAUSED OR MAY CAUSE A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO RING FENCE SUCH ENTITIES IN ORDER TO PROTECT CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF SUCH ENTITIES IN THE EVENT OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES INVOLVING SUCH ENTITIES.

THE RESULT HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY AMONG OUR AFFILIATED ENTITIES, THEREBY INCREASING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIRED BY THE FIRM ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GSEC SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT ASSETS TO GS BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME

WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OWN OBLIGATIONS.

THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA TO

DEVELOP AND SUBMIT RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANS TO REGULATORS, AND THE INCORPORATION OF FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM REGULATORS, MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY LEVELS AT PARTICULAR SUBSIDIARIES OR OTHERWISE INCUR ADDITIONAL OR

DUPLICATIVE OPERATIONAL OR OTHER COSTS AT MULTIPLE ENTITIES, AND MAY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE GROUP INC. GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR RAISE DEBT AT GROUP INC. RESOLUTION PLANNING MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO STRUCTURE

OUR INTERCOMPANY AND EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE DEEM MOST OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL TAXES. ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN CAPITAL ACTIONS OR MAKE INTERCOMPANY DIVIDENDS OR PAYMENTS.

SEE

BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK

OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH

IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE

ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD, INCLUDING A DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY THIRD PARTIES TO SECURE THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO

US UNDER DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS AND LOAN AGREEMENTS, COULD RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF

OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS. DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS

TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING AND

PRIME BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENTS POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL REQUIRE ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES AND INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTION TO RETAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE THE COST TO US OF ENGAGING IN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER, ISSUER,

INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR GROUP OF RELATED COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE EU, AND A FAILURE OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH WE SET

LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES, COUNTERPARTIES AND COUNTRIES, WE ROUTINELY

EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT

CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE COUNTERPARTIES. PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT ARE EXPECTED TO LEAD TO INCREASED CENTRALIZATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR

CONCENTRATION OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS BOTH HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INTERRELATED.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO.

WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE. OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH

MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATIONS, IMPOSED

TAXES OR OTHERWISE PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT HAVE OR MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER OR AT ALL IN CERTAIN OR ALL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE

OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE. THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR RULES, MANY OF WHICH DO NOT APPLY TO ALL OUR U.S. OR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR

THE RISKS WE TAKE.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY INTERRELATED IN THAT A VERY SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AMONG MEMBERS OF THAT INDUSTRY. MANY TRANSACTIONS ARE SYNDICATED TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OFTEN COUNTERPARTIES IN TRANSACTIONS. THIS HAS LED TO CLAIMS BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND

REGULATORS THAT SUCH INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLUDED IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE MARKETS OR MARKET PRICES, INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS THAT ANTITRUST LAWS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. WHILE WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT

SUCH ACTIVITIES, ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY BY REGULATORS, CAN HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE REPUTATIONAL IMPACT AND, IF WE ARE FOUND TO HAVE ENGAGED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO LARGE FINES AND SETTLEMENTS, AND POTENTIALLY VERY

SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES, INCLUDING TREBLE DAMAGES.

WE FACE ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT WITH A

BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT

AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET

CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONTINUE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS AND INVEST IN NEW REGIONS, INCLUDING A WIDE RANGE OF EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS. FURTHERMORE, IN A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING WHERE WE MAKE MARKETS, INVEST AND LEND, WE

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN INTERESTS IN, OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS, TOLL ROADS AND SHIPPING PORTS, AS WELL AS PHYSICAL COMMODITIES, MINES, COMMODITY WAREHOUSES AND OTHER

COMMODITIES INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. DETERIORATING MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE DISTRESSED ASSETS AND WE MAY DETERMINE OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE

TO THESE TYPES OF ASSETS.

THESE ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED CREDIT-RELATED, MARKET, SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING

FROM ACCIDENTS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND NON-STANDARDIZED, WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE

PAYMENTS DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM. DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE RISK THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY

EXECUTED, THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY, OR THAT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE NETTED AGAINST OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, COUNTERPARTIES

MAY CLAIM THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS WERE NOT APPROPRIATE OR AUTHORIZED.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING SECONDARY BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR DURING ANY DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING CREDIT AND

OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS. THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT

REQUIRING CENTRAL CLEARING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVES, OR A MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

DEVELOP DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND TO HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE,

OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW TALENTED AND DIVERSE EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND

MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SUCH EMPLOYEES INCLUDE OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OUR REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITH A CULTURE OF FAIRLY HIRING, TRAINING AND PROMOTING

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRESENCE OR MORE

EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

CHANGES IN LAW OR REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED THAT

AFFECT TAXES ON OUR EMPLOYEES INCOME, OR THE AMOUNT OR COMPOSITION OF COMPENSATION, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS  REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION AND REGULATION 

COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT

TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE PRA, THE FCA, THE FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPOSED BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE

LEGISLATION OR REGULATION, MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN WAYS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION

AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS

A RESULT OF REGULATORS OR PRIVATE PARTIES CHALLENGING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. IN MANY CASES, OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO OVERLAPPING AND DIVERGENT REGULATION IN

DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS ON LEVERAGED LENDING OR OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, TAX BURDENS AND COMPENSATION

RESTRICTIONS, COULD BE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES, GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED

IN THE SAME WAY. IN ADDITION, REGULATION IMPOSED ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR MARKET PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY, SUCH AS TAXES ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LEVELS OF MARKET ACTIVITY MORE BROADLY, AND THUS IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT UNECONOMIC FOR US TO CONTINUE

TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING OUR BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR EMPLOYEES

TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND BASEL III,

HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER UNDER BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF

THE 2013 FORM 10-K, IN DECEMBER 2013, FINAL RULES WERE ADOPTED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE, WHICH WILL PROHIBIT PROPRIETARY TRADING AND WILL LIMIT OUR SPONSORSHIP OF, AND

INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS. BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, GIVEN

THAT THE RULE IS HIGHLY COMPLEX, AND ITS FULL IMPACT WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL MARKET PRACTICES ARE FULLY DEVELOPED, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE AND THE RELATED MARKET CHANGES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND EXPOSE US TO INCREASED

LIABILITY FOR INADVERTENT BREACHES AND REPORTING FAILURES. AMONG THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT MOST LIKELY TO AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES ARE: INCREASED CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; INCREASED REGULATION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON

OTC DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATIONS ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION; THE PROHIBITION ON ENGAGING IN CERTAIN SWAPS-BASED ACTIVITIES THROUGH AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION; LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS; REQUIREMENTS TO

REORGANIZE OR LIMIT ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANS; INCREASED DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS; AND INCREASED STANDARDS OF CARE FOR BROKER-DEALERS IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO UNDER BASEL III MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY IF THE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY, OR DO NOT APPLY EQUALLY, TO OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT

IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE FILED LAWSUITS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF RECORDING MORTGAGES AND DESIGNATING A COMMON ENTITY AS THE MORTGAGE HOLDER IS IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW, AND OTHER AUTHORITIES HAVE BROUGHT SIMILAR ACTIONS OR

INDICATED THAT THEY ARE CONTEMPLATING BRINGING SUCH ACTIONS. IF THIS SYSTEM AND RELATED PRACTICES ARE DEEMED INVALID, IT MAY CALL INTO QUESTION THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE HAVE PARTICIPATED, NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MARKET FOR MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND OUR MORTGAGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES, OR SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS OR PENALTIES.

INCREASINGLY, REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE SOUGHT TO HOLD FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIABLE FOR THE MISCONDUCT OF THEIR CLIENTS WHERE SUCH

REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE DETECTED THAT THE CLIENT WAS ENGAGED IN WRONGDOING, EVEN THOUGH THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAD NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY ITS CLIENT. REGULATORS

AND COURTS HAVE ALSO INCREASINGLY FOUND LIABILITY AS A CONTROL PERSON FOR ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR FUNDS CONTROLLED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN INVESTMENT, BUT WHICH THEY DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE. IN

ADDITION, REGULATORS AND COURTS CONTINUE TO SEEK TO ESTABLISH FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES TO WHICH NO SUCH DUTY HAD BEEN ASSUMED TO EXIST. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COST OF, AND LIABILITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH, ENGAGING IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, MARKET-MAKING, PRIME BROKERAGE, INVESTING AND OTHER SIMILAR ACTIVITIES COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR

NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH

RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO COMPENSATION, OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS ADVERSE STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. PRESS COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ASSERT SOME FORM OF WRONGDOING OFTEN

RESULT IN SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORS, LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS. RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING, IS TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE AND

CAN DIVERT THE TIME AND EFFORT OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO

COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO ADVANCE OR SUPPORT LEGISLATION TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ON

THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CERTAIN REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE SEC, HAVE ANNOUNCED POLICIES THAT MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THEY WILL SEEK AN ADMISSION OF

WRONGDOING AS PART OF ANY SETTLEMENT OF A MATTER BROUGHT BY THEM AGAINST A REGULATED ENTITY OR INDIVIDUAL, WHICH COULD LEAD TO INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CIVIL LITIGATION AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONS WITH SO-CALLED BAD ACTOR DISQUALIFICATION LAWS AND COULD HAVE OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR

OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND OCCUR AT VERY HIGH VOLUMES AND

FREQUENCIES, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY

STANDARDS.

AS OUR CLIENT BASE, AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS, AND THE VOLUME, SPEED, FREQUENCY AND COMPLEXITY OF

TRANSACTIONS, ESPECIALLY ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS (AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SUCH TRANSACTIONS ON A REAL-TIME BASIS TO CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND EXCHANGES) INCREASES, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING, AND THE RISK OF SYSTEMS OR HUMAN ERROR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS INCREASES. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED

AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO

SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN REGULATIONS AND MARKETS, AND INVEST HEAVILY IN SYSTEMIC CONTROLS AND TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS DO NOT VIOLATE APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS OR, DUE TO ERRORS IN

PROCESSING SUCH TRANSACTIONS, ADVERSELY AFFECT MARKETS, OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES OR THE FIRM.

SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND

UPDATES, AS WELL AS THE REQUISITE TRAINING, ENTAIL SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM WITH EXISTING ONES.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE INCREASINGLY FACE THE

RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT

CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL BE CLEARED ON EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION

OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER

AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, AND THE

INCREASED CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE,

TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY,

DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT

BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, SATELLITE, UNDERSEA CABLE OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS,

INTERNET, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES FACILITIES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED, TO NATURAL DISASTERS, WAR, CIVIL UNREST, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, PANDEMICS AND WEATHER

EVENTS.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, LONDON, BANGALORE,

HONG KONG, TOKYO AND SALT LAKE CITY, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE

NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA AND OUR TWO PRINCIPAL OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE NEW YORK AREA BOTH ARE LOCATED ON THE WATERFRONT OF THE HUDSON RIVER, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK

METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES, INCLUDING A TERRORIST ATTACK, EXTREME WEATHER EVENT OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENT, COULD VERY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO

OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. WE ARE REGULARLY THE TARGET OF ATTEMPTED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS, AND MUST CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR AND DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND

DATA FROM MISAPPROPRIATION OR CORRUPTION. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR

OTHER MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED

IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSACT WITH

US OR OTHERWISE RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE INCREASED USE OF MOBILE AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES CAN HEIGHTEN THESE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL RISKS. WE EXPECT TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS.

WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES AND PROTECT AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE,

SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE

INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY

ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH.

SEE NOTE 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED AND NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED

CLAIMS INCREASE FOLLOWING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE REDUCED OUR STAFF. ADDITIONALLY, GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ARE PLAINTIFFS IN CERTAIN OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, AND WE MAY FACE FUTURE ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BY THE SAME OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. RECENTLY, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENTS BY SEVERAL LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED. THE TREND OF LARGE SETTLEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OUTCOMES FOR

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN SIMILAR ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHERE GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE LARGE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE USED AS THE BASIS OR A TEMPLATE FOR OTHER SETTLEMENTS.

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TRADING TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH US, PARTICULARLY OUR EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING MARKETS COULD

CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE INVESTED

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE

RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR PHYSICAL

COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

WE ENGAGE IN, OR INVEST IN ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN, THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING AND TRADING OF NUMEROUS

COMMODITIES, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, METALS (BASE AND PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING URANIUM), EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES.

THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL, ANTITRUST AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR

QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT COULD INCREASE THE

OPERATING COSTS AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE

US TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, RENOVATION OF STORAGE FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES.

OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR

CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF TRANSPORT VESSELS, STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS, FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT

OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE

ON THEIR PART, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. ALSO, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE

INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL,

OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND

MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF

HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE

WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT

NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES,

DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY, CIVIL UNREST OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE

CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WHILE BUSINESS AND OTHER PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DIFFER, OUR PRINCIPAL LEGAL

ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT IN THEIR OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE TO RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL PAYMENTS AND MONEY LAUNDERING, AS WELL AS LAWS RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE U.S.

FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND U.K. BRIBERY ACT. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED AND CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING, THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY OF OUR OPERATIONS, EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS

AND CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT WE DEAL WITH, GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF SUCH RULES OR REGULATIONS AND ANY SUCH VIOLATION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR REPUTATION.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES AROUND THE WORLD, INVOLVING ACTUAL OR

ALLEGED FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. THIS MISCONDUCT HAS INCLUDED AND MAY INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE THE THEFT OF PROPRIETARY

INFORMATION, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BEEN AND MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME

WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE

EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY (OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY), TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME TERRESTRIAL OR SOLAR WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, AND COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES.
