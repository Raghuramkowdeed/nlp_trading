TEAMWORK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE PROVIDE SERVICES IN AN INTEGRATED

FASHION FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CLIENTS.

OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO OUR CLIENTS THE ENTIRE

RESOURCES OF THE FIRM IN A SEAMLESS FASHION, WITH INVESTMENT

BANKING SERVING AS FRONT OF THE HOUSE. TO ACCOMPLISH

THIS OBJECTIVE, WE FOCUS ON COORDINATION AMONG OUR EQUITY AND

DEBT UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES AND OUR CORPORATE RISK AND

LIABILITY MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES. THIS COORDINATION IS INTENDED

TO ASSIST OUR INVESTMENT BANKING CLIENTS IN MANAGING THEIR ASSET

AND LIABILITY EXPOSURES.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO COMPONENTS.

ACQUISITION FINANCING AND CROSS-BORDER STRUCTURING EXPERTISE, AS

WELL AS SERVICES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE FIRM, SUCH AS INTEREST

RATE AND CURRENCY HEDGING.

UNDERWRITING

UNDERWRITING INCLUDES PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF

EXCHANGES, AND WE CLEAR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK,

MERCHANT BANKING AND OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WE MAKE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE RAISE

AND MANAGE.

TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS, TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS. WE

BELIEVE OUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO TAKE RISK TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS DISTINGUISHES US FROM MANY OF OUR

COMPETITORS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO

THREE COMPONENTS: FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES;

EQUITIES; AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC) AND EQUITIES

ARE LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED OPERATIONS THROUGH WHICH WE ENGAGE IN

A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER-DRIVEN AND PROPRIETARY TRADING AND

INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

IN OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESSES, FICC AND EQUITIES STRIVE TO

DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY SERVICE BY OFFERING BROAD MARKET-MAKING AND

MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. IN ADDITION,

WE USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TAKE POSITIONS IN MARKETS, BY COMMITTING

CAPITAL AND TAKING RISK, TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND

TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. OUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MARKETS, COMMIT

CAPITAL AND TAKE RISK IN A BROAD RANGE OF FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRODUCTS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES IS

CRUCIAL TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND TO SUPPORT OUR

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A CORE ACTIVITY IN FICC AND EQUITIES IS MARKET MAKING IN A BROAD

ARRAY OF SECURITIES AND PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE A PRIMARY

DEALER IN MANY OF THE LARGEST GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS AROUND THE

WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND THE UNITED

KINGDOM. WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE MAJOR FUTURES EXCHANGES, AND

ALSO HAVE INTERBANK DEALER STATUS IN THE CURRENCY MARKETS IN NEW

YORK, LONDON, TOKYO AND HONG KONG.

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

BUSINESSES IN THREE WAYS.



FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL

POSITION, WE UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WHERE

SPREADS AND FEES ARE GENERALLY LARGER.



FINALLY, WE STRUCTURE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS THAT ADDRESS

COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

OUR FICC AND EQUITIES BUSINESSES OPERATE IN CLOSE COORDINATION

TO PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH SERVICES AND CROSS-MARKET KNOWLEDGE AND

EXPERTISE.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES IN BOTH FICC AND EQUITIES, WE

ASSUME A VARIETY OF RISKS AND DEVOTE RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY,

ANALYZE AND BENEFIT FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE CAPITALIZE ON OUR

ANALYTICAL MODELS TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE INFORMED

TRADING JUDGMENTS, AND WE SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED

DISPARITIES IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND

FROM MACROECONOMIC AND ISSUER-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

FICC

OUR FICC BUSINESS MAKES MARKETS IN AND TRADES INTEREST RATE AND

CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES AND LOAN PRODUCTS

SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED $70 BILLION OF COMMITTED

EQUITY CAPITAL IN THESE FUNDS, OF WHICH $51 BILLION RELATES

TO OUR CORPORATE FUNDS AND $19 BILLION RELATES TO OUR REAL

COMMITTED EQUITY CAPITAL WAS FUNDED AND THE AMOUNT OF AUM

REMAINING IN THESE FUNDS AFTER DISTRIBUTIONS WAS

$44 BILLION.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE THREE PRIMARY REVENUE

STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS GENERALLY A

SOME OF THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING FROM

TECHNOLOGY

GOLDMAN SACHS IS COMMITTED TO THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT,

MAINTENANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION.

OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES CAN BE BROADLY CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR

EFFORTS.



ENHANCING CLIENT SERVICE THROUGH INCREASED CONNECTIVITY AND THE

PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED, TAILORED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



IMPROVING OUR TRADING, EXECUTION AND CLEARING CAPABILITIES;



RISK MANAGEMENT; AND



OVERALL EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY AND CONTROL.

WE HAVE TAILORED OUR SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS BY PROVIDING THEM

WITH ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN

PARTICULAR, WE PROVIDE GLOBAL ELECTRONIC TRADING AND INFORMATION

DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES COVERING MANY OF OUR FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY, COMMODITY, EQUITY AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS AROUND THE

WORLD.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE CHANGED AND WILL

CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE WAYS THAT SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS ARE TRADED, DISTRIBUTED AND SETTLED. THIS CREATES BOTH

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR OUR BUSINESSES. WE REMAIN

COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY ARE HIGH PRIORITIES

FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN

DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY

IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE FIRMS CRITICAL

FACILITIES AND TO COMPLY WITH NYSE AND NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE KEY

ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE CRISIS MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS

RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, PEOPLE RECOVERY FACILITIES

AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY, WE

HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES,

POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION ASSETS OF THE

FIRM AND OUR CLIENTS. SAFEGUARDS ARE APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION

RESOURCES.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON

FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION

OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE

STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS

PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG OUR

EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE AND HIGH STANDARDS OF BUSINESS ETHICS.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A

CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART.

ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

EDUCATION AND

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF INSTILLING THE

GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW PROCESS. EMPLOYEES

ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES THEY

SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR

TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2006, WE HAD 26,467 EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING 1,326

EMPLOYEES OF GOLDMAN SACHS CONSOLIDATED PROPERTY

MANAGEMENT AND LOAN SERVICING SUBSIDIARIES AND EXCLUDING 3,868

EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES INCLUDE ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD STRICTLY FOR

CAPITAL APPRECIATION, HAVE A DEFINED EXIT STRATEGY AND ARE

ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR

PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER BROKERS AND

DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT

OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY,

DUE IN PART TO U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT HAS EXPANDED

THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A

U.S. BANK. IN PARTICULAR, A NUMBER OF LARGE COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRMS HAVE ESTABLISHED OR ACQUIRED BROKER-DEALERS OR

HAVE MERGED WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE

FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM

LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND INSURANCE TO BROKERAGE, ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING SERVICES, WHICH MAY ENHANCE

THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES PRODUCTS WITH

COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH HAS RESULTED

IN PRICING PRESSURE IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND COULD

RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE,

PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO

BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY

NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS INCREASINGLY SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS AGREEMENTS

TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR OTHER LOAN

FACILITIES) FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH

INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. WE PROVIDE THESE

COMMITMENTS EITHER THROUGH OUR WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES,

PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENT-GRADE CLIENTS, OR THROUGH GOLDMAN SACHS

CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. OR OUR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, PRIMARILY FOR

OTHER CLIENTS. WITH RESPECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE WILLIAM

STREET COMMITMENTS, SMFG PROVIDES US WITH CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION

THAT IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS WE REALIZE ON

APPROVED LOAN COMMITMENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF

$1.00 BILLION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF

CERTAIN CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL PROVIDE

PROTECTION FOR 70% OF THE SECOND LOSS ON SUCH COMMITMENTS, UP TO

A MAXIMUM OF $1.13 BILLION. WE ALSO USE OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN WILLIAM

STREET COMMITMENTS NOT COVERED BY SMFG. SEE

INFORMATION REGARDING THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES AND FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF THE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION PROVIDED BY SMFG. AN

INCREASING NUMBER OF OUR COMMITMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH

INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS DO NOT MEET THE

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES AND DO NOT

BENEFIT FROM THE SMFG LOSS PROTECTION. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

ISSUED THROUGH GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. OR OUR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND

BETTER CAPITALIZED AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE

AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR

BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE

IN THE PRICING OF BLOCK TRADES. ALSO, EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS TRADING SPREADS, HAVE BEEN

UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE

TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH OTHER

ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON

TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD

ELECTRONIC AND OTHER LOW-TOUCH, LOW-COMMISSION

TRADING WILL CONTINUE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE

FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING PRICES.

REGULATION

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE SECURITIES AND COMMODITY

FUTURES AND OPTIONS INDUSTRIES, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE

REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH

WE OPERATE. AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY, REGULATORY BODIES

AROUND THE WORLD ARE CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL MARKETS AND WITH PROTECTING

THE INTERESTS OF CLIENTS PARTICIPATING IN THOSE MARKETS. THEY

ARE NOT, HOWEVER, CHARGED WITH PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF

GOLDMAN SACHS SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS.

BROKER-DEALERS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT

COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS, INCLUDING SALES

METHODS, TRADE PRACTICES, USE AND SAFEKEEPING OF CLIENTS

FUNDS AND SECURITIES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE, RECORDKEEPING, THE

FINANCING OF CLIENTS PURCHASES, AND THE CONDUCT OF

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT THAT REGULATION MAY HAVE ON OUR

BUSINESSES.

REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SEC IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. THE

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC AS

A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY. AS SUCH, IT IS SUBJECT TO

GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE SEC AND TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. AS PART OF A

CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY, GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

(GS&CO.), OUR PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER, IS

PERMITTED TO CALCULATE ITS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK STANDARDS OF

APPENDIX E OF

RULE

15C3-1

UNDER

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

GS&CO. IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER AND AS AN INVESTMENT

ADVISER WITH THE SEC AND AS A BROKER-DEALER IN ALL

50 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE NYSE AND NASD, ADOPT RULES THAT APPLY

TO, AND EXAMINE, BROKER-DEALERS SUCH AS GS&CO. IN ADDITION,

STATE SECURITIES AND OTHER REGULATORS ALSO HAVE REGULATORY OR

OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER GS&CO. SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESSES

ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS

NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENTAL

AND REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN

VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE OFFICES. GOLDMAN SACHS

U.S. BROKER-DEALERS AND ARE REGULATED BY THE SEC AND NYSE,

AND GSEC IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE NASD. GOLDMAN SACHS FINANCIAL

MARKETS, L.P. IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN OTC DERIVATIVES

DEALER AND CONDUCTS CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES.

THE NYSE AND THE NASD, WHICH HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER A

LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR BUSINESSES AND ACTIVITIES, HAVE ANNOUNCED

THAT THEY INTEND TO MERGE THEIR REGULATORY OPERATIONS INTO A

SINGLE REGULATORY BODY, EXPECTED TO BEGIN OPERATIONS IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2007.

THE COMMODITY FUTURES AND COMMODITY OPTIONS INDUSTRY IN THE

UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER THE COMMODITY

EXCHANGE ACT. THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION IS THE

FEDERAL AGENCY CHARGED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMODITY

EXCHANGE ACT. SEVERAL OF GOLDMAN SACHS SUBSIDIARIES,

INCLUDING GS&CO. AND GSEC, ARE REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AND

ACT AS FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS, COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS OR

COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE COMMODITY

EXCHANGE ACT. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF VARIOUS

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE CHICAGO BOARD OF

TRADE AND THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, OTHER FUTURES

EXCHANGES AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION, ALSO GOVERN THE

COMMODITY FUTURES AND COMMODITY OPTIONS BUSINESSES OF THESE

ENTITIES.

GS&CO. AND GSEC ARE SUBJECT TO

RULE

15C3-1

OF THE

SEC AND RULE 1.17 OF THE CFTC, WHICH SPECIFY UNIFORM

MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO EFFECTIVELY REQUIRE

THAT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE REGISTRANTS ASSETS BE KEPT

IN RELATIVELY LIQUID FORM. GS&CO. AND GSEC HAVE ELECTED TO

COMPUTE THEIR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT AS PERMITTED

BY RULE

15C3-1.

AS

OF NOVEMBER 2006, GS&CO. AND GSEC HAD NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS

OF THEIR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION TO ITS

ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, GS&CO. IS ALSO

REQUIRED TO HOLD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF

$1 BILLION AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK STANDARDS OF

APPENDIX E OF

RULE

15C3-1.

GS&CO. IS REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE SEC IN THE EVENT THAT ITS

TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IS LESS THAN $5 BILLION. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2006, GS&CO. HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL AND NET

CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF BOTH THE MINIMUM AND THE NOTIFICATION

REQUIREMENTS. THESE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT

OF PROHIBITING THESE ENTITIES FROM DISTRIBUTING OR WITHDRAWING

CAPITAL AND MAY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE TO THE SEC FOR CERTAIN

WITHDRAWALS OF CAPITAL. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED THREE LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST

COMPANIES UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO

AND DO NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS (OTHER THAN AS INCIDENTAL TO THEIR

TRUST ACTIVITIES) OR MAKE LOANS AND, AS A RESULT, ARE NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE BANKS FOR PURPOSES OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY

ACT, NOR ARE THEY INSURED BY THE FDIC OR SUBJECT TO THE

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT. THESE ENTITIES AND THEIR REGULATORS

ARE: THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY, N.A., A NATIONAL BANK THAT

IS LIMITED TO HAVING ONLY TRUST POWERS, IS REGULATED BY THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND IS A MEMBER BANK

OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM; THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY,

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED GS BANK, A WHOLLY OWNED INDUSTRIAL

BANK, TO EXTEND CREDIT AND TO TAKE DEPOSITS, OTHER THAN DEMAND

DEPOSITS. GS BANK IS REGULATED BY THE FDIC AND THE STATE OF UTAH

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006, GS BANK WAS IN

COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE IT

DOES NOT ACCEPT DEMAND DEPOSITS, GS BANK IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE

A BANK FOR PURPOSES OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT. THE

DEPOSITS MAINTAINED AT GS BANK ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC TO THE

EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW.

OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE

INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE DOMICILED

AND IN THE OTHER STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE LICENSED. A NUMBER OF

OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR LENDING AND MORTGAGE

BUSINESSES, REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN LICENSES AND ADHERE TO

APPLICABLE REGULATIONS IN THE STATES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT THESE

BUSINESSES.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 CONTAINS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND

FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND MANDATES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

VARIOUS NEW REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR VERIFYING

CLIENT IDENTIFICATION AT ACCOUNT OPENING, AND OBLIGATIONS TO

MONITOR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES.

THROUGH THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS, THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001

SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES THAT MAY BE

INVOLVED IN TERRORISM OR MONEY LAUNDERING. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

LAWS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES CONTAIN SOME SIMILAR PROVISIONS.

THE OBLIGATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN

SACHS, TO IDENTIFY THEIR CLIENTS, TO WATCH FOR AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND TO

SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS

REQUIRED THE IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNAL

PRACTICES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT HAVE INCREASED, AND MAY

CONTINUE TO INCREASE, OUR COSTS, AND ANY FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO

OUR PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL

LIABILITY AND REGULATORY FINES.

REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDES INVESTMENT SERVICES IN AND FROM THE

UNITED KINGDOM UNDER THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AUTHORITY (FSA). GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI), OUR

REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER, IS SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS OF THE FSA. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006, GSI WAS IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE FSA CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL BANK, ARE

ALSO REGULATED BY THE FSA.

VARIOUS GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BANKING AND

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN WHICH

GOLDMAN SACHS OPERATES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE FEDERAL

FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (BAFIN) AND THE BUNDESBANK IN

GERMANY, BANQUE DE FRANCE AND THE AUTORITÉ DES MARCHÉS

FINANCIERS IN FRANCE, BANCA DITALIA AND THE COMMISSIONE

NAZIONALE PER LE SOCIETÀ E LA BORSA (CONSOB) IN ITALY,

THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL MARKETS SERVICE IN RUSSIA AND THE SWISS

FEDERAL BANKING COMMISSION. GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE ALSO

REGULATED BY THE EUROPEAN SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND

COMMODITIES EXCHANGES OF WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS.

THE INVESTMENT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FSA

AND OTHER EUROPEAN REGULATORS ARE REGULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES REQUIRING, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS, CUSTOMER

PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS RULES. THESE

STANDARDS, REQUIREMENTS AND RULES ARE SIMILARLY IMPLEMENTED,

UNDER THE SAME DIRECTIVES, THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ARE

BROADLY COMPARABLE IN SCOPE AND PURPOSE TO THE REGULATORY

CAPITAL AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED UNDER THE

SEC AND CFTC RULES. SOME EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES ALSO PERMIT

LOCAL REGULATION IN EACH JURISDICTION, INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH

WE OPERATE, TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH

DIRECTIVES AND THESE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN CERTAIN

COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES TO GOLDMAN SACHS.

THE EUROPEAN UNIONS MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2004/39/EC) WILL AFFECT SEVERAL OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES BY IMPOSING DETAILED PAN-EUROPEAN REQUIREMENTS IN

AREAS SUCH AS INTERNAL ORGANIZATION (INCLUDING CONFLICT

MANAGEMENT, OUTSOURCING AND RECORDKEEPING), BEST EXECUTION,

REAL-TIME DISCLOSURE OF COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS IN SHARES,

QUOTING OBLIGATIONS FOR INTERNALIZED CLIENT ORDERS IN SHARES,

TRANSACTION REPORTING TO REGULATORS, CLIENT CLASSIFICATION AND

DOCUMENTATION, AND

REGULATION OF INVESTMENT SERVICES RELATED TO COMMODITY

DERIVATIVES. EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES WERE REQUIRED TO ADOPT

NATIONAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

COMPLYING WITH THE DIRECTIVE BY JANUARY 31, 2007 AND MUST

APPLY THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND PROVISIONS BY

NOVEMBER 1, 2007. THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS MET THE

ADOPTING DEADLINE AND IS EXPECTED TO MEET THE DEADLINE FOR

APPLYING THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THEREFORE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT

WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL NEW REQUIREMENTS BEGINNING

NOVEMBER 1, 2007, WHICH COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS

OR REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES.

CERTAIN OTHER MEMBER STATES HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED THE REQUIRED

LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND MAY NOT MEET THE NOVEMBER 1, 2007

DEADLINE FOR APPLYING THEM. WHILE WE ARE PREPARING FOR

COMPLIANCE WITH THE IMPLEMENTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE REMAIN

SUBJECT TO CONTINUING REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE

NATIONAL IMPLEMENTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL), OUR REGULATED JAPANESE

BROKER-DEALER, IS SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF

JAPANS FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006,

GSJCL WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS.

GSJCL IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE, THE OSAKA

SECURITIES EXCHANGE, THE TOKYO FINANCIAL EXCHANGE, THE JAPAN

SECURITIES DEALERS ASSOCIATION, THE TOKYO COMMODITY EXCHANGE AND

THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, TRADE AND INDUSTRY IN JAPAN. PRIOR TO

OCTOBER 1, 2006, GOLDMAN SACHS (JAPAN) LTD., THE

PREDECESSOR TO GSJCL, WAS OUR PRIMARY REGULATED SUBSIDIARY BASED

IN JAPAN.

ALSO IN ASIA, THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION IN HONG

KONG, THE MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE, THE CHINA SECURITIES

REGULATORY COMMISSION AND THE KOREAN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY

SERVICE, AMONG OTHERS, REGULATE VARIOUS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND

ALSO HAVE CAPITAL STANDARDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS COMPARABLE TO

THE RULES OF THE SEC.

VARIOUS GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BANKING AND

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF OTHER

NON-U.S.

COUNTRIES

IN WHICH GOLDMAN SACHS OPERATES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

BRAZIL, INDIA AND DUBAI. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BERMUDA REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES.

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE IN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

THE U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES, REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS,

AS WELL AS STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES,

ARE EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN

RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST

ORDERS, OR THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR ITS

DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. FROM TIME TO TIME, OUR

SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATIONS AND

PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED FOR INFRACTIONS OF

VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR ACTIVITIES, NONE OF WHICH

HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US OR OUR BUSINESSES.

IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION ISSUED THE

BASEL II CAPITAL STANDARDS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE

ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS BY ALIGNING REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS MORE CLOSELY WITH THE UNDERLYING RISKS FACED BY

THESE FIRMS. UNDER THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED TIME SCHEDULE, GSI, AS

WELL AS OUR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND

ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE, WOULD BECOME SUBJECT TO THE BASEL II

REQUIREMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE CONSOLIDATED

SUPERVISED ENTITY RULES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

 REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH

PROVIDE FOR GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION, ARE CONSISTENT WITH

BASEL II. COMPLYING WITH THESE NEW STANDARDS HAS REQUIRED

US TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW AND SOPHISTICATED MEASUREMENT

TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY. AS AN

INCREASING NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BECOME SUBJECT TO

BASEL II, NEW INTERPRETATIONS MAY ARISE, AND HARMONIZATION

AMONG REGULATORS COULD THEN IMPACT THE REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED

ENTITY, AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOME OF OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY

A NUMBER OF SECURITIES EXCHANGES. THE RULES OF THESE EXCHANGES

GENERALLY REQUIRE OUR SPECIALISTS TO MAINTAIN ORDERLY

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS IN THE SECURITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE SPECIALISTS. THESE

REQUIREMENTS, IN TURN, MAY REQUIRE US TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES.

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN THE

SUBJECT OF REGULATORY SCRUTINY. THE SEC, NYSE AND NASD HAVE

ADOPTED RULES IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN

EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING PERSONNEL AT

MEMBER SECURITIES FIRMS. VARIOUS

NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS

HAVE IMPOSED BOTH SUBSTANTIVE AND DISCLOSURE-BASED REQUIREMENTS

WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH AND MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.

IN 2003, GS&CO. AGREED TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH CERTAIN

FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO EQUITY RESEARCH

ANALYSTS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE GLOBAL

SETTLEMENT INCLUDES CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS THAT

HAVE IMPOSED ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERACTION

BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BANKING DEPARTMENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESEARCH SETTLEMENT, WE HAVE ALSO

SUBSCRIBED TO A VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON

THE ALLOCATION OF SHARES IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS TO

EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE FSA IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM HAS IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF THE

ALLOCATION PROCESS IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES

OFFERINGS (INCLUDING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND SECONDARY

DISTRIBUTIONS). THE SEC, NYSE AND NASD HAVE PROPOSED RULES THAT

WOULD FURTHER AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH SECURITIES ARE

DISTRIBUTED AND ALLOCATED IN REGISTERED PUBLIC OFFERINGS. WE

CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE PRACTICAL EFFECT THAT THESE PROPOSED

REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, AND THE SEC, NYSE, NASD

AND

NON-U.S.

REGULATORS,

SUCH AS THE FSA, MAY ADOPT ADDITIONAL AND MORE STRINGENT RULES

WITH RESPECT TO OFFERING PROCEDURES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE FUTURE.

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

REGULATION IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD RELATING

TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT ASSETS AND

OUR MANAGEMENT OF CLIENT FUNDS.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION MAY HOLD

CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY

REQUIREMENTS OR INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING

THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED

UPON ITS UNDERLYING RISK.

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH

REGULATIONS ENACTED BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS,

THE EUROPEAN UNION OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND/OR ENACTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS OR EXCHANGES RELATING TO THE

PRIVACY OF CLIENT INFORMATION, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

THESE REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY AND/OR

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME

OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN

THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS. WHILE WE HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE IN EACH OF OUR LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, REFLECTING A

FAVORABLE TRADING AND INVESTING ENVIRONMENT AND AN INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY, AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THESE MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, AND

THESE CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY. A

FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH,

STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT

CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND STRONG

BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR

OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY, DECLINES IN BUSINESS CONFIDENCE,

INCREASES IN INFLATION, CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS

THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS, NATURAL

DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER

FACTORS, HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE

ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY WAYS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE

PAST SEVERAL YEARS. INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH CHANGES ARE RAPID,

MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST

AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS, AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING

INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW

TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT

TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF MARKET TURBULENCE. CONVERSELY,

CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS

AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES

CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ARE

DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECREASE

IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR

UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE CONTINUED, EVEN AS

THE VOLUME AND NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS HAVE

INCREASED. IN ADDITION, THE TREND IN THE UNDERWRITING BUSINESS

TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND CO-MANAGERS HANDLING

TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE

BOOK RUNNER, HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR BUSINESS AND REDUCED OUR

REVENUES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS OR INCREASES IN

INTEREST RATES TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR

MANAGING ASSETS. INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR ATTRACTIVE

CONDITIONS IN OTHER INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO

TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS. EVEN

IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET

CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS

COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND IN THE

INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT NEW

INVESTORS.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING,

BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING AND LENDING

BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL

TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RECENT

YEARS LARGE BLOCKS OF SECURITIES HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN SOLD IN

BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A MARKETED BASIS, WHICH INCREASES

THE RISK THAT GOLDMAN SACHS MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE

PURCHASED SECURITIES AT FAVORABLE PRICES AND MAY INCUR

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AS A RESULT. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF

CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE

INDUSTRY. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS

PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH

TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN

PERIOD.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND

AS A SPECIALIST OR MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE

THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN

ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND OTHER INDUSTRY FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE INCREASING USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING, COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK

EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY

PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN

TRADING LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN

GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE

MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF BLOCK

TRADES.



THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH

EMERGENCY, OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN

EMERGENCY, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS IN

EMERGING MARKETS AND OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND COULD

LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS)

THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES AROUND

THE WORLD. IN ADDITION, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING HEALTH EMERGENCIES, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL

DISASTERS, COULD EXPOSE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A

VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS. OUR TRADING

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT

FROM TRADING POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES.

WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING

AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE

JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE

EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING

OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES,

INCUR LOSSES.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES

REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK

THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS, AND IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN

CIRCUMSTANCES PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME

CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY

MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. IN THE PAST, THESE TYPES OF MARKET

MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING

STRATEGIES AND HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND

THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

MARKET VOLATILITY HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS. AN

INCREASE IN VOLATILITY WOULD INCREASE OUR MEASURED RISK, WHICH

MIGHT CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR TO REDUCE

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS OR OUR EXPOSURE IN A

TIMELY, COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OR IN A MANNER SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET

THE INCREASE IN MEASURED RISK.

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

REPORT ON

OUR LIQUIDITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL

ASSETS, BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INABILITY

OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT

MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF

CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A

GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS

THIRD PARTIES OR US. THE FINANCIAL

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A

PARTY ARE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS

TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS

TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. GROWTH OF OUR

PROPRIETARY INVESTING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE

THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR

OUR POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE

IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL

SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND,

THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER

PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO

FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO., ARE

SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR

REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN

SACHS GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE

ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE

PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF,

OR DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR

OTHER ASSETS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST

THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR

OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY

PURPOSES. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN

INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH OF

THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. AS A CLEARING

MEMBER FIRM, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENT POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE

HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS,

PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT

ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR,

CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS

FROM US IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER

ASSIGNMENTS. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT

INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS,

RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO

THIS INDUSTRY. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY ALSO

BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR

COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER OR ISSUER.

ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES

AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT

TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT

BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY

PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN

TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US

TO TRANSACT WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS, WITH NEW ASSET

CLASSES AND IN NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT BASE AND WITH NEW ASSET

CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEGUN PROVIDING

LOANS TO SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES, INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE

TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND ARE TRANSACTING BUSINESS AND INVESTING

IN NEW EMERGING MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE INCREASINGLY

OFFERING COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

TO A WIDER INVESTOR BASE, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH THIRD-PARTY

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. FURTHERMORE, A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES,

INCLUDING OUR PROPRIETARY INVESTING AND MERCHANT BANKING

ACTIVITIES, CAUSE US TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN INTERESTS IN,

OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION

OF, PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS, TOLL ROADS, SHIPPING

PORTS AND ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES, BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THESE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US

TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS

ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED COUNTERPARTIES AND

INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THESE ACTIVITIES,

INCREASED CREDIT-RELATED AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING

FROM ACCIDENTS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS

WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK

AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES, THAT REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO

THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE

DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

AND MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION THROUGH THE

PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE

SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION WITHIN THE REQUIRED

CONTRACTUAL TIME FRAME FOR DELIVERY. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO

FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT

IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL

RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH

THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES ON

A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, WE

ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE

EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE THE

CONTRACT.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR

THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR

BUSINESSES, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR

SYSTEMS COULD LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL

LOSS, DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS,

REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. OUR BUSINESSES

ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY

BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY

COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES.

THESE TRANSACTIONS OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC

GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. OUR

FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATING

SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME

DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY

BEYOND OUR CONTROL, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS

THESE TRANSACTIONS. THE INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE

AN INCREASING VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO CONSTRAIN OUR

ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR TERMINATION OF

ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES

TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS

GROWS, WE WILL INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE

WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS. IN RECENT YEARS,

THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS,

EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR TERMINATION OF THE PARTICULAR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE

EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE OR TERMINATION. ANY SUCH FAILURE OR

TERMINATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT

TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS AND MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

RISK.

DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION

OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR, FOR

EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY THE BUILDINGS OF

GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS

WITH A BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES

WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES

IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING NEW YORK, LONDON, FRANKFURT,

HONG KONG, TOKYO AND BANGALORE, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE

ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE

LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY

OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS,

OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER,

AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY

PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE

AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR

MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED

THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE

INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE

VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED

AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO

DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE IN

PLACE SECURE CAPABILITIES FOR ALL OF OUR CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES. AN INTERCEPTION OR MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL,

CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BEING SENT TO OR

RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT OR COUNTERPARTY COULD RESULT IN LEGAL

LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM. WE ARE

EXPOSED TO SIMILAR RISKS ARISING FROM THE INTERCEPTION OF

PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SENT TO OR

RECEIVED FROM, OR THE MISUSE OR MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL,

CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY, VENDORS, SERVICE

PROVIDERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY RECEIVE SUCH

INFORMATION FROM US, AND OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD

PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO

APPROPRIATELY DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS. AS WE HAVE

EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT BASE, WE

INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,

INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT

OR OUR OWN PROPRIETARY INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT,

OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER

CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT

MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM.

THE SEC, THE NASD, OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS AND

REGULATORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM AND JAPAN, HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO INCREASE

THEIR

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SCRUTINY OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THROUGH

DETAILED EXAMINATIONS OF SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN

RECENT PUBLIC REPORTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS

CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING JOINT PARTICIPATION BY

CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

CERTAIN LEVERAGED BUYOUTS, REFERRED TO AS CLUB

DEALS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST FIRMS

OTHER THAN GOLDMAN SACHS ALLEGE THE VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS

ARISING FROM THEIR CLUB DEAL ARRANGEMENTS. A NUMBER

OF CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS HAVE ALSO BEEN FILED IN CONNECTION

WITH CERTAIN SPECIFIC CLUB DEAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH

NAME THE RELEVANT CLUB DEAL PARTICIPANTS AMONG THE

DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS AFFILIATES IN SEVERAL CASES,

AND GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE TRANSACTIONS CONSTITUTE A BREACH

OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BY THE TARGET COMPANY AND THAT THE

CLUB PARTICIPANTS AIDED AND ABETTED SUCH BREACH. WE

MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO FURTHER LITIGATION OR REGULATORY SCRUTINY

IN THE FUTURE IN THIS REGARD.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO

PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG OUR

BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE

DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MIGHT ARISE MAY BE

AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO DEAL APPROPRIATELY

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED

CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS

AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION

BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED,

PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR

SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING

LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR

CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. REGULATORY

CHANGES COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, COULD REQUIRE US TO

CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD EXPOSE US TO

ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL HARM.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM

10-K.

FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN

A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED

INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY

IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, CONTINUE

TO SCRUTINIZE COMPLEX, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE

BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS. WE SEEK TO

CREATE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS NEEDS,

AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO, AND CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO, STRUCTURED

TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS.

THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS LED SOME OF OUR CLIENTS TO BE LESS WILLING

TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY CARRY A RISK OF INCREASED

SCRUTINY BY REGULATORS AND HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT

TO A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN ENTERED

INTO BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR FIRM, AND THAT

WERE GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE PERMISSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. THIS

ENVIRONMENT ALSO HAS LED US AND OUR COMPETITORS TO MODIFY

TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND, IN SOME CASES, TO LIMIT OR CEASE OUR

EXECUTION OF SOME TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE

TRANSACTIONS WE ENTER INTO ARE APPROPRIATELY REVIEWED AND COMPLY

WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR THAT THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND

LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH, TRANSACTIONS

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WILL MAKE OUR CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO THESE

TRANSACTIONS WITH US, AND WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY

ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO

GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS

PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

PART I, ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM

10-K

FOR A

DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED.

FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES AND OTHER REGULATORY

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE NASD, HAVE MADE INFORMATIONAL REQUESTS

REGARDING MARKET TIMING, LATE TRADING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

BROADLY ACROSS ALL OF THE MAJOR FUND COMPANIES AND

BROKER-DEALERS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT

WE HAVE IN PLACE REASONABLE MEASURES TO DETECT AND DETER

DISRUPTIVE AND ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES AND COMPLY WITH

APPLICABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE CANNOT PREDICT

THE COURSE THAT THESE INQUIRIES AND AREAS OF FOCUS MAY TAKE OR

THE IMPACT THAT ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING MUTUAL

FUNDS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESSES.

ALSO, IN MARCH 2004, CERTAIN NYSE SPECIALIST FIRMS, INCLUDING

OUR SPECIALIST UNIT, AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC AND

NYSE TO RESOLVE CHARGES THAT THE FIRMS VIOLATED CERTAIN FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS AND NYSE RULES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR

ACTIVITIES AS NYSE SPECIALISTS DURING THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH

2003. THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT RESOLVE THE RELATED CIVIL ACTIONS

DISCUSSED UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  SPECIALIST

MATTERS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM

10-K,

OR

POTENTIAL REGULATORY CHARGES AGAINST INDIVIDUALS. IN ADDITION,

WE HAVE RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM REGIONAL STOCK

EXCHANGES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES REGARDING SPECIALIST ACTIVITIES.

AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT AND ANY RELATED DEVELOPMENTS,

OTHER INVESTIGATIONS OR ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING

SPECIALISTS, OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

AND THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPAIRED.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR

PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO

PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL

CASES.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE

WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING PRICES. OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, WHICH

SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS

AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK, HAS ACCELERATED THIS

CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASED COMPETITION. THIS TREND

TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS

TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. AS OUR BUSINESS EXPANDS INTO

NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS, WE WILL FACE

COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO EXPAND.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF

NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY

INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE

INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING

SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING MARKETS COULD

CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. THE NYSES

ADOPTION OF ITS HYBRID MARKET FOR TRADING SECURITIES MAY

INCREASE PRESSURE ON OUR EQUITIES BUSINESS AS CUSTOMERS EXECUTE

MORE OF THEIR NYSE-RELATED TRADES ELECTRONICALLY. WE HAVE

INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE

SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT,

PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM

ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE

TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM

BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, SUCH AS

HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, FOR

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING

MARKETS. OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND

EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED

ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO EXPAND

INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW

EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. IN

ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS (INCLUDING LAWS RELATING TO

IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING) MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO MOVE

RESPONSIBILITIES OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO ANOTHER.

THIS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES OR POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES.

OUR POWER GENERATION INTERESTS SUBJECT US TO THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.

THE OPERATION OF OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY BE

DISRUPTED FOR MANY REASONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OUR

CONTROL, INCLUDING THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION

EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES,

AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY.

IN ADDITION, THESE FACILITIES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE

FAILURE OF ANY OF THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO

PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO

OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR OPERATION AT REASONABLE

PRICES. MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE A FAILURE

TO SATISFY OR OBTAIN WAIVERS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD

PARTIES, INCLUDING LENDERS AND UTILITIES, WHICH IMPOSE

SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT OWN SUCH

FACILITIES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT THE

AFFECTED FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER APPLICABLE POWER SALES

AGREEMENTS, MAY IMPAIR THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND

EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY,

WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE

REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS,

INTENSIFIED SCRUTINY OF THE ENERGY MARKET BY FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE PUBLIC HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED

REGULATORY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING COMPANIES ENGAGED IN

ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO POWER GENERATION, INCLUDING HAVING TO COMMIT

SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,

INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION

FEES, AND APPLICATION FOR,

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES AT OUR POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CEASE OR CURTAIL

OPERATIONS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.

OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF

UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE

MAY NOT HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST THESE RISKS OR OTHER RISKS,

INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, THAT SUCH FACILITIES FACE, AND,

IN CASES IN WHICH WE DO HAVE INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS

MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES. OUR OVERALL BUSINESSES

AND REPUTATION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS, ARISING OUT OF OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS, AS WELL

AS BY THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER

RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN MANY

COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES

AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING,

AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. OUR INABILITY TO

REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET

COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR

BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE

STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY INVOLVED IN

EMERGING MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND

TO CONTINUE. IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET

COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR

NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS

OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS

GENERALLY.

PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT 85 BROAD STREET,

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AND COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION

RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF LEASED SPACE, PURSUANT TO A LEASE

AGREEMENT EXPIRING IN JUNE 2008 (WITH OPTIONS TO RENEW FOR UP TO

20 ADDITIONAL YEARS). WE ALSO OCCUPY OVER

680,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET AT ONE NEW YORK PLAZA UNDER

LEASE AGREEMENTS EXPIRING PRIMARILY IN 2009 (WITH OPTIONS TO

RENEW FOR UP TO FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS), AND WE LEASE SPACE AT

VARIOUS OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA. IN

TOTAL, WE LEASE APPROXIMATELY 3.9 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE

FEET IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA.

IN AUGUST 2005, WE LEASED FROM BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY A

PARCEL OF LAND IN LOWER MANHATTAN, PURSUANT TO A GROUND LEASE.

WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING A 2.1 MILLION

GROSS-SQUARE-FOOT OFFICE BUILDING ON THE SITE THAT WILL SERVE AS

OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS. UNDER THE LEASE, BATTERY PARK CITY

AUTHORITY HOLDS TITLE TO ALL IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE OFFICE

BUILDING, SUBJECT TO GOLDMAN SACHS RIGHT OF EXCLUSIVE

POSSESSION AND USE FOR THE

64-YEAR

DURATION OF THE

LEASE.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GROUND LEASE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE A

LUMP-SUM GROUND RENT PAYMENT OF $161 MILLION BY JUNE 2007

AND TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PERIODIC PAYMENTS DURING THE TERM OF THE

LEASE. WE ARE OBLIGATED UNDER THE GROUND LEASE TO CONSTRUCT THE

OFFICE BUILDING BY 2011 (SUBJECT

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO EXTENSIONS IN THE CASE OF FORCE MAJEURE) IN ACCORDANCE WITH

CERTAIN PRE-APPROVED DESIGN STANDARDS. CONSTRUCTION BEGAN ON THE

BUILDING IN NOVEMBER 2005, AND WE EXPECT INITIAL OCCUPANCY OF

THE BUILDING BY 2009. THE BUILDING IS PROJECTED TO COST BETWEEN

$2.3 BILLION AND $2.5 BILLION, INCLUDING ACQUISITION,

DEVELOPMENT, FITOUT AND FURNISHINGS, FINANCING AND OTHER RELATED

COSTS.

WE ARE RECEIVING A NUMBER OF BENEFITS FROM THE CITY AND STATE OF

NEW YORK BASED ON OUR AGREEMENT TO CONSTRUCT OUR WORLD

HEADQUARTERS IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THESE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO

RECOUPMENT OR RECAPTURE IF WE DO NOT PROCEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THE CITY AND STATE OF NEW YORK.

WE OWN AN OFFICE BUILDING AT 30 HUDSON STREET IN JERSEY CITY,

NEW JERSEY, WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION GROSS

SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE, AND WE OWN OVER 300,000 SQUARE

FEET OF ADDITIONAL SPACE SPREAD AMONG THREE LOCATIONS IN NEW

YORK AND NEW JERSEY. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL OFFICES IN THE U.S. AND

ELSEWHERE IN THE AMERICAS, WHICH TOGETHER COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY

2.3 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF LEASED SPACE.

IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, WE HAVE OFFICES THAT

TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET. OUR

EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN LONDON AT PETERBOROUGH

COURT, PURSUANT TO A LEASE EXPIRING IN 2026. IN TOTAL, WE LEASE

APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET IN LONDON

THROUGH VARIOUS LEASES, RELATING TO VARIOUS PROPERTIES.

IN ASIA, WE HAVE OFFICES THAT TOTAL APPROXIMATELY

1.2 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET. OUR HEADQUARTERS IN THIS

REGION ARE IN TOKYO, AT THE ROPPONGI HILLS MORI TOWER, AND IN

HONG KONG, AT THE CHEUNG KONG CENTER. IN TOKYO, WE CURRENTLY

LEASE APPROXIMATELY 390,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THROUGH A

LEASE THAT WILL EXPIRE IN 2018. IN HONG KONG, WE CURRENTLY LEASE

APPROXIMATELY 220,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET UNDER LEASE

AGREEMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN FISCAL 2012.

OUR OCCUPANCY EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OFFICE

SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. THIS EXCESS

SPACE, THE COST OF WHICH IS CHARGED TO EARNINGS AS INCURRED, IS

BEING HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH OR TO REPLACE CURRENTLY OCCUPIED

SPACE THAT WE MAY EXIT IN THE FUTURE. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE OUR

CURRENT AND FUTURE SPACE CAPACITY IN RELATION TO CURRENT AND

PROJECTED STAFFING LEVELS. WE MAY INCUR EXIT COSTS IN 2007 AND

THEREAFTER TO THE EXTENT WE (I) REDUCE OUR SPACE CAPACITY

OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $19.69 FOR 2006,

COMPARED WITH $11.21 FOR 2005. RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY

(1)

WAS 39.8% AND RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

AND

RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS

34.4%

(2).

IN 2006, WE GENERATED RECORD DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE,

WHICH EXCEEDED THE PRIOR YEAR RECORD RESULTS BY 76%. EACH OF OUR

THREE SEGMENTS ACHIEVED RECORD RESULTS. THE INCREASE IN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC),

EQUITIES AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. THE INCREASE IN FICC

REFLECTED PARTICULARLY STRONG PERFORMANCES ACROSS ALL MAJOR

BUSINESSES. DURING 2006, FICC OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. THE INCREASE IN EQUITIES PRIMARILY

REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR CUSTOMER

FRANCHISE BUSINESS. DURING 2006, EQUITIES OPERATED IN A

FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES AND FAVORABLE MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES, ALTHOUGH VOLATILITY LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOW. IN

FICC AND EQUITIES, AS A RESULT OF THE FAVORABLE TRADING AND

INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, WE

INCREASED OUR MARKET RISK, PARTICULARLY IN EQUITY PRODUCTS, TO

CAPITALIZE ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES. WE GREW OUR BALANCE SHEET AS

NEEDED TO SUPPORT THESE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT

INCREASED ACTIVITY IN SECURITIES SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT GAIN RELATED TO

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF INDUSTRIAL AND

COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA LIMITED (ICBC) AND HIGHER GAINS

AND OVERRIDES FROM OTHER PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A SMALLER, BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT, GAIN RELATED TO OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUMITOMO MITSUI

FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG). THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING

WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING AND

FINANCIAL ADVISORY, AS WE BENEFITED FROM STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY

LEVELS, REFLECTING FAVORABLE EQUITY AND FINANCING MARKETS,

STRONG CEO CONFIDENCE AND GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SPONSOR ACTIVITY.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER GLOBAL CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES SERVICES. ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT INCREASED $144 BILLION OR 27% TO A RECORD

$676 BILLION, INCLUDING NET ASSET INFLOWS OF

$94 BILLION DURING 2006.

LOOKING FORWARD TO 2007, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BACKLOG AT THE

END OF 2006 WAS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE

2000

(3).

IN ADDITION TO POTENTIAL GROWTH IN THE BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC

AREAS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE, THE EXPANSION OF THE

ECONOMIES OF CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA AND BRAZIL, AS WELL AS THOSE

OF THE MIDDLE EAST OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO INCREASE

OUR PRESENCE IN THOSE MARKETS. IN INVESTMENT BANKING, THERE IS

GROWTH POTENTIAL TO BROADEN OUR CLIENT BASE BY PROVIDING

STRATEGIC AND FINANCING ADVICE AND CAPITAL TO

MIDDLE-MARKET

COMPANIES. WE ALSO SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVISE GOVERNMENTS AND

INVESTORS ON THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE BUILDING A PRIVATE BANKING

CAPABILITY AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO PROVIDE A

FULL-RANGE

OF SERVICES

TO OUR PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT CLIENTS.

THOUGH WE GENERATED RECORD OPERATING RESULTS IN 2006, OUR

BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS.

OUR RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD CAN BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

GENERALLY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS THAT MAY

AFFECT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS, SEE

WHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED AWARDS HELD BY EMPLOYEES THAT

WERE

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE,

INCLUDING THOSE SUBJECT TO NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS, BE EXPENSED

IN THE YEAR OF GRANT. IN ADDITION TO EXPENSING CURRENT YEAR

AWARDS, PRIOR YEAR AWARDS MUST CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE

RELEVANT SERVICE PERIOD. THEREFORE, OUR COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES IN 2006 INCLUDED (AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT,

2007 AND 2008 WILL INCLUDE) BOTH AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR YEAR

SHARE-BASED AWARDS HELD BY EMPLOYEES THAT WERE

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN

THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH IN

THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. A FAVORABLE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL

MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE

AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. THESE FACTORS PROVIDE A POSITIVE

CLIMATE FOR OUR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES, FOR MANY OF OUR

TRADING BUSINESSES AND FOR WEALTH CREATION, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO

GROWTH IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH GLOBAL

SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES ROSE TO MODEST LEVELS AND YIELD CURVES

CONTINUED TO FLATTEN IN 2006, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAINED

FAVORABLE, AS GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES GENERALLY ROSE, CORE

INFLATION WAS BROADLY CONTAINED AND CORPORATE ACTIVITY

STRENGTHENED. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW MARKET CONDITIONS

CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE  CERTAIN RISK

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BELOW AS WELL AS

RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE

A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2006 IS SET

FORTH BELOW.

GLOBAL.

AFTER SOLID ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 2005, THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY GREW AT A STRONG PACE IN 2006, PARTICULARLY DURING THE

FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. HOWEVER, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR, ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN SHOWED SOME

SIGNS OF DECELERATION, WHILE THE PACE OF GROWTH IN THE EUROZONE

ECONOMY APPEARED TO STRENGTHEN. CORPORATE ACTIVITY WAS VERY

STRONG, AS MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING VOLUMES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2005.

THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CONTINUED TO RAISE RATES IN THE

FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, INCREASING ITS FEDERAL FUNDS TARGET RATE

BY A TOTAL OF 125 BASIS POINTS. DESPITE THE INCREASE IN

SHORT-TERM RATES, FIXED INCOME MARKETS WERE FAVORABLE AS

LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS REMAINED LOW AND THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT

REMAINED STRONG. OIL PRICES REMAINED HIGH THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,

DESPITE DECLINING DURING OUR FOURTH QUARTER, BUT THIS DID NOT

APPEAR TO MATERIALLY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING OR GLOBAL GROWTH.

IN THE CURRENCY MARKETS, THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED AGAINST

MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES, AS WELL AS AGAINST SUCH EMERGING MARKET

CURRENCIES AS THE BRAZILIAN REAL, CHINESE YUAN AND KOREAN WON.

UNITED STATES.

THE U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT A STRONG

PACE DURING THE YEAR AS FINANCIAL CONDITIONS REMAINED SUPPORTIVE

OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ROSE BY 3.4%

IN THE 2006 CALENDAR YEAR, DRIVEN PRINCIPALLY BY STRENGTH IN THE

INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, SOLID CONSUMER EXPENDITURE GROWTH AND A

STRONG LABOR MARKET. THIS GROWTH OCCURRED DESPITE A DECLINE IN

THE HOUSING MARKET AND RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT. AFTER SLOWING

MODESTLY IN THE BEGINNING OF 2006, THE RATE OF INFLATION

INCREASED, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER, AS ENERGY PRICES

ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY. MEASURES OF CORE INFLATION ALSO ACCELERATED,

ALTHOUGH THEY EASED TOWARDS THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. IN

RESPONSE TO THE STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RISING INFLATION, THE

U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE RAISED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS TARGET RATE

BY 25 BASIS POINTS IN EACH OF ITS MEETINGS IN 2006 THROUGH

JUNE, BRINGING THE RATE TO 5.25%. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

KEPT RATES UNCHANGED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR AS THE PACE

OF GROWTH MODERATED, REFLECTING A DECLINE IN THE

U.S. HOUSING MARKET AND THE DELAYED EFFECTS OF HIGHER

INTEREST RATES AND ENERGY PRICES. DESPITE THE RISE IN SHORT-TERM

INTEREST RATES, THE

10-YEAR

U.S. TREASURY NOTE YIELD ENDED THE YEAR ONLY 12 BASIS

POINTS HIGHER AT 4.55%. THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE,

S&P 500 INDEX AND NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX INCREASED BY 12%,

10% AND 9%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

EUROPE.

THE PACE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EUROPE ACCELERATED

AS REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN THE EUROZONE ECONOMY GREW BY

APPROXIMATELY 2.7% IN THE 2006 CALENDAR YEAR. DESPITE A HIGHER

EURO, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE EUROZONE COUNTRIES IMPROVED

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND CONSUMER SENTIMENT BEGAN TO IMPROVE AS

A RESULT OF LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND HIGHER DOMESTIC

DEMAND. AFTER LEAVING RATES UNCHANGED FOR OVER TWO YEARS, THE

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK RAISED INTEREST RATES BY A TOTAL OF

125 BASIS POINTS DURING OUR 2006 FISCAL YEAR, BRINGING ITS

POLICY RATE TO 3.25%. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC

PRODUCT GROWTH ACCELERATED TO APPROXIMATELY 2.7% IN THE 2006

CALENDAR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING STRONG INVESTMENT SPENDING.

THE BANK OF ENGLAND INCREASED INTEREST RATES BY 50 BASIS

POINTS TO 5.00%, AFTER HAVING REDUCED RATES BY 25 BASIS

POINTS IN 2005.

IMPROVEMENT IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

ASIA.

JAPANS ECONOMY GREW AT A RELATIVELY STRONG

PACE FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW, WITH REAL GROSS DOMESTIC

PRODUCT INCREASING BY APPROXIMATELY 2.2% IN THE 2006 CALENDAR

YEAR. THE RECOVERY IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND DOMESTIC DEMAND

CONTINUED TO DRIVE MUCH OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE FIRST PART OF

THE YEAR, WHILE EXPORTS DROVE REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH

TOWARD THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL

TO 4.2% IN 2006 FROM 4.4% IN CALENDAR 2005. THE BANK OF JAPAN

ENDED ITS ZERO INTEREST RATE POLICY, WHICH HAD BEEN IN PLACE

SINCE EARLY 2001, AND RAISED THE TARGET OVERNIGHT CALL RATE BY

25 BASIS POINTS DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. THE YIELD ON

10-YEAR

JAPANESE

GOVERNMENT BONDS INCREASED SLIGHTLY, ENDING OUR FISCAL YEAR UP

17 BASIS POINTS. DESPITE SLIGHTLY HIGHER

SHORT-

AND LONG-TERM

INTEREST RATES, FINANCIAL CONDITIONS REMAINED SUPPORTIVE OF

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE YEN APPRECIATED SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE

U.S. DOLLAR, BUT DECLINED AGAINST MOST OTHER MAJOR

CURRENCIES, WHILE THE NIKKEI 225 INDEX INCREASED 6% DURING OUR

FISCAL YEAR.

ELSEWHERE IN ASIA, CHINAS REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

GROWTH REMAINED ROBUST, WITH GROWTH PARTICULARLY RELIANT ON NET

EXPORTS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY CHINAS LARGE CURRENT ACCOUNT

SURPLUS. CHINA CONTINUED TO ALLOW ITS CURRENCY TO APPRECIATE

MODESTLY, WITH EVIDENCE OF ACCELERATION DURING THE SECOND HALF

OF THE CALENDAR YEAR, ENDING OUR FISCAL YEAR NEARLY 3% HIGHER

AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. OTHER CURRENCIES IN THE REGION

ALSO STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, INCLUDING THE

KOREAN WON, PHILIPPINE PESO AND THE TAIWAN DOLLAR. GROWTH IN

INDIA ALSO REMAINED STRONG, WHICH, TOGETHER WITH CHINA,

SUPPORTED GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE REGION. EQUITY MARKETS ACROSS

THE REGION GENERALLY ROSE, WITH MARKETS IN CHINA, INDIA, HONG

KONG, SOUTH KOREA AND TAIWAN ALL POSTING SIGNIFICANT GAINS

DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW

MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE RISKS, SEE

 RISK MANAGEMENT BELOW. A SUMMARY OF THE

MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS FOLLOWS

BELOW. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT

FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, SEE RISK

FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM

10-K.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MARKET RISK.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, AND THESE CONDITIONS

MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, STABLE GEOPOLITICAL

CONDITIONS, TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW

INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND STRONG

BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR

OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY, DECLINES IN BUSINESS CONFIDENCE,

INCREASES IN INFLATION, CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS

THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS, NATURAL

DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER

FACTORS,

HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE

ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY WAYS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE

PAST SEVERAL YEARS. INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH CHANGES ARE RAPID,

MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST

AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING

INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW

TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO TIME, WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS

OF MARKET TURBULENCE. CONVERSELY, CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING

BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND

ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE

THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE

BUSINESSES.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS

AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES

CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ARE

DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECREASE

IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR

UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE CONTINUED, EVEN AS

THE VOLUME AND NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS HAVE

INCREASED. IN ADDITION, THE TREND IN THE UNDERWRITING BUSINESS

TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND CO-MANAGERS HANDLING

TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE

BOOK RUNNER, HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR BUSINESS AND REDUCED OUR

REVENUES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS OR INCREASES IN

INTEREST RATES TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR

MANAGING ASSETS. INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR ATTRACTIVE

CONDITIONS IN OTHER INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO

TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS. EVEN

IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET

CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS

COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND IN THE

INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT NEW

INVESTORS.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING,

BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING AND LENDING

BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL

TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RECENT

YEARS LARGE BLOCKS OF SECURITIES HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN SOLD IN

BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A MARKETED BASIS, WHICH INCREASES

THE RISK THAT GOLDMAN SACHS MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE

PURCHASED SECURITIES AT FAVORABLE PRICES AND MAY INCUR

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AS A RESULT. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF

CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE

INDUSTRY. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS

PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH

TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN

PERIOD.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND

AS A SPECIALIST OR MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE

THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN

ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND OTHER INDUSTRY FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE INCREASING USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING, COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK

EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY

PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN

TRADING LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN

GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE

MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF BLOCK

TRADES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE  CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES  GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW.



WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING

AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE

JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE

EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING

OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES,

INCUR LOSSES.



MARKET VOLATILITY HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS. AN

INCREASE IN VOLATILITY WOULD INCREASE OUR MEASURED RISK, WHICH

MIGHT CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR TO REDUCE

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS OR OUR EXPOSURE IN A

TIMELY, COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OR IN A MANNER SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET

THE INCREASE IN MEASURED RISK.

LIQUIDITY RISK.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS

SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS

FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR

UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY

ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH

AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT

AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE

HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS

AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO

NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF

LIQUIDITY STRESS. GROWTH OF OUR PROPRIETARY INVESTING ACTIVITIES

MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD

RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE

SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GOLDMAN SACHS OF A

REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE  LIQUIDITY

AND FUNDING RISK  CREDIT RATINGS BELOW.

CREDIT RISK.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD

PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT

PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE

RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE

ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, A DETERIORATION

IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR

OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE

SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A SIGNIFICANT

DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO

HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION

OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE

HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. AS A CLEARING MEMBER FIRM, WE FINANCE OUR

CLIENT POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS

SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES

AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT

TO DETECT OR FORESEE, PARTICULARLY AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES

LEAD US TO TRANSACT WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS, WITH NEW

ASSET CLASSES AND IN NEW MARKETS. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT,

OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT

LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONAL RISK.

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR

INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS, OR EXTERNAL EVENTS COULD

LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL LOSS, DISRUPTION

OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY INTERVENTION

OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY

DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE

NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN

MANY CURRENCIES. THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC

GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. DESPITE

THE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR

ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION

OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE

AND EVOLVING REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION

AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL

EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS. FIRMS

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A

DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF

DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY

EXPOSURES, SEE  USE OF ESTIMATES BELOW.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FAIR VALUE

THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WITH

RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED

IMMEDIATELY IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH

THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION

BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION

SALE.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE SEPARATE OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTO THREE CATEGORIES  CASH (I.E., NONDERIVATIVE)

TRADING INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS (INCLUDED WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT

OF OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT), AS SET FORTH

FAIR VALUES OF OUR CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY

OBTAINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, BROKER OR

DEALER PRICE QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH

REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF

INSTRUMENTS VALUED IN THIS MANNER INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND AGENCY SECURITIES, OTHER SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS,

LIQUID MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT-GRADE AND HIGH-YIELD

CORPORATE BONDS, LISTED EQUITIES, MONEY MARKET SECURITIES,

STATE, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS, AND PHYSICAL

COMMODITIES.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND HAVE

LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE

CERTAIN CORPORATE BANK LOANS, MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND

DISTRESSED DEBT. WE VALUE THESE INSTRUMENTS INITIALLY AT COST

AND GENERALLY DO NOT ADJUST VALUATIONS UNLESS THERE IS

SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT OR VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS (SUCH AS SIMILAR

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR CHANGES IN

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING COMPANIES). WHERE THERE IS

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE, WE USE VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED

CASH FLOWS.

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS WE OWN (LONG POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO

BID PRICES, AND INSTRUMENTS WE HAVE SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED

(SHORT POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE ILLIQUID OR HAVE

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, THE FAIR VALUE REFLECTS LIQUIDITY

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED

POLICIES. FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS,

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THESE

LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS. SEE  RECENT

FAIR VALUES OF OUR EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY

DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED

USING VALUATION MODELS. WE USE A VARIETY OF VALUATION MODELS

INCLUDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS AND

OPTION-PRICING MODELS. THE VALUATION MODELS THAT WE USE TO

DERIVE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES REQUIRE INPUTS

INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT

CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES AND

CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. THE SELECTION OF A MODEL TO VALUE

AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF, AND

SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. WE GENERALLY

USE SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. WHERE POSSIBLE,

WE VERIFY THE VALUES PRODUCED BY OUR PRICING MODELS TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS,

SUCH AS GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL SELECTION

DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BECAUSE MARKET PRICES ARE

READILY AVAILABLE. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LESS LIQUID

MARKETS, MODEL SELECTION REQUIRES MORE JUDGMENT BECAUSE SUCH

INSTRUMENTS TEND TO BE MORE COMPLEX AND PRICING INFORMATION IS

LESS AVAILABLE IN THESE MARKETS. PRICE TRANSPARENCY IS

INHERENTLY MORE LIMITED FOR MORE COMPLEX STRUCTURES BECAUSE THEY

OFTEN COMBINE ONE OR MORE PRODUCT TYPES, REQUIRING ADDITIONAL

INPUTS SUCH AS CORRELATIONS AND VOLATILITIES. AS MARKETS

CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MORE PRICING INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND REFINE THE MODELS THAT WE

USE.

AT THE INCEPTION OF AN OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACT (DAY ONE), WE

VALUE THE CONTRACT AT THE MODEL VALUE IF WE CAN VERIFY ALL OF

THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND

VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. WHEN APPROPRIATE,

VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS

LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS. THESE

ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR

PREDETERMINED POLICIES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR

HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED

TO DETERMINE THESE ADJUSTMENTS.

WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, WE VALUE THE CONTRACT AT THE TRANSACTION PRICE AT

INCEPTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, RECORD NO DAY ONE GAIN OR LOSS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO.

02-3,

ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY

TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

FOLLOWING DAY ONE, WE ADJUST THE INPUTS TO OUR VALUATION MODELS

ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT CHANGES IN THESE INPUTS CAN BE VERIFIED

BY SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES

AND/OR BROKER QUOTES, OR CAN BE DERIVED FROM OTHER SUBSTANTIVE

EVIDENCE SUCH AS EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

WE CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD PRODUCE A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SEE

WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN OTC OPTION TRANSACTIONS THAT PROVIDE US OR

OUR COUNTERPARTIES WITH THE RIGHT TO EXTEND THE MATURITY OF THE

UNDERLYING CONTRACT. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OPTION CONTRACTS IS

NOT MATERIAL TO THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVE

PORTFOLIO. IN THE TABLES ABOVE, FOR OPTION CONTRACTS THAT

REQUIRE SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF AN UNDERLYING DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT, THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL MATURITY IS GENERALLY

CLASSIFIED BASED UPON THE MATURITY DATE OF THE UNDERLYING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE UNDERLYING

INSTRUMENT DOES NOT HAVE A MATURITY DATE OR EITHER COUNTERPARTY

HAS THE RIGHT TO SETTLE IN CASH, THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY IS GENERALLY BASED UPON THE OPTION EXPIRATION DATE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR JAPANESE YEN-DENOMINATED INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF

FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVALUATION. WE MITIGATE OUR ECONOMIC EXPOSURE

TO EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN SMFG BY

BORROWING JAPANESE YEN. FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVALUATION ON THE

INVESTMENT AND THE RELATED BORROWING ARE GENERALLY EQUAL AND

OFFSETTING. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE JAPANESE YEN APPRECIATES AGAINST

THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE U.S. DOLLAR CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

SMFG INVESTMENT WILL INCREASE AND THE U.S. DOLLAR CARRYING

VALUE OF THE RELATED BORROWING WILL ALSO INCREASE BY AN AMOUNT

THAT IS GENERALLY EQUAL AND OFFSETTING.

(3)

EXCLUDES AN ECONOMIC HEDGE ON THE UNRESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED

STOCK OF SMFG. THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS HEDGE WAS

$3.07 BILLION AND $1.51 BILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005, RESPECTIVELY, AND IS

REFLECTED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET

PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE OR SELL THE COMMON STOCK

UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT IN SMFG, SEE BELOW.

(4)

INCLUDES INTERESTS OF $3.28 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2006

HELD BY INVESTMENT FUNDS MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS. THE FAIR

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC, WHICH

TRADE ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE OF HONG KONG, INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF

FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVALUATION.

OUR PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, HAVE LITTLE

OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY CARRIED

AT COST AS AN APPROXIMATION OF FAIR VALUE. ADJUSTMENTS TO

CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE IF THERE ARE THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO

MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, IF WE

DETERMINE THAT THE EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT

IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN REACHING THAT DETERMINATION,

WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES

OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO BUDGETS OR PROJECTIONS, TRENDS WITHIN

SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS, UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODELS, EXPECTED

EXIT TIMING AND STRATEGY, AND ANY SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS CONVERSION FEATURES AND

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES. SEE  RECENT ACCOUNTING

DEVELOPMENTS BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF

SFAS NO. 157 ON THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE LARGE,

CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS THAT RESULT FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS

OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, ARE VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET

PRICES LESS A LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENT BASED ON

PREDETERMINED WRITTEN POLICIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM A MODEL THAT

INCORPORATES SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE AND CREDIT SPREADS,

THE IMPACT OF NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY, AND DOWNSIDE

PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO MOVEMENTS IN THE SMFG

COMMON STOCK PRICE. AS A RESULT OF DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE

CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT AND CHANGES IN SMFGS COMMON

STOCK PRICE WOULD BE NONLINEAR FOR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE

SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE. DURING THE YEAR, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT (EXCLUDING THE ECONOMIC HEDGE ON THE UNRESTRICTED

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK) INCREASED 8% (EXPRESSED IN JAPANESE

YEN), REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF PASSAGE OF TIME IN RESPECT OF THE

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK.

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS

GENERALLY NONTRANSFERABLE WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF SMFG, BUT IS

FREELY CONVERTIBLE INTO SMFG COMMON STOCK. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006,

WE HAD HEDGED TWO-THIRDS OF THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING OUR

INVESTMENT IN SMFG. RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE OR SELL

THE REMAINING SHARES WILL LAPSE ON FEBRUARY 7, 2007. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2006, THE CONVERSION PRICE WAS ¥318,800, SUBJECT

TO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IF THE PRICE OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT THE

TIME OF CONVERSION IS LESS THAN THE CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT TO

A FLOOR OF ¥105,100).

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC IS CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES LESS A LIQUIDITY VALUATION

ADJUSTMENT. THE ORDINARY SHARES ACQUIRED FROM ICBC ARE SUBJECT

TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROHIBIT ANY

SALE, DISPOSITION OR OTHER TRANSFER UNTIL APRIL 28, 2009.

FROM APRIL 28, 2009 TO OCTOBER 20, 2009, WE MAY

TRANSFER UP TO 50% OF THE AGGREGATE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC THAT

WE OWNED AS OF OCTOBER 20, 2006. WE MAY TRANSFER THE

REMAINING SHARES AFTER OCTOBER 20, 2009. A PORTION OF OUR

INTEREST IS HELD BY INVESTMENT FUNDS MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

A

CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE, INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING AND INVESTING

FUNCTIONS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY VALUED AND THAT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS ARE RELIABLE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN

VALUING INSTRUMENTS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

WE EMPLOY AN OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES APPROPRIATE

SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INDEPENDENT OF THE

TRADING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF CONTROL

AND VALUATION POLICIES AND FOR REPORTING THE RESULTS OF THESE

POLICIES TO OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN THE

NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL FUNCTIONS ARE

PERFORMED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS. WE EMPLOY PROCEDURES FOR THE

APPROVAL OF NEW TRANSACTION TYPES AND MARKETS, PRICE

VERIFICATION, REVIEW OF DAILY PROFIT AND LOSS, AND REVIEW OF

VALUATION MODELS BY PERSONNEL WITH APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL

KNOWLEDGE OF RELEVANT PRODUCTS AND MARKETS. THESE PROCEDURES ARE

PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING

UNITS. FOR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS WITH LITTLE OR NO

PRICE TRANSPARENCY, WE EMPLOY, WHERE POSSIBLE, PROCEDURES THAT

INCLUDE COMPARISONS WITH SIMILAR OBSERVABLE POSITIONS, ANALYSIS

OF ACTUAL TO PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, COMPARISONS WITH SUBSEQUENT

SALES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR BUSINESS LEADERS. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE THE RISKS INHERENT IN OUR

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING BUSINESSES, SEE

 RISK MANAGEMENT BELOW.

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRINCIPALLY SLK LLC

(SLK) IN 2000, THE AYCO COMPANY, L.P. (AYCO) IN 2003,

COGENTRIX ENERGY, INC. (COGENTRIX) IN 2004, NATIONAL

ENERGY & GAS TRANSMISSION, INC. (NEGT) IN 2005 AND

THE ACQUISITION OF THE VARIABLE ANNUITY AND VARIABLE LIFE

INSURANCE BUSINESS OF THE HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP, INC.

(FORMERLY ALLMERICA FINANCIAL CORPORATION) IN 2006, WE HAVE

ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL

IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODWILL.

WE TEST THE GOODWILL IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING

SEGMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH

OPERATING SEGMENT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. WE DERIVE

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS PRIMARILY BASED

ON PRICE-EARNINGS MULTIPLES. WE DERIVE THE NET BOOK VALUE OF OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS BY ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF

EACH OPERATING SEGMENT. OUR LAST ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS

PERFORMED DURING OUR 2006 FOURTH QUARTER AND NO IMPAIRMENT WAS

IDENTIFIED.

SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING

VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS,

CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED

IF THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO

THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING

PRIMARILY RELATES TO ABOVE-MARKET POWER CONTRACTS OF

CONSOLIDATED POWER GENERATION FACILITIES RELATED TO COGENTRIX

AND NEGT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE POWER CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN

PLEDGED TO COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECURED

FINANCINGS. THE INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF POWER

CONTRACTS IN 2006 WAS DUE TO A RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN

CONTRACTS, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE ASSOCIATED

POWER GENERATION FACILITIES THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED

FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD.

(3)

CONSISTS OF THE VALUE OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED (VOBA) AND

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS (DAC). VOBA REPRESENTS THE PRESENT

VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE GROSS PROFITS OF THE VARIABLE ANNUITY

AND VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN 2006. DAC

RESULTS FROM COMMISSIONS PAID BY GOLDMAN SACHS TO THE PRIMARY

INSURER (CEDING COMPANY) ON LIFE AND ANNUITY REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS AS COMPENSATION TO PLACE THE BUSINESS WITH US AND TO

COVER THE CEDING COMPANYS ACQUISITION EXPENSES. VOBA AND

DAC ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING

CONTRACTS BASED ON ESTIMATED GROSS PROFITS, AND AMORTIZATION IS

ADJUSTED BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. THE SEVEN YEAR USEFUL LIFE

REPRESENTS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING AMORTIZATION PERIOD OF

THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS (CERTAIN OF WHICH EXTEND FOR

APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS).

(4)

PRIMARILY INCLUDES TECHNOLOGY-RELATED AND OTHER ASSETS RELATED

TO SLK.

(5)

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE REDUCED THE ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES OF OUR NYSE SPECIALIST RIGHTS FROM

22-24

YEARS TO

16 YEARS. THIS CHANGE WAS DUE TO HIGHER THAN EXPECTED

ATTRITION IN ACQUIRED NYSE SPECIALIST RIGHTS, PRIMARILY FROM

MERGERS AND DELISTINGS.

A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE

TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE

EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE

VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND/OR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT

OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING

(I) CHANGES IN MARKET STRUCTURE THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, (II) AN ADVERSE ACTION OR

ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR, (III) A DEFAULT EVENT UNDER A

POWER CONTRACT OR PHYSICAL DAMAGE OR OTHER ADVERSE EVENTS

IMPACTING THE UNDERLYING POWER GENERATION FACILITIES, OR

(IV) ADVERSE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ON THE CONTRACTS IN OUR

VARIABLE ANNUITY AND VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES. IN ADDITION TO THE

ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND

THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

THE USE OF ESTIMATES IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING PROVISIONS

FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT

OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS TO THE

EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE ESTIMATED, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONTINGENCIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING

THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A

CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES

AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH

CASE OR PROCEEDING, OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS

IN SIMILAR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF

LEGAL COUNSEL. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE

OUTCOME OF OUR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY

IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE

DAMAGES OR FINES ARE SOUGHT, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES

OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS WHERE THERE IS ONLY A

REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED. SEE

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE NO LONGER DEDUCT IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH POWER CONTRACTS FROM TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY BECAUSE, UNLIKE OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, LESS THAN 50% OF THESE ASSETS ARE SUPPORTED BY COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO

CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT MEASURES THE

PERFORMANCE OF BUSINESSES CONSISTENTLY, WHETHER THEY WERE

NET REVENUES

2006 VERSUS 2005.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$37.67 BILLION IN 2006, AN INCREASE OF 49% COMPARED WITH

2005, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENT BANKING, AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN FICC, EQUITIES AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. THE

INCREASE IN FICC REFLECTED PARTICULARLY STRONG PERFORMANCES

ACROSS ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES. DURING 2006, FICC OPERATED IN AN

ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND

FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, CORPORATE CREDIT

SPREADS TIGHTENED, THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENED AND VOLATILITY

LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOW IN INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKETS.

THE INCREASE IN EQUITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESS. DURING

2006, EQUITIES OPERATED IN A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY

PRICES AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, ALTHOUGH VOLATILITY

LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOW. THE INCREASE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC AND HIGHER GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM

OTHER PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SMALLER, BUT

STILL SIGNIFICANT, GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG. THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT

BANKING WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN

UNDERWRITING AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY, AS WE BENEFITED FROM STRONG

CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, REFLECTING FAVORABLE EQUITY AND

FINANCING MARKETS, STRONG CEO CONFIDENCE AND GROWTH IN FINANCIAL

SPONSOR ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

SECURITIES SERVICES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES

SERVICES. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT INCREASED $144 BILLION OR

27% TO A RECORD $676 BILLION, INCLUDING NET ASSET INFLOWS

OF $94 BILLION DURING 2006.

2005 VERSUS 2004.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$25.24 BILLION IN 2005, AN INCREASE OF 20% COMPARED WITH

2004, REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS AND ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES AS WELL

AS HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING. THE INCREASE IN

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN FICC, AS ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES PERFORMED WELL.

DURING 2005, FICC OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, TIGHT, BUT

VOLATILE, CREDIT SPREADS, HIGHER ENERGY PRICES AND A FLATTER

YIELD CURVE. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES ALSO IMPROVED

SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING STRONG

PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE BUSINESS. EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN

ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES,

IMPROVED CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED LOW LEVELS OF

MARKET VOLATILITY. NET REVENUES IN OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

BUSINESS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A

GAIN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SMFG AS WELL AS GAINS FROM REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

THE STRONG NET REVENUE GROWTH IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES

SERVICES PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND

HIGHER CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING NET REVENUES WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING AND IMPROVED RESULTS IN

FINANCIAL ADVISORY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE CORPORATE ACTIVITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET

REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING.

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ARE ENTITIES

THAT ARE HELD STRICTLY FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION, HAVE A DEFINED

EXIT STRATEGY AND ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY

RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT HOLD REAL ESTATE

ASSETS, SUCH AS GOLF COURSES AND HOTELS IN ASIA, BUT EXCLUDE

INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT PRIMARILY HOLD FINANCIAL ASSETS. WE

BELIEVE THAT IT IS MEANINGFUL TO REVIEW NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES EXCLUDING EXPENSES RELATED TO THESE CONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES IN ORDER TO EVALUATE TRENDS IN NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. REVENUES

RELATED TO SUCH ENTITIES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2006 VERSUS 2005.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE

$23.11 BILLION FOR 2006, 36% HIGHER THAN 2005. COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $16.46 BILLION INCREASED 40%

COMPARED WITH 2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUES, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF

EMPLOYMENT. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET

REVENUES FOR 2006 WAS

43.7%

(1)

COMPARED WITH

46.6%

(1)

FOR 2005. THIS LOWER RATIO PRIMARILY REFLECTED OUR STRONG NET

REVENUES IN 2006. EMPLOYMENT LEVELS INCREASED 12% COMPARED WITH

NOVEMBER 2005.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE ADOPTED

SFAS NO.

123-R,

WHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES BE EXPENSED IN THE YEAR OF GRANT.

IN ADDITION TO EXPENSING CURRENT YEAR AWARDS, PRIOR YEAR AWARDS

MUST CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE RELEVANT SERVICE PERIOD.

THEREFORE, OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS IN 2006 INCLUDED (AND,

TO A LESSER EXTENT, 2007 AND 2008 WILL INCLUDE) BOTH

AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR YEAR SHARE-BASED AWARDS HELD BY EMPLOYEES

THAT WERE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO.

123-R

AND NEW AWARDS GRANTED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES IN 2006 INCLUDED

$637 MILLION IN CONTINUED AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR YEAR AWARDS

HELD BY EMPLOYEES THAT WERE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF

ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO.

123-R.

THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPENSE TO BE

RECOGNIZED WITH RESPECT TO THESE AWARDS.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF $6.65 BILLION FOR 2006

INCREASED 28% COMPARED WITH 2005. EXCLUDING NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES, NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE 24% HIGHER THAN 2005,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND

DISTRIBUTION FEES IN EQUITIES AND FICC, AND INCREASED OTHER

EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO COSTS RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE

BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN 2006. IN ADDITION, MARKET

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE HIGHER, REFLECTING

INCREASED LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY, AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES

INCREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING NEW OFFICE SPACE AND HIGHER

FACILITY EXPENSES.

2005 VERSUS 2004.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE

$16.97 BILLION FOR 2005, 19% ABOVE 2004. COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $11.76 BILLION INCREASED 21% COMPARED

WITH 2004, RESULTING FROM HIGHER DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION,

REFLECTING HIGHER NET REVENUES, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF

EMPLOYMENT. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET

REVENUES FOR 2005 WAS

46.6%

(1)

COMPARED WITH

46.2%

(1)

FOR 2004. EMPLOYMENT LEVELS INCREASED 9% COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER

2004.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF $5.21 BILLION FOR 2005

INCREASED 13% COMPARED WITH 2004. EXCLUDING NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES, NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE 8% HIGHER THAN 2004,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND

DISTRIBUTION FEES, REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN FICC

AND EQUITIES, AND INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES, REFLECTING HIGHER

LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN 2005 INCLUDED $37 MILLION OF

NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

(INCLUDED IN OTHER EXPENSES) AND $36 MILLION OF REAL ESTATE

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELOCATION OF OFFICE SPACE (INCLUDED

IN OCCUPANCY). NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN 2004 INCLUDED

$103 MILLION OF NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, $62 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR JOINT VENTURE IN CHINA (INCLUDED IN MARKET

DEVELOPMENT) AND $41 MILLION OF REAL ESTATE EXIT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR OFFICE SPACE (INCLUDED IN

OCCUPANCY AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION).

(1)

THE EFFECT OF THE COST OF POWER GENERATION RECLASSIFICATION ON

THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES WAS TO

DECREASE THE RATIO BY APPROXIMATELY 30 BASIS POINTS,

60 BASIS POINTS AND 50 BASIS POINTS FOR 2006, 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVISION FOR TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 34.5% FOR 2006, UP FROM 32.0%

FOR 2005. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2006

COMPARED WITH 2005 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A REDUCTION IN THE

IMPACT OF PERMANENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF EARNINGS IN

2006 AND AUDIT SETTLEMENTS IN 2005. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATE FOR 2005 WAS 32.0% COMPARED WITH 31.8% FOR 2004. EXCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS IN 2005, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME

TAX RATE FOR 2005 WOULD HAVE BEEN

33.3%

(1).

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, THE INCREASE IN THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER BENEFIT FROM TAX CREDITS IN 2005.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD

DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GEOGRAPHIC AND BUSINESS

MIX OF OUR EARNINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR TAX CREDITS AND THE EFFECT

OF TAX AUDITS. CERTAIN OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR

HISTORY OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING

OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. SEE

NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM

FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES.

(1)

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF AUDIT

SETTLEMENTS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE PROVISION FOR TAXES,

ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, BY PRE-TAX

EARNINGS. THE IMPACT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS DECREASED THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE BY 1.3% FOR 2005. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF AUDIT

SETTLEMENTS PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL BASIS FOR

PERIOD-TO

-PERIOD

COMPARISONS OF OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES.

(1)

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $3.26 BILLION FOR 2005 INCREASED 10%

COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION AND INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO PRIOR

YEAR EQUITY AWARDS. IN ADDITION, PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE HIGHER,

PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES. PRE-TAX

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO

THREE COMPONENTS.



FICC.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN AND TRADE INTEREST RATE AND

CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES AND LOAN PRODUCTS,

CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES, STRUCTURE AND ENTER INTO A WIDE

VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY

TRADING AND INVESTING.



EQUITIES.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN, TRADE AND ACT AS A

SPECIALIST FOR EQUITIES AND EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS, STRUCTURE

AND ENTER INTO EQUITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND ENGAGE IN

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO EXECUTE

AND CLEAR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND

FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE REAL ESTATE AND CORPORATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AND THE ORDINARY SHARES OF

ICBC. WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS

AND FROM THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS DERIVED

FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WHEN THE RETURN ON A FUNDS

INVESTMENTS, OVER THE LIFE OF THE FUND, EXCEEDS CERTAIN

THRESHOLD RETURNS (OVERRIDES).

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS

MARKED-TO

-MARKET DAILY

AND, THEREFORE, ITS VALUE AND OUR NET REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO

FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS. IN ADDITION, NET

REVENUES DERIVED FROM OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY

HELD CONCERNS AND IN REAL ESTATE MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDING ON THE REVALUATION OR SALE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN ANY

GIVEN PERIOD. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS

PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH

TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN

PERIOD.

NET REVENUES FROM PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE

MANAGEMENT FEES GENERATED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS. THESE

MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN THE NET REVENUES OF THE ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES SEGMENT.

NET REVENUES IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

COMPARED WITH 2005. NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $14.26 BILLION

INCREASED 60% COMPARED WITH 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS (WHICH INCLUDES

DISTRESSED INVESTING) AND COMMODITIES. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES

WERE HIGHER IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND MORTGAGES.

DURING 2006, THE BUSINESS OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS

TIGHTENED, THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENED AND VOLATILITY LEVELS WERE

GENERALLY LOW IN INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKETS. NET

REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $8.48 BILLION INCREASED 50%

COMPARED WITH 2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN DERIVATIVES, ACROSS ALL REGIONS, AS WELL AS

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN SHARES. THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTED THE

CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN

2006. IN ADDITION, PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES PERFORMED WELL, ALTHOUGH

NET REVENUES WERE LOWER THAN A PARTICULARLY STRONG 2005. DURING

2006, EQUITIES OPERATED IN A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY

PRICES AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, ALTHOUGH VOLATILITY

LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOW. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET

REVENUES OF $2.82 BILLION, REFLECTING A $937 MILLION

GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC, A

$527 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AND $1.35 BILLION IN

GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM OTHER PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $14.96 BILLION FOR 2006 INCREASED 41%

COMPARED WITH 2005, DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUES AND

INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT, AS WELL AS HIGHER

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES. EXCLUDING NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES

RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES,

THE INCREASE IN NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, IN

EQUITIES AND FICC, AND INCREASED OTHER EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE

TO COSTS RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED

IN 2006, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION,

PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE HIGHER, DUE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND

CONSULTING FEES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $10.60 BILLION IN 2006

INCREASED 70% COMPARED WITH 2005.

2005 VERSUS 2004.

NET REVENUES IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS OF $16.82 BILLION FOR 2005 INCREASED 23%

COMPARED WITH 2004. NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $8.94 BILLION

INCREASED 16% COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS (WHICH

INCLUDES DISTRESSED INVESTING) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, INTEREST

RATE PRODUCTS AND CURRENCIES. NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES AND

MORTGAGES WERE STRONG, BUT ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH

2004. DURING 2005, FICC OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, TIGHT, BUT

VOLATILE, CREDIT SPREADS, HIGHER ENERGY PRICES AND A FLATTER

YIELD CURVE. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $5.65 BILLION

INCREASED 21% COMPARED WITH 2004, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE AND PRINCIPAL

STRATEGIES BUSINESSES. THE INCREASE IN OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE

BUSINESS REFLECTED IMPROVED RESULTS IN DERIVATIVES AND SHARES,

PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA, AS WELL AS IN CONVERTIBLES. IN

ADDITION, RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES REFLECTED STRENGTH

ACROSS ALL REGIONS. DURING 2005, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN

ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES,

IMPROVED CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED LOW LEVELS OF

MARKET VOLATILITY. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET REVENUES

OF $2.23 BILLION, DUE TO A $1.48 BILLION GAIN RELATED

TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AND

$753 MILLION IN GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM OTHER CORPORATE

AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $10.60 BILLION FOR 2005 INCREASED 22%

COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING HIGHER DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION

AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT,

HIGHER NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. EXCLUDING

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD

FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, THE INCREASE IN NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE,

CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO

INCREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN FICC AND EQUITIES, AND HIGHER

PROFESSIONAL FEES, DUE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES.

PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $6.22 BILLION IN 2005 INCREASED 23%

COMPARED WITH 2004.

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES SEGMENT IS DIVIDED

INTO TWO COMPONENTS.



ASSET MANAGEMENT.

ASSET MANAGEMENT PROVIDES INVESTMENT

ADVISORY AND FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES AND OFFERS INVESTMENT

PRODUCTS (PRIMARILY THROUGH SEPARATE ACCOUNTS AND FUNDS) ACROSS

ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS AND

INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE AND PRIMARILY GENERATES REVENUES IN THE

FORM OF MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES.



SECURITIES SERVICES.

SECURITIES SERVICES PROVIDES PRIME

BROKERAGE SERVICES, FINANCING SERVICES AND SECURITIES LENDING

SERVICES TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING HEDGE FUNDS, MUTUAL

FUNDS, PENSION FUNDS AND FOUNDATIONS, AND TO HIGH-NET-WORTH

INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE, AND GENERATES REVENUES PRIMARILY IN THE

FORM OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS OR FEES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY GENERATE FEES AS A PERCENTAGE

OF ASSET VALUE. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED

TO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS

RETURN OR WHEN THE RETURN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT EXCEEDS

SPECIFIED BENCHMARK RETURNS OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGETS.

INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDS

AND THEY ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT. WE HAVE NUMEROUS

INCENTIVE FEE ARRANGEMENTS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE ANNUAL

PERFORMANCE PERIODS THAT END ON DECEMBER 31. FOR THAT

REASON, INCENTIVE FEES HAVE BEEN SEASONALLY WEIGHTED TO OUR

FIRST QUARTER. BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN CALENDAR 2006,

OUR INCENTIVE FEES WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN FISCAL 2007

THAN THEY WERE IN FISCAL 2006.

PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL CUSTOMER

BALANCES IN SECURITIES LENDING AND MARGIN LENDING.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $4.04 BILLION FOR 2006 INCREASED 31%

COMPARED WITH 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUES, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF

EMPLOYMENT. NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED, PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER DISTRIBUTION FEES (INCLUDED IN BROKERAGE,

CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES). IN ADDITION, MARKET

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE

ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT

IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING

PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL AND OTHER INTERESTS IN

MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION VEHICLES;

HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT, INTERESTS IN LIMITED AND

GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK IN OTHER

NONCONSOLIDATED VEHICLES; ENTERING INTO INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN

CURRENCY, EQUITY, COMMODITY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING

TOTAL RETURN SWAPS; ENTERING INTO OPERATING LEASES; AND

PROVIDING GUARANTEES, INDEMNIFICATIONS, LOAN COMMITMENTS,

LETTERS OF CREDIT, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS

PURPOSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SECURITIZATION OF COMMERCIAL

AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY AND AUTO LOANS,

GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS. OTHER REASONS FOR ENTERING INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS

INCLUDE UNDERWRITING CLIENT SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS;

PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKING INVESTMENTS IN

PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER

ASSETS; PROVIDING INVESTORS WITH CREDIT-LINKED AND

ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES; AND RECEIVING OR PROVIDING LETTERS OF

CREDIT TO SATISFY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE

CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS.

WE ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES)

AND QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES). SUCH VEHICLES

ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR

MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER

ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES

MARKETS, SINCE THEY PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY TO FINANCIAL ASSETS

BY OFFERING INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS

CREATED THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. OUR FINANCIAL

INTERESTS IN, AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH, SUCH

NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, IN THE

SAME MANNER AS OUR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EXCEPT IN CASES

WHERE WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

FOR A

EQUITY CAPITAL

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE PRINCIPALLY

DETERMINED BY OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES.

THE EQUITY CAPITAL WE HOLD MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY THE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND AN

ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES DURING AN EXTREMELY

ADVERSE BUSINESS AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006,

OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $35.79 BILLION

(CONSISTING OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF

$32.69 BILLION AND PREFERRED STOCK OF $3.10 BILLION)

COMPARED WITH TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF

$28.00 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 (CONSISTING OF COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $26.25 BILLION AND PREFERRED

STOCK OF $1.75 BILLION). IN ADDITION TO TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WE CONSIDER THE $2.75 BILLION OF

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO A TRUST (SEE BELOW) PART OF

OUR EQUITY CAPITAL, AS IT QUALIFIES AS CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY

AND CERTAIN RATING AGENCY PURPOSES.

CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

DURING 2005, GOLDMAN SACHS BECAME REGULATED BY THE

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) AS A

CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY (CSE). AS SUCH, GOLDMAN SACHS IS

SUBJECT TO GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE SEC AND

TO MINIMUM CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.

MINIMUM CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS ARE PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY THE

AMOUNT OF OUR MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS

CALCULATED BY METHODOLOGIES APPROVED BY THE SEC. ELIGIBLE

SOURCES OF REGULATORY CAPITAL INCLUDE COMMON EQUITY AND CERTAIN

TYPES OF PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT AND HYBRID INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO A TRUST. THE RECOGNITION

OF PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT AND HYBRID INSTRUMENTS AS REGULATORY

CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS. GOLDMAN SACHS WAS IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE CSE CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS AS OF

NOVEMBER 2006 AND

NOVEMBER

2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

MANY OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE

REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND/OR

ELSEWHERE. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. AND GOLDMAN SACHS

EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P. ARE REGISTERED

U.S. BROKER-DEALERS AND FUTURES COMMISSIONS MERCHANTS, AND

THEIR PRIMARY REGULATORS INCLUDE THE SEC, THE COMMODITY FUTURES

TRADING COMMISSION, THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE, THE NYSE, THE

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. AND THE

NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL, OUR

REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER, IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION PRIMARILY

BY THE U.K.S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. GOLDMAN SACHS

JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL), OUR REGULATED JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER,

IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY JAPANS FINANCIAL SERVICES

AGENCY. PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1, 2006, GOLDMAN SACHS (JAPAN)

LTD. (GSJL), THE PREDECESSOR TO GSJCL, WAS OUR PRIMARY REGULATED

SUBSIDIARY BASED IN JAPAN. SEVERAL OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF GOLDMAN

SACHS ARE REGULATED BY SECURITIES, INVESTMENT ADVISORY, BANKING,

AND OTHER REGULATORS AND AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, SUCH AS

THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (BAFIN) AND THE

BUNDESBANK IN GERMANY, BANQUE DE FRANCE AND THE AUTORITÉ

DES MARCHÉS FINANCIERS IN FRANCE, BANCA DITALIA AND

THE COMMISSIONE NAZIONALE PER LE SOCIETÀ E LA BORSA

(CONSOB) IN ITALY, THE SWISS FEDERAL BANKING COMMISSION,

THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION IN HONG KONG, THE MONETARY

AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE AND THE CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY

COMMISSION. GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA (GS BANK), A WHOLLY OWNED

INDUSTRIAL BANK, IS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION AND THE STATE OF UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS

OF NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005, THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION MAY HOLD

CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY

REQUIREMENTS OR INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING

THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED

UPON ITS UNDERLYING RISK. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR POTENTIAL

INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, SEE

 LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK 

CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE BELOW.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH

PARENT COMPANY EQUITY CAPITAL. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006, GROUP

INC.S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES WAS

$32.58 BILLION COMPARED WITH ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY OF $35.79 BILLION.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES

IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF WHICH IS MANAGED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY MANAGE THE NON-TRADING

EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THAT ARISES FROM TRANSACTIONS

DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE TRANSACTING

ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE

OBLIGATIONS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., WHICH DIRECTLY

ISSUES OR GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF GOLDMAN SACHS

SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS. THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR

EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN

DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS OWN

DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING

CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON A

COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE CALCULATION. SEE

 LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK  CREDIT

RATINGS BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CREDIT

RATINGS.

EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT LEVEL AND OPTIMIZE THE

COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL THROUGH

REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND ISSUANCES OF PREFERRED

STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO A TRUST AND

SUBORDINATED DEBT.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

WE USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY

AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER TIME

RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET

PURCHASES AND IS INFLUENCED BY OUR OVERALL CAPITAL POSITION (THE

COMPARISON OF OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO OUR AVAILABLE

CAPITAL), GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND

TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO A TRUST.

AS OF

NOVEMBER 2006, WE HAD OUTSTANDING JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT

ISSUED TO A TRUST OF $2.75 BILLION, INCLUDED IN

UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

OF THESE SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE

SECURITIES, OUR ABILITY TO DEFER COUPON INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN

THE OBLIGATIONS IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, ARE SUCH THAT THEY

QUALIFY AS REGULATORY CAPITAL FOR CSE PURPOSES, AND THUS, ARE

PART OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL.

ALTHOUGH NOT PART OF OUR

OUR COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE AGREEMENTS TO LEND TO

COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE FIXED TERMINATION DATES AND ARE

CONTINGENT ON THE SATISFACTION OF ALL CONDITIONS TO BORROWING

SET FORTH IN THE CONTRACT. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR LENDING

ACTIVITIES, WE HAD OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT OF

$100.48 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2006 COMPARED WITH

$61.12 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2005. SINCE THESE COMMITMENTS

MAY EXPIRE UNUSED OR BE REDUCED OR CANCELLED AT THE

COUNTERPARTYS REQUEST, THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT DOES

NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE ACTUAL FUTURE CASH FLOW

REQUIREMENTS. OUR COMMERCIAL LENDING COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE

WILLIAM STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM ARE GENERALLY EXTENDED

IN CONNECTION WITH CONTINGENT ACQUISITION FINANCING AND OTHER

TYPES OF CORPORATE LENDING. WE MAY SEEK TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT

RISK ON THESE COMMITMENTS BY SYNDICATING ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL

PORTIONS OF COMMITMENTS TO OTHER INVESTORS. IN ADDITION,

COMMITMENTS THAT ARE EXTENDED FOR CONTINGENT ACQUISITION

FINANCING ARE OFTEN SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AS BORROWERS OFTEN

REPLACE THEM WITH OTHER FUNDING SOURCES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMMITMENTS PROVIDED UNDER THE WILLIAM

STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM ARE TO INVESTMENT-GRADE

CORPORATE BORROWERS. COMMITMENTS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE PRIMARILY

EXTENDED BY WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENT CORPORATION (COMMITMENT

CORP.), A CONSOLIDATED WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GROUP INC.

WHOSE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE LEGALLY SEPARATED FROM OTHER

ASSETS

WILLIAM STREET FUNDING CORPORATION (FUNDING CORP.), ANOTHER

CONSOLIDATED WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GROUP INC. WHOSE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO LEGALLY SEPARATED FROM OTHER ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS. WITH RESPECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENTS, SMFG PROVIDES US WITH CREDIT

LOSS PROTECTION THAT IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE FIRST

LOSS WE REALIZE ON APPROVED LOAN COMMITMENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF

$1.00 BILLION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF

CERTAIN CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL PROVIDE

PROTECTION FOR 70% OF THE SECOND LOSS ON SUCH COMMITMENTS, UP TO

A MAXIMUM OF $1.13 BILLION. WE ALSO USE OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN WILLIAM

STREET COMMITMENTS NOT COVERED BY SMFG.

OUR COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ALSO INCLUDE FINANCING FOR THE

WAREHOUSING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO BE SECURITIZED, PRIMARILY IN

CONNECTION WITH COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS) AND

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPAID FROM

THE PROCEEDS OF THE RELATED SECURITIZATIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY OR

MAY NOT ACT AS UNDERWRITER. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE SECURED BY

THE WAREHOUSED ASSETS, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF MORTGAGE-BACKED

RISK MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS OF PRIMARY

IMPORTANCE TO THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE

A COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO MONITOR, EVALUATE AND

MANAGE THE PRINCIPAL RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR

ACTIVITIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE MARKET, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL EXPOSURES.

RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A

VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS. IN

ADDITION, A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING

RISK EXPOSURES AND FOR GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS, AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW. THESE COMMITTEES (INCLUDING

THEIR SUBCOMMITTEES), MEET REGULARLY AND CONSIST OF SENIOR

MEMBERS OF BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND DEPARTMENTS THAT

ARE INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS.

SEGREGATION OF DUTIES AND MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT ARE FUNDAMENTAL

ELEMENTS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. IN ADDITION TO THE

COMMITTEES DESCRIBED BELOW, FUNCTIONS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF

THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, SUCH AS COMPLIANCE, FINANCE, LEGAL,

MANAGEMENT CONTROLS (INTERNAL AUDIT) AND OPERATIONS, PERFORM

RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE MONITORING, ANALYZING

AND EVALUATING RISK.

MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.

ALL RISK CONTROL FUNCTIONS

ACTIVITIES OF EXISTING BUSINESSES, APPROVES NEW BUSINESSES AND

PRODUCTS, APPROVES FIRMWIDE AND DIVISIONAL MARKET RISK LIMITS,

REVIEWS BUSINESS UNIT MARKET RISK LIMITS, APPROVES MARKET RISK

LIMITS FOR SELECTED SOVEREIGN MARKETS AND BUSINESS UNITS,

APPROVES SOVEREIGN CREDIT RISK LIMITS AND CREDIT RISK LIMITS BY

RATINGS GROUP, AND REVIEWS SCENARIO ANALYSES BASED ON ABNORMAL

OR CATASTROPHIC MARKET MOVEMENTS.

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DIVISIONAL RISK COMMITTEE SETS MARKET RISK LIMITS FOR OUR

TRADING ACTIVITIES SUBJECT TO OVERALL FIRMWIDE RISK LIMITS,

BASED ON A NUMBER OF MEASURES, INCLUDING VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR),

STRESS TESTS AND SCENARIO ANALYSES. SEVERAL OTHER COMMITTEES

OVERSEE VARIOUS RISK, VALUATION, OPERATIONAL, CREDIT AND

BUSINESS PRACTICE ISSUES RELATED TO OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS.

BUSINESS UNIT RISK LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE VARIOUS RISK

COMMITTEES AND MAY BE FURTHER ALLOCATED BY THE BUSINESS UNIT

MANAGERS TO INDIVIDUAL TRADING DESKS. TRADING DESK MANAGERS HAVE

THE FIRST LINE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING RISK WITHIN

PRESCRIBED LIMITS. THESE MANAGERS HAVE IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE

PRIMARY SOURCES OF RISK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS AND THE

INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO HEDGE THEIR EXPOSURES.

MARKET RISK LIMITS ARE MONITORED BY THE FINANCE DIVISION AND ARE

REVIEWED REGULARLY BY THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE. LIMIT

VIOLATIONS ARE REPORTED TO THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE AND

BUSINESS UNIT MANAGERS AND ADDRESSED, AS NECESSARY. CREDIT RISK

LIMITS ARE ALSO MONITORED BY THE FINANCE DIVISION AND REVIEWED

BY THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE.

BUSINESS PRACTICES COMMITTEE.

THE BUSINESS PRACTICES

COMMITTEE ASSISTS SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN ITS OVERSIGHT OF

COMPLIANCE, LEGAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS AND RELATED REPUTATIONAL

CONCERNS, SUCH AS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE BUSINESS

PRACTICES COMMITTEE ALSO REVIEWS GOLDMAN SACHS BUSINESS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET RISK

THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR TRADING AND

INVESTING POSITIONS IS REFERRED TO AS MARKET RISK. SUCH

POSITIONS RESULT FROM MARKET-MAKING, SPECIALIST, PROPRIETARY

TRADING AND INVESTING, AND UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES.

CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATES,

EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. A

DESCRIPTION OF EACH MARKET RISK CATEGORY IS SET FORTH BELOW.



INTEREST RATE RISKS PRIMARILY RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES

IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE, THE

VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND

CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES

AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, EQUITY BASKETS AND

EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS

ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND

PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THESE RISKS BY DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES,

CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING ECONOMIC HEDGES IN

RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY HEDGE A

PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCKS BY TAKING AN OFFSETTING POSITION IN A

RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AN

EXPOSURE MAY, HOWEVER, BE LIMITED BY ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE

LIQUIDITY OF THE SECURITY OR THE RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT AND IN

THE CORRELATION OF PRICE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND

RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT.

IN ADDITION TO APPLYING BUSINESS JUDGMENT, SENIOR MANAGEMENT

USES A NUMBER OF QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

MARKET RISK FOR OUR LONG AND SHORT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THESE

TOOLS INCLUDE.



RISK LIMITS BASED ON A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE

REFERRED TO AS VAR;



SCENARIO ANALYSES, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT

MEASURE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON OUR TRADING NET REVENUES OF

VARIOUS MARKET EVENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A LARGE

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT MOVES IN SELECTED EMERGING

MARKETS; AND



INVENTORY POSITION LIMITS FOR SELECTED BUSINESS UNITS.

VAR

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF GOLDMAN SACHS

TRADING POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED

TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

FOR THE VAR NUMBERS REPORTED BELOW, A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND A

95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL WERE USED. THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS A 1 IN

20 CHANCE THAT DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES WILL FALL BELOW THE

EXPECTED DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES BY AN AMOUNT AT LEAST AS

LARGE AS THE REPORTED VAR. THUS, SHORTFALLS FROM EXPECTED

TRADING NET REVENUES ON A SINGLE TRADING DAY GREATER THAN THE

REPORTED VAR WOULD BE ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR, ON AVERAGE, ABOUT

ONCE A MONTH. SHORTFALLS ON A SINGLE DAY CAN EXCEED REPORTED VAR

BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. SHORTFALLS CAN ALSO ACCUMULATE OVER A

LONGER TIME HORIZON SUCH AS A NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

THE MODELING OF THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR TRADING

POSITIONS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS.

WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND

APPROXIMATIONS ARE REASONABLE, THERE IS NO STANDARD METHODOLOGY

FOR ESTIMATING VAR, AND DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND/OR

APPROXIMATIONS COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR ESTIMATES.

90

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OUR VAR AND, TO BETTER

REFLECT CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WE GENERALLY WEIGHT

HISTORICAL DATA TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT

OBSERVATIONS. GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST

EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE

ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION OF VAR IS THAT THE

DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT

PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK. DIFFERENT

VAR METHODOLOGIES AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS COULD PRODUCE A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR. MOREOVER, VAR CALCULATED FOR A ONE-DAY

TIME HORIZON DOES NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE MARKET RISK OF POSITIONS

THAT CANNOT BE LIQUIDATED OR OFFSET WITH HEDGES WITHIN ONE DAY.

CHANGES IN VAR BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS ARE GENERALLY DUE TO

CHANGES IN LEVELS OF EXPOSURE, VOLATILITIES AND/OR CORRELATIONS

AMONG ASSET CLASSES.

OUR AVERAGE DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $70 MILLION IN 2005 FROM

$67 MILLION IN 2004. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICES, EQUITY PRICES AND

INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY ASSETS.

FOLLOWING CHART SETS FORTH THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF OUR

DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVENTORY

POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2006.

(1)

BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE EXCLUDED DAILY NET

REVENUES FROM OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS AND OUR POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES FROM THIS CHART. AMOUNTS FOR THE FULL YEAR HAVE BEEN

ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.

AS PART OF OUR OVERALL RISK CONTROL PROCESS, DAILY TRADING NET

REVENUES ARE COMPARED WITH VAR CALCULATED AS OF THE END OF THE

PRIOR BUSINESS DAY. TRADING LOSSES INCURRED ON A SINGLE DAY

EXCEEDED OUR 95%

ONE-DAY

VAR ON THREE

OCCASIONS DURING 2006.

OTHER MARKET RISK MEASURES

CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS AND INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

VAR, WHERE VAR IS NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF RISK

(E.G., DUE TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND/OR ILLIQUIDITY). THE

MARKET RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AND THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC IS

MEASURED BY ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES

ASSOCIATED WITH A 10% DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE AND

A 10% DECLINE IN THE ICBC ORDINARY SHARE PRICE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THE REMAINING POSITIONS IS MEASURED

BY ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED

WITH A 10% DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES FOR EQUITY AND DEBT POSITIONS IN OUR

TRADING PORTFOLIO AND EQUITY, DEBT (PRIMARILY MEZZANINE

INSTRUMENTS) AND REAL ESTATE POSITIONS IN OUR

NON-TRADING

PORTFOLIO

ARE MEASURED BY THE IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN THE ASSET VALUES

(INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LEVERAGE IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS

FOR REAL ESTATE POSITIONS IN OUR

NON-TRADING

PORTFOLIO)

OF SUCH POSITIONS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING POSITIONS

MAY BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES

OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO BUDGETS OR PROJECTIONS, THE PROJECTED

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES, TRENDS

WITHIN SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS, UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODELS AND

EQUITY PRICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG, NET OF THE ECONOMIC HEDGE ON THE

UNRESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING A PORTION OF OUR

INVESTMENT, IS MEASURED BY THE IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN THE SMFG

COMMON STOCK PRICE. THIS SENSITIVITY SHOULD NOT BE EXTRAPOLATED

TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE, AS THE

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT AND THE

SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE WOULD BE NONLINEAR DUE TO DOWNSIDE

PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STOCK PRICE.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC EXCLUDES INTERESTS HELD BY INVESTMENT FUNDS

MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS.

BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE EXCLUDED FROM OUR

CALCULATION OF VAR CERTAIN EQUITY POSITIONS GENERALLY DUE TO

THEIR TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS OR ILLIQUIDITY. THE EFFECT OF

EXCLUDING THESE POSITIONS FROM VAR WAS NOT MATERIAL TO PRIOR

PERIODS AND, ACCORDINGLY, VAR FOR SUCH PERIODS HAS NOT BEEN

ADJUSTED. WE HAVE CALCULATED THE 10% SENSITIVITY MEASURE FOR

THESE EQUITY POSITIONS (I.E., TRADING RISK EQUITY) AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005 TO PROVIDE A

PERIOD-TO-PERIOD

COMPARISON. TO THE EXTENT THAT OTHER MARKET RISK MEASURES IN THE

ABOVE TABLE WERE AFFECTED, SUCH MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO

CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

(2)

IN ADDITION TO THE POSITIONS IN THESE PORTFOLIOS, WHICH ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, WE MAKE INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD AND WE ALSO MAKE DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN

REAL ESTATE, BOTH OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION. DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ON OTHER

ASSETS.

(3)

RELATES TO INTERESTS IN OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS.

DURING 2006, THE MARKET RISK FOR EQUITY POSITIONS IN OUR TRADING

PORTFOLIO INCREASED DUE TO NEW INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS AN

INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN

MARKET RISK IN 2006 FOR DEBT POSITIONS IN OUR TRADING PORTFOLIO

AND DEBT, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER EQUITY POSITIONS IN OUR

NON-TRADING

PORTFOLIO

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW INVESTMENTS.

THE DECREASE IN MARKET RISK IN 2006 FOR SMFG WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL HEDGING WITH RESPECT TO THE SECOND

ONE-THIRD

INSTALLMENT

OF UNRESTRICTED SHARES UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT DUE

TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK.

CREDIT RISK

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS THAT WE WOULD INCUR IF A

COUNTERPARTY OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE

HOLD FAILS TO PERFORM UNDER ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO US,

OR UPON A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTC

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVES, WE HOLD. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY

ARISES THROUGH OUR TRADING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE SEEK TO ENTER INTO NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION,

WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES BY (I) ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE

US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM A COUNTERPARTY ON AN UPFRONT OR

CONTINGENT BASIS, (II) SEEKING

THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES

OF THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS, AND/OR

(III) TRANSFERRING OUR CREDIT RISK TO THIRD PARTIES USING

CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND/OR OTHER STRUCTURES AND TECHNIQUES.

TO MEASURE AND MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE USE A VARIETY OF

TOOLS, INCLUDING CREDIT LIMITS REFERENCED TO BOTH CURRENT

EXPOSURE AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE IS GENERALLY

BASED ON PROJECTED

WORST-CASE

MARKET

MOVEMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, AS PART

OF OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, FOR POSITIONS MEASURED BY

CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS, WE USE VAR AND OTHER SENSITIVITY

MEASURES. TO SUPPLEMENT OUR PRIMARY CREDIT EXPOSURE MEASURES, WE

ALSO USE SCENARIO ANALYSES, SUCH AS CREDIT SPREAD WIDENING

SCENARIOS, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER QUANTITATIVE TOOLS.

OUR GLOBAL CREDIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MONITOR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO

COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. THESE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRMWIDE RISK AND CREDIT POLICY

COMMITTEES, WITH INFORMATION REGARDING CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT,

INDUSTRY SECTOR, COUNTRY AND REGION.

WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND

COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS,

INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, RESULTING IN

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER.

AS OF BOTH NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005, WE HELD

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS THAT

REPRESENTED 6% AND 7% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. IN

ADDITION, MOST OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AS WELL AS SOME DERIVATIVES ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL AGENCY AND OTHER

SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER

2005, WE DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY

THAT EXCEEDED 5% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES

HAVE BEEN INCREASING, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GROWTH OF

OUR LENDING AND OTC DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET EVOLUTION

TOWARDS LONGER DATED TRANSACTIONS. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS BELOW.

CREDIT RISK ON DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED

INTO TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY

POSITIONS OR AS A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, WE

ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON

OUR NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS

AND TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON OUR

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS

AND CERTAIN

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND WE BELIEVE

THAT THE ASSOCIATED MARKET RISK CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD RELATIVE

TO ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OR RISKS BEING HEDGED, OR AS

PART OF A BROADER TRADING STRATEGY. ACCORDINGLY, THE MARKET RISK

OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS IS MANAGED TOGETHER WITH OUR

NONDERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED NET OF

CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND

ARE REPORTED ON A

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE LEGAL RISKS INCLUDING

THE RISK THAT THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATE FOR A

COUNTERPARTY, THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY EXECUTED

OR THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE

COUNTERPARTY. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS BY OBTAINING

ADVICE OF COUNSEL ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS

ON THE AUTHORITY OF A COUNTERPARTY TO EFFECT THE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS (E.G.,

CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS) INVOLVE THE RISK THAT WE MAY HAVE

DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING

SECURITY OR OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO SATISFY ANY PHYSICAL

SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENT.

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO COMPANIES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOST FAILURES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT

LIQUIDITY RESULTING FROM ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY,

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING POLICIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS BOTH GOLDMAN

SACHS-SPECIFIC

AND

BROADER INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL

OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO FUND GOLDMAN SACHS AND TO ENABLE OUR

CORE BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE EVEN UNDER

ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES ACCORDING TO THE

FOLLOWING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.



EXCESS LIQUIDITY  WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS

LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS IN A

STRESSED ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING FINANCING OBLIGATIONS.



ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT  WE ENSURE OUR FUNDING SOURCES ARE

SUFFICIENTLY

LONG-TERM

IN ORDER TO WITHSTAND A PROLONGED OR SEVERE

LIQUIDITY-STRESSED

ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON ASSET SALES.



CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE  WE ACCESS FUNDING

ACROSS A DIVERSE RANGE OF MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES,

EMPHASIZE LESS

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

SOURCES OF FUNDING AND CONSERVATIVELY MANAGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF

FUNDING ACROSS OUR ENTITY STRUCTURE.



CRISIS PLANNING  WE BASE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING

MANAGEMENT ON

STRESS-SCENARIO

PLANNING AND MAINTAIN A CRISIS PLAN DETAILING OUR RESPONSE TO A

LIQUIDITY THREATENING EVENT.

EXCESS LIQUIDITY

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO

PRE-FUND

WHAT WE

ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR LIKELY CASH NEEDS DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS

AND HOLD SUCH EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF UNENCUMBERED,

HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT MAY BE SOLD OR PLEDGED TO PROVIDE

SAME-DAY

LIQUIDITY.

THIS GLOBAL CORE EXCESS LIQUIDITY IS INTENDED TO

ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL

OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POOL OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY PROVIDES

US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST

CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS SURVIVAL.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL

OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. GOLDMAN

SACHS BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND ITS CASH NEEDS ARE

DRIVEN BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE

DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS,

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED

FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE AND THE TERMS OR

AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO

PRE-FUND

LIQUIDITY THAT

WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED

SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER UNSECURED DEBT BALANCES THAN OUR

BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID

UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR UNSECURED

LIABILITIES.

THE SIZE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL

LIQUIDITY MODEL TOGETHER WITH A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE

CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OF GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR

LIQUIDITY MODEL IDENTIFIES AND ESTIMATES CASH AND COLLATERAL

OUTFLOWS OVER A

SHORT-TERM

HORIZON IN A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.



UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT AND LETTERS OF CREDIT;



POTENTIAL BUYBACKS OF A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING NEGOTIABLE

UNSECURED DEBT;



ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE TERMS OR AVAILABILITY OF SECURED FUNDING;



DERIVATIVES AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, INCLUDING

THOSE DUE TO MARKET MOVES;



POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRIME BROKERAGE

BUSINESS;



ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL THAT COULD BE CALLED IN THE EVENT OF A

OUR CREDIT RATINGS;



DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS NOT SUPPORTED BY WILLIAM

NON-U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

EXCESS IS COMPRISED OF ONLY UNENCUMBERED FRENCH, GERMAN, UNITED

KINGDOM AND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS AND EURO, BRITISH POUND

AND JAPANESE YEN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO THIS NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES

AND CASH THAT WE BELIEVE ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT

FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT

IT IS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT

COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE REMAINDER

IS PRIMARILY HELD TO BETTER MATCH THE CURRENCY AND TIMING

REQUIREMENTS FOR POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY OBLIGATIONS OF OUR

PRINCIPAL

NON-U.S.

THE GLOBAL CORE EXCESS EXCLUDES LIQUID ASSETS OF

$6.93 BILLION HELD SEPARATELY BY WILLIAM STREET FUNDING

CORPORATION. SEE  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMITMENTS ABOVE FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE WILLIAM

STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM.

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION TO OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AS A RESULT OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THESE ASSETS, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA, INCLUDE OTHER GOVERNMENT BONDS,

HIGH-GRADE

MONEY MARKET

SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND MARGINABLE EQUITIES. WE DO NOT

INCLUDE THESE SECURITIES IN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS.

WE MAINTAIN GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS IN

AN AMOUNT THAT, IF PLEDGED OR SOLD, WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDS

NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST 110% OF OUR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS

THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE (OR WHERE HOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION

TO REDEEM) WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ASSUME

CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES THAT ARE BASED ON

STRESS-SCENARIO

BORROWING CAPACITY AND WE REGULARLY REVIEW THESE ASSUMPTIONS

ASSET CLASS BY ASSET CLASS.

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS

MARKED-TO-MARKET

DAILY.

WE UTILIZE AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO OUR BUSINESSES TO HOLD

INVENTORY OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

LIMITS PROVIDE A COMPLEMENTARY MECHANISM FOR ENSURING

APPROPRIATE BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY IN ADDITION TO OUR STANDARD

POSITION LIMITS. ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES DUE TO

SEASONAL ACTIVITY, MARKET CONVENTIONS AND PERIODIC MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND

ADJUSTED ASSETS AT FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATES ARE NOT MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR REPORTING PERIODS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THE MATURITY PROFILE OF OUR FUNDING BASE SUCH

THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS PRIOR TO OUR

LIABILITIES COMING DUE, EVEN IN TIMES OF PROLONGED OR SEVERE

LIQUIDITY STRESS. WE DO NOT RELY ON IMMEDIATE SALES OF ASSETS

(OTHER THAN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS) TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY IN A

DISTRESSED ENVIRONMENT, ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE ORDERLY ASSET

SALES MAY BE PRUDENT AND NECESSARY IN A PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY

CRISIS.

IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES, OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE

THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL CAPITAL (UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS

PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) TO FUND OUR BALANCE SHEET

FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE AMOUNT OF OUR TOTAL CAPITAL IS BASED

ON AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, WHICH INCORPORATES, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE FOLLOWING

LONG-TERM

FINANCING

REQUIREMENTS.



THE PORTION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED THAT WE BELIEVE COULD

NOT BE FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS,

ASSUMING CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES;



GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS;



DERIVATIVE AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS;



ANTICIPATED DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS; AND



SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS IN EXCESS OF THEIR

LONG-TERM

REQUIREMENTS. SEE  CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY

A LARGE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS ARE FUNDED THROUGH SECURED

FUNDING MARKETS OR NONRECOURSE FINANCING. WE FOCUS ON

DEMONSTRATING A CONSISTENT ABILITY TO FUND THESE ASSETS ON A

SECURED BASIS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME TO REDUCE REFINANCING

RISK AND TO HELP ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED AMOUNT OF

LOAN VALUE IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN BE FUNDED IN PERIODS OF MARKET

STRESS.

CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY

STRUCTURE

WE SEEK TO STRUCTURE OUR LIABILITIES CONSERVATIVELY TO REDUCE

REFINANCING RISK AND THE RISK THAT WE MAY REDEEM OR REPURCHASE

CERTAIN OF OUR BORROWINGS PRIOR TO THEIR CONTRACTUAL MATURITY.

OUR CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING

POLICIES.



WE FUND A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR INVENTORY ON A SECURED

BASIS. WE BELIEVE SECURED FINANCING PROVIDES GOLDMAN SACHS WITH

A MORE STABLE SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY THAN UNSECURED FINANCING, AS

IT IS LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT DUE TO UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL.

OUR LIQUIDITY DEPENDS TO AN IMPORTANT DEGREE ON THE STABILITY OF

OUR

SHORT-TERM

UNSECURED FINANCING BASE. ACCORDINGLY, WE PREFER THE USE OF

PROMISSORY NOTES (IN WHICH GOLDMAN SACHS DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET)

OVER COMMERCIAL PAPER, WHICH WE MAY REPURCHASE PRIOR TO MATURITY

THROUGH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A MARKET MAKER. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005, OUR UNSECURED

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS,

INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION OF UNSECURED

WE RECOGNIZE THAT SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS HAVE GREATER

REFINANCING RISK WHEN THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL IS MORE

DIFFICULT TO FUND. CONSEQUENTLY, WE SEEK LONGER MATURITIES FOR

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COLLATERALIZED BY THESE ASSETS. IN

SOME CASES, WE USE EXTENDIBLE MATURITY FEATURES TO OBTAIN A

ROLLING MINIMUM TERM TO THE FUNDING.



WE ISSUE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT WITHOUT

PROVISIONS THAT WOULD, BASED SOLELY UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN

OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR

STOCK PRICE, TRIGGER A REQUIREMENT FOR AN EARLY PAYMENT,

COLLATERAL SUPPORT, CHANGE IN TERMS, ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OR

THE CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES

GLOBALLY FOR BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING. WE MAKE

EXTENSIVE USE OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES LENDING

MARKETS, AS WELL AS OTHER SECURED FUNDING MARKETS. IN ADDITION,

WE ISSUE DEBT THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS,

U.S. REGISTERED AND 144A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAMS,

OFFSHORE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE OFFERINGS AND OTHER BOND OFFERINGS,

U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND PROMISSORY NOTE ISSUANCES, AND OTHER METHODS. WE ALSO

ARRANGE FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT TO BE ISSUED ON OUR BEHALF.

WE BENEFIT FROM DISTRIBUTING OUR DEBT ISSUANCES THROUGH OUR OWN

SALES FORCE TO A LARGE, DIVERSE GLOBAL CREDITOR BASE AND WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE CRITICAL

TO OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR CREDITORS INCLUDE BANKS, GOVERNMENTS,

SECURITIES LENDERS, PENSION FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

MUTUAL FUNDS. WE ACCESS FUNDING IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS IN THE

UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL

GUIDELINES ON INVESTOR CONCENTRATION, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER THAT CAN BE OWNED AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

THAT CAN BE ISSUED BY ANY SINGLE INVESTOR OR GROUP OF INVESTORS.

TO MITIGATE REFINANCING RISK, WE HAVE CREATED INTERNAL

GUIDELINES ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT MATURING ON ANY ONE

DAY OR DURING ANY WEEK OR YEAR. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH

OUR QUARTERLY UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS MATURITY PROFILE

THROUGH 2012.

(1)

OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INCLUDE EXTENDIBLE DEBT IF

THE EARLIEST MATURITY IS ONE YEAR OR GREATER FROM OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENT DATE. EXTENDIBLE DEBT IS CATEGORIZED IN THE MATURITY

PROFILE AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MATURITY EVEN THOUGH THE DEBT

CAN BE, AND IN THE PAST GENERALLY HAS BEEN, EXTENDED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS AS OF NOVEMBER 2006 WAS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT YEARS. WE

SWAP A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO

U.S. DOLLAR OBLIGATIONS WITH SHORT-TERM FLOATING INTEREST

RATES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES AND

FOREIGN EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP INC.

THE PARENT COMPANY THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET

FINANCING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT

COMPANY PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY

CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF

THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING INCLUDE ENHANCED CONTROL AND

GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ARE PREDICATED ON AN

ASSUMPTION THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR, FUNDS OR

SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE FROM A SUBSIDIARY TO ITS

PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR LIMIT THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD

IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. AS SUCH, WE ASSUME THAT

CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE ASSUME THAT THE GLOBAL CORE EXCESS

HELD IN OUR PRINCIPAL

NON-U.S.

OPERATING

ENTITIES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES AND THEREFORE IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO MEET THE

POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE ENTITIES.

WE ALSO MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY RISK BY REQUIRING SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR

SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE

PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES

OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN

ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY BORROWINGS. IN

ADDITION, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES PLEDGE

COLLATERAL TO THE PARENT COMPANY TO COVER THEIR INTERCOMPANY

BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN SUBORDINATED DEBT) IN ORDER TO MITIGATE

PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY RISK.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES; FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF NOVEMBER 2006, GROUP

INC. HAD $17.32 BILLION OF SUCH EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED

INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., ITS

PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER;

$23.87 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL, A

REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER; $2.50 BILLION INVESTED IN

GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P., A

U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; AND $2.79 BILLION

INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL) A

REGULATED JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER. GROUP INC. ALSO HAD

$46.25 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS TO THESE ENTITIES AS

OF NOVEMBER 2006, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL

INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRISIS PLANNING

IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR A LIQUIDITY EVENT, OR A PERIOD OF

MARKET STRESS, WE BASE OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

AND OUR RESULTING FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY POLICIES ON CONSERVATIVE

STRESS-SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS. OUR PLANNING INCORPORATES SEVERAL

MARKET-BASED AND OPERATIONAL STRESS SCENARIOS. WE ALSO

PERIODICALLY CONDUCT LIQUIDITY CRISIS DRILLS TO TEST OUR LINES

OF COMMUNICATION AND BACKUP FUNDING PROCEDURES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS PLAN THAT SPECIFIES

AN APPROACH FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A

LIQUIDITY-THREATENING

EVENT. THE PLAN PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELY

IMPACT OF A LIQUIDITY EVENT ON GOLDMAN SACHS BASED ON SOME OF

THE RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE AND OUTLINES WHICH AND TO WHAT EXTENT

LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BASED ON

102

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. IT ALSO LISTS THE CRISIS MANAGEMENT

TEAM AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTIES TO BE CONTACTED TO ENSURE

EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION.

CREDIT RATINGS

WE RELY UPON THE SHORT-TERM AND

LONG-TERM

DEBT CAPITAL

MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

DAY-TO-DAY

OPERATIONS.

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING IS INFLUENCED BY OUR

CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE

COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND WHEN WE SEEK TO ENGAGE IN

LONGER TERM TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES. WE BELIEVE

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT RATING

AGENCIES ASSESSMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT AND

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY

OF OUR EARNINGS, OUR CAPITAL BASE, OUR FRANCHISE, REPUTATION AND

MANAGEMENT, OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE EXTERNAL OPERATING

ENVIRONMENT. SEE  CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS ABOVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS.

TO BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES OF

APPROXIMATELY $595 MILLION WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED IN THE

EVENT OF A

ONE-NOTCH

REDUCTION IN OUR

LONG-TERM

CREDIT

RATINGS. IN EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE CONSIDER

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT WOULD BE

REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A

TWO-NOTCH

DOWNGRADE IN

OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT

BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

CASH FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX

AND INTERRELATED AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS

AND NET ASSETS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN EVALUATING OUR

LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY,

HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESS.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2006.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

DECREASED BY $3.97 BILLION TO $6.29 BILLION AT THE END

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY IN

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS AS

WELL AS THROUGH SECURED FINANCINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COMMON

STOCK REPURCHASES. WE USED NET CASH OF $57.37 BILLION IN

OURSELVES.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

REPURCHASES. WE USED NET CASH OF $13.48 BILLION IN OUR

TRADING AND INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CLIENTS AND

OURSELVES.

IN LIGHT OF THE FAVORABLE DEBT FINANCING ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS

FOR OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, TO MEET ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS AT SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS

AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SUPPORT FOR OUR WILLIAM STREET

LOAN COMMITMENTS PROGRAM.

OPERATIONAL RISK

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR

SYSTEMS, AND FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN ARISE

FROM MANY FACTORS RANGING FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS TO

POTENTIALLY COSTLY INCIDENTS ARISING, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM MAJOR

SYSTEMS FAILURES. OPERATIONAL RISK MAY ALSO CAUSE REPUTATIONAL

HARM. THUS, EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY, MANAGE AND MITIGATE OPERATIONAL

RISK MUST BE EQUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE RISK OF REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AS WELL AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS.

WE MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF

LONG-STANDING,

BUT

CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING, FIRMWIDE CONTROL STANDARDS: THE TRAINING,

SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE; THE ACTIVE

PARTICIPATION AND COMMITMENT OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN A

CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING KEY OPERATIONAL

RISKS ACROSS GOLDMAN SACHS; AND A FRAMEWORK OF STRONG AND

INDEPENDENT CONTROL DEPARTMENTS THAT MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK ON

A DAILY BASIS. TOGETHER, THESE ELEMENTS FORM A STRONG FIRMWIDE

CONTROL CULTURE THAT SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR EFFORTS TO

MINIMIZE EVENTS THAT CREATE OPERATIONAL RISK AND THE DAMAGE THEY

CAN CAUSE.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK DEPARTMENT, AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT

FUNCTION, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A

STANDARDIZED FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND MANAGE

OPERATIONAL RISK ACROSS GOLDMAN SACHS. THIS FRAMEWORK, WHICH

EVOLVES WITH THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY

GUIDANCE, TAKES INTO ACCOUNT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL

RISK EVENTS, BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL FACTORS,

THE ONGOING ANALYSIS OF

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC

RISK

METRICS AND THE USE OF SCENARIO ANALYSIS. WHILE INDIVIDUAL

BUSINESS UNITS HAVE DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTROL AND

MITIGATION OF OPERATIONAL RISK, THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A

CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING AND MONITORING

OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS AT THE BUSINESS UNIT AND FIRMWIDE

LEVEL. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONAL RISK SEE

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

SFAS NO.

123-R.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED

SFAS NO.

123-R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, WHICH IS A REVISION TO

SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION.

SFAS NO.

123-R

FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN

ENTITY OBTAINS EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARE-BASED

PAYMENTS. UNDER

SFAS NO.

123-R,

THE COST OF EMPLOYEE SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD

OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS IS GENERALLY MEASURED BASED ON THE

GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD. UNDER

SFAS NO.

123-R,

SHARE-BASED AWARDS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE (I.E.,

VESTED AWARDS) ARE EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY. SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE

AWARDS THAT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE

RELEVANT SERVICE PERIOD. WE ADOPTED

SFAS NO.

123-R

UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION METHOD. UNDER THAT

METHOD OF ADOPTION, THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO.

123-R

ARE GENERALLY APPLIED ONLY TO SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED

SUBSEQUENT TO ADOPTION. THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF SHARE-BASED

AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES PRIOR TO OUR

ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO.

123-R

HAS NOT CHANGED AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO

ADOPTION ARE NOT RESTATED FOR THE EFFECTS OF ADOPTING

SFAS NO.

123-R.

SFAS NO.

123-R

REQUIRES THE IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED

TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING AWARDS SUBJECT TO

NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS. SHARE-BASED AWARDS HELD BY EMPLOYEES

THAT WERE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO.

123-R

MUST CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE STATED SERVICE PERIOD OF

THE AWARD (AND ACCELERATED IF THE

104

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY RETIRES). CONSEQUENTLY, OUR COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES IN 2006 INCLUDED (AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT,

2007 AND 2008 WILL INCLUDE) BOTH THE AMORTIZATION OF AWARDS HELD

BY EMPLOYEES THAT WERE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF

ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO.

123-R

AS WELL AS THE FULL GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF NEW AWARDS GRANTED

TO SUCH EMPLOYEES UNDER

SFAS NO.

123-R.

IF WE HAD AMORTIZED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PRIOR TO THE

ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO.

123-R

OVER A PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND ENDING ON THE

EARLIER OF THE VESTING DATE OR THE DATE OF RETIREMENT

ELIGIBILITY, COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN

$637 MILLION LOWER IN 2006, APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION

HIGHER IN 2005 AND APPROXIMATELY $375 MILLION HIGHER IN

2004.

SFAS NO.

123-R

REQUIRES EXPECTED FORFEITURES TO BE INCLUDED IN DETERMINING

SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION

OF

SFAS NO.

123-R,

FORFEITURE BENEFITS WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS EXPENSE WHEN AN EMPLOYEE LEFT GOLDMAN SACHS AND

FORFEITED THE AWARD. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE RECORDED A

BENEFIT FOR EXPECTED FORFEITURES ON ALL OUTSTANDING SHARE-BASED

AWARDS. THE TRANSITION IMPACT OF ADOPTING

SFAS NO.

123-R

AS OF THE FIRST DAY OF OUR 2006 FISCAL YEAR, INCLUDING THE

EFFECT OF ACCRUING FOR EXPECTED FORFEITURES ON OUTSTANDING

SHARE-BASED AWARDS, WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED

SFAS NO. 155, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB

STATEMENTS NO. 133 AND 140. SFAS NO. 155

PERMITS AN ENTITY TO MEASURE AT FAIR VALUE ANY HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT THAT CONTAINS AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE THAT OTHERWISE

WOULD REQUIRE BIFURCATION. AS PERMITTED, WE EARLY ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 155 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. ADOPTION

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

SFAS NO. 156.

EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2006, WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 156, ACCOUNTING FOR

SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB

FIN NO. 48.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED

FIN NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 109. FIN NO. 48 REQUIRES THAT

MANAGEMENT DETERMINE WHETHER A TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF

ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. ONCE IT IS DETERMINED THAT A

POSITION MEETS THIS RECOGNITION THRESHOLD, THE POSITION IS

MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE EXPECT TO ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF

FIN NO. 48 BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. WE

ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING

FIN NO. 48 ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

SFAS NO. 157.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 CLARIFIES THAT FAIR

VALUE IS AN EXIT PRICE, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE

EXCHANGED TO SELL AN ASSET OR TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. SFAS NO. 157

NULLIFIES THE CONSENSUS REACHED IN EITF ISSUE

NO.

BY SFAS NO. 155) WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY ALL OF THE

SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND VERIFY

THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. HOWEVER,

SFAS NO. 157 REQUIRES THAT A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

TECHNIQUE INCLUDE AN ADJUSTMENT FOR RISKS INHERENT IN A

PARTICULAR VALUATION TECHNIQUE (SUCH AS A PRICING MODEL) AND/OR

THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE INPUTS TO THE MODEL, IF MARKET

PARTICIPANTS WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SUCH AN ADJUSTMENT. IN ADDITION,

SFAS NO. 157 PROHIBITS THE RECOGNITION OF BLOCK

DISCOUNTS FOR LARGE HOLDINGS OF UNRESTRICTED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WHERE QUOTED PRICES ARE READILY AND REGULARLY

AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 157 ARE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY, EXCEPT

RETAINED EARNINGS, WE HAVE PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS OF EXISTING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MEASURED UNDER EITF

HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND BLOCK DISCOUNTS. TO DETERMINE THE

PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT THAT WILL BE RECORDED IN NET

REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, WE WILL PERFORM AN

ANALYSIS OF ALL OTHER POSITIONS. WITH RESPECT TO PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT MAY INCLUDE

POSITIVE CHANGES TO INVESTMENT VALUATIONS BASED ON AVAILABLE

MARKET EVIDENCE EVEN IF THERE HAVE BEEN NO THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE UNDERLYING

INVESTEE. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS

WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE

ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF SFAS NO. 157 ON

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

SFAS NO. 158.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND

RECOGNIZE IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION THE FUNDED

STATUS OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS,

MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN

ASSETS AND THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION. SFAS NO. 158 ALSO

REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS OF

A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLAN WITHIN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, TO THE

EXTENT SUCH CHANGES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS COMPONENTS

OF PERIODIC NET BENEFIT COST. SFAS NO. 158 IS

EFFECTIVE AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2006. WE WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 158 AS

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.

AS OF THE END OF THE FIRMS 2006 FISCAL YEAR, MANAGEMENT

CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT

NOTE 2.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

GROUP INC. AND ALL OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS

A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY

(VIE) OR A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY

(QSPE) UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.



VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE

ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK

IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES

INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE THE

OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES, THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE RESIDUAL

RETURNS AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE ENTITYS

ACTIVITIES. VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN

(ARB) NO. 51, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED. ARB NO. 51 STATES THAT

THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN

ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. ACCORDINGLY,

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS A

MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST.

116

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT LACK

ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY.

A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE IS PRESENT WHEN AN

ENTERPRISE HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST, OR A COMBINATION OF VARIABLE

INTERESTS, THAT WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE VIES

EXPECTED LOSSES, RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VIES EXPECTED

RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. THE ENTERPRISE WITH A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST, KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY,

CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION

(FIN) NO.

46-R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, THE

FIRM CONSOLIDATES VIES OF WHICH IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A

VIE BY FIRST PERFORMING A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VIE THAT

INCLUDES A REVIEW OF, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ITS CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL TERMS, WHICH INTERESTS CREATE OR ABSORB

VARIABILITY, RELATED PARTY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DESIGN OF THE

VIE. WHERE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE FIRM

PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING A

VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS TO ITS

VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, THE FIRM UTILIZES THE TOP

DOWN METHOD. UNDER THAT METHOD, THE FIRM CALCULATES ITS

SHARE OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL

RETURNS USING THE SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO

IT, BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR THE FIRMS

POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE VIE, UNDER VARIOUS

PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED SCENARIOS.



QSPES.

QSPES ARE PASSIVE ENTITIES THAT ARE COMMONLY USED

IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 140,

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES, SETS FORTH THE

CRITERIA AN ENTITY MUST SATISFY TO BE A QSPE. THESE CRITERIA

INCLUDE THE TYPES OF ASSETS A QSPE MAY HOLD, LIMITS ON ASSET

SALES, THE USE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, AND THE

LEVEL OF DISCRETION A SERVICER MAY EXERCISE IN ATTEMPTING TO

COLLECT RECEIVABLES. THESE CRITERIA MAY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT COMPLEX MATTERS, INCLUDING WHETHER A

DERIVATIVE IS CONSIDERED PASSIVE AND THE DEGREE OF DISCRETION A

SERVICER MAY EXERCISE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 140

AND

FIN NO.

46-R,

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE QSPES.



EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT EXERTS

SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING AND

FINANCIAL POLICIES (GENERALLY DEFINED AS OWNING A VOTING

INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%) AND HAS AN INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OR

IN-SUBSTANCE COMMON STOCK, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PRESCRIBED BY

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18,

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON

STOCK.



OTHER.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY OR

APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ALSO HAS FORMED NUMEROUS

NONCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS THAT

ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE FIRM ACTS

AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR THESE FUNDS AND DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY

OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN ANY FUND. FOR FUNDS ESTABLISHED ON

OR BEFORE JUNE 29, 2005 IN WHICH THE FIRM HOLDS MORE

THAN A MINOR INTEREST AND FOR FUNDS ESTABLISHED OR MODIFIED

AFTER JUNE 29, 2005, THE FIRM HAS GENERALLY PROVIDED THE

THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS WITH RIGHTS TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS THE

GENERAL PARTNER OR TO TERMINATE THE FUNDS (SEE

STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN, ALL REFERENCES TO NOVEMBER 2006,

NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004 REFER TO THE FIRMS FISCAL

YEARS ENDED, OR THE DATES, AS THE CONTEXT REQUIRES,

NOVEMBER 24, 2006, NOVEMBER 25, 2005 AND

NOVEMBER 26, 2004, RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS

HAVE BEEN MADE TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE

CURRENT PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT

REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL

LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND OTHER ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

INVESTMENT BANKING.

UNDERWRITING REVENUES AND FEES FROM

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL ADVISORY

ASSIGNMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS WHEN THE SERVICES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION

ARE COMPLETED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ENGAGEMENT. EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE RELATED

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OR THE ENGAGEMENT IS OTHERWISE CONCLUDED.

UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE PRESENTED NET OF RELATED EXPENSES.

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES, NET OF CLIENT

REIMBURSEMENTS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

TOTAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD,

BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ON A TRADE-DATE

BASIS AND CONSIST OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

OR AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, WITH RELATED UNREALIZED

GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT

AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT

TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR

LIQUIDATION SALE.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM SEPARATES ITS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS INTO THREE CATEGORIES  CASH (I.E.,

NONDERIVATIVE) TRADING INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.



CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM QUOTED

MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, BROKER OR DEALER PRICE

QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE

LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED IN

THIS MANNER INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES,

OTHER SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, LIQUID MORTGAGE

PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT-GRADE AND HIGH-YIELD CORPORATE BONDS,

LISTED EQUITIES, MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL AND

PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND HAVE

LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE

CERTAIN CORPORATE BANK LOANS, MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND

DISTRESSED DEBT. THE FIRM VALUES THESE INSTRUMENTS INITIALLY AT

COST AND GENERALLY DOES NOT ADJUST VALUATIONS UNLESS THERE IS

SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT OR VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS (SUCH AS SIMILAR

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR CHANGES IN

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING COMPANIES). WHERE THERE IS

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE, THE FIRM USES

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR

ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS.

118

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY THE FIRM (LONG POSITIONS) ARE

MARKED TO BID PRICES, AND INSTRUMENTS SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED

(SHORT POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE ILLIQUID OR HAVE

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, THE FAIR VALUE REFLECTS LIQUIDITY

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED

POLICIES. FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS,

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THESE

LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS. SEE  RECENT

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

IMPACT OF SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS ON THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.



DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONSIST OF EXCHANGE-TRADED AND

OVER-THE

-COUNTER (OTC)

DERIVATIVES AND ARE REFLECTED NET OF CASH THAT THE FIRM HAS PAID

AND RECEIVED (FOR EXAMPLE, OPTION PREMIUMS OR CASH PAID OR

RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS). FAIR VALUES OF

THE FIRMS EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY

DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED

USING VALUATION MODELS. THE FIRM USES A VARIETY OF VALUATION

MODELS INCLUDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH

FLOWS AND OPTION-PRICING MODELS. THE VALUATION MODELS USED TO

DERIVE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS OTC DERIVATIVES

REQUIRE INPUTS INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD

CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES

AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. THE SELECTION OF A MODEL TO

VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF,

AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. THE FIRM

GENERALLY USES SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM VERIFIES THE VALUES PRODUCED BY ITS

PRICING MODELS TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT

TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND

OPTIONS, MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT

BECAUSE MARKET PRICES ARE READILY AVAILABLE. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES

THAT TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS, MODEL SELECTION REQUIRES MORE

JUDGMENT BECAUSE SUCH INSTRUMENTS TEND TO BE MORE COMPLEX AND

PRICING INFORMATION IS LESS AVAILABLE IN THESE MARKETS. PRICE

TRANSPARENCY IS INHERENTLY MORE LIMITED FOR MORE COMPLEX

STRUCTURES BECAUSE THEY OFTEN COMBINE ONE OR MORE PRODUCT TYPES,

REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INPUTS SUCH AS CORRELATIONS AND

VOLATILITIES. AS MARKETS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MORE PRICING

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND

REFINE THE MODELS IT USES.

AT THE INCEPTION OF AN OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACT (DAY ONE), THE

FIRM VALUES THE CONTRACT AT THE MODEL VALUE IF THE FIRM CAN

VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. WHEN

APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT VARIOUS FACTORS

SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR

PREDETERMINED POLICIES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR

HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED

TO DETERMINE THESE ADJUSTMENTS.

WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS

TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM VALUES THE CONTRACT AT THE TRANSACTION

PRICE AT INCEPTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, RECORDS NO DAY ONE GAIN OR

LOSS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF ISSUE

NO.

02-3,

ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY

TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

FOLLOWING DAY ONE, THE FIRM ADJUSTS THE INPUTS TO ITS VALUATION

MODELS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT CHANGES IN THESE INPUTS CAN BE

VERIFIED BY SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY PRICING

SERVICES AND/OR BROKER QUOTES, OR CAN BE DERIVED FROM OTHER

SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUCH AS EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL

COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

IN VALUING CORPORATE AND REAL

ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

SEGMENT, THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO IS SEPARATED INTO PRIVATE

INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENTS IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG) AND THE

ORDINARY SHARES OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA

LIMITED (ICBC), AND OTHER PUBLIC INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRMS PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE,

HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE

INITIALLY CARRIED AT COST AS AN APPROXIMATION OF FAIR VALUE.

ADJUSTMENTS TO CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE IF THERE ARE THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS

ARE ALSO MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, IF IT

IS DETERMINED THAT THE EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN REACHING THAT

DETERMINATION, MANY FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

OF THE COMPANIES OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO BUDGETS OR

PROJECTIONS, TRENDS WITHIN SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS, UNDERLYING

BUSINESS MODELS, EXPECTED EXIT TIMING AND STRATEGY, AND ANY

SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS

CONVERSION FEATURES AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES. SEE

 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS BELOW FOR

A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF SFAS NO. 157 ON THE

VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRMS PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE

LARGE, CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS THAT RESULT FROM INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, ARE VALUED USING

QUOTED MARKET PRICES LESS A LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENT BASED

ON PREDETERMINED WRITTEN POLICIES.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SMFG IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM A MODEL

THAT INCORPORATES SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE AND CREDIT

SPREADS, THE IMPACT OF NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY, AND

DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE. THE

FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SMFG IS GENERALLY NONTRANSFERABLE WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF SMFG,

BUT IS FREELY CONVERTIBLE INTO SMFG COMMON STOCK. AS OF NOVEMBER

2006, THE FIRM HAD HEDGED TWO-THIRDS OF THE COMMON STOCK

UNDERLYING ITS INVESTMENT IN SMFG. RESTRICTIONS ON THE

FIRMS ABILITY TO HEDGE OR SELL THE REMAINING SHARES WILL

LAPSE ON FEBRUARY 7, 2007. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006, THE

CONVERSION PRICE WAS ¥318,800, SUBJECT TO DOWNWARD

ADJUSTMENT IF THE PRICE OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF

CONVERSION IS LESS THAN THE CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT TO A FLOOR

OF ¥105,100).

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC IS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES LESS A

LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENT. THE ORDINARY SHARES ACQUIRED

FROM ICBC ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PROHIBIT ANY SALE, DISPOSITION OR OTHER TRANSFER UNTIL

APRIL 28, 2009. FROM APRIL 28, 2009 TO

OCTOBER 20, 2009, THE FIRM MAY TRANSFER UP TO 50% OF THE

AGGREGATE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC THAT THE FIRM OWNED AS OF

OCTOBER 20, 2006. THE FIRM MAY TRANSFER THE REMAINING

SHARES AFTER OCTOBER 20, 2009. A PORTION OF THE FIRMS

INTEREST IS HELD BY INVESTMENT FUNDS MANAGED BY THE FIRM.

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS.

IN GENERAL, TRANSFERS OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES UNDER

SFAS NO. 140 WHEN THE FIRM HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL

OVER THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. FOR TRANSFERS ACCOUNTED FOR AS

SALES, ANY RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET

REVENUES. TRANSFERS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, WITH THE RELATED

INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES OVER THE LIVES OF

THE TRANSACTIONS.

FIN NO. 41, OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO

CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OR

FIN NO. 39, OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL,

MAKES DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO

REPURCHASE, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ON A DAILY BASIS AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL AS APPROPRIATE.



SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND

LOANED ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL

ADVANCED OR RECEIVED. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY

COLLATERALIZED BY CASH, SECURITIES OR LETTERS OF CREDIT. THE

FIRM RECEIVES SECURITIES BORROWED, MAKES DELIVERY OF SECURITIES

LOANED, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES BORROWED AND

LOANED, AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AS

APPROPRIATE.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS MAY ARISE FROM TRADING, INVESTING AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC,

INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL FACTORS. THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE CREDIT

RISK BY ACTIVELY MONITORING EXPOSURES AND OBTAINING COLLATERAL

AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. WHILE THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES EXPOSE

IT TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, THE FIRM

ROUTINELY EXECUTES A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH

COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT FUNDS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT

CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY. IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER.

AS OF BOTH NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005, THE FIRM HELD

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS THAT

REPRESENTED 6% AND 7% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, MOST OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL AGENCY AND OTHER

SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005,

THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY

THAT EXCEEDED 5% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS.

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES MAY INVOLVE FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR COMMODITIES, OR TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY OR

INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE

SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED

RATES, SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES,

INTEREST-ONLY AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY OBLIGATIONS, AND INDEXED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES EVEN THOUGH THEIR

VALUES OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED CASH FLOWS ARE DERIVED FROM THE

PRICE OF SOME OTHER SECURITY OR INDEX. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

COMMODITY-RELATED CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURE, AS THESE CONTRACTS MAY BE SETTLED IN

CASH OR THE ASSETS TO BE DELIVERED UNDER THE CONTRACT ARE

READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS AND AS A

MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. RISK EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED THROUGH

DIVERSIFICATION, BY CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND BY ENTERING

INTO OFFSETTING POSITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAY MANAGE THE

RISK RELATED TO A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCK BY ENTERING INTO AN

OFFSETTING POSITION IN A RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM APPLIES CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO A

LIMITED NUMBER OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE

CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS IN ITS

CONSOLIDATED POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. SEE NOTE 2 FOR

INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS POLICY ON FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM APPLIES A LONG-HAUL METHOD TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS

HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS TO PERFORM AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS IN ACHIEVING

OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR OFFSETTING CASH FLOWS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE FIRM UTILIZES A

DOLLAR-OFFSET METHOD, WHICH COMPARES THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE HEDGED ITEM, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME,

TO PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS.

THE FIRMS PROSPECTIVE DOLLAR-OFFSET ASSESSMENT UTILIZES

SCENARIO ANALYSES TO TEST HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS VIA SIMULATIONS OF

NUMEROUS PARALLEL AND SLOPE SHIFTS OF THE RELEVANT YIELD CURVE.

PARALLEL SHIFTS CHANGE THE INTEREST RATE OF ALL MATURITIES BY

IDENTICAL AMOUNTS. SLOPE SHIFTS CHANGE THE CURVATURE OF THE

YIELD CURVE. FOR BOTH THE PROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, IN RESPONSE TO

EACH OF THE SIMULATED YIELD CURVE SHIFTS, AND THE RETROSPECTIVE

ASSESSMENT, A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS DEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IF

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM

CHANGE INVERSELY WITHIN A RANGE OF 80% TO 125%.

FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED

IS REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AND IS

SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER ITS REMAINING

LIFE. FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF GAINS OR

LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED

TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS FOR ALL HEDGES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED

IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THESE GAINS OR LOSSES AND THE

COMPONENT OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS EXCLUDED

FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS (E.G., THE EFFECT OF

THE PASSAGE OF TIME ON FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE FIRMS

BORROWINGS) WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 2006, NOVEMBER 2005 AND

NOVEMBER 2004. GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES USED FOR

TRADING PURPOSES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME

EQUITY AND AUTO LOANS, GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE BONDS AND OTHER

TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE FIRM ACTS AS UNDERWRITER OF THE

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INVESTORS. THE FIRM

DERECOGNIZES FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED IN SECURITIZATIONS

PROVIDED IT HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER SUCH ASSETS.

TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE PRIOR TO

SECURITIZATION. NET REVENUES RELATED TO THESE UNDERWRITING

ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF THE

UNDERLYING BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO INVESTORS.

THE FIRM MAY RETAIN INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS,

PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED SECURITIES,

INCLUDING RESIDUAL INTERESTS. RETAINED INTERESTS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005, THE FIRM

SECURITIZED $103.92 BILLION AND $92.00 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING $67.73 BILLION

AND $65.18 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

LOANS AND SECURITIES. CASH FLOWS RECEIVED ON RETAINED INTERESTS

WERE APPROXIMATELY $801 MILLION AND $908 MILLION FOR

BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, ALL RETAINED INTERESTS

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS. PREVIOUSLY, THE

ANALYSIS ONLY INCLUDED RETAINED INTERESTS NOT VALUED USING

QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. ALSO, THE FIRM CHANGED

ITS METHODOLOGY FOR QUANTIFYING THE SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN

ASSUMPTIONS TO CONSIDER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON A

BOND-BY-BOND

BASIS

RATHER THAN AT THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND FOR APPLYING

ANTICIPATED CREDIT LOSSES. THE PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN

ADJUSTED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

(2)

ANTICIPATED CREDIT LOSSES ARE COMPUTED ONLY ON POSITIONS IN

WHICH EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS IS A KEY ASSUMPTION IN THE

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES.

(3)

THE IMPACTS OF ADVERSE CHANGE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CREDIT MITIGANTS

INCORPORATED IN THE RETAINED INTERESTS, INCLUDING

OVER-COLLATERALIZATION

AND SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS.

(4)

INCLUDES RETAINED INTERESTS IN BONDS AND OTHER TYPES OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK.

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO THE OFFSETTING

BENEFIT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE HELD TO MITIGATE

RISKS INHERENT IN THESE RETAINED INTERESTS. CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE BASED ON AN ADVERSE VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY

CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN

ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS NOT USUALLY LINEAR.

IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION

IS CALCULATED INDEPENDENTLY OF CHANGES IN ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION.

IN PRACTICE, SIMULTANEOUS CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT MAGNIFY

OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES DISCLOSED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO THE RETAINED INTERESTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM

ALSO HELD INTERESTS IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE QSPES PURCHASED IN

CONNECTION WITH SECONDARY

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES. THESE PURCHASED INTERESTS APPROXIMATED

$8 BILLION AND $5 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2006 AND

NOVEMBER 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

VIES TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH

PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED

NOTES,

CREDIT-LINKED

NOTES AND ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES DESIGNED TO MEET THEIR

OBJECTIVES.

VIES GENERALLY PURCHASE ASSETS BY ISSUING DEBT AND EQUITY

THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS INCLUDED IN THE TABLES SET FORTH

BELOW IS THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF SUCH GUARANTEES. SUCH AMOUNTS DO

NOT REPRESENT ANTICIPATED LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

GUARANTEES.

THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES INCLUDE SENIOR AND

WITH THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED

ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH

PROCEEDINGS, IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY BE

MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH

PERIOD. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME

OF THE FIRMS LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR FINES ARE SOUGHT, THE FIRM CANNOT

ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS

WHERE THERE IS ONLY A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE

INCURRED.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE FIRM IS

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE TO PROVIDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS

TO CERTAIN CONTRACT HOLDERS. THE TOTAL ACCOUNT BALANCES OF

CONTRACT HOLDERS TO WHOM THE FIRM HAS PROVIDED SUCH GUARANTEED

MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS WAS $8.04 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

GENERALLY, THE FIRM DETERMINED THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS BY REFERENCING INDICES FOR LONG-TERM,

HIGH-QUALITY BONDS AND ENSURING THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE DOES NOT

EXCEED THE YIELD REPORTED FOR THOSE INDICES AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR

THE DURATION OF THE PLANS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH IN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL FINANCIAL MARKET

RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE EXISTED OVER TIME WITH THE PRESUMPTION

THAT THIS TREND WILL GENERALLY REMAIN CONSTANT IN THE FUTURE.

FOR MEASUREMENT PURPOSES, AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN THE PER

CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS OF 10.74% WAS ASSUMED

FOR THE YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2007. THE RATE WAS ASSUMED TO

DECREASE RATABLY TO 5.00% FOR THE YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2015

AND REMAIN AT THAT LEVEL THEREAFTER.

THE ASSUMED COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS AN EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS

REPORTED FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. A 1% CHANGE

IN THE ASSUMED HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE WOULD HAVE THE

FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS INVOLVES EMPLOYING A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF

FLEXIBILITY TO CAPTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY OCCUR,

WHILE MAINTAINING REASONABLE PARAMETERS TO ENSURE THAT PRUDENCE

PROGRAMS. THE PLANS EMPLOY A TOTAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT

APPROACH, WHEREBY A MIX, WHICH IS BROADLY SIMILAR TO THE ACTUAL

ASSET ALLOCATION AS OF NOVEMBER 2006, OF EQUITY SECURITIES, DEBT

SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS, IS TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE THE

LONG-TERM RETURN ON ASSETS FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF RISK. INVESTMENT

RISK IS MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY THE

FIRMS RETIREMENT COMMITTEE THROUGH PERIODIC PORTFOLIO

REVIEWS, MEETINGS WITH INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ANNUAL LIABILITY

MEASUREMENTS.

THE FIRM WILL CONTRIBUTE A MINIMUM OF $30 MILLION TO ITS

PENSION PLANS AND $9 MILLION TO ITS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IN

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

THE FIRM SPONSORS A STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, THE GOLDMAN SACHS

WHICH PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS,

NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, DIVIDEND

EQUIVALENT RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND

OTHER

SHARE-BASED

AWARDS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE AMENDED SIP WAS

APPROVED BY THE FIRMS SHAREHOLDERS, EFFECTIVE FOR GRANTS

AFTER APRIL 1, 2003, AND NO FURTHER AWARDS WERE OR

WILL BE MADE UNDER THE ORIGINAL PLAN AFTER THAT DATE, ALTHOUGH

AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE ORIGINAL PLAN PRIOR TO THAT DATE REMAIN

OUTSTANDING.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED

UNDER THE AMENDED SIP THROUGH 2008 MAY NOT EXCEED

250 MILLION SHARES AND, IN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER, MAY NOT

EXCEED 5% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK,

DETERMINED AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING YEAR,

INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS IN

PREVIOUS YEARS BUT NOT COVERED BY AWARDS GRANTED IN SUCH YEARS.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005,

180.0 MILLION AND 196.6 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY,

WERE AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE AMENDED SIP, AFTER TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT

STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT WERE ISSUED SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END, AS

PART OF

YEAR-END

COMPENSATION.

OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM ADOPTED NEW DEFERRED COMPENSATION

PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. IN GENERAL, UNDER THE PLANS,

PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO DEFER PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THEIR

CASH

YEAR-END

COMPENSATION. DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE

TO NOMINALLY INVEST THEIR DEFERRALS IN CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES

AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLANS. GENERALLY, UNDER CURRENT TAX LAW,

PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX ON AMOUNTS DEFERRED

OR ON ANY NOTIONAL INVESTMENT EARNINGS UNTIL THE RETURNS ARE

DISTRIBUTED, AND THE FIRM IS NOT ENTITLED TO A CORRESPONDING TAX

DEDUCTION UNTIL THE AMOUNTS ARE DISTRIBUTED. THE FIRM HAS

RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE AMOUNTS DEFERRED UNDER

THESE PLANS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005,

$245 MILLION AND $134 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED

THE SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE AND

WILL NOT BE TRANSFERABLE BEFORE THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE

GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE TOTAL

REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, SUCH AS JAPAN, THE UNITED KINGDOM, KOREA AND

U.S. STATES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS

OPERATIONS, SUCH AS NEW YORK. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

IN REPORTING TO MANAGEMENT, THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS

ARE CATEGORIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE SEGMENTS: INVESTMENT

BANKING, TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, AND ASSET MANAGEMENT

AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS LINES

HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS.

(I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE,

(II) THEIR METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF

CLIENTS THEY SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS A WHOLE 

COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY  ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES WITHIN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AS WELL AS THE

PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS. CONSEQUENTLY, PRE-TAX

MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES REVENUES AND EXPENSES AMONG THE THREE

SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS,

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ALLOCATING CERTAIN

REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS ARE

BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE THIRD-PARTY RATES.

TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT HAVE NOT

BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE ALLOCATION

PROCESS IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE

BUSINESS OF THE FIRM.

THE SEGMENT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW IS PREPARED

ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES.



REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE

INCLUDED IN DETERMINING PRE-TAX EARNINGS.



NET REVENUES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS OF

INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE TO SPECIFIC SECURITIES,

COMMODITIES AND OTHER POSITIONS IN RELATION TO THE CASH

GENERATED BY, OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF, SUCH UNDERLYING

POSITIONS. NET INTEREST IS INCLUDED WITHIN SEGMENT NET REVENUES

AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH MANAGEMENT ASSESSES

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE.



OVERHEAD EXPENSES NOT DIRECTLY ALLOCABLE TO SPECIFIC SEGMENTS

ARE ALLOCATED RATABLY BASED ON DIRECT SEGMENT EXPENSES.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

DUE TO THE HIGHLY INTEGRATED NATURE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL

MARKETS, THE FIRM MANAGES ITS BUSINESSES BASED ON THE

PROFITABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE. ACCORDINGLY,

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PROFITABILITY BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION IS

NOT NECESSARILY MEANINGFUL. IN ADDITION, AS A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES REQUIRE CROSS-BORDER

COORDINATION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE NEEDS OF THE FIRMS

CLIENTS, THE METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING THE FIRMS

PROFITABILITY TO GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IS DEPENDENT ON THE JUDGMENT

OF MANAGEMENT. DURING 2006, THE FIRM AMENDED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR

ALLOCATING PROFITABILITY BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. PRIOR PERIODS

HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS.



INVESTMENT BANKING: LOCATION OF THE CLIENT AND INVESTMENT

BANKING TEAM.



FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES, AND EQUITIES: LOCATION

OF THE TRADING DESK.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS: LOCATION OF THE INVESTMENT.



UNDERLYING SECURITY.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (THE PARENT COMPANY), A DELAWARE

CORPORATION, SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND

SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM) AND NOTES THERETO (THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM

10-K.

THESE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS FOR

THE PARENT COMPANY ONLY. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PRESCRIBED

BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18,

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON

STOCK.

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN, ALL REFERENCES TO

NOVEMBER 2006, NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004

REFER TO THE PARENT COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS ENDED, OR THE

DATES, AS THE CONTEXT REQUIRES, NOVEMBER 24, 2006,

NOVEMBER 25, 2005 AND NOVEMBER 26, 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

THE PARENT COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE

IDENTICAL TO THOSE USED BY THE FIRM, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE TO

THE PARENT COMPANYS ACTIVITIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

REGARDING THE FIRMS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, REFER

TO NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM

USE OF ESTIMATES

THESE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING

FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE

PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION

AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND

OTHER ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

THESE ESTIMATES.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED

BY THE PARENT COMPANY. THE PARENT COMPANY THEN LENDS THE

NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE

REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET FINANCING AND CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES ITS

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. SUCH FUNDING IS INCLUDED IN LOANS

TO SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBORDINATED LOANS TO

SUBSIDIARIES IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. INTERCOMPANY EXPOSURE IS MANAGED BY

REQUIRING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE

MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE

AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES

THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY

WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS

THIRD-PARTY

BORROWINGS.

IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE SUBSIDIARIES PLEDGE COLLATERAL AT LOAN

VALUE TO COVER THEIR INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN

SUBORDINATED DEBT) IN ORDER TO MITIGATE PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY

RISK. EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED
