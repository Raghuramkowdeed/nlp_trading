TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVES ON SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE

ENGAGE IN FLOOR-BASED AND ELECTRONIC MARKET MAKING AS A

SPECIALIST ON U.S. EQUITIES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES AND WE CLEAR

CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES

EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MERCHANT BANKING AND

OTHER INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WE MAKE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE RAISE AND MANAGE.

IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS,

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A WIDE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE OUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO

TAKE RISK DISTINGUISHES US FROM MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT IS

DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPONENTS.



FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND

COMMODITIES.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN

AND TRADE INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES AND LOANS, CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES, STRUCTURE AND

ENTER INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND ENGAGE

IN PROPRIETARY TRADING;



EQUITIES.

WE

MAKE MARKETS IN, ACT AS A SPECIALIST FOR, AND TRADE EQUITIES AND

EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS, STRUCTURE AND ENTER INTO EQUITY

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY TRADING. WE

ALSO EXECUTE AND CLEAR CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK,

OPTIONS AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE; AND



PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

PRIMARILY REPRESENTS NET REVENUES FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING

INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND

GAINS DERIVED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WHEN THE RETURN ON

A FUNDS INVESTMENTS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS

(MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES), AS WELL AS UNREALIZED GAINS OR

LOSSES ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG).

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES AND

EQUITIES

FICC AND EQUITIES ARE LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED

OPERATIONS THROUGH WHICH WE ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN AND PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES.

IN THEIR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESSES, FICC AND

EQUITIES STRIVE TO DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY SERVICE BY OFFERING

BROAD MARKET-MAKING AND MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON A

GLOBAL BASIS. IN ADDITION, WE USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TAKE

POSITIONS IN MARKETS, OFTEN BY COMMITTING CAPITAL AND TAKING

RISK, TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY.

OUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MARKETS IN A BROAD RANGE OF FIXED

INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRODUCTS AND THEIR

DERIVATIVES IS CRUCIAL BOTH TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND TO

SUPPORT OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET

LIQUIDITY.

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM OUR

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESSES IN THREE WAYS.



FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS, WE

UNDERTAKE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND

FEES.



SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG MARKET

RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL POSITION, WE UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN

LESS LIQUID MARKETS WHERE SPREADS AND FEES ARE GENERALLY LARGER.



FINALLY, WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM

STRUCTURING AND EXECUTING TRANSACTIONS THAT ADDRESS COMPLEX

CLIENT NEEDS.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES IN BOTH FICC AND

EQUITIES, WE ASSUME A VARIETY OF RISKS AND DEVOTE RESOURCES TO

IDENTIFY, ANALYZE AND BENEFIT FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE LEVERAGE

OUR STRONG PROPRIETARY RESEARCH CAPABILITIES AND CAPITALIZE ON

OUR ANALYTICAL MODELS TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE INFORMED

TRADING JUDGMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS PART OF OUR FICC CREDIT AND

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS BUSINESSES, WE HAVE EXPANDED AND EXPECT TO

CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE MAKE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIOS AND SINGLE ISSUES OF DISTRESSED DEBT

AS WELL AS OTHER

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SPECIAL SITUATION INVESTMENTS. IN OUR PROPRIETARY

ACTIVITIES, WE SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED DISPARITIES IN THE

VALUE OF ASSETS IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND FROM MACROECONOMIC

AND COMPANY-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

ALTHOUGH FICC AND EQUITIES INVOLVE DISTINCT

PRODUCT AREAS, WE HAVE RECENTLY INCREASED COORDINATION AMONG

THEIR BUSINESSES. AMONG THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN ARE TO

INTEGRATE, TO AN INCREASING EXTENT, MANAGEMENT OF FICC AND

EQUITIES AND TO INTEGRATE THE FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL OF SOME

OF OUR FICC AND EQUITIES BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE AND

ASIA. WE HAVE ALSO MERGED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS FOR FICC AND EQUITIES. WE EXPECT TO

CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION OF THESE

BUSINESSES IN THE FUTURE, AS WE RESPOND TO WHAT WE BELIEVE IS

CLIENT DEMAND FOR MORE CENTRALIZED SERVICES AND AS WE ATTEMPT TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PERCEIVED SYNERGIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADING AND MARKET-MAKING

CAPABILITIES ARE KEY INGREDIENTS TO OUR SUCCESS. WHILE THESE

BUSINESSES HAVE GENERALLY EARNED ATTRACTIVE RETURNS, WE HAVE IN

THE PAST INCURRED SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF

MARKET TURBULENCE, SUCH AS IN 1994 AND THE SECOND HALF OF 1998,

AND FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH LARGE BLOCK TRADES.

IN BOTH OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN AND PROPRIETARY

ACTIVITIES IN FICC AND EQUITIES, WE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL RISKS ON A GLOBAL BASIS ACROSS ALL

OUR PRODUCTS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO

BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING POSITIONS WITH OUR

EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, WE

ANALYZE NOT ONLY MARKET RISK BUT ALSO CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL

RISKS. RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDES INPUT FROM ALL LEVELS OF GOLDMAN

SACHS, FROM THE TRADING DESKS TO THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS SPONSORED

PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS IN THE CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE

MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESS WITH $39.05 BILLION OF COMMITTED

CAPITAL AS OF NOVEMBER 2003, OF WHICH $27.23 BILLION HAS

BEEN FUNDED. WE HAVE PROVIDED A PORTION OF THOSE AMOUNTS. SEE

 TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS 

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ABOVE. OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING

PENSION PLANS, ENDOWMENTS, CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS, HAVE PROVIDED THE REMAINDER.

OUR STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO OUR MERCHANT BANKING

FUNDS GENERALLY IS TO INVEST OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO BUILD A

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS THAT IS DIVERSIFIED BY INDUSTRY,

PRODUCT TYPE, GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND

TYPE. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUE, ON A GLOBAL BASIS,

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES IN PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, LEVERAGED BUYOUTS AND ACQUISITIONS. AS

OF NOVEMBER 2003, OUR CORPORATE MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS HAD TOTAL

COMMITTED CAPITAL OF $26.96 BILLION. OTHER FUNDS, WITH

TOTAL COMMITTED CAPITAL OF $12.09 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER

2003, INVEST IN REAL ESTATE OPERATING COMPANIES, DEBT AND EQUITY

INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, AND OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED

INVESTMENTS.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE THREE

REVENUE STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS

GENERALLY A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL,

INVESTED CAPITAL, TOTAL GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE.

THESE ANNUAL MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET

MANAGEMENT REVENUES. SECOND, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTOR IN THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

THE FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING

FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON

REALIZATION. THIRD, AFTER THE FUND HAS ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN

FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE RECEIVE AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE

FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS THAT IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME

AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS. THE SECOND AND THIRD

OF THESE REVENUE STREAMS ARE INCLUDED IN NET REVENUES OF THE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS SEGMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY

GOLDMAN SACHS IS COMMITTED TO THE ONGOING

DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT THE

ORGANIZATION. OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES CAN BE BROADLY

CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR EFFORTS.



ENHANCING CLIENT SERVICE THROUGH INCREASED

CONNECTIVITY AND THE PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED, TAILORED PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES;



IMPROVING OUR TRADING, EXECUTION AND CLEARING

CAPABILITIES;



RISK MANAGEMENT; AND



OVERALL EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY AND CONTROL.

WE HAVE TAILORED OUR SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS BY

PROVIDING THEM WITH ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR GLOBAL ELECTRONIC

TRADING AND INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES TO OUR CLIENTS

VIA THE INTERNET AND OTHER FORMS OF ELECTRONIC CONNECTIVITY.

THESE CAPABILITIES COVER MANY OF OUR FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY, EQUITY AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE

HAVE ALSO USED THE INTERNET TO IMPROVE THE EASE AND QUALITY OF

COMMUNICATION WITH OUR INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS.

INTERNET TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE HAVE

CHANGED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE WAYS THAT SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE TRADED, DISTRIBUTED AND SETTLED.

THIS CREATES BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR OUR

BUSINESSES. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE HAVE DEVELOPED SOFTWARE THAT ENABLES US TO

MONITOR AND ANALYZE OUR MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS. THIS RISK

MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE NOT ONLY ANALYZES MARKET RISK ON FIRMWIDE,

DIVISIONAL AND TRADING DESK LEVELS, BUT ALSO BREAKS DOWN OUR

RISK INTO ITS UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, PERMITTING MANAGEMENT TO

EVALUATE EXPOSURES ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC INTEREST RATE,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE, EQUITY PRICE OR COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES.

TO ASSIST FURTHER IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES,

DATA FROM MANY SOURCES ARE AGGREGATED DAILY INTO CREDIT

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT GIVE SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND PROFESSIONALS

IN THE CREDIT AND CONTROLLERS DEPARTMENTS THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE

TIMELY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT EXPOSURES WORLDWIDE,

INCLUDING NETTING INFORMATION, AND THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE

COMPLEX RISK SITUATIONS EFFECTIVELY. OUR SOFTWARE ACCESSES THIS

DATA, ALLOWS FOR QUICK ANALYSIS AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL

TRADES, AND INTERACTS WITH OTHER GOLDMAN SACHS SYSTEMS.

TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN

IMPROVING THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF MANY AREAS OF GOLDMAN SACHS.

BY AUTOMATING MANY TRADING PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONAL AND

ACCOUNTING PROCESSES, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED OUR

EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ONE OF THE STRENGTHS AND

PRINCIPAL REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE

QUALITY AND DEDICATION OF ITS PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF

BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT

THAT FOSTERS PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY AND

COOPERATION AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL

EMPLOYEES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN

IMPORTANT PART. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR

AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT

PART OF INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE

REVIEW PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS,

CO-WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW

PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2003, WE HAD

19,476 EMPLOYEES, WHICH EXCLUDES EMPLOYEES OF GOLDMAN

SACHS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARIES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE COSTS OF THE PROPERTY

MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES ARE REIMBURSED TO GOLDMAN

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND

ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND

WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER BROKERS

AND DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES,

INVESTMENT ADVISORS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMERCIAL BANKS

AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS

GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT OR NICHE BASIS.

OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION,

REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING

AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON OUR

ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR

EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, DUE IN PART TO U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION

THAT HAS EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS

AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK. IN PARTICULAR, A NUMBER OF

LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER

BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE ESTABLISHED OR

ACQUIRED BROKER-DEALERS OR HAVE MERGED WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER A

WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND INSURANCE

TO BROKERAGE, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING SERVICES,

WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY ALSO HAVE THE

ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES PRODUCTS

WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH COULD RESULT

IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE

TO FACE, PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL

TO BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT

MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR,

CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE SUCH COMMITMENTS

FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT

BANKING ASSIGNMENTS. IN 2003, WE ESTABLISHED THE WILLIAM STREET

ENTITIES, THROUGH WHICH WE HAVE ISSUED COMMITMENTS TO LEND TO

COUNTERPARTIES, PRIMARILY INVESTMENT GRADE CLIENTS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

COMMITMENTS HAS BEEN HEDGED THROUGH CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION

PROVIDED TO GOLDMAN SACHS BY SMFG. THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT BE

SUFFICIENT, HOWEVER, TO FULLY SATISFY OUR CLIENTS DESIRE

FOR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION

IS LIMITED GENERALLY TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS GOLDMAN SACHS

REALIZES ON APPROVED INVESTMENT-GRADE LOAN COMMITMENTS, SUBJECT

TO A MAXIMUM OF $1 BILLION, AND 70% OF THE SECOND LOSS ON

SUCH COMMITMENTS, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.125 BILLION.

SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND

NOTE 6 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE

INFORMATION REGARDING THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES, AND OUR

CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K, DATED JANUARY 15, 2003,

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION PROVIDED BY SMFG.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC

REACH OF SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED

THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO

COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER

AND BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL

PRESENCE AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN

SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN

CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE IN THE PRICING OF LARGE BLOCK TRADES,

INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE THE BIDDING DEALERS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

ABLE TO PRE-MARKET THE SECURITIES. ALSO, EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS TRADING SPREADS, HAVE BEEN

UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE

TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH OTHER

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE

PRESSURE ON TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND

TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE. WE OWN

INTERESTS IN AND PARTICIPATE IN A NUMBER OF THESE TRADING

SYSTEMS. MOREOVER, THE INTRODUCTION OF DECIMALIZATION HAS LED TO

A REDUCTION IN THE REVENUES OF OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESS AND TO

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A FEE-BASED PRICING STRUCTURE IN OUR

NASDAQ TRADING BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING

PRICES.

THE TRADING OF FUTURES ON SINGLE STOCKS COMMENCED

IN NOVEMBER 2002. IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THE

INTRODUCTION OF SINGLE STOCK FUTURES CONTRACTS WILL HAVE A

LONG-TERM ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE BUSINESSES OF GOLDMAN SACHS.

WHILE COMMISSIONS AND CLEARING FEES MAY INCREASE, OTHER ASPECTS

OF OUR BUSINESS, IN PARTICULAR, OUR OTC DERIVATIVE BUSINESS, MAY

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AS A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND MEMBER OF

VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, GOLDMAN, SACHS &

CO. IS SUBJECT TO THE SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE,

RULE 15C3-1. THIS RULE SPECIFIES THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF NET

SIGNIFICANT PART OF ITS ASSETS BE KEPT IN RELATIVELY LIQUID

FORM. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE NET

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE CFTC AND VARIOUS SECURITIES AND

COMMODITY EXCHANGES. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

THE SEC AND VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS

IMPOSE RULES THAT REQUIRE NOTIFICATION WHEN NET CAPITAL FALLS

BELOW CERTAIN PREDEFINED CRITERIA, LIMIT THE RATIO OF

SUBORDINATED DEBT TO EQUITY IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL

COMPOSITION OF A BROKER-DEALER AND CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF A

BROKER-DEALER TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES. ADDITIONALLY, THE SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL

RULE IMPOSES CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF

PROHIBITING A BROKER-DEALER FROM DISTRIBUTING OR WITHDRAWING

CAPITAL AND REQUIRING PRIOR NOTICE TO THE SEC FOR CERTAIN

WITHDRAWALS OF CAPITAL.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001, ENACTED IN RESPONSE

TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, CONTAINS

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND

MANDATES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS NEW REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR VERIFYING CLIENT

THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS, THE USA PATRIOT ACT SEEKS TO PROMOTE

COOPERATION AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REGULATORS AND LAW

ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES IN IDENTIFYING PARTIES THAT MAY BE INVOLVED

IN TERRORISM OR MONEY LAUNDERING. ANTI-MONEY-LAUNDERING LAWS

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES CONTAIN SOME SIMILAR PROVISIONS.

THE INCREASED OBLIGATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

GOLDMAN SACHS, TO IDENTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS, WATCH FOR AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND SHARE

INFORMATION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REQUIRES THE

ADEQUACY STANDARDS, CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT

OF BUSINESS RULES. THESE STANDARDS, REQUIREMENTS AND RULES ARE

SIMILARLY IMPLEMENTED, UNDER THE SAME DIRECTIVES, THROUGHOUT THE

EUROPEAN UNION AND ARE BROADLY COMPARABLE IN SCOPE AND PURPOSE

TO THE REGULATORY CAPITAL AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS

IMPOSED UNDER THE SEC AND CFTC RULES. EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES

ALSO PERMIT LOCAL REGULATION IN EACH JURISDICTION, INCLUDING

THOSE IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTED IN UNREGULATED ENTITIES

TO BECOME SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FORMS OF REGULATION, INCLUDING

CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS.

THE SEC PROPOSED NEW RULES IN OCTOBER 2003 THAT

WOULD ESTABLISH VOLUNTARY REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE

SUPERVISION OF BROKER-DEALERS AND THEIR AFFILIATES ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND, TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

EUROPEAN FINANCIAL GROUPS DIRECTIVE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY

ELECT TO BECOME SUBJECT TO SUCH CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION BY THE

SEC. IF WE BECOME SUBJECT TO SUCH A FRAMEWORK, WE WILL BE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH STRINGENT RULES REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS,

OUR GROUP-WIDE INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEM,

RECORDKEEPING AND PERIODIC REPORTING, INCLUDING REPORTING OF

CONSOLIDATED COMPUTATIONS OF ALLOWABLE CAPITAL AND RISK

ALLOWANCES CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION, WHICH STANDARDS ARE CURRENTLY

BEING REVISED.

WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR REGULATORS TO

UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES. WE CANNOT FULLY PREDICT

THE PRACTICAL EFFECT THAT ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY THE EUROPEAN

UNION, THE SEC AND THE BASEL COMMITTEE WILL HAVE ON OUR

BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THESE RULES, TO THE EXTENT THEY ULTIMATELY

APPLY TO OUR BUSINESSES, MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS, AFFECT OUR

DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RAISING AND USING CAPITAL AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE IN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS

STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE EMPOWERED

TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN

CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS, OR THE

SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR ITS DIRECTORS,

OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. OCCASIONALLY, OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN

SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE

BEEN IMPOSED FOR INFRACTIONS OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO

OUR ACTIVITIES, NONE OF WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON US OR OUR BUSINESSES.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPLIANCE WITH THE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF

U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS COULD LIMIT THOSE OPERATIONS

OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT REQUIRE THE INTENSIVE USE OF CAPITAL,

SUCH AS UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES, SPECIALIST

ACTIVITIES AND THE FINANCING OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNT BALANCES, AND

ALSO COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW CAPITAL FROM OUR

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH IN TURN COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

REPAY DEBT OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK.

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY A NUMBER OF SECURITIES EXCHANGES. THE

RULES OF THESE EXCHANGES GENERALLY REQUIRE OUR SPECIALISTS TO

MAINTAIN ORDERLY MARKETS IN THE SECURITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE

SPECIALISTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS, IN TURN, MAY REQUIRE US TO

COMMIT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO OUR SPECIALIST

BUSINESSES. RECENTLY, CERTAIN NYSE SPECIALIST FIRMS, INCLUDING

OUR SPECIALIST UNIT, AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT

WITH THE SEC AND THE NYSE TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THEIR

ACTIVITIES AS NYSE SPECIALISTS DURING THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH

2003. WE DISCUSS THIS GLOBAL SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE AND THE

RELATED INVESTIGATIONS UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

SPECIALIST MATTERS IN ITEM 3 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K AND UNDER  CERTAIN FACTORS THAT

MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS  LEGAL AND REGULATORY.

IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING

STOCK MARKETS AND THE CONDUCT OF SPECIALISTS ON THOSE MARKETS,

INCLUDING THE NYSE, MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US, ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES OR IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATING TO THOSE

BUSINESSES.

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE BEEN

AND REMAIN THE SUBJECT OF INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY. IN 2002

AND 2003, ACTING IN PART PURSUANT TO A MANDATE CONTAINED IN THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, THE SEC, THE NYSE AND THE NASD

ADOPTED RULES IMPOSING HEIGHTENED RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT

BANKING PERSONNEL AT MEMBER SECURITIES FIRMS. VARIOUS NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALSO CHANGED OR PROPOSED TO CHANGE THEIR

REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, IN 2003,

SEVERAL LEADING SECURITIES FIRMS OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH

CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO

THEIR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST PURSUANT TO WHICH THE FIRMS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS. AS PART OF THIS

SETTLEMENT, RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON THE INTERACTION

BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BANKING DEPARTMENTS AND THESE

SECURITIES FIRMS ARE REQUIRED TO FUND THE PROVISION OF

INDEPENDENT RESEARCH TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESEARCH SETTLEMENT, THE

FIRM HAS ALSO SUBSCRIBED TO A VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE IMPOSING

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ALLOCATION OF SHARES IN INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS TO EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE

FSA IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS RECENTLY IMPOSED NEW REQUIREMENTS

ON THE CONDUCT OF THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IN EQUITY AND FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES OFFERINGS (INCLUDING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS

AND SECONDARY DISTRIBUTIONS). WE CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE

PRACTICAL EFFECT THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR MEASURES WILL HAVE ON

OUR BUSINESS, AND THE SEC, NYSE AND NASD AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS

SUCH AS THE FSA MAY ADOPT ADDITIONAL AND MORE STRINGENT RULES

WITH RESPECT TO OFFERING PROCEDURES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE FUTURE.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS

MARKET

CONDITIONS

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE

AROUND THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH BUSINESS CONDITIONS IMPROVED SOMEWHAT

IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003, IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEEN

OPERATING IN A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT: THE NUMBER AND SIZE

OF EQUITY UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

TRANSACTIONS HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY; THE EQUITIES MARKETS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE HAVE BEEN VOLATILE AND ARE AT

LEVELS BELOW THEIR RECORD HIGHS; INVESTORS HAVE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXHIBITED CONCERNS OVER THE INTEGRITY OF THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS AS A RESULT OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED FINANCIAL

SCANDALS; AND THE ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT OF MANY CLIENTS HAS

BEEN DIVERTED FROM CAPITAL-RAISING TRANSACTIONS AND ACQUISITIONS

AND DISPOSITIONS IN PART AS A RESULT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

REGULATIONS, SUCH AS THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, AND RELATED

UNCERTAINTY IN CAPITAL MARKETS.

ADVERSE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE

FUTURE ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY

WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF

CAPITAL IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE

TRADING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS. MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF

THOSE POSITIONS, INCLUDING OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT

PRODUCTS, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS AND OUR

MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO

ENTER INTO SOME NEW TRANSACTIONS.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF

EQUITY UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY CONTINUE

TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE

TRANSACTIONS, A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS DUE

TO UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE

CONTINUED, EVEN AS THE VOLUME AND NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKING

TRANSACTIONS HAVE STARTED TO INCREASE. THESE PRESSURES HAVE BEEN

PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF LARGE BLOCK TRADES. IN

ADDITION, THE TREND (PARTICULARLY IN THE EQUITY UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS) TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND CO-MANAGERS HANDLING

TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE

BOOK RUNNER, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND REDUCE OUR

REVENUES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITIES MARKETS

ALSO TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS,

WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS.

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR

MARKET CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET

MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR

COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AND THEREFORE IN THE INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK IN THE PAST HAS INCREASED

THE LOSSES THAT WE HAVE INCURRED IN OUR MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN

THE FUTURE. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE

PRIMARILY CLIENT-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, BLOCK TRADES ARE

INCREASINGLY BEING EFFECTED WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GOLDMAN

SACHS TO PRE-MARKET THE TRANSACTION, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK

GOLDMAN SACHS MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE PURCHASED SECURITIES

AT FAVORABLE PRICES. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK,

WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW OR DECLINING

INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. INCREASING OR

HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY

IF SUCH CHANGES ARE RAPID, MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE

ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR

OUR CUSTOMERS AND AS A SPECIALIST MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD

REDUCE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE

RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING

SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES

AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. FURTHER WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL

EQUITIES

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS, THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE

MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AND THE ONGOING NYSE AND SEC

INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE STOCK SPECIALIST BUSINESS COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF

OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

RISK MANAGEMENT, LIQUIDITY AND

CREDIT

IF ANY OF THE VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS AND

STRATEGIES WE UTILIZE TO HEDGE OR OTHERWISE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE

TO VARIOUS TYPES OF RISK ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY INCUR LOSSES.

OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY

NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING OUR RISK EXPOSURE IN ALL

MARKET ENVIRONMENTS OR AGAINST ALL TYPES OF RISK.

LIQUIDITY (

I.E.

, READY ACCESS TO FUNDS) IS

ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY

AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, OR AN INABILITY

TO SELL ASSETS. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES

THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET

DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES

OR US. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF

OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT

THE SAME TIME.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR

LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR

TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN

SOME OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS.

UNDER SUCH PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO

TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN

LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER

SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR

SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A HOLDING

COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, IT DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS

AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING

DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO., ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION

OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING

DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, TO THE

EXTENT THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (OR ANY OTHER ENTITY)

HOLDS EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS REGULATED OR

UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, ITS RIGHTS AS AN EQUITY HOLDER TO THE

ASSETS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF

THE CLAIMS OF THE CREDITORS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES

THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM

THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE

CREDIT EXPOSURES. AS A CLEARING MEMBER FIRM, WE FINANCE OUR

CUSTOMER POSITIONS AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND

CREDIT AND PRICE MORE AGGRESSIVELY THE CREDIT RISKS WE TAKE. IN

PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT

COMMITMENTS FROM US IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND

OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES

TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN

ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD

LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY

OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN

SACHS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONS

AND INFRASTRUCTURE

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR

ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES, AND THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. IF ANY OF OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING OR

OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS DO NOT OPERATE PROPERLY OR ARE

DISABLED OR IF THERE ARE OTHER SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR

INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS, WE COULD SUFFER AN

IMPAIRMENT TO OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL LOSS, A DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THESE SYSTEMS MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY

OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING A DISRUPTION OF

ELECTRICAL OR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OR OUR INABILITY TO OCCUPY

ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUILDINGS. THE INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS TO

ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO

CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR

TERMINATION OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING

HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE

OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. ANY SUCH FAILURE OR TERMINATION

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS AND

MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK.

IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY PLANS WE

HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR

BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. THIS

MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS,

TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN SACHS OR THIRD

PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY

OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY THE

BUILDINGS OF GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT

OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT ON THE CITIES WHERE THOSE

BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR

PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING NEW YORK, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG

KONG AND TOKYO, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER, IN ONE OR

MORE BUILDINGS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR

EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OR

TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT

WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON

COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING,

STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE

PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES

WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE

VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER

MALICIOUS CODE, AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY

IMPACT. IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY

COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR

COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR

MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES

OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND

SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE

MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR

OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND

FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT

FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US.

LEGAL

AND REGULATORY

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT

REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM

TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR

BUSINESS PROSPECTS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR

BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES

CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES HAVE BEEN INCREASING.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME

OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR

CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS

OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO OUR CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

AS DISCUSSED UNDER REGULATION ABOVE,

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN THE

SUBJECT OF INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY WHICH HAS LED TO

INCREASED RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY

RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING PERSONNEL AT SECURITIES

FIRMS. VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALSO CHANGED OR

PROPOSED CHANGING THEIR REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH

MATTERS. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL LEADING SECURITIES FIRMS IN THE

UNITED STATES, INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., HAVE

REACHED A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE

SECURITIES REGULATORS AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS TO

RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS

ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST PURSUANT TO WHICH THE FIRMS HAVE

BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS. CERTAIN

OF THESE REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS MAY IMPOSE COSTS AND

LIMITATIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES. CURRENT OR FUTURE

CIVIL LAWSUITS IMPLICATING INVESTMENT RESEARCH ANALYSTS

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WERE NOT SETTLED AS PART OF THE GLOBAL

SETTLEMENT. GOLDMAN SACHS TOTAL POTENTIAL LIABILITY IN

RESPECT OF SUCH CIVIL CASES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED BUT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ALSO DID NOT RESOLVE POTENTIAL CHARGES

INVOLVING INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING SUPERVISORS, AND

REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONTINUING.

IN ADDITION, THE SEC AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF COMPLEX, STRUCTURED

FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

AGAINST A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH

SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IN SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, CLIENTS

OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY ENGAGED IN ACCOUNTING,

DISCLOSURE OR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS, AND THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY FACILITATED THESE IMPROPRIETIES

BY ENTERING INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH THE CLIENTS. WE SEEK TO

CREATE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS NEEDS,

AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO, AND CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO, STRUCTURED

TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE STRUCTURED

TRANSACTIONS WE ENTER INTO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN OF THESE TRANSACTIONS

COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND

LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS

WILL MAKE OUR CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO THESE

TRANSACTIONS, AND WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN THIS

AREA.

RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN INDUSTRY-WIDE AND OTHER

INVESTIGATIONS BY FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES CONCERNING

MARKET TIMING, LATE TRADING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INVOLVING

MUTUAL FUNDS. FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTEDLY MADE

INFORMATIONAL REQUESTS REGARDING TRADING PRACTICES BROADLY

ACROSS ALL OF THE MAJOR FUND COMPANIES AND BROKER-DEALERS.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND HAS BEEN

FULLY COOPERATING WITH THOSE AUTHORITIES. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT

WE HAVE IN PLACE REASONABLE MEASURES TO DETECT AND DETER

DISRUPTIVE AND ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES AND COMPLY WITH

APPLICABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE CANNOT PREDICT

THE COURSE THAT THE EXISTING INQUIRIES AND AREAS OF FOCUS MAY

TAKE OR THE IMPACT THAT ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING

MUTUAL FUNDS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.

THE NYSE AND THE SEC HAVE ALSO BEEN CONDUCTING

INVESTIGATIONS INTO CERTAIN TRADING PRACTICES OF NYSE SPECIALIST

FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST UNIT. IN FEBRUARY 2004, CERTAIN

OF THESE NYSE SPECIALIST FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST UNIT,

AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC AND THE

NYSE TO RESOLVE CHARGES THAT THE FIRMS VIOLATED CERTAIN FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS AND NYSE RULES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR

ACTIVITIES AS NYSE SPECIALISTS DURING THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH

2003. THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT, IF ULTIMATELY CONSUMMATED, WOULD

INVOLVE, AMONG OTHERS, RESTITUTION AND PENALTIES, A CENSURE,

CEASE AND DESIST ORDER AND AN UNDETERMINED FORM OF UNDERTAKING.

THE SETTLEMENT WOULD NOT RESOLVE THE RELATED CIVIL ACTIONS

DISCUSSED UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  SPECIALIST

MATTERS IN ITEM 3 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K, OR POTENTIAL REGULATORY CHARGES AGAINST

INDIVIDUALS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT THE FINAL GLOBAL

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SETTLEMENT, INCLUDING ANY RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY

BE IMPOSED ON THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR SPECIALIST UNIT, OR NEW LAWS

OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING SPECIALISTS MAY HAVE ON OUR SPECIALIST

BUSINESSES. DEPENDING ON THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS AND OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND ANY RELATED

DEVELOPMENTS, OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED AND THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPAIRED.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED

CASES INVOLVING FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK

THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE

TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE

TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN

ALL CASES.

REGULATORY

IMPACT ON CAPITAL MARKETS

FINANCIAL SCANDALS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE LED TO

INSECURITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

CONTRIBUTED TO DECLINES IN CAPITAL MARKETS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE

SCANDALS, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE RULES OF THE

SEC, THE NYSE AND NASDAQ NECESSITATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. THESE PROVISIONS

GENERALLY APPLY TO COMPANIES WITH SECURITIES LISTED ON U.S.

SECURITIES EXCHANGES, AND SOME PROVISIONS APPLY TO NON-U.S.

ISSUERS WITH SECURITIES TRADED ON U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGES. TO

THE EXTENT THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO AVOID BECOMING

SUBJECT TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS, DECIDE TO FORGO INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS, OUR EQUITY UNDERWRITING BUSINESS MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXIT SOME OF

OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

SIMILARLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE IMPOSITION OF THOSE

PROVISIONS ON NON-U.S. ISSUERS MAY MAKE THESE ISSUERS LESS

LIKELY TO LIST THEIR SECURITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OR

UNDERTAKE MERGER OR ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD RESULT

IN THEIR SECURITIES BEING LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IF THESE

MEASURES RESULT IN LESS ACTIVITY BY NON-U.S. ISSUERS IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE PROVISIONS OF SARBANES-OXLEY AND THE NYSE AND

NASDAQ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RULES, COUPLED WITH EXISTING

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, HAVE DIVERTED MANY COMPANIES

ATTENTION AWAY FROM CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

SECURITIES OFFERINGS AND ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION

TRANSACTIONS. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW LONG THIS UNCERTAINTY AND

DIVERSION WILL LAST, BUT SO LONG AS IT DOES, IT WILL HAVE A

NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION,

ADOPTED OR PROPOSED ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES, INCLUDING

THOSE RELATING TO OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ENTITIES, MAY HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND OTHER REVENUES

RELATING TO STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS.

COMPETITION

AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND

ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND

WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE

MAY EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. IN

RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE

ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK,

MAY ACCELERATE THIS CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASE

COMPETITION. THIS TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF

OUR COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION

OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT

ASSETS. AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR

CLIENT BASE, WE INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST. WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE

DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. HOWEVER,

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED IF

WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS

OF INTEREST.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS

STRATEGY. THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC TRADING, AND

THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESS

AND PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND

OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW BEING CONDUCTED THROUGH THE

INTERNET AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE, NON-TRADITIONAL TRADING SYSTEMS,

AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS

WILL CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE

TRADING SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES. A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC

TRADING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMMISSION AND TRADING

REVENUES, INCLUDING OUR MARKET-MAKING REVENUES, REDUCE OUR

PARTICIPATION IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND ASSOCIATED ACCESS TO

MARKET INFORMATION AND LEAD TO THE CREATION OF NEW AND STRONGER

COMPETITORS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS MAY ALSO REQUIRE US TO MAKE

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY OR TRADING SYSTEMS AND MAY

IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

RECRUITING

AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE

TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS. COMPETITION

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS

INTENSE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION WITH BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR THE MOST HIGHLY SKILLED

INDIVIDUALS HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE AS THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS

LOWERED AVERAGE COMPENSATION WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY SIGNIFICANTLY. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT

NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT MAY CAUSE US TO MOVE

EMPLOYEES FROM ONE BUSINESS TO ANOTHER OR TO REDUCE THE NUMBER

OF EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES; THIS MAY CAUSE TEMPORARY

DISRUPTIONS AS OUR EMPLOYEES ADAPT TO NEW ROLES AND MAY REDUCE

OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS (INCLUDING

LAWS RELATING TO IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING) MAY RESTRICT OUR

ABILITY TO MOVE RESPONSIBILITIES OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE

JURISDICTION TO ANOTHER. THIS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES.

ACQUISITIONS

WE EXPECT THE GROWTH OF OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO

COME THROUGH BOTH INTERNAL EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS. TO THE

EXTENT WE MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO COMBINATIONS, WE FACE

NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COMBINING THE BUSINESSES AND

SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE NEED TO COMBINE ACCOUNTING AND DATA

PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND TO INTEGRATE

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. WE MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO MEET THESE OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS CHALLENGES.

INVESTMENTS

IN THE POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY

WE OWN EQUITY INTERESTS IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN

ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, PRINCIPALLY EAST COAST POWER L.L.C.

AND COGENTRIX ENERGY, INC. AS A RESULT OF THESE INTERESTS AND

FUTURE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY MAKE IN THE POWER GENERATION

INDUSTRY, WE FACE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

WE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW ENTRANT TO THE POWER

GENERATION BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LESS EXPERTISE AND

EXPERIENCE IN OWNING POWER GENERATION BUSINESSES THAN MANY OF

OUR COMPETITORS. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN OWNING

AND MANAGING COMPANIES ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION AND WE MAY

NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OWNING AND MANAGING OUR POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES. IN PARTICULAR, IN THE FUTURE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND

EMPLOYEES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY

BE DISRUPTED. THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES INVOLVES MANY RISKS, INCLUDING THE BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR

OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED

LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY. ALTHOUGH OUR FACILITIES CONTAIN

VARIOUS REDUNDANCIES AND BACK-UP MECHANISMS, A BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE MAY PREVENT THE AFFECTED FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING

UNDER APPLICABLE POWER SALES AGREEMENTS OR OTHERWISE OPERATING

AS PLANNED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY,

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN

THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INTENSIFIED SCRUTINY OF THE ENERGY

MARKET BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE PUBLIC

HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING ENERGY COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE ENGAGED IN POWER

GENERATION. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POWER

GENERATION, AND OUR OVERALL BUSINESSES AND REPUTATION MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARISING

OUT OF OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR POWER

GENERATION OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE

AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG

OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, NATURAL

RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION, AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,

INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION

FEES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AT OUR

FACILITIES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR

REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF SEVERE CIVIL OR

CRIMINAL LIABILITIES AGAINST US AND THE NEED TO EXPEND

SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR COMPLIANCE OR REMEDIATION.

INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS WITH

RESPECT TO OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE

AND THE PROCEEDS FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY, IF ANY, MAY NOT BE

ADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LIABILITIES IN A PARTICULAR INCIDENT. AS A

RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM AT ONE OF OUR

FACILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER

HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE MAY NOT HAVE INSURANCE

AGAINST THESE RISKS AND, IF WE DO HAVE INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE

PROCEEDS MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND

SUPPORTING OUR OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE

INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING RISKS OF

POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN MANY

COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES

AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING,

AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. OUR INABILITY TO

REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN

MARKET COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON

OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION

GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE

STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, VARIOUS EMERGING

MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR

NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS

OF THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES

AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (THE PARENT COMPANY)

SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(THE FIRM) AND NOTES THERETO (THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS), WHICH ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS

FORM 10-K.

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

THESE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT,

ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE

PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATIONS

AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER MATTERS THAT AFFECT THE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED

DISCLOSURES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE

BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION; NONETHELESS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS

MOST OF THE CONSOLIDATED UNSECURED LIQUIDITY OF

THE FIRM IS RAISED BY THE PARENT COMPANY. THE PARENT COMPANY

THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES, AS REPRESENTED BY RECEIVABLES FROM

AFFILIATES AND SUBORDINATED LOAN RECEIVABLES FROM

AFFILIATES ON THE CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION. INTERCOMPANY EXPOSURE IS MANAGED BY GENERALLY

REQUIRING INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR

SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE

PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES

OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN

ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

PLEDGE COLLATERAL TO COVER THEIR INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS. EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH EQUITY

CAPITAL.

IN ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY CHARGES CERTAIN

AFFILIATES FOR RENTAL AND OTHER COSTS RELATING TO PROPERTIES

OCCUPIED BY THOSE AFFILIATES.

INTEREST INCOME IS LARGELY GENERATED FROM LOANS

MADE TO AFFILIATES.

THE PARENT COMPANY ACTS AS AN INVESTOR IN

CONTINGENCIES

THE PARENT COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF

JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING

MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF ITS

BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN THE

AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE

PARENT COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH

PERIOD.

GUARANTEES

THE PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEES MANY OF THE

OBLIGATIONS OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDING ITS

LARGEST OPERATING ENTITIES IN EUROPE AND ASIA AND MANY OF ITS

PRIMARY DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES TRADING ENTITIES AS WELL AS

CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. THE PARENT COMPANY TYPICALLY DOES

NOT GUARANTEE ALL OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTICULAR

SUBSIDIARY; RATHER, IT GUARANTEES OBLIGATIONS ON A

TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH THE

COUNTERPARTY. THE PARENT COMPANY TYPICALLY DOES NOT ISSUE

GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS U.S. BROKER-DEALER

SUBSIDIARIES, ALTHOUGH THE PARENT COMPANY IS THE GENERAL PARTNER

OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. THE PARENT COMPANY IS UNABLE TO

DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE

GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS ARE

OBLIGATIONS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE PARENT

COMPANYS LIABILITIES AS GUARANTOR ARE INCLUDED IN THE

LIABILITIES OF THE FIRM THAT ARE ALREADY REPORTED AND DISCLOSED

IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMPANY INDEMNIFIES AND GUARANTEES CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS,

SUCH AS CUSTODY AGENTS, TRUSTEES AND ADMINISTRATORS, AGAINST

SPECIFIED POTENTIAL LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACTING AS AN

AGENT OF, OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO, THE PARENT COMPANY OR ITS

AFFILIATES. THE PARENT COMPANY ALSO INDEMNIFIES SOME CLIENTS

AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES INCURRED IN THE EVENT SPECIFIED

THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING SUBCUSTODIANS AND

THIRD-PARTY BROKERS, IMPROPERLY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS. THE PARENT

COMPANY IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT

UNDER THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE PARENT COMPANY WILL HAVE TO

MAKE MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO

LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONDENSED NON-CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENT AS OF NOVEMBER 2003.

THE PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES TO COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH A VARIETY OF

COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND OCCASIONALLY INDEMNIFIES THEM

AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY THE BREACH OF THOSE

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE PARENT COMPANY MAY ALSO

PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN OR

ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN U.S. TAX LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH

ORDINARY-COURSE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS SECURITIES ISSUANCES,

BORROWINGS OR DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY MAY

PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS TO SOME COUNTERPARTIES TO PROTECT THEM

IN THE EVENT ADDITIONAL TAXES ARE OWED OR PAYMENTS ARE WITHHELD,

DUE EITHER TO A CHANGE IN OR AN ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN

NON-U.S. TAX LAWS. THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS GENERALLY ARE STANDARD

CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS. GENERALLY, THERE ARE NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND THE CONTINGENCIES

TRIGGERING THE OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO

OCCUR. THE PARENT COMPANY IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF

THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE PARENT COMPANY WILL HAVE TO

MAKE MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO

LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED

IN THE CONDENSED NON-CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF

NOVEMBER 2003.
