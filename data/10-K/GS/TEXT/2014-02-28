BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING CYBER SECURITY, ARE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY

PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE FIRMS CRITICAL FACILITIES AND TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF FINRA. BECAUSE WE ARE A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY, OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM IS ALSO SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE CRISIS PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT, PEOPLE RECOVERY, BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, AND PROCESS

IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY OUR CLIENTS AND THAT OF THE FIRM FROM CYBER ATTACKS AND OTHER

MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS. SAFEGUARDS ARE APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE

QUALITY AND DEDICATION OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE AND HIGH STANDARDS OF BUSINESS

ETHICS.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT

PART. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW

MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE AND DIVERSITY. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, WE HAD 32,900 TOTAL STAFF.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN

SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AS WELL AS THOSE ENTITIES THAT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, DERIVATIVES, REAL ESTATE, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

ASSETS. THESE ENTITIES INCLUDE BROKERS AND DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME ENTITIES GLOBALLY AND

WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND, IN PARTICULAR,

THE CREDIT CRISIS CAUSED NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. EFFORTS BY OUR COMPETITORS TO GAIN MARKET SHARE HAVE RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING AND CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES AND COULD

RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES. MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE, PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY NOT BE

COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS AGREEMENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR OTHER LOAN FACILITIES) FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING

AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND HAVE ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND HAVE MORE CAPITAL AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS.

FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE INCREASING VOLUME OF TRADES EXECUTED ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON TRADING COMMISSIONS, IN THAT COMMISSIONS FOR

LOW-TOUCH ELECTRONIC TRADING ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOR HIGH-TOUCH NON-ELECTRONIC TRADING. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD ELECTRONIC AND OTHER LOW-TOUCH, LOW-COMMISSION TRADING WILL CONTINUE. IN ADDITION, WE

BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY FURTHER REDUCING PRICES.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT), THE REQUIREMENTS PROMULGATED BY THE

BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL COMMITTEE) AND OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATION COULD AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION TO THE EXTENT THAT LIMITATIONS ON ACTIVITIES, INCREASED FEES AND COMPLIANCE COSTS OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS DO NOT

APPLY, OR DO NOT APPLY EQUALLY, TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. THE IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WILL DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT

ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THE REQUIRED RULEMAKING AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE EVOLVE, THE EXTENT OF INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICE AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE NEW REGULATORY REGIMES AS DISCUSSED FURTHER UNDER

REGULATION BELOW.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO

CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES AND TO CONTINUE TO COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES COMPETITIVELY AMID INTENSE PUBLIC AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY ON THE COMPENSATION

PRACTICES OF LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR PAY PRACTICES AND THOSE OF OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND REGULATORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE PRUDENTIAL

REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA) AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FCA) IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. SEE REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES BELOW AND RISK

FACTORS  OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE REGULATION OF OUR

COMPENSATION PRACTICES.

REGULATION

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE BANKING, SECURITIES, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, AND DERIVATIVES INDUSTRIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION WORLDWIDE. REGULATORY BODIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE GENERALLY CHARGED

WITH SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL MARKETS AND WITH PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE CUSTOMERS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING DEPOSITORS IN BANKING ENTITIES AND THE CUSTOMERS OF BROKER-DEALERS, INVESTMENT

ADVISERS, SWAP DEALERS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE

REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN RECENT YEARS. OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. IN PARTICULAR, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH WAS

ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT FOR OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEGISLATION BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC, THE SEC, THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC) AND OTHER AGENCIES, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE REGIME ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATION AND THE IMPLEMENTING RULES.

OTHER REFORMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY OTHER REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS WORLDWIDE, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE OUR BUSINESS, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND COMPLIANCE PRACTICES TO CONFORM TO

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BHC ACT, GROUP INC. IS SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL

REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF OUR CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION, BUT GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY REGULATORS OF OUR U.S. NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH RESPECT TO THE

ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. SUCH FUNCTIONALLY REGULATED NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE BROKER-DEALERS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC, SUCH AS OUR PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER, GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.), ENTITIES REGISTERED

WITH OR REGULATED BY THE CFTC WITH RESPECT TO FUTURES-RELATED AND SWAPS-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THEIR INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES.

AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW, OUR SUBSIDIARY, GS BANK USA, IS SUPERVISED AND REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC, THE NEW YORK

STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB). IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. HAS TWO LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCEPT DEPOSITS OR MAKE LOANS (OTHER THAN AS INCIDENTAL

TO THEIR TRUST ACTIVITIES) AND ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC. THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY, N.A., A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT IS LIMITED TO FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES, IS REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND IS A MEMBER

BANK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY OF DELAWARE, A DELAWARE LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY, IS REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE DELAWARE STATE BANK COMMISSIONER.

ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT GENERALLY

RESTRICTS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES FROM ENGAGING IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THE BUSINESS OF BANKING AND CERTAIN CLOSELY RELATED ACTIVITIES. FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, HOWEVER, GENERALLY CAN ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND RELATED

ACTIVITIES THAN ARE OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. THESE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE THAT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS U.S.

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAIN THEIR STATUS AS WELL-CAPITALIZED AND WELL-MANAGED. THE BROADER RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES INCLUDES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND MAKING MARKETS IN

SECURITIES AND MAKING INVESTMENTS IN NON-FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE GLB ACT TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE IMPERMISSIBLE FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES, SO LONG AS THE ASSETS HELD PURSUANT TO THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT EQUAL 5% OR MORE OF THEIR CONSOLIDATED ASSETS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, HOWEVER, HAS THE AUTHORITY TO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT

ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PERMISSIBLE FOR A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AND WILL DO SO IF WE DO NOT SATISFACTORILY MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

APPROVAL BEFORE ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

VOLCKER RULE

IN DECEMBER 2013, THE FINAL RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE WERE

ADOPTED. WE ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE (INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM) BY JULY 2015 WITH CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RULE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS THROUGH JULY 2017.

THE VOLCKER RULE PROHIBITS PROPRIETARY TRADING, BUT WILL ALLOW ACTIVITIES SUCH AS UNDERWRITING, MARKET MAKING AND

RISK-MITIGATION HEDGING. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FINAL RULE, WE EVALUATED THIS PROHIBITION AND DETERMINED THAT BUSINESSES THAT ENGAGE IN BRIGHT LINE PROPRIETARY TRADING WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE PROHIBITED. IN 2010 AND 2011, WE LIQUIDATED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR GLOBAL MACRO PROPRIETARY AND PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES TRADING POSITIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE PROHIBITION

ON PROPRIETARY TRADING, THE VOLCKER RULE LIMITS THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS (AS DEFINED IN THE RULE) BY BANKING ENTITIES, INCLUDING GROUP INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IT ALSO LIMITS CERTAIN TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN US AND OUR SPONSORED FUNDS, SIMILAR TO THE LIMITATIONS ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR AFFILIATES AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. COVERED FUNDS INCLUDE OUR PRIVATE EQUITY

FUNDS, CERTAIN OF OUR CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS, AND OUR HEDGE FUNDS. THE LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS IN COVERED FUNDS REQUIRES US TO REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT IN EACH SUCH FUND TO 3% OR LESS OF THE FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE, AND TO REDUCE OUR

AGGREGATE INVESTMENT IN ALL SUCH FUNDS TO 3% OR LESS OF OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FINAL RULE, WE LIMITED OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NEW COVERED FUNDS TO 3% OF THE FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE.

WE CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR EXISTING FUNDS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TRANSITION PERIODS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE. AS A RESULT, IN

MARCH 2012, WE BEGAN REDEEMING CERTAIN INTERESTS IN OUR HEDGE FUNDS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.

FOR CERTAIN OF OUR COVERED FUNDS, IN ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE VOLCKER RULE BY THE

PRESCRIBED COMPLIANCE DATE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THE PARTICULAR FUNDS ARE NOT SOLD, THE FIRM MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUCH FUNDS. IF THAT OCCURS, THE FIRM MAY RECEIVE A VALUE FOR ITS INVESTMENTS THAT IS

LESS THAN THE THEN CARRYING VALUE, AS THERE COULD BE A LIMITED SECONDARY MARKET FOR THESE INVESTMENTS AND THE FIRM MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEM IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS.

ALTHOUGH OUR NET REVENUES FROM INVESTMENTS IN OUR PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, OUR AGGREGATE NET REVENUES FROM THESE INVESTMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO

LEVERAGED LENDING

IN MARCH 2013, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES (AGENCIES) ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE ON LEVERAGED LENDING. THE GUIDANCE

FOCUSES ON TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS AND OUTLINES HIGH-LEVEL PRINCIPLES FOR SAFE-AND-SOUND LEVERAGED LENDING, INCLUDING UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, VALUATION AND STRESS TESTING. ALTHOUGH THE FULL IMPACT OF THE GUIDANCE

REMAINS UNCERTAIN, IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS GUIDANCE AND ANY RELATED CHANGES IN THE LEVERAGED LENDING MARKET COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LEVERAGED LENDING BUSINESS.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AND GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO BROADLY SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND, IN THE CASE OF GS BANK USA, THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION, BOTH GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA MUST MEET

SPECIFIC REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS. THE SUFFICIENCY OF OUR CAPITAL LEVELS AND THOSE OF GS BANK USA, AS WELL AS GS BANK USAS PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS.

OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING

GS&CO. AND GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI), ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT GROUP INC., GS BANK USA, GS&CO., GSI AND OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO BECOME SUBJECT TO INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OVER TIME.

LEVERAGE RATIO), AND FOR A DISCUSSION OF MINIMUM REQUIRED RATIOS.

REVISED MARKET RISK CAPITAL RULES OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THESE RULES REQUIRED THE ADDITION OF SEVERAL NEW MODEL-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITIZATION POSITIONS, AND WERE DESIGNED TO

IMPLEMENT THE NEW MARKET RISK FRAMEWORK OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS A PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS, AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT.

CHANGES IN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE AGENCIES HAVE APPROVED REVISED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND

LEVERAGE RATIO REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING A NEW COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR U.S. BANKING ORGANIZATIONS (REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK). THESE REGULATIONS ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEES DECEMBER 2010 FINAL CAPITAL FRAMEWORK

FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL III), AND SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS U.S. RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

RATIO RULES, AND THEREBY, IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT.

UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, GROUP INC.

IS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION. BELOW ARE THE ASPECTS OF THE RULES THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT TO US AS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION.

DEFINITION OF CAPITAL AND CAPITAL

RATIOS.

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INTRODUCED CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL, WHICH, SUBJECT TO TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, BECAME EFFECTIVE ACROSS OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL

AND LEVERAGE RATIOS ON JANUARY 1, 2014. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CAPITAL MEASURE CALLED COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1), AND THE RELATED REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIO OF CET1 TO RWAS (CET1 RATIO). IN ADDITION, THE

DEFINITION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL HAS BEEN NARROWED TO INCLUDE ONLY CET1 AND INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS PERPETUAL NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA.

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE REVISED REQUIREMENTS PHASE IN OVER TIME. THESE INCLUDE INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW CAPITAL BUFFERS AND CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS FROM

REGULATORY CAPITAL (SUCH AS INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS). IN ADDITION, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS IS BEING PHASED OUT OF REGULATORY CAPITAL. IT IS FIRST PHASED OUT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL BUT IS ELIGIBLE AS

TIER 2 CAPITAL FOR AN INTERIM PERIOD THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2015, AFTER WHICH IT WILL ALSO BE PHASED OUT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2021.

THE MINIMUM CET1 RATIO IS 4.0% AS OF JANUARY 1, 2014 AND WILL INCREASE TO 4.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2015. THE MINIMUM

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO INCREASED FROM 4.0% TO 5.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2014 AND WILL INCREASE TO 6.0% BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015. THE MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO REMAINS UNCHANGED AT 8.0%. THESE MINIMUM RATIOS WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY

A NEW CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER THAT PHASES IN, BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2016, IN INCREMENTS OF 0.625% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 2.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ALSO INTRODUCES A NEW COUNTER-CYCLICAL

CAPITAL BUFFER, TO BE IMPOSED IN THE EVENT THAT NATIONAL SUPERVISORS DEEM IT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT EXCESSIVE CREDIT GROWTH.

CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO CALCULATE CET1 ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSITION PROVISIONS. MOST ITEMS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DEDUCTED FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL BECOME DEDUCTIONS FROM CET1, MANY OF WHICH TRANSITION INTO

CET1 DEDUCTIONS AT A RATE OF 20% PER YEAR, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2014. THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ALSO INTRODUCED NEW DEDUCTIONS FROM CET1 (SUCH AS INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS), WHICH ARE ALSO PHASED IN AS CET1

DEDUCTIONS AT A RATE OF 20% PER YEAR WITH RESIDUAL AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RISK WEIGHTING.

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

IN FEBRUARY 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFORMED US THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL RUN, AS REQUIRED OF ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE REVISED

CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AND THEREFORE CHANGES TO RWAS WILL TAKE EFFECT BEGINNING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014. ACCORDINGLY, THE CALCULATION OF RWAS IN FUTURE QUARTERS WILL BE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES.



DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014  THE BASEL I RISK-BASED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS RELATED TO EXISTING CAPITAL

DEDUCTIONS AND THE PHASE-IN OF NEW CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS (BASEL I ADJUSTED);



DURING THE REMAINING QUARTERS OF 2014  THE HIGHER OF RWAS COMPUTED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH OR THE BASEL I

ADJUSTED CALCULATION; AND



BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015  THE HIGHER OF RWAS COMPUTED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED OR STANDARDIZED APPROACH.

THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH IS THAT

THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH UTILIZES PRESCRIBED RISK-WEIGHTINGS AND DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE THE USE OF INTERNAL MODELS TO COMPUTE EXPOSURE FOR CREDIT RISK ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHEREAS THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH

PERMITS THE USE OF SUCH MODELS, SUBJECT TO SUPERVISORY APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, RWAS UNDER THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH DEPEND LARGELY ON THE TYPE OF COUNTERPARTY (E.G., WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK, BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER ENTITY),

RATHER THAN ON ASSESSMENTS OF EACH COUNTERPARTYS CREDITWORTHINESS. FURTHERMORE, THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH DOES NOT INCLUDE A CAPITAL REQUIREMENT FOR OPERATIONAL RISK. RWAS FOR MARKET RISK UNDER BOTH THE STANDARDIZED AND BASEL III ADVANCED

APPROACHES ARE BASED ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

FOR INFORMATION ON OUR RWAS, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  EQUITY CAPITAL  RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

REGULATORY LEVERAGE RATIOS.

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INCREASED THE MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO APPLICABLE TO US FROM 3% TO 4% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014.

IN ADDITION, THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK WILL INTRODUCE A NEW SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS,

WHICH COMPARES TIER 1 CAPITAL (AS DEFINED UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK) TO A MEASURE OF LEVERAGE EXPOSURE (DEFINED AS THE SUM OF OUR ASSETS LESS CERTAIN CET1 DEDUCTIONS PLUS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES).

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK REQUIRES A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3%, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, BUT WITH

DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.

LIQUIDITY

RATIOS UNDER BASEL III.

HISTORICALLY, REGULATION AND MONITORING OF BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONALLY, WITHOUT REQUIRED FORMULAIC MEASURES. BASEL III WILL REQUIRE BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY AGAINST TWO SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR IN SOME RESPECTS TO LIQUIDITY MEASURES HISTORICALLY

APPLIED BY BANKS AND REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES, WILL BE MANDATED BY REGULATION. ONE TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO, IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED

HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS UNDER AN ACUTE LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. THE OTHER, REFERRED TO AS THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO, IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR

TIME HORIZON. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY INCENTIVIZE BANKING ENTITIES TO INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS OF SECURITIES THAT QUALIFY AS HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS AND INCREASE THE USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS A FUNDING SOURCE. UNDER THE BASEL COMMITTEES

FRAMEWORK, THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO WOULD BE INTRODUCED ON JANUARY 1, 2015; HOWEVER THERE WOULD BE A PHASE-IN PERIOD WHEREBY FIRMS WOULD HAVE A 60% MINIMUM IN 2015, WHICH WOULD BE RAISED 10% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 100% IN 2019.

THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE INTRODUCED AS A REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2018.

IN OCTOBER 2013, THE AGENCIES ISSUED A PROPOSAL ON MINIMUM LIQUIDITY STANDARDS THAT IS

GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES FRAMEWORK AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, BUT WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSET DEFINITION AND EXPECTED CASH OUTFLOW ASSUMPTIONS, AND ACCELERATED TRANSITION PROVISIONS. IN ADDITION,

UNDER THE PROPOSED ACCELERATED TRANSITION TIMELINE, THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO WOULD BE INTRODUCED ON JANUARY 1, 2015; HOWEVER, THERE WOULD BE AN ACCELERATED U.S. PHASE-IN PERIOD WHEREBY FIRMS WOULD HAVE AN 80% MINIMUM IN 2015 WHICH

WOULD BE RAISED 10% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 100% IN 2017.

WHILE THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE NEW FRAMEWORKS PROPOSED BY

THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE AGENCIES ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REFINEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STANDARDS COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES.

STRESS TESTS.

IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ISSUED FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT CONCERNING THE DODD-FRANK ACT SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS TO BE CONDUCTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND SEMI-ANNUAL COMPANY-RUN

STRESS TESTS FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE. THE STRESS TEST RULES REQUIRE INCREASED INVOLVEMENT BY BOARDS OF DIRECTORS IN STRESS TESTING AND, SINCE MARCH 2013, PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE

RESULTS OF BOTH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS ANNUAL STRESS TESTS AND A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ANNUAL SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS, AND SEMI-ANNUAL INTERNAL STRESS TESTS. CERTAIN STRESS TEST REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA, AS

DISCUSSED BELOW.

WE PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF OUR ANNUAL DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST RESULTS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO IN MARCH 2013. WE SUBMITTED THE RESULTS OF OUR MID-CYCLE DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN JULY 2013 AND WE PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF OUR MID-CYCLE DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST

RESULTS UNDER OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO IN SEPTEMBER 2013. OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO IS DESIGNED TO STRESS THE FIRMS RISKS AND IDIOSYNCRATIC VULNERABILITIES AND ASSESS THE FIRMS

PRO-FORMA CAPITAL POSITION AND RATIOS UNDER THE HYPOTHETICAL STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR ANNUAL AND MID-CYCLE DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST RESULTS ON OUR WEB SITE AS DESCRIBED UNDER AVAILABLE INFORMATION

BELOW. OUR ANNUAL DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST SUBMISSION IS INCORPORATED INTO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL PLANS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AS PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR).

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND STOCK

REPURCHASES.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY GROUP INC. TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND STOCK REPURCHASES BY GROUP INC. ARE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE DIVIDEND AND SHARE

REPURCHASE POLICIES OF LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS GROUP INC., ARE REVIEWED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS AND STRESS TESTS SUBMITTED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY, AND WILL BE ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO MEET AND EXCEED MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER STRESSED SCENARIOS, ITS EXPECTED SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON (GENERALLY A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS) UNDER BASELINE AND STRESSED

SCENARIOS, AND ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESS PLAN AND ACTIVITIES ON ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE CAPITAL PLAN REVIEW IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING

PROCESSES THAT ACCOUNT FOR EACH INSTITUTIONS UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMIT CONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS. AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLAN REVIEW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WILL EVALUATE AN INSTITUTIONS

PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASING OR REDEEMING STOCK OR INCREASING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACROSS A RANGE OF MACRO-ECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS.

AS PART OF OUR INITIAL 2013 CCAR SUBMISSION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFORMED US THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, INCLUDING THE REPURCHASE OF

OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, AN INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND, AND THE POSSIBLE ISSUANCE, REDEMPTION AND MODIFICATION OF OTHER CAPITAL SECURITIES. AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, WE RESUBMITTED OUR 2013 CAPITAL PLAN IN

SEPTEMBER 2013, INCORPORATING CERTAIN ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR STRESS TESTING PROCESS. IN DECEMBER 2013, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFORMED US THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO OUR RESUBMITTED CAPITAL PLAN. WE SUBMITTED OUR 2014 CCAR TO THE FEDERAL

RESERVE IN JANUARY 2014 AND EXPECT TO PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF OUR ANNUAL DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST RESULTS IN MARCH 2014.

ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL

STANDARDS.

IN FEBRUARY 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ADOPTED RULES TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN OF THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS CONTEMPLATED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT. BEGINNING

JANUARY 1, 2015, THE RULES REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS TO COMPLY WITH ENHANCED LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, INCLUDING A BUFFER OF HIGHLY LIQUID ASSETS BASED ON

PROJECTED FUNDING NEEDS FOR 30 DAYS, AND INCREASED INVOLVEMENT BY BOARDS OF DIRECTORS IN LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT. THE LIQUIDITY BUFFER IS IN ADDITION TO THE AGENCIES PROPOSAL ON MINIMUM LIQUIDITY STANDARDS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

ALTHOUGH THE RULES ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

REGULATORY PROPOSALS

IN ADDITION

TO THE REGULATORY RULE CHANGES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE), BOTH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAVE PROPOSED OTHER CHANGES, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE PROPOSALS ON THE FIRM WILL

NOT BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY UNTIL AFTER ANY RESULTING RULES ARE FINALIZED AND MARKET PRACTICES DEVELOP UNDER THE FINAL RULES. FURTHERMORE, THESE PROPOSALS, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, OTHER REFORM INITIATIVES PROPOSED AND ANNOUNCED BY THE AGENCIES, THE

BASEL COMMITTEE, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS (INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), THE PRA AND THE FCA) ARE NOT IN ALL CASES CONSISTENT WITH ONE ANOTHER, WHICH ADDS FURTHER UNCERTAINTY TO OUR FUTURE CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS, AND THOSE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

PROPOSALS.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS AND EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE DODD-FRANK

ACT. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS HAVE NOW BEEN ADDRESSED IN FINAL RULES THAT ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE SINGLE-COUNTERPARTY CREDIT LIMITS AND EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL UNDER CONSIDERATION. THE PROPOSED SINGLE-COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

LIMITS IMPOSE MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT EXPOSURE AMONG MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH (TOGETHER WITH OTHER PROVISIONS INCORPORATED INTO THE BASEL III CAPITAL RULES) MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO TRANSACT OR HEDGE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. THE PROPOSED EARLY REMEDIATION RULES ARE MODELED ON THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGIME, DESCRIBED BELOW, BUT ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ACTION TO BEGIN IN EARLIER STAGES OF A COMPANYS FINANCIAL DISTRESS, BASED ON A RANGE OF

TRIGGERS, INCLUDING CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE, STRESS TEST RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE APPROVAL

OF THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, THE AGENCIES ISSUED A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR THE LARGEST U.S. BANKS (THOSE DEEMED TO BE GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING INSTITUTIONS (G-SIBS) UNDER THE

BASEL

G-SIB

FRAMEWORK). THESE PROPOSALS WOULD REQUIRE US AND OTHER G-SIBS TO MEET A 5% SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (COMPRISED OF THE CURRENT MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF 3% PLUS A 2% BUFFER). IN ADDITION, THE BASEL

COMMITTEE RECENTLY FINALIZED REVISIONS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE LEVERAGE EXPOSURE FOR PURPOSES OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO, BUT WOULD RETAIN A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 3%. IT IS NOT KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY

AT THIS POINT WHETHER THE U.S. REGULATORS WILL ADOPT THIS REVISED DEFINITION OF LEVERAGE INTO THEIR RULES AND PROPOSALS FOR THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO.

BASEL COMMITTEE PROPOSALS.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS UPDATED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING

THE GLOBAL SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND DETERMINING THE RANGE OF ADDITIONAL CET1 THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY THOSE DEEMED TO BE G-SIBS. THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CET1 FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS WILL INITIALLY RANGE FROM 1% TO

2.5% AND COULD BE HIGHER IN THE FUTURE FOR A BANKING INSTITUTION THAT INCREASES ITS SYSTEMIC FOOTPRINT (E.G., BY INCREASING TOTAL ASSETS). IN NOVEMBER 2013, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (ESTABLISHED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP

OF 20) INDICATED THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HOLD AN ADDITIONAL 1.5% OF CET1 AS A G-SIB,

BASED ON OUR 2012 FINANCIAL DATA. THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CET1 THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO HOLD WILL INITIALLY BE BASED ON OUR 2013 FINANCIAL DATA AND THE MANNER AND

TIMING OF THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY. THE BASEL COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT G-SIBS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE CAPITAL SURCHARGES ON A PHASED-IN BASIS BEGINNING IN 2016 THROUGH 2019.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ALSO PUBLISHED ITS FINAL GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING INCREMENTAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DOMESTIC

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING INSTITUTIONS

(D-SIBS).

THESE GUIDELINES ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE FRAMEWORK OUTLINED ABOVE FOR G-SIBS, BUT ARE MORE PRINCIPLES-BASED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE DEGREE OF

NATIONAL DISCRETION. THE IMPACT OF THESE GUIDELINES ON THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF GS BANK USA, GSI AND OTHER OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES WILL DEPEND ON HOW THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING AND NON-BANKING REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND

OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS RELEASED OTHER CONSULTATION PAPERS THAT MAY RESULT IN FURTHER CHANGES TO

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING A FUNDAMENTAL REVIEW OF THE TRADING BOOK AND REVISIONS TO THE BASEL SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORK.

RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANS

AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD AND FDIC HAVE JOINTLY ISSUED A RULE REQUIRING EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN ASSETS AND EACH DESIGNATED SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO PROVIDE TO REGULATORS AN ANNUAL PLAN FOR ITS RAPID AND ORDERLY

RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE (RESOLUTION PLAN). OUR RESOLUTION PLAN MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DEMONSTRATE THAT GS BANK USA IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER ENTITIES. THE REGULATORS

JOINT RULE SETS SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR THE RESOLUTION PLANS, INCLUDING REQUIRING A DETAILED RESOLUTION STRATEGY AND ANALYSES OF THE COMPANYS MATERIAL ENTITIES, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, INTERCONNECTIONS AND INTERDEPENDENCIES, AND MANAGEMENT

INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AMONG OTHER ELEMENTS. IN APRIL 2013, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC PROVIDED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO US RELATING TO OUR 2013 RESOLUTION PLAN. GROUP INC. SUBMITTED ITS 2013 RESOLUTION PLAN TO ITS REGULATORS IN

SEPTEMBER 2013. GROUP INC. IS ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, A GLOBAL RECOVERY PLAN TO REGULATORS THAT OUTLINES THE STEPS THAT MANAGEMENT COULD TAKE OVER TIME TO REDUCE RISK, RAISE LIQUIDITY, AND CONSERVE CAPITAL IN TIMES OF

PROLONGED STRESS. WE HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING YEARLY PLANS SINCE 2010.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY HISTORICALLY HAS REQUIRED BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT CODIFIES THIS POLICY AS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. THIS SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AT TIMES WHEN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT. CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A

SUBSIDIARY BANK ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BANK. IN ADDITION, IF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY COMMITS TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATOR THAT IT WILL MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF ITS BANK

SUBSIDIARY, WHETHER IN RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS INVOKING ITS SOURCE-OF-STRENGTH AUTHORITY OR IN RESPONSE TO OTHER REGULATORY MEASURES, THAT COMMITMENT WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND THE BANK WILL BE ENTITLED TO

PRIORITY PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF THAT COMMITMENT, AHEAD OF OTHER CREDITORS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE BHC ACT

PROVIDES FOR REGULATION OF BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS AND PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING A PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF

THAT SUBSIDIARY OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

COMPENSATION PRACTICES

OUR

COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND, WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND EMPLOYEES, BY OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATORY BODIES WORLDWIDE. THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF COMPENSATION REGULATION IN THE

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP, AND WE EXPECT THAT THESE REGULATIONS AND RESULTING MARKET PRACTICES WILL EVOLVE OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

IN JUNE 2010, THE AGENCIES JOINTLY ISSUED GUIDANCE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AT BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RISK AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH SAFE AND SOUND

PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE SETS FORTH THE FOLLOWING THREE KEY PRINCIPLES WITH RESPECT TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS: THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER

THAT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO EXPOSE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISK; THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT; AND THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. IN

ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD HAS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF A NUMBER OF LARGE, COMPLEX BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING US. THE JUNE 2010 GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT

SUPERVISORY FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION WILL BE INCORPORATED, AS APPROPRIATE, INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS, WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER ACTIONS. THE GUIDANCE ALSO

PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT, CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS.

THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD HAS RELEASED STANDARDS FOR IMPLEMENTING CERTAIN COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES FOR BANKS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL COMPANIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE SOUND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THESE STANDARDS ARE TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL REGULATORS. IN EUROPE, THE FOURTH CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE (CRD4) INCLUDES COMPENSATION PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO IMPLEMENT THE

FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARDS COMPENSATION STANDARDS WITHIN THE EU. THESE RULES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED BY EU MEMBER STATES AND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT THE RATIO OF VARIABLE TO FIXED COMPENSATION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE RISK PROFILE OF EU-REGULATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING GSI AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVISION

DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRES THE U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, TO ESTABLISH

JOINT REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES PROHIBITING INCENTIVE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AT SPECIFIED REGULATED ENTITIES HAVING AT LEAST $1 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH WOULD INCLUDE GROUP INC. AND SOME OF ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, BROKER-DEALER

AND INVESTMENT ADVISOR SUBSIDIARIES) THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISKS BY PROVIDING AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, DIRECTOR OR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER WITH EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION, FEES, OR BENEFITS OR THAT COULD LEAD TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS TO

THE ENTITY. IN ADDITION, THESE REGULATORS MUST ESTABLISH REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURE TO REGULATORS OF INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THE INITIAL VERSION OF THESE REGULATIONS WAS PROPOSED BY THE U.S. FINANCIAL

REGULATORS IN EARLY 2011 BUT THE REGULATIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN FINALIZED. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS INCORPORATE THE THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FROM THE JUNE 2010 REGULATORY GUIDANCE DISCUSSED ABOVE. IF THE REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTED IN THE FORM INITIALLY

PROPOSED, THEY MAY RESTRICT OUR FLEXIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE MANNER IN WHICH WE STRUCTURE COMPENSATION.

REGULATION OF GS BANK USA

OUR SUBSIDIARY, GS BANK USA, AN FDIC-INSURED, NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, IS SUPERVISED AND REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC, THE NEW YORK

STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THE CFPB, AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (DESCRIBED BELOW) THAT ARE CALCULATED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. A NUMBER OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED

PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY THROUGH GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING: ORIGINATION OF BANK LOANS; INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, CURRENCY AND OTHER DERIVATIVES; LEVERAGED FINANCE; MORTGAGE ORIGINATION; STRUCTURED FINANCE; AND AGENCY LENDING.

UNDER RULES ADOPTED BY THE AGENCIES IN 2012 UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, GS BANK USA IS REQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE STRESS TESTS, TO SUBMIT THE

RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AND TO MAKE A SUMMARY OF THOSE RESULTS PUBLIC. THE RULES REQUIRE THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GS BANK USA, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CONSIDER THE RESULTS OF THE STRESS TESTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE BANKS

BUSINESS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ITS CAPITAL PLANNING, ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT CONTAINS DERIVATIVE PUSH-OUT PROVISIONS THAT WILL PREVENT US FROM CONDUCTING CERTAIN SWAPS-RELATED

ACTIVITIES THROUGH GS BANK USA, SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS FOR CERTAIN INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY AND CLEARED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AND FOR HEDGING OR RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BANKS BUSINESS. IN JULY 2013, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD GRANTED GS BANK USA AN EXTENSION THROUGH JULY 2015 TO COMPLY WITH THESE DERIVATIVE PUSH-OUT PROVISIONS. PRECLUDED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE FIRM, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS AND POTENTIAL REGISTRATION AS

A SWAP OR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALER.

IN ADDITION, NEW YORK STATE BANKING LAW IMPOSES LENDING LIMITS (WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS) AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD IMPACT THE MANNER AND SCOPE OF GS BANK USAS ACTIVITIES.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, ON THE ONE HAND, AND GROUP INC. OR ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER THE

FEDERAL RESERVE ACT. THE STATUTE AND THE RELATED REGULATIONS LIMIT THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM GS BANK USA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. OR ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES) THAT MAY TAKE PLACE

AND GENERALLY REQUIRE THOSE TRANSACTIONS TO BE ON MARKET TERMS OR BETTER TO GS BANK USA. THESE REGULATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE COVERAGE AND

SCOPE OF THE REGULATIONS THAT LIMIT AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN A BANKING ORGANIZATION, INCLUDING BY APPLYING THESE REGULATIONS TO THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ARISING UNDER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND

SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING TRANSACTIONS.

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY

OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. IN GENERAL, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY GS BANK USA OR OUR NATIONAL BANK TRUST COMPANY SUBSIDIARY IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT

EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY THE ENTITY IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME

COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE ENTITY OBTAINS PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF THE ENTITYS UNDIVIDED PROFITS

(GENERALLY, ACCUMULATED NET PROFITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PAID OUT AS DIVIDENDS OR TRANSFERRED TO SURPLUS). THE BANKING REGULATORS HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A

DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

GS BANK USA ACCEPTS DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF FDIC INSURANCE UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE ASSESSMENTS FOR LARGER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (GENERALLY THOSE THAT HAVE $10 BILLION IN ASSETS OR MORE), SUCH AS GS BANK USA, ARE CURRENTLY BASED ON THE AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS

LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD, THE SUPERVISORY RATINGS OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND SPECIFIED FORWARD-LOOKING FINANCIAL MEASURES USED TO CALCULATE THE ASSESSMENT

RATE. THE ASSESSMENT RATE IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BY THE FDIC.

PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION AND CAPITAL RATIOS.

THE U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA), AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES TO TAKE

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET SPECIFIED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FDICIA ESTABLISHES FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES FOR FDIC-INSURED BANKS: WELL-CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED,

UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED AND CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.

A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY

DEEMED TO BE WELL-CAPITALIZED, THE HIGHEST CATEGORY, IF IT HAS A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. GS BANK USA HAS AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THESE WELL-CAPITALIZED LEVELS. UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2014, GS BANK USA BECAME SUBJECT TO A NEW MINIMUM CET1 RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 4%,

INCREASING TO 4.5% IN 2015. IN ADDITION, THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK CHANGES THE STANDARDS FOR WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGULATIONS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015 BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INTRODUCING A

CET1 RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 6.5% AND INCREASING THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENT FROM 6% TO 8%. IN ADDITION, COMMENCING, JANUARY 1, 2018, ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA, MUST HAVE A SUPPLEMENTARY

LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3% OR GREATER. SHORTLY AFTER THE APPROVAL OF THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, IN JULY 2013, THE AGENCIES ISSUED A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT U.S. INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF U.S. G-SIBS, SUCH AS GS

BANK USA, MEET A WELL-CAPITALIZED SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 6%, WHICH WOULD BE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018 IF THE PROPOSAL IS ENACTED AS PROPOSED.

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ON GS

BANK USAS REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS.

GS BANK USA COMPUTES ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WERE BASED ON THE

BASEL I CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE, AND ALSO REFLECTED THE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013.

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA, WHICH IS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK.

GS BANK USA HAS ALSO BEEN INFORMED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THAT IT HAS COMPLETED A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL RUN, AS REQUIRED OF ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AND THEREFORE CHANGES TO ITS CALCULATIONS

OF RWAS WILL TAKE EFFECT BEGINNING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014.

AN INSTITUTION MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO, OR DEEMED TO BE IN, A

CAPITAL CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IF IT IS DETERMINED TO BE IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS. FDICIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY

MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, AS THE CAPITAL CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION DECLINES. FAILURE TO MEET THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COULD ALSO REQUIRE A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO RAISE CAPITAL. ULTIMATELY,

CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR, AS DESCRIBED UNDER  INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY BELOW.

THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS GROUP INC.

HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED UPON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO AN

UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO

FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE HOLDING COMPANY, THE GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE HOLDING COMPANYS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS, AS DESCRIBED UNDER  SOURCE OF

STRENGTH ABOVE.

INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY

UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT OF 1950, IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER FOR AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUCH AS GS BANK USA, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS BROAD POWERS, INCLUDING THE POWER.



TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR, INCLUDING A NEWLY FORMED BRIDGE BANK,

WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS;



TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PROVISIONS TRIGGERED BY THE

APPOINTMENT OF THE FDIC IN THAT CAPACITY; OR



TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC

TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMANCE OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF DOMESTIC DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY

OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS, INCLUDING DEPOSITS AT NON-U.S. BRANCHES, AGAINST SUCH AN INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION BY ANY

RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF GS BANK USA, THE DEBT HOLDERS (OTHER THAN DEPOSITORS) WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE

DEPOSITORS OF GS BANK USA.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT CREATED A NEW RESOLUTION REGIME (KNOWN AS ORDERLY LIQUIDATION

AUTHORITY) FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES, AND SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, THE FDIC MAY BE APPOINTED AS RECEIVER FOR THE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTION, AND

ITS FAILED NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES, FOR PURPOSES OF LIQUIDATING THE ENTITY IF, AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS, IT IS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE INSTITUTIONS FAILURE THAT IT IS IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT AND THE FAILURE POSES A RISK TO THE

STABILITY OF THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS RECEIVER UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, THEN THE

POWERS OF THE RECEIVER, AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CREDITORS AND OTHER PARTIES WHO HAVE DEALT WITH THE INSTITUTION, WOULD BE DETERMINED UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, AND NOT UNDER THE INSOLVENCY LAW THAT WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY. THE

POWERS OF THE RECEIVER UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY WERE GENERALLY BASED ON THE POWERS OF THE FDIC AS RECEIVER FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT. SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS EXIST

BETWEEN THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY AND THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE USE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE

CLAIMS PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE CREDITORS CLAIMS (AS OPPOSED TO THE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE UTILIZED IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS), AND THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC TO TRANSFER CLAIMS TO A BRIDGE ENTITY. IN ADDITION, THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION

AUTHORITY LIMITS THE ABILITY OF CREDITORS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL CROSS-DEFAULTS AGAINST AFFILIATES OF THE INSTITUTION IN RECEIVERSHIP.

THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT. THE FDIC HAS COMPLETED SEVERAL RULEMAKINGS UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, BUT MAY PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE. NEW GUIDANCE MAY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NEW AUTHORITY IS APPLIED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO BROKER-DEALER AND FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT SUBSIDIARIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. THE FDIC ISSUED A NOTICE IN

DECEMBER 2013 DESCRIBING SOME ELEMENTS OF ITS SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY OR SPOE STRATEGY PURSUANT TO THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, UNDER WHICH THE FDIC WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESOLVE

A FAILED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY BY TRANSFERRING ITS ASSETS TO A BRIDGE HOLDING COMPANY.

RESOLUTION PLAN

THE FDIC ISSUED A RULE REQUIRING EACH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN ASSETS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA, TO

PROVIDE A RESOLUTION PLAN. SIMILAR TO OUR RESOLUTION PLAN FOR GROUP INC., OUR RESOLUTION PLAN FOR GS BANK USA MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER ENTITIES. GS BANK USA SUBMITTED ITS

2013 RESOLUTION PLAN TO ITS REGULATORS IN SEPTEMBER 2013.

BROKER-DEALER AND SECURITIES REGULATION

GOLDMAN SACHS BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS, INCLUDING

SALES METHODS, TRADE PRACTICES, USE AND SAFEKEEPING OF CLIENTS FUNDS AND SECURITIES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE, RECORDKEEPING, THE FINANCING OF CLIENTS PURCHASES, AND THE CONDUCT OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

SEC IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. GS&CO. IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER, A MUNICIPAL ADVISOR AND AN INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH THE SEC AND AS A BROKER-DEALER IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS FINRA AND THE NYSE, ADOPT RULES THAT APPLY TO, AND EXAMINE, BROKER-DEALERS SUCH AS GS&CO.

IN ADDITION, STATE SECURITIES AND OTHER REGULATORS ALSO HAVE REGULATORY OR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER GS&CO. SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL AND

REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE OFFICES, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER UNDER OTHER REGULATION BELOW. GSEC AND ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED U.S. BROKER-DEALERS AND ARE REGULATED

BY THE SEC, THE NYSE AND FINRA. FOR A DISCUSSION OF NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO GS&CO. AND GSEC, SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY A NUMBER OF SECURITIES EXCHANGES. AS A DESIGNATED

MARKET MAKER (DMM) ON THE NYSE AND AS A MARKET MAKER ON OTHER EXCHANGES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ORDERLY MARKETS IN THE SECURITIES TO WHICH WE ARE ASSIGNED. UNDER THE NYSES DMM RULES, THIS MAY REQUIRE US TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY TO THESE

MARKETS WHEN MARKETS ARE DECLINING.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY THE SEC, THE CFTC AND

OTHER REGULATORS OF OUR BROKER-DEALER AND REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF RESPECTS. THE LEGISLATION CALLS FOR THE IMPOSITION OF EXPANDED STANDARDS OF CARE BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING BY PROVIDING THE

SEC WITH AUTHORITY TO ADOPT RULES ESTABLISHING FIDUCIARY DUTIES FOR BROKER-DEALERS AND DIRECTING THE SEC TO EXAMINE AND IMPROVE SALES PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURE BY BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS.

OUR BROKER-DEALER AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY RULES TO BE ADOPTED BY

FEDERAL AGENCIES PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT THAT REQUIRE ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES OR INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITY TRANSACTION TO RETAIN A PORTION (GENERALLY, AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT) OF ANY CREDIT RISK THAT THE PERSON CONVEYS TO A THIRD

PARTY. SECURITIZATIONS WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY RULES PROPOSED BY THE SEC IN SEPTEMBER 2011 TO IMPLEMENT THE DODD-FRANK ACTS PROHIBITION AGAINST SECURITIZATION PARTICIPANTS ENGAGING IN ANY TRANSACTION THAT WOULD INVOLVE OR RESULT IN

ANY MATERIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH AN INVESTOR IN A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION. THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD EXEMPT BONA FIDE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AND RISK-MITIGATING HEDGING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES FROM THE

GENERAL PROHIBITION.

THE SEC, FINRA AND REGULATORS IN VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS HAVE IMPOSED BOTH CONDUCT-BASED AND

DISCLOSURE-BASED REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH REPORTS AND RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.

SWAPS, DERIVATIVES

AND COMMODITIES REGULATION

THE COMMODITY FUTURES, COMMODITY OPTIONS AND SWAPS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO

REGULATIONS. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE AND THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION, ALSO GOVERN THE COMMODITY FUTURES,

COMMODITY OPTIONS AND SWAPS ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES. IN ADDITION, GOLDMAN SACHS FINANCIAL MARKETS, L.P. (GSFM) IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN OTC DERIVATIVES DEALER AND CONDUCTS CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED REGULATION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON

DERIVATIVE MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE DODD-FRANK ACT IMPOSES THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS.



REAL-TIME PUBLIC AND REGULATORY REPORTING OF TRADE INFORMATION FOR SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS AND LARGE TRADER REPORTING FOR SWAPS;



REGISTRATION OF SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS WITH THE CFTC AND OF SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS



POSITION LIMITS THAT CAP EXPOSURE TO DERIVATIVES ON CERTAIN PHYSICAL COMMODITIES;



MANDATED CLEARING THROUGH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES AND EXECUTION THROUGH REGULATED EXCHANGES OR ELECTRONIC FACILITIES FOR CERTAIN SWAPS AND

SECURITY-BASED SWAPS;



NEW BUSINESS CONDUCT STANDARDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR

SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS, COVERING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNTERPARTIES, INTERNAL OVERSIGHT AND COMPLIANCE STRUCTURES, CONFLICT OF INTEREST RULES, INTERNAL INFORMATION BARRIERS, GENERAL AND TRADE-SPECIFIC RECORD-KEEPING AND RISK

MANAGEMENT;



MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR TRADES THAT ARE NOT CLEARED THROUGH A CENTRAL COUNTERPARTY; AND



ENTITY-LEVEL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS, AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP

PARTICIPANTS.

THE TERMS SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS ARE GENERALLY DEFINED BROADLY

FOR PURPOSES OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND CAN INCLUDE A WIDE VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN ADDITION TO THOSE CONVENTIONALLY CALLED SWAPS. THE DEFINITION INCLUDES CERTAIN FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS, CERTAIN LOAN PARTICIPATIONS AND GUARANTEES OF

SWAPS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND RELATES TO A WIDE VARIETY OF UNDERLYING ASSETS OR OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, INTEREST OR OTHER MONETARY RATES, YIELDS, INDICES, SECURITIES, CREDIT EVENTS, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

OBLIGATIONS.

THE CFTC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUING RULES RELATING TO SWAPS, SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP

PARTICIPANTS, AND THE SEC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUING RULES RELATING TO SECURITY-BASED SWAPS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS. ALTHOUGH THE CFTC HAS NOT YET FINALIZED ITS MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OR CAPITAL

REGULATIONS, CERTAIN OF THE REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REGISTRATION OF SWAP DEALERS, BUSINESS CONDUCT STANDARDS AND REAL-TIME PUBLIC TRADE REPORTING, HAVE TAKEN EFFECT ALREADY UNDER CFTC RULES, AND THE SEC AND THE CFTC HAVE FINALIZED THE DEFINITIONS OF

A NUMBER OF KEY TERMS. IN ADDITION, THE CFTC HAS IMPLEMENTED RULES REQUIRING THE MANDATORY CLEARING OF CERTAIN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS BETWEEN DEALERS, AND BETWEEN SWAP DEALERS AND NON-DEALER FINANCIAL ENTITIES. FINALLY, THE

CFTC HAS COMMENCED MAKING DETERMINATIONS REGARDING WHICH SWAPS MUST BE TRADED ON SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES OR EXCHANGES, AND CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS ARE NOW SUBJECT TO THESE TRADE-EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS. THE CFTC IS

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATIONS DURING 2014.

THE SEC HAS PROPOSED RULES TO IMPOSE MARGIN, CAPITAL AND

SEGREGATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS. THE SEC HAS ALSO PROPOSED RULES RELATING TO REGISTRATION OF SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS, TRADE REPORTING

AND REAL-TIME REPORTING, AND BUSINESS CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS, AND HAS PROPOSED RULES AND GUIDANCE ON THE CROSS-BORDER REGULATION OF SECURITY-BASED SWAPS. THE SEC HAS PROPOSED,

BUT NOT YET FINALIZED, RULES THAT WOULD GOVERN THE DESIGN OF NEW TRADING VENUES FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAPS AND ESTABLISH THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHICH PRODUCTS MUST BE TRADED ON THESE VENUES.

WE HAVE REGISTERED CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AS SWAP DEALERS UNDER THE CFTC RULES, INCLUDING GS&CO., GS BANK USA, GSI AND J.

ARON & COMPANY. WE EXPECT THAT THESE ENTITIES, AND OUR BUSINESSES MORE BROADLY, WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND DEVELOPING REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT IN CONNECTION WITH SWAP-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

SIMILAR REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED OR ADOPTED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF STANDARDIZED EXECUTION AND CLEARING, MARGINING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR OTC DERIVATIVES. FOR INSTANCE, THE EU HAS ESTABLISHED A SET OF NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR EU DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES UNDER THE

EUROPEAN MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION. THESE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE VARIOUS RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BECOME EFFECTIVE AND REGULATORY REPORTING AND CLEARING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO START BECOMING EFFECTIVE

IN 2014.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REGULATION

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT REGULATION IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD RELATING TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT ASSETS, OFFERINGS OF FUNDS,

MARKETING ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS AMONG AFFILIATES AND OUR MANAGEMENT OF CLIENT FUNDS. CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED WITH, AND SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY, THE SEC AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS. IN JUNE 2013, THE SEC PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO

THE RULES GOVERNING THE REGULATION OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WHICH INCLUDED TWO ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED SEPARATELY OR IN A COMBINED MANNER: A FLOATING NET ASSET VALUE AND/OR RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS. THE FULL IMPACT OF THE AMENDMENTS ON

US WILL NOT BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY UNTIL THE AMENDMENTS ARE FINALIZED AND MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES DEVELOP UNDER THE AMENDED RULES.

OTHER

REGULATION

THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS

STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND OTHER STATE REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS, OR THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A

REGULATED ENTITY OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN LICENSES, ADHERE TO APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND BE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF VARIOUS REGULATORS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT THESE ACTIVITIES. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT HAS BEEN INCREASING, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF FINES AND PENALTIES IMPOSED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS AND NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION, INVESTIGATIONS

AND PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED FOR INFRACTIONS OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR ACTIVITIES.

GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDES INVESTMENT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY NATIONAL REGULATORS AS WELL AS THE EU. THESE INVESTMENT SERVICES ARE REGULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATIONAL LAWS, MANY OF WHICH IMPLEMENT EU DIRECTIVES, AND INCREASINGLY BY

DIRECTLY APPLICABLE EU REGULATIONS. THESE NATIONAL AND EU LAWS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS, CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND MARKET CONDUCT AND TRADE REPORTING RULES.

GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDES INVESTMENT SERVICES IN AND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM UNDER THE REGULATION OF THE PRA AND THE FCA. GSI, OUR REGULATED

U.K. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY, IS SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE PRA. OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL BANK (GSIB), OUR REGULATED U.K. BANK, ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE PRA AND THE FCA. AS OF

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN

THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. SINCE 2008, THESE CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, VERY NEGATIVELY. IN 2008 AND THROUGH

EARLY 2009, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SINCE 2011, CONCERNS ABOUT

EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM, AND ABOUT U.S. GROWTH AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING U.S. FEDERAL FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES, THE U.S. FEDERAL DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

HAVE RESULTED, AT TIMES, IN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY WHILE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY.

SINCE 2008,

GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. IN ADDITION, NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO

DEAL WITH WHAT REGULATORS, POLITICIANS AND OTHERS BELIEVE TO BE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES,

RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE, AND GENERALLY INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY. ADDITIONAL TAXES HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, IMPOSED ON US AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

AND ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ENGAGE. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGISLATION (INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT YET IN EFFECT; THEREFORE, THE EXACT IMPACT THAT THESE

REGULATIONS WILL HAVE ON OUR BUSINESSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR. CERTAIN OF THESE REGULATIONS HAVE OR WILL SOON COME INTO EFFECT, AND LIQUIDITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AND MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES ADJUST TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS.

NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO FACE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS DUE TO

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TAX REVENUES, PARTICULARLY FROM CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS INCREASED OUTLAYS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE COST OF STIMULUS PROGRAMS.

GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND MARKET ACTIVITIES, AND THE TIMING AND FINAL DETAILS OF REGULATORY REFORM, AS WELL AS A

LACK OF CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE RESULTING IN LARGE PART FROM SUCH UNCERTAINTY, CONTINUES TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT CLIENT ACTIVITY WHICH, TOGETHER WITH LOW LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON EQUITY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW 2007 LEVELS, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE POST-2008 ECONOMIC,

FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS (INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUTURE REGULATIONS) AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE MARKETS AND THE LEVEL OF CLIENT ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AND THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MINIMUM LIQUIDITY LEVELS AND LEVELS OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPE OF AND MANNER IN WHICH CERTAIN BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES MAY BE CARRIED OUT BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION RETURNS HAVE ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED FUNDING COSTS DUE IN PART TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF PERCEIVED GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE EVENT OF

FUTURE FINANCIAL CRISES.

THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE AND OTHER CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WILL HAVE A LONG-TERM

IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE FINAL INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW REGULATIONS, THE MANNER IN WHICH MARKETS, MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ADAPT TO THE NEW LANDSCAPE, AND THE

PREVAILING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A RISK THAT SUCH CHANGES WILL, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR-TERM, CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON EQUITY AT OUR FIRM AND AT

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES

OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CERTAINTY AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: CONCERNS ABOUT SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS; UNCERTAINTY IN U.S. FEDERAL FISCAL OR MONETARY POLICY, THE U.S.

FEDERAL DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT; UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND NATURE OF REGULATORY REFORMS; DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY

OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR

OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS, RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS, DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE

EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE) AND MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. THESE INCLUDE POSITIONS WE TAKE WHEN WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, OR COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, EQUITIES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND PRIVATE

EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY OR LEVERAGE RATIOS, INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS AND GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

IN OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY

PURCHASING SECURITIES IN A DECLINING MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE ASSET-BASED MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES IN

CONNECTION WITH OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL DECLINES, THE PARTY POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF FUNDING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF POSITIONS IS

DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED

CREDIT RISK TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING ADEQUATE COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS,

INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT, BY

ACCEPTING DEPOSITS AT OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BY ISSUING HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY

ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST,

THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR

TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR

LOSSES DUE SOLELY TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR ISSUE, WHICH MAY IN TURN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL RATIOS.

OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET

VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE

OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR CLIENTS, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS, ALSO INCREASES

RISK AS MEASURED BY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING THE

SIZE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING, BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL

ASSETS AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL

OF OUR RWAS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, BOTH OF WHICH IN TURN INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING,

CLIENT EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OTHER

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO THE U.S. DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT

MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY

AFFECT OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING VOLUMES OR HIGHER SPREADS

OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE

OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY

MAY INVEST THEM IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO EITHER GENERAL MARKET

CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS OR TO BENCHMARKS) BY FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL

ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS. THIS COULD AFFECT THE MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION OR THE COMMISSIONS AND NET SPREADS THAT WE EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED NOTES OR

DERIVATIVES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY

FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM MARKET-MAKING, INVESTING OR LENDING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES. MARKET CONDITIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING

HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009, AND TO SOME EXTENT SINCE 2011,

PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS WITH

ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. IN THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET

VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE POSITIONS THROUGH OUR

MARKET-MAKING OR ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OR WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR HEDGING, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE

FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE

INVESTMENTS.

PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, MAY CAUSE US TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO

COUNTERPARTIES, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKETS, WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING OR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR LIQUIDITY, PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS

THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD

PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE OFTEN COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS, AND THESE COMPLEX

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC

MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS.

FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN

PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN

SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US

TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. CERTAIN RATING AGENCIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE DODD-FRANK ACT COULD RESULT IN THE RATING AGENCIES REDUCING THEIR ASSUMED LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

AND THEREFORE RESULT IN RATINGS DOWNGRADES FOR CERTAIN LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, EACH OF STANDARD & POORS RATINGS SERVICES AND RATINGS AND INVESTMENT INFORMATION, INC. HAD ISSUED

A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK ON OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, IN THE EVENT OF A ONE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD HAVE CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS RELATED TO

OUR NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $911 MILLION AND $2.99 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF THE FIRM AT THE TIME

OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RATINGS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE

SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS, MARKET-DRIVEN, AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY

VOLATILE MOVEMENTS. OUR CREDIT SPREADS ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, ALTHOUGH VERY LARGE, HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND AT TIMES MAY LACK A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

DUE TO THE BROAD SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE REGULARLY ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER CLIENT, AS

WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN

ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

IN ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND

INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE VIEWED AS AFFILIATES OF OURS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG OUR BUSINESSES.

HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH US MAY

BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY, DISCLOSE AND DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR BROKER-DEALER AND

BANK SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. IN ADDITION, OUR

BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN

BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL

AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., INCLUDING UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS SOURCE OF STRENGTH POLICY, AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH

SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO

PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

AS A RESULT OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS INCREASED REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS. CONCERNS ABOUT PROTECTING CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY PERSONS OR ENTITIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ENTITIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS HAVE

CAUSED OR MAY CAUSE A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO RING FENCE SUCH ENTITIES IN ORDER TO PROTECT CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF SUCH ENTITIES IN THE EVENT OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES INVOLVING SUCH ENTITIES.

THE RESULT HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY AMONG OUR AFFILIATED ENTITIES, THEREBY INCREASING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIRED BY THE FIRM ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GSEC SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT ASSETS TO GS BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME

WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OWN OBLIGATIONS.

THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA TO

DEVELOP AND SUBMIT RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANS TO REGULATORS, AND THE INCORPORATION OF FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM REGULATORS, MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY LEVELS AT PARTICULAR SUBSIDIARIES OR OTHERWISE INCUR ADDITIONAL OR

DUPLICATIVE OPERATIONAL OR OTHER COSTS AT MULTIPLE ENTITIES, AND MAY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE GROUP INC. GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR RAISE DEBT AT GROUP INC. RESOLUTION PLANNING MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO STRUCTURE

OUR INTERCOMPANY AND EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE DEEM MOST OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL TAXES. ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN CAPITAL ACTIONS OR MAKE INTERCOMPANY DIVIDENDS OR PAYMENTS.

SEE

BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK

OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH

IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE

ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD, INCLUDING A DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY THIRD PARTIES TO SECURE THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO

US UNDER DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS AND LOAN AGREEMENTS, COULD RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF

OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS. DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS

TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING AND

PRIME BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENTS POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING,

UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES

IN OUR MARKET-MAKING, UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL REQUIRE ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES AND INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTION TO RETAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE THE COST TO US OF ENGAGING IN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER, ISSUER,

INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR GROUP OF RELATED COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE EU, AND A FAILURE OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH WE SET

LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES, COUNTERPARTIES AND COUNTRIES, WE ROUTINELY

EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT

CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE COUNTERPARTIES. PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT ARE EXPECTED TO LEAD TO INCREASED CENTRALIZATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR

CONCENTRATION OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS BOTH HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INTERRELATED.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO.

WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE. OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH

MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATIONS, IMPOSED

TAXES OR OTHERWISE PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT HAVE OR MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER OR AT ALL IN CERTAIN OR ALL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE

OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE. THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR RULES, MANY OF WHICH DO NOT APPLY TO ALL OUR U.S. OR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR

THE RISKS WE TAKE.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY INTERRELATED IN THAT A VERY SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AMONG MEMBERS OF THAT INDUSTRY. MANY TRANSACTIONS ARE SYNDICATED TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OFTEN COUNTERPARTIES IN TRANSACTIONS. THIS HAS LED TO CLAIMS BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND

REGULATORS THAT SUCH INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLUDED IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE MARKETS OR MARKET PRICES, INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS THAT ANTITRUST LAWS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. WHILE WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT

SUCH ACTIVITIES, ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY BY REGULATORS, CAN HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE REPUTATIONAL IMPACT AND, IF WE ARE FOUND TO HAVE ENGAGED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO LARGE FINES AND SETTLEMENTS, AND POTENTIALLY VERY

SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES, INCLUDING TREBLE DAMAGES.

WE FACE ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT WITH A

BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT

AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET

CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONTINUE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS AND INVEST IN NEW REGIONS, INCLUDING A WIDE RANGE OF EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS. FURTHERMORE, IN A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING WHERE WE MAKE MARKETS, INVEST AND LEND, WE

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN INTERESTS IN, OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS, TOLL ROADS AND SHIPPING PORTS, AS WELL AS PHYSICAL COMMODITIES, MINES, COMMODITY WAREHOUSES AND OTHER

COMMODITIES INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. DETERIORATING MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE DISTRESSED ASSETS AND WE MAY DETERMINE OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE

TO THESE TYPES OF ASSETS.

THESE ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED CREDIT-RELATED, MARKET, SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING

FROM ACCIDENTS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND NON-STANDARDIZED, WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE

PAYMENTS DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM. DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE RISK THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY

EXECUTED, THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY, OR THAT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE NETTED AGAINST OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, COUNTERPARTIES

MAY CLAIM THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS WERE NOT APPROPRIATE OR AUTHORIZED.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING SECONDARY BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR DURING ANY DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING CREDIT AND

OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS. THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT

REQUIRING CENTRAL CLEARING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVES, OR A MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

DEVELOP DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND TO HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE,

OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW TALENTED AND DIVERSE EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND

MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SUCH EMPLOYEES INCLUDE OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OUR REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITH A CULTURE OF FAIRLY HIRING, TRAINING AND PROMOTING

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRESENCE OR MORE

EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

CHANGES IN LAW OR REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED THAT

AFFECT TAXES ON OUR EMPLOYEES INCOME, OR THE AMOUNT OR COMPOSITION OF COMPENSATION, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS  REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION AND REGULATION 

COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT

TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE PRA, THE FCA, THE FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPOSED BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE

LEGISLATION OR REGULATION, MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN WAYS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION

AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS

A RESULT OF REGULATORS OR PRIVATE PARTIES CHALLENGING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. IN MANY CASES, OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO OVERLAPPING AND DIVERGENT REGULATION IN

DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS ON LEVERAGED LENDING OR OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, TAX BURDENS AND COMPENSATION

RESTRICTIONS, COULD BE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES, GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED

IN THE SAME WAY. IN ADDITION, REGULATION IMPOSED ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR MARKET PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY, SUCH AS TAXES ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LEVELS OF MARKET ACTIVITY MORE BROADLY, AND THUS IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT UNECONOMIC FOR US TO CONTINUE

TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING OUR BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR EMPLOYEES

TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND BASEL III,

HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER UNDER BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF

THE 2013 FORM 10-K, IN DECEMBER 2013, FINAL RULES WERE ADOPTED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE, WHICH WILL PROHIBIT PROPRIETARY TRADING AND WILL LIMIT OUR SPONSORSHIP OF, AND

INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS. BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, GIVEN

THAT THE RULE IS HIGHLY COMPLEX, AND ITS FULL IMPACT WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL MARKET PRACTICES ARE FULLY DEVELOPED, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE AND THE RELATED MARKET CHANGES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND EXPOSE US TO INCREASED

LIABILITY FOR INADVERTENT BREACHES AND REPORTING FAILURES. AMONG THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT MOST LIKELY TO AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES ARE: INCREASED CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; INCREASED REGULATION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON

OTC DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATIONS ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION; THE PROHIBITION ON ENGAGING IN CERTAIN SWAPS-BASED ACTIVITIES THROUGH AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION; LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS; REQUIREMENTS TO

REORGANIZE OR LIMIT ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANS; INCREASED DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS; AND INCREASED STANDARDS OF CARE FOR BROKER-DEALERS IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO UNDER BASEL III MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY IF THE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY, OR DO NOT APPLY EQUALLY, TO OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT

IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE FILED LAWSUITS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF RECORDING MORTGAGES AND DESIGNATING A COMMON ENTITY AS THE MORTGAGE HOLDER IS IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW, AND OTHER AUTHORITIES HAVE BROUGHT SIMILAR ACTIONS OR

INDICATED THAT THEY ARE CONTEMPLATING BRINGING SUCH ACTIONS. IF THIS SYSTEM AND RELATED PRACTICES ARE DEEMED INVALID, IT MAY CALL INTO QUESTION THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE HAVE PARTICIPATED, NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MARKET FOR MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND OUR MORTGAGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES, OR SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS OR PENALTIES.

INCREASINGLY, REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE SOUGHT TO HOLD FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIABLE FOR THE MISCONDUCT OF THEIR CLIENTS WHERE SUCH

REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE DETECTED THAT THE CLIENT WAS ENGAGED IN WRONGDOING, EVEN THOUGH THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAD NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY ITS CLIENT. REGULATORS

AND COURTS HAVE ALSO INCREASINGLY FOUND LIABILITY AS A CONTROL PERSON FOR ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR FUNDS CONTROLLED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN INVESTMENT, BUT WHICH THEY DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE. IN

ADDITION, REGULATORS AND COURTS CONTINUE TO SEEK TO ESTABLISH FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES TO WHICH NO SUCH DUTY HAD BEEN ASSUMED TO EXIST. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COST OF, AND LIABILITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH, ENGAGING IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, MARKET-MAKING, PRIME BROKERAGE, INVESTING AND OTHER SIMILAR ACTIVITIES COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR

NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH

RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO COMPENSATION, OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS ADVERSE STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. PRESS COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ASSERT SOME FORM OF WRONGDOING OFTEN

RESULT IN SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORS, LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS. RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING, IS TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE AND

CAN DIVERT THE TIME AND EFFORT OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO

COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO ADVANCE OR SUPPORT LEGISLATION TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ON

THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CERTAIN REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE SEC, HAVE ANNOUNCED POLICIES THAT MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THEY WILL SEEK AN ADMISSION OF

WRONGDOING AS PART OF ANY SETTLEMENT OF A MATTER BROUGHT BY THEM AGAINST A REGULATED ENTITY OR INDIVIDUAL, WHICH COULD LEAD TO INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CIVIL LITIGATION AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONS WITH SO-CALLED BAD ACTOR DISQUALIFICATION LAWS AND COULD HAVE OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR

OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND OCCUR AT VERY HIGH VOLUMES AND

FREQUENCIES, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY

STANDARDS.

AS OUR CLIENT BASE, AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS, AND THE VOLUME, SPEED, FREQUENCY AND COMPLEXITY OF

TRANSACTIONS, ESPECIALLY ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS (AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SUCH TRANSACTIONS ON A REAL-TIME BASIS TO CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND EXCHANGES) INCREASES, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING, AND THE RISK OF SYSTEMS OR HUMAN ERROR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS INCREASES. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED

AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO

SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN REGULATIONS AND MARKETS, AND INVEST HEAVILY IN SYSTEMIC CONTROLS AND TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS DO NOT VIOLATE APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS OR, DUE TO ERRORS IN

PROCESSING SUCH TRANSACTIONS, ADVERSELY AFFECT MARKETS, OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES OR THE FIRM.

SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND

UPDATES, AS WELL AS THE REQUISITE TRAINING, ENTAIL SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM WITH EXISTING ONES.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE INCREASINGLY FACE THE

RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT

CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL BE CLEARED ON EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION

OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER

AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, AND THE

INCREASED CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE,

TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY,

DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT

BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, SATELLITE, UNDERSEA CABLE OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS,

INTERNET, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES FACILITIES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED, TO NATURAL DISASTERS, WAR, CIVIL UNREST, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, PANDEMICS AND WEATHER

EVENTS.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, LONDON, BANGALORE,

HONG KONG, TOKYO AND SALT LAKE CITY, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE

NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA AND OUR TWO PRINCIPAL OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE NEW YORK AREA BOTH ARE LOCATED ON THE WATERFRONT OF THE HUDSON RIVER, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK

METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES, INCLUDING A TERRORIST ATTACK, EXTREME WEATHER EVENT OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENT, COULD VERY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO

OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. WE ARE REGULARLY THE TARGET OF ATTEMPTED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS, AND MUST CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR AND DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND

DATA FROM MISAPPROPRIATION OR CORRUPTION. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR

OTHER MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED

IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSACT WITH

US OR OTHERWISE RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE INCREASED USE OF MOBILE AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES CAN HEIGHTEN THESE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL RISKS. WE EXPECT TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS.

WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES AND PROTECT AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE,

SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE

INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY

ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH.

SEE NOTE 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED AND NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED

CLAIMS INCREASE FOLLOWING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE REDUCED OUR STAFF. ADDITIONALLY, GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ARE PLAINTIFFS IN CERTAIN OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, AND WE MAY FACE FUTURE ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BY THE SAME OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. RECENTLY, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENTS BY SEVERAL LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED. THE TREND OF LARGE SETTLEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OUTCOMES FOR

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN SIMILAR ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHERE GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE LARGE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE USED AS THE BASIS OR A TEMPLATE FOR OTHER SETTLEMENTS.

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TRADING TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH US, PARTICULARLY OUR EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING MARKETS COULD

CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE INVESTED

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE

RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR PHYSICAL

COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

WE ENGAGE IN, OR INVEST IN ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN, THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING AND TRADING OF NUMEROUS

COMMODITIES, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, METALS (BASE AND PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING URANIUM), EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES.

THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL, ANTITRUST AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR

QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT COULD INCREASE THE

OPERATING COSTS AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE

US TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, RENOVATION OF STORAGE FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES.

OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR

CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF TRANSPORT VESSELS, STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS, FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT

OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE

ON THEIR PART, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. ALSO, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE

INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM

PERFORMING UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS, MAY IMPAIR OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION, REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DIVEST OR DISCONTINUE CERTAIN OF THESE ACTIVITIES FOR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REASONS. IF THAT OCCURS, THE FIRM MAY

RECEIVE A VALUE THAT IS LESS THAN THE THEN CARRYING VALUE, AS THE FIRM MAY BE UNABLE TO EXIT THESE ACTIVITIES IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL,

OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND

MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF

HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE

WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT

NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES,

DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY, CIVIL UNREST OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE

CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WHILE BUSINESS AND OTHER PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DIFFER, OUR PRINCIPAL LEGAL

ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT IN THEIR OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE TO RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL PAYMENTS AND MONEY LAUNDERING, AS WELL AS LAWS RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE U.S.

FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND U.K. BRIBERY ACT. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED AND CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING, THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY OF OUR OPERATIONS, EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS

AND CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT WE DEAL WITH, GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF SUCH RULES OR REGULATIONS AND ANY SUCH VIOLATION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR REPUTATION.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES AROUND THE WORLD, INVOLVING ACTUAL OR

ALLEGED FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. THIS MISCONDUCT HAS INCLUDED AND MAY INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE THE THEFT OF PROPRIETARY

INFORMATION, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BEEN AND MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME

WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE

EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY (OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY), TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME TERRESTRIAL OR SOLAR WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, AND COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE IN EARLY STAGES,

AND MANY OF THESE CASES SEEK AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION, BUT MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD. GIVEN THE RANGE OF LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS PRESENTLY UNDER WAY, OUR LITIGATION EXPENSES CAN BE

ON MARCH 21, 2000, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD HAD APPROVED A REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PURSUANT TO WHICH UP TO 15 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

MAY BE REPURCHASED. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS INCREASED BY AN AGGREGATE OF 430 MILLION SHARES BY RESOLUTIONS OF OUR BOARD ADOPTED FROM JUNE 2001 THROUGH APRIL 2013. WE USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY THE FIRMS CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITION, BUT WHICH MAY

ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO SET EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION DATE. ANY REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD.

2.

INCLUDES 90,457 SHARES REMITTED BY EMPLOYEES TO SATISFY MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON EQUITY-BASED AWARDS THAT WERE DELIVERED TO EMPLOYEES DURING

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

THE FIRM GENERATED NET EARNINGS OF $8.04 BILLION FOR 2013,

COMPARED WITH $7.48 BILLION FOR 2012 AND $4.44 BILLION FOR 2011. OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $15.46 FOR 2013, COMPARED WITH $14.13 FOR 2012 AND $4.51 FOR 2011. RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

(ROE)

1

WAS 11.0% FOR 2013, COMPARED WITH 10.7% FOR

2012 AND 3.7% FOR 2011.

BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 5% TO $152.48 AND

TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE

2

INCREASED

APPROXIMATELY 7% TO $143.11 COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2012.

3

DURING THE YEAR, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 39.3 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL COST OF $6.17 BILLION, WHILE MAINTAINING STRONG CAPITAL LEVELS. OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 16.7%

AND OUR TIER 1 COMMON RATIO

4

WAS 14.6% AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 (IN EACH CASE UNDER BASEL I AND ALSO REFLECTING THE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013).

THE FIRM GENERATED NET REVENUES OF $34.21 BILLION FOR 2013. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING, AS WELL AS HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING

AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPARED WITH 2012. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES COMPARED WITH 2012.

AN OVERVIEW OF NET REVENUES FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS PROVIDED BELOW.

INVESTMENT BANKING

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING, DUE TO STRONG NET REVENUES IN BOTH EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING. NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED

WITH 2012, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY. NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2012.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES

NET

REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES IN BOTH FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES.

THE DECREASE IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION COMPARED WITH 2012 REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN

INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS COMPARED WITH A SOLID 2012, AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2012. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER, WHILE NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES WERE

ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2012. FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION OPERATED IN A GENERALLY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT DURING MUCH OF 2013, AS MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTY LED TO CHALLENGING MARKET-MAKING

CONDITIONS AND GENERALLY LOWER LEVELS OF ACTIVITY.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE DECREASE IN EQUITIES COMPARED WITH 2012 WAS DUE TO THE SALE OF OUR

AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS

1

IN 2013 AND THE SALE

OF OUR HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS IN 2012. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION (EXCLUDING NET REVENUES FROM OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS) WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CASH

PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN DERIVATIVES. COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012. SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2012, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF

OUR HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS IN 2012 (2012 INCLUDED A GAIN ON SALE OF $494 MILLION). DURING 2013, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY IN JAPAN AND THE U.S.,

AND GENERALLY LOWER VOLATILITY LEVELS.

THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON

BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS $296 MILLION ($220 MILLION AND $76 MILLION RELATED TO FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, RESPECTIVELY) FOR 2013, COMPARED

WITH A NET LOSS OF $714 MILLION ($433 MILLION AND $281 MILLION RELATED TO FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, RESPECTIVELY) FOR 2012.

INVESTING & LENDING

NET

REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, DRIVEN BY COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND STRONGER CORPORATE PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES. IN ADDITION, NET GAINS AND NET INTEREST INCOME FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER, WHILE OTHER NET REVENUES, RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2012.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION. DURING THE YEAR, TOTAL ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $77 BILLION TO $1.04 TRILLION. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $81 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF

$41 BILLION

2

, REFLECTING INFLOWS IN FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUTFLOWS IN ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT ASSETS. NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $40 BILLION DURING THE YEAR WAS PRIMARILY IN EQUITY ASSETS. LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS DECREASED $4 BILLION.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS. OUR RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD CAN BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY AND OTHER FACTORS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS, SEE CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES

BELOW, AS WELL AS RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

1.

IN APRIL 2013, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS AND NO LONGER CONSOLIDATE THIS BUSINESS. NET REVENUES

RELATED TO THE AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS WERE $317 MILLION FOR 2013 AND $1.08 BILLION FOR 2012. SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ABOUT THIS SALE.

2.

FIXED INCOME FLOWS FOR 2013 INCLUDE $10 BILLION IN ASSETS MANAGED BY THE FIRM RELATED TO OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS, IN WHICH A MAJORITY STAKE WAS

SOLD IN APRIL 2013, THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED FROM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION AS THEY WERE ASSETS OF A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP), ALTHOUGH GENERALLY RISING, APPEARED TO REMAIN SUBDUED IN

MOST MAJOR ECONOMIES. MARKET SENTIMENT IMPROVED IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES, SUPPORTED BY BETTER PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH PROSPECTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND IN THE EURO AREA, WHILE MONETARY POLICY GENERALLY REMAINED ACCOMMODATIVE.

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY REFLECTED FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING, EVEN THOUGH A REDUCTION IN FISCAL SPENDING WEIGHED ON GROWTH. THESE IMPROVEMENTS RESULTED IN TIGHTER CREDIT SPREADS, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL EQUITY

PRICES AND GENERALLY LOWER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY. HOWEVER, SIGNALS DURING THE YEAR FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE THAT IT WOULD BEGIN TAPERING ITS ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM CONTRIBUTED TO A RISE IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AND A MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT,

PARTICULARLY FOR EMERGING MARKETS. IN ADDITION, CONTINUED POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY, PARTICULARLY THE POLITICAL DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES SURROUNDING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND A POTENTIAL BREACH OF THE DEBT CEILING, GENERALLY RESULTED IN HEIGHTENED

RISK AVERSION. THESE CONCERNS ALSO WEIGHED ON INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY AS INDUSTRY-WIDE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2012. INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY IMPROVED AND INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT UNDERWRITING

ACTIVITY REMAINED SOLID. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW MARKET CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES BELOW AS WELL AS RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF

THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

GLOBAL

DURING 2013, REAL GDP GROWTH APPEARED TO DECLINE IN MANY ADVANCED ECONOMIES AND EMERGING MARKETS. IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES, THE SLOWDOWN PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECLINE IN FIXED INVESTMENT GROWTH IN THE UNITED

STATES AND CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE EURO AREA. IN EMERGING MARKETS, GROWTH IN DOMESTIC DEMAND DECREASED AND CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCES WORSENED. UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS DECLINED IN SOME ECONOMIES COMPARED WITH 2012, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, BUT

INCREASED IN OTHERS, PARTICULARLY IN THE EURO AREA.

THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT CONTINUED TO REMAIN ELEVATED IN MANY ADVANCED ECONOMIES. DURING 2013, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE, THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE BANK OF JAPAN EACH LEFT POLICY INTEREST RATES

UNCHANGED, WHILE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK REDUCED ITS POLICY INTEREST RATE. IN DECEMBER 2013, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BEGIN TO SCALE BACK ITS ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM BY $10 BILLION TO $75 BILLION PER MONTH.

THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED AGAINST BOTH THE EURO AND THE BRITISH POUND, WHILE IT STRENGTHENED SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN.

UNITED STATES

IN THE UNITED STATES, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.9% IN 2013, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 2.8% IN 2012. GROWTH DECELERATED ON

THE BACK OF A SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTION IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING AS A RESULT OF SEQUESTRATION, AS WELL AS A SLOWDOWN IN FIXED INVESTMENT. HOUSE PRICES, HOUSE SALES AND HOUSING STARTS INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE RISE IN U.S. BOND YIELDS DROVE

MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES HIGHER. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION EXPANDED IN 2013, BUT AT A SLOWER PACE THAN IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. ALTHOUGH POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LED TO SOME TEMPORARY DETERIORATION, BUSINESS AND CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE GENERALLY IMPROVED DURING THE YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. MEASURES OF INFLATION WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2012. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINED DURING 2013, BUT REMAINED ELEVATED. THE U.S. FEDERAL

RESERVE MAINTAINED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT A TARGET RANGE OF ZERO TO 0.25% DURING THE YEAR AND ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2013 A REDUCTION IN ITS MONTHLY PROGRAM TO PURCHASE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, THE

U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE AFFIRMED ITS COMMITMENT TO KEEP SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES EXCEPTIONALLY LOW FOR SOME TIME, EVEN AFTER THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLS TO 6.5% OR INFLATION RISES MATERIALLY. THE YIELD ON THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTE ROSE BY 126

BASIS POINTS DURING 2013 TO 3.04%. IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX, THE S&P 500 INDEX AND THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE INCREASED BY 38%, 30% AND 26%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2013.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EUROPE

IN THE EURO AREA, REAL GDP DECLINED BY 0.4% IN 2013, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF 0.6% IN 2012. THE CONTRACTION WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN DOMESTIC DEMAND, PRIMARILY REFLECTING FURTHER

DECLINES IN FIXED INVESTMENT AND CONSUMER SPENDING. BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS AND MEASURES OF CORE INFLATION DECELERATED FURTHER DURING THE YEAR. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REMAINED ELEVATED, PARTICULARLY IN ITALY AND SPAIN.

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN ITALY AND THE DEBT CRISIS IN CYPRUS TEMPORARILY INCREASED MARKET VOLATILITY EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHILE PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING CONDITIONS REMAINED VERY TIGHT IN PERIPHERY COUNTRIES. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, THE EUROPEAN

CENTRAL BANK DECREASED ITS MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS RATE BY 50 BASIS POINTS TO 0.25%, AND ADOPTED FORWARD GUIDANCE FOR THE FUTURE PATH OF INTEREST RATES AS A NEW PART OF ITS MONETARY POLICY TOOLS. THE EURO APPRECIATED BY 5% AGAINST THE U.S.

DOLLAR. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.8% IN 2013, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 0.3% IN 2012. THE BANK OF ENGLAND MAINTAINED ITS OFFICIAL BANK RATE AT 0.50% AND ALSO INTRODUCED FORWARD GUIDANCE FOR THE FUTURE PATH OF INTEREST RATES,

CONTINGENT ON THE EVOLUTION OF EMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION. THE BRITISH POUND APPRECIATED BY 2% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS GENERALLY INCREASED DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT IN THE PERIPHERY COUNTRIES WHERE YIELDS FELL. IN

EQUITY MARKETS, THE DAX INDEX, THE CAC 40 INDEX, THE EURO STOXX 50 INDEX AND THE FTSE 100 INDEX INCREASED BY 25%, 18%, 18% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2013.

ASIA

IN JAPAN, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.6% IN 2013, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 1.4%

IN 2012. GROWTH WAS SUPPORTED BY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN PRIVATE HOUSING INVESTMENT AND IN PUBLIC FIXED INVESTMENT. HOWEVER, THE TRADE BALANCE CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE DURING 2013. MEASURES OF INFLATION TURNED POSITIVE DURING THE YEAR, BUT REMAIN

FAR FROM THE BANK OF JAPANS NEWLY ADOPTED 2% INFLATION TARGET. IN ADDITION, THE BANK OF JAPAN, UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP, INTRODUCED A NEW PROGRAM OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MONETARY EASING, WHICH INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SIZE

AND MANDATE OF ITS ASSET PURCHASES, AS WELL AS A COMMITMENT TO A MORE TARGETED COMMUNICATION STRATEGY.

THE BANK OF JAPAN ALSO CHANGED ITS MAIN OPERATING TARGET FOR MONEY MARKET OPERATIONS FROM THE UNCOLLATERALIZED OVERNIGHT CALL RATE TO THE MONETARY BASE, WHICH IS SET TO INCREASE ANNUALLY BY

APPROXIMATELY

60-70 TRILLION

YEN. THE YIELD ON 10-YEAR JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS FELL BY 5 BASIS POINTS DURING THE YEAR TO 0.74%. THE JAPANESE YEN DEPRECIATED BY 21% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND, IN EQUITY

MARKETS, THE NIKKEI 225 INDEX INCREASED BY 57%. IN CHINA, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 7.7% IN 2013, BROADLY IN LINE WITH THE INCREASE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, ALTHOUGH IMPACTED BY LESS SUPPORTIVE MONETARY POLICIES AND TIGHTENING FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

MEASURES OF INFLATION REMAINED MODERATE AND THE PEOPLES BANK OF CHINA KEPT THE RESERVE REQUIREMENT RATIO UNCHANGED. THE CHINESE YUAN APPRECIATED BY 3% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND, IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX FELL BY 7%. IN

INDIA, REAL GDP INCREASED BY AN ESTIMATED 4.7% IN 2013, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 5.1% IN 2012. GROWTH DECELERATED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A FURTHER SOFTENING IN DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH AND ONLY SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE.

THE RATE OF WHOLESALE INFLATION DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2012. THE INDIAN RUPEE DEPRECIATED BY 12% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHILE, IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE BSE SENSEX INDEX INCREASED BY 9%. EQUITY MARKETS IN HONG KONG AND SOUTH KOREA WERE SLIGHTLY

HIGHER, AS THE HANG SENG INDEX INCREASED BY 3% AND THE KOSPI COMPOSITE INDEX INCREASED BY 1% DURING 2013.

OTHER MARKETS

IN BRAZIL, REAL GDP INCREASED BY AN ESTIMATED 2.2% IN 2013, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 1.0% IN 2012. GROWTH ACCELERATED ON THE BACK OF

INCREASING DOMESTIC DEMAND AND FIXED INVESTMENT. THE BRAZILIAN REAL DEPRECIATED BY 15% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND, IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE BOVESPA INDEX DECREASED BY 15% DURING 2013. IN RUSSIA, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.3% IN 2013, COMPARED WITH AN

INCREASE OF 3.4% IN 2012. THIS SLOWDOWN PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECLINE IN DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH AND A CONTRACTION IN INVESTMENT GROWTH, PARTICULARLY DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. THE RUSSIAN RUBLE DEPRECIATED BY 8% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHILE,

IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE MICEX INDEX INCREASED BY 2% DURING 2013.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE (I.E., INVENTORY), AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, ARE

REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT FAIR VALUE (I.E., MARKED-TO-MARKET), WITH RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WE MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

AS A PORTFOLIO (I.E., BASED ON ITS NET EXPOSURE TO MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISKS). IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE HIERARCHY UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) GIVES (I) THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES

IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 INPUTS), (II) THE NEXT PRIORITY TO INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY (LEVEL 2 INPUTS), AND

(III) THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED IN MARKET ACTIVITY (LEVEL 3 INPUTS). ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE

PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD

REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE FOR FACTORS SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE.

INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE THOSE WHICH

REQUIRE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, LEVEL 3 ASSETS REPRESENTED 4.4% AND 5.0%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, INSTRUMENTS

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION DATE, WE USE OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR

VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT. ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE. THESE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.



DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND/OR MODEL FOR EACH TYPE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT;



DETERMINING MODEL INPUTS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICES EVIDENCED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INTEREST

RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS; AND



DETERMINING APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ILLIQUIDITY OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY.

REGARDLESS OF THE METHODOLOGY, VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

MARKET MAKERS AND INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRICING OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. OUR CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS

AND IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY VALUED AT MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN SITUATIONS WHERE ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

REQUIRES JUDGMENT (E.G., CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES OR TRADE COMPARISON, AS DESCRIBED BELOW), THE FINAL VALUATION DECISION IS MADE BY SENIOR MANAGERS IN CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS. THIS

INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE PROPERLY VALUED.

PRICE VERIFICATION.

ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE SUBJECT TO OUR INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF PRICE VERIFICATION IS TO HAVE AN

INFORMED AND INDEPENDENT OPINION WITH REGARD TO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UNDER REVIEW. INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS WHICH CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL MARKET DATA ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. PRICE VERIFICATION STRATEGIES UTILIZED BY OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE.



TRADE COMPARISON.

ANALYSIS OF TRADE

DATA (BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL WHERE AVAILABLE) IS USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT PRICING INPUTS AND VALUATIONS.



EXTERNAL PRICE COMPARISON.

VALUATIONS AND PRICES ARE COMPARED TO PRICING DATA OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES (E.G., BROKER OR DEALERS, MARKIT, BLOOMBERG, IDC, TRACE). DATA OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES IS COMPARED TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY. WHEN BROKER OR DEALER

QUOTATIONS OR THIRD-PARTY PRICING VENDORS ARE USED FOR VALUATION OR PRICE VERIFICATION, GREATER PRIORITY IS GENERALLY GIVEN TO EXECUTABLE QUOTATIONS.



CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES.

MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE VALUATION OF POSITIONS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, RISKS AND COMPONENTS.



RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES.

MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE SIMILARITY, MEASURED IN TERMS OF RISK, LIQUIDITY AND RETURN, OF ONE INSTRUMENT RELATIVE TO ANOTHER OR, FOR A GIVEN INSTRUMENT, OF ONE MATURITY RELATIVE TO ANOTHER.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. GOODWILL IS ASSESSED ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST, BY FIRST ASSESSING QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT

IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST WOULD BE PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, WE ASSESSED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

JUDGMENTS AND TO EVALUATE SEVERAL FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDED, BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO, MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATIONS, COST FACTORS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, ENTITY-SPECIFIC EVENTS, EVENTS AFFECTING REPORTING UNITS

AND SUSTAINED CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF THESE FACTORS, WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED ITS RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNT, AND THEREFORE, WE

DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AND THAT A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED.

IF WE

EXPERIENCE A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OR FINANCIAL MARKETS, OUR GOODWILL COULD BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CRITICAL INPUTS OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST (E.G., COST OF EQUITY)

COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS TO DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN THE FUTURE.

SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR GOODWILL.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE

AMORTIZE OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED LIVES OR BASED ON ECONOMIC USAGE FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES-RELATED INTANGIBLES. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013

FORM 10-K

FOR THE CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY MAJOR ASSET CLASS.

A

PROLONGED PERIOD OF MARKET WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REGULATION COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING WEAKER BUSINESS PERFORMANCE RESULTING IN A DECREASE IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND DECREASES IN REVENUES FROM COMMODITIES-RELATED CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE

WHETHER INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT HAVE OCCURRED, AND TO TEST INTANGIBLES FOR IMPAIRMENT IF REQUIRED.

AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS, GENERALLY CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE TOTAL OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN

THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

USE OF ESTIM

ATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR

POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS IN

EXCESS OF THE RELATED RESERVES FOR LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS WHERE THE FIRM BELIEVES THE RISK OF LOSS IS MORE THAN SLIGHT. SEE NOTES 18 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR

INFORMATION ON CERTAIN JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY

ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

PROGRESS OF EACH CASE OR PROCEEDING, OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN SIMILAR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF LEGAL COUNSEL.

IN ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF TAX AUDITS TO THE EXTENT THAT UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS FAIL TO MEET THE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER

FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 740. SEE NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

NET REVENUES

2013 VERSUS 2012.

NET REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE

$34.21 BILLION FOR 2013, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2012. 2013 INCLUDED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES, AS WELL AS HIGHER OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES. IN ADDITION,

COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER MARKET-MAKING REVENUES AND LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME COMPARED WITH 2012.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

NET REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE

$34.16 BILLION FOR 2012, 19% HIGHER THAN 2011, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES, AS WELL AS HIGHER MARKET-MAKING REVENUES, INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES COMPARED WITH

2011. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME AND LOWER COMMISSIONS AND FEES COMPARED WITH 2011.

NON-INTEREST REVENUES

INVESTMENT BANKING

DURING 2013, INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES REFLECTED AN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, AS GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY REMAINED SOLID, AND INCLUDED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVERAGED

FINANCE ACTIVITY, AS INTEREST RATES REMAINED LOW. HOWEVER, ONGOING MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUED TO WEIGH ON INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY AS INDUSTRY-WIDE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2012. IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS

CONTINUE AND RESULT IN LOWER LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY, INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2013 VERSUS 2012.

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $6.00 BILLION FOR 2013, 22% HIGHER THAN 2012, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING, DUE TO STRONG REVENUES IN BOTH EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING.

REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012,

PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY. REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2012.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $4.94 BILLION FOR 2012, 13% HIGHER THAN 2011, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING, DUE TO STRONG

REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING. REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2011, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER REVENUES FROM INVESTMENT-GRADE AND LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY. REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE LOWER COMPARED

WITH 2011, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2011.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

DURING 2013, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES REFLECTED AN

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED ASSET PRICES, PARTICULARLY IN EQUITIES, RESULTING IN APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE MIX OF AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION SHIFTED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2012

FROM LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS TO LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME ASSETS. IN THE FUTURE, IF ASSET PRICES WERE TO DECLINE, OR INVESTORS FAVOR ASSET CLASSES THAT TYPICALLY GENERATE LOWER FEES OR

INVESTORS WITHDRAW THEIR ASSETS, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, CONTINUED CONCERNS ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK COULD RESULT IN DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION.

2013 VERSUS 2012.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $5.19 BILLION FOR 2013, 5% HIGHER THAN 2012, REFLECTING HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $4.97 BILLION FOR 2012, 6% HIGHER THAN 2011, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY LOWER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES

DURING 2013,

COMMISSIONS AND FEES REFLECTED AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY VOLUMES IN LISTED CASH EQUITIES IN ASIA AND EUROPE AND LOWER AVERAGE DAILY VOLUMES IN LISTED CASH EQUITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, AND GENERALLY LOWER VOLATILITY

LEVELS COMPARED WITH 2012. IF MARKET VOLUMES WERE TO DECLINE, COMMISSIONS AND FEES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2013 VERSUS 2012.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $3.26 BILLION FOR 2013, SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 2012, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES IN ASIA AND EUROPE. DURING 2013, OUR AVERAGE DAILY VOLUMES WERE HIGHER IN

MARKET MAKING

MARKET

MAKING IS COMPRISED OF REVENUES (EXCLUDING NET INTEREST) FROM CLIENT EXECUTION ACTIVITIES RELATED TO MAKING MARKETS IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGES, CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITY PRODUCTS. MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES

ARE INCLUDED IN OUR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT.

DURING 2013, MARKET-MAKING REVENUES REFLECTED A CHALLENGING

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT THAT REQUIRED CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT OF THE OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHEN THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE WOULD BEGIN TAPERING ITS ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM, AS WELL AS CONSTANT GLOBAL POLITICAL RISK AND

UNCERTAINTY, WERE INTERSPERSED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AS A RESULT, OUR CLIENTS RISK APPETITE AND ACTIVITY LEVELS FLUCTUATED DURING 2013. COMPARED WITH 2012, ACTIVITY LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOWER,

GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AND CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED. IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUE OVER THE LONG TERM, MARKET-MAKING REVENUES WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2013 VERSUS 2012.

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $9.37 BILLION FOR 2013, 17% LOWER THAN 2012. THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES IN EQUITY PRODUCTS, MORTGAGES AND INTEREST

RATE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS LOWER REVENUES IN CURRENCIES. THE DECREASE IN EQUITY PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO THE SALE OF OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN 2013, THE SALE OF OUR HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS IN 2012 (2012 INCLUDED A GAIN ON SALE OF

$494 MILLION) AND LOWER REVENUES IN DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN CASH PRODUCTS COMPARED WITH 2012. REVENUES IN COMMODITIES WERE HIGHER, WHILE REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED

WITH 2012. IN DECEMBER 2013, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN OUR EUROPEAN INSURANCE BUSINESS AND RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF $211 MILLION.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE

$11.35 BILLION FOR 2012, 22% HIGHER THAN 2011, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN MORTGAGES AND HIGHER REVENUES IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CREDIT PRODUCTS AND EQUITY CASH PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

REVENUES IN COMMODITIES. IN ADDITION, MARKET-MAKING

REVENUES INCLUDED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN SECURITIES SERVICES COMPARED WITH 2011, REFLECTING A GAIN OF $494 MILLION ON THE SALE OF OUR HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS.

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS IS COMPRISED OF REVENUES (EXCLUDING NET INTEREST) FROM OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND THE ORIGINATION OF LOANS TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO CLIENTS. IN ADDITION,

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS INCLUDES REVENUES RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS. OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT.

DURING 2013, OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES GENERALLY REFLECTED FAVORABLE COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND STRONG CORPORATE PERFORMANCE,

AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES AND TIGHTER CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS. HOWEVER, CONCERNS ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND UNCERTAINTY OVER FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE GLOBAL

MARKETPLACE. IF EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE OR CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN, OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2013 VERSUS 2012.

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS WERE $6.99 BILLION FOR 2013, 19% HIGHER THAN 2012, REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, DRIVEN BY COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND STRONGER CORPORATE PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES. IN ADDITION, NET GAINS FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER, WHILE REVENUES RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2012.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

OTHER

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $5.87 BILLION FOR 2012 COMPARED WITH $1.51 BILLION FOR 2011. THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2011 REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN

EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIMARILY IN PUBLIC EQUITIES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES DURING 2012 AFTER EQUITY PRICES IN EUROPE AND ASIA DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING 2011. NET GAINS FROM EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDED A

GAIN IN 2012 AND A LOSS IN 2011 RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA LIMITED (ICBC). THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2011 ALSO REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET GAINS FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND

LOANS, PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF HEDGES, IN 2011 AND THE IMPACT OF A MORE FAVORABLE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AS CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED DURING

2012 AFTER WIDENING DURING 2011. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2013 VERSUS 2012.

OPERATING EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $22.47 BILLION FOR 2013, 2% LOWER THAN 2012. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE

$12.61 BILLION FOR 2013, 3% LOWER COMPARED WITH $12.94 BILLION FOR 2012. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2013 WAS 36.9% COMPARED WITH 37.9% FOR 2012. TOTAL STAFF INCREASED 2% DURING 2013.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $9.86 BILLION FOR 2013, 2% LOWER THAN 2012. THE DECREASE

COMPARED WITH 2012 INCLUDED A DECLINE IN INSURANCE RESERVES, REFLECTING THE SALE OF OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS, AND A DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND LOWER OPERATING

EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSES, DUE TO HIGHER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, AND HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION

FEES. NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS FOR 2013 WERE $962 MILLION (PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS) COMPARED WITH $448 MILLION FOR 2012 (INCLUDING A SETTLEMENT WITH THE BOARD OF

GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) REGARDING THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW). 2013 INCLUDED A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION OF $155 MILLION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND. COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED TO

FUND THIS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES. THE FIRM ASKS ITS PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POTENTIAL CHARITABLE RECIPIENTS FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

OPERATING EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $22.96 BILLION FOR 2012, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2011. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $12.94 BILLION FOR

2012, 6% HIGHER COMPARED WITH $12.22 BILLION FOR 2011. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2012 WAS 37.9%, COMPARED WITH 42.4% FOR 2011. TOTAL STAFF DECREASED 3% DURING 2012.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE

$10.01 BILLION FOR 2012, 4% LOWER COMPARED WITH 2011. THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH 2011 PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, LOWER OCCUPANCY EXPENSES AND A DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

EXPENSES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. IN ADDITION, MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2011, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF EXPENSE REDUCTION INITIATIVES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER OTHER EXPENSES AND INCREASED INSURANCE RESERVES RELATED TO OUR REINSURANCE BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSES COMPARED WITH 2011 PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND HIGHER

CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WERE $448 MILLION DURING 2012 (INCLUDING A SETTLEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGARDING THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW) COMPARED WITH

$175 MILLION FOR 2011. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $225 MILLION DURING 2012, INCLUDING $159 MILLION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND, AND $10 MILLION TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION, COMPARED WITH

$163 MILLION DURING 2011, INCLUDING $78 MILLION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES AND $25 MILLION TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION. COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED TO FUND THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES. THE FIRM ASKS ITS

PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POTENTIAL CHARITABLE RECIPIENTS FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

PROVISION FOR TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2013 WAS 31.5%, DOWN FROM 33.3% FOR 2012. THE DECREASE FROM 33.3% TO 31.5% WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO A DETERMINATION THAT CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS WILL BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED ABROAD.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

2012 WAS 33.3%, UP FROM 28.0% FOR 2011. THE INCREASE FROM 28.0% TO 33.3% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EARNINGS MIX AND A DECREASE IN THE IMPACT OF PERMANENT BENEFITS.

THE RULES RELATED TO THE DEFERRAL OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN NON-REPATRIATED ACTIVE FINANCING INCOME EXPIRED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2013. THIS CHANGE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 2014.

2013 VERSUS 2012.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WERE $6.00 BILLION FOR 2013, 22% HIGHER THAN 2012.

NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE $1.98 BILLION, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2012. NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING WERE $4.03 BILLION, 36% HIGHER THAN 2012, DUE TO STRONG NET REVENUES

IN BOTH EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING. NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY.

DURING 2013, INVESTMENT BANKING

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, AS GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY REMAINED SOLID, AND INCLUDED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY, AS INTEREST RATES REMAINED LOW. HOWEVER, ONGOING MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUED TO WEIGH ON INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY AS INDUSTRY-WIDE MERGERS

AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2012. IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUE AND RESULT IN LOWER LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

DURING 2013, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM

BOTH POTENTIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS AND POTENTIAL UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS. THE INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING REFLECTS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL EQUITY UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS,

AND HIGHER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL DEBT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS, PRINCIPALLY FROM LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF OUR FUTURE NET

REVENUES FROM INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE REVENUE REALIZATION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. WE BELIEVE CHANGES IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG MAY BE A USEFUL INDICATOR OF CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS WHICH, OVER

THE LONG TERM, IMPACT OUR NET REVENUES. HOWEVER, THE TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETION AND CORRESPONDING REVENUE RECOGNITION OF TRANSACTIONS IN OUR BACKLOG VARIES BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE ASSIGNMENT, AS CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MAY REMAIN IN OUR BACKLOG FOR

LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND OTHERS MAY ENTER AND LEAVE WITHIN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, OUR TRANSACTION BACKLOG IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT INDIVIDUAL CLIENT TRANSACTIONS WILL OCCUR

IN THE FUTURE. TRANSACTIONS MAY BE CANCELLED OR MODIFIED, AND TRANSACTIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE MAY ALSO OCCUR.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.48 BILLION FOR 2013, 4% HIGHER THAN 2012, DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, PRIMARILY

RESULTING FROM HIGHER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $2.53 BILLION IN 2013, 58% HIGHER THAN 2012.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WERE $4.93 BILLION FOR 2012, 13% HIGHER THAN 2011.

NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE $1.98 BILLION, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2011. NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING WERE

$2.95 BILLION, 25% HIGHER THAN 2011, DUE TO STRONG NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2011, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER NET REVENUES FROM INVESTMENT-GRADE AND LEVERAGED

FINANCE ACTIVITY. NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2011, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS.

DURING 2012, INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY

CONTINUED CONCERNS ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. THESE CONCERNS WEIGHED ON INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY, AS COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2011, AND EQUITY AND EQUITY-RELATED

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY REMAINED LOW, PARTICULARLY IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. HOWEVER, INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY IMPROVED COMPARED WITH 2011, AS CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED AND INTEREST RATES REMAINED LOW.

DURING 2012, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG INCREASED DUE TO AN INCREASE IN POTENTIAL DEBT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LEVERAGED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS, AND AN INCREASE IN POTENTIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN POTENTIAL EQUITY UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2011,

REFLECTING UNCERTAINTY IN MARKET CONDITIONS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.33 BILLION FOR 2012, 11% HIGHER THAN 2011,

DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HIGHER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $1.60 BILLION IN 2012, 17% HIGHER THAN 2011.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES

OUR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF.

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION.

INCLUDES CLIENT EXECUTION ACTIVITIES RELATED TO MAKING MARKETS IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGES, CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES.

WE GENERATE MARKET-MAKING REVENUES IN THESE ACTIVITIES IN THREE WAYS.



IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS (SUCH AS MARKETS FOR U.S. TREASURY BILLS OR CERTAIN MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES), WE EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS (SUCH AS MID-CAP CORPORATE BONDS, GROWTH MARKET CURRENCIES OR CERTAIN NON-AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES), WE EXECUTE

TRANSACTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS FOR SPREADS AND FEES THAT ARE GENERALLY SOMEWHAT LARGER.



WE ALSO STRUCTURE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING CUSTOMIZED OR TAILOR-MADE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS RISK EXPOSURES, INVESTMENT

OBJECTIVES OR OTHER COMPLEX NEEDS (SUCH AS A JET FUEL HEDGE FOR AN AIRLINE).

GIVEN THE FOCUS ON THE MORTGAGE

MARKET, OUR MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.

OUR ACTIVITIES IN MORTGAGES INCLUDE COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES, LOANS AND DERIVATIVES, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES, LOANS AND DERIVATIVES (INCLUDING U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY-ISSUED COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, OTHER PRIME, SUBPRIME AND ALT-A SECURITIES AND LOANS),

AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, LOANS AND DERIVATIVES.

WE BUY, HOLD AND SELL LONG AND SHORT MORTGAGE POSITIONS,

PRIMARILY FOR MARKET MAKING FOR OUR CLIENTS. OUR INVENTORY THEREFORE CHANGES BASED ON CLIENT DEMANDS AND IS GENERALLY HELD FOR SHORT-TERM PERIODS.

SEE NOTES 18 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT EXPOSURE TO MORTGAGE REPURCHASE REQUESTS, MORTGAGE

EQUITIES.

INCLUDES CLIENT EXECUTION ACTIVITIES RELATED TO MAKING MARKETS IN EQUITY PRODUCTS AND COMMISSIONS AND FEES FROM EXECUTING AND CLEARING INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND

FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE, AS WELL AS OVER-THE-COUNTER TRANSACTIONS. EQUITIES ALSO INCLUDES OUR SECURITIES SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES FINANCING, SECURITIES LENDING AND OTHER PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING HEDGE

NET REVENUES IN FIXED

INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION WERE $8.65 BILLION FOR 2013, 13% LOWER THAN 2012, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS COMPARED WITH A SOLID 2012, AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN

MORTGAGES COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2012. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS AND MORTGAGES PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF A MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AND LOWER ACTIVITY LEVELS COMPARED WITH 2012. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES WERE

SLIGHTLY LOWER, WHILE NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2012. IN DECEMBER 2013, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN OUR EUROPEAN INSURANCE BUSINESS AND RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF

$211 MILLION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES WERE $7.07 BILLION FOR 2013, 14% LOWER COMPARED WITH 2012, DUE TO THE SALE OF OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS

1

IN 2013 AND THE SALE OF OUR HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS IN

2012. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION (EXCLUDING NET REVENUES FROM OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS) WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CASH PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET

REVENUES IN DERIVATIVES. COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2012, REFLECTING HIGHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES IN ASIA AND EUROPE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMMISSIONS AND FEES IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR AVERAGE DAILY VOLUMES DURING

2013 WERE HIGHER IN ASIA AND EUROPE AND LOWER IN THE UNITED STATES COMPARED WITH 2012, CONSISTENT WITH LISTED CASH EQUITY MARKET VOLUMES. SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2012, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF OUR

HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS IN 2012 (2012 INCLUDED A GAIN ON SALE OF $494 MILLION). DURING 2013, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY IN JAPAN AND THE U.S., AND

GENERALLY LOWER VOLATILITY LEVELS.

THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS $296 MILLION ($220 MILLION AND $76 MILLION RELATED TO FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, RESPECTIVELY) FOR 2013, COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF

$714 MILLION ($433 MILLION AND $281 MILLION RELATED TO FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, RESPECTIVELY) FOR 2012.

DURING 2013, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES OPERATED IN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT THAT REQUIRED CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT OF THE OUTLOOK FOR

THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHEN THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE WOULD BEGIN TAPERING ITS ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM, AS WELL AS CONSTANT GLOBAL POLITICAL RISK AND UNCERTAINTY, WERE INTERSPERSED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY OVER THE

COURSE OF THE YEAR. AS A RESULT, OUR CLIENTS RISK APPETITE AND ACTIVITY LEVELS FLUCTUATED DURING 2013. COMPARED WITH 2012, ACTIVITY LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOWER, GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AND CREDIT SPREADS

TIGHTENED. IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUE OVER THE LONG TERM, NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $11.78 BILLION FOR 2013, 6% LOWER THAN 2012, DUE TO DECREASED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM LOWER NET REVENUES, AND LOWER EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN APRIL 2013. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS, AND HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $3.94 BILLION IN 2013,

30% LOWER THAN 2012.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WERE $18.12 BILLION FOR 2012, 5% HIGHER THAN 2011.

NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION WERE $9.91 BILLION FOR 2012, 10% HIGHER THAN 2011. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED STRONG NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES, WHICH WERE

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2011 IN BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS WERE SOLID AND HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2011. THE INCREASE IN MORTGAGES, CREDIT PRODUCTS AND

INTEREST RATES PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING TIGHTER CREDIT SPREADS, COMPARED WITH 2011. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES AND SLIGHTLY LOWER NET

REVENUES IN CURRENCIES. THE DECREASE IN COMMODITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED MORE CHALLENGING MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS, IN PART DRIVEN BY LOWER LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY.

IN APRIL 2013, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS AND NO LONGER CONSOLIDATE THIS BUSINESS. NET REVENUES

HIGHER THAN 2011, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RESULTS IN CASH PRODUCTS, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER COMMISSIONS AND FEES, REFLECTING DECLINES IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE

DURING 2012, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY CONTINUED BROAD MARKET CONCERNS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, ALTHOUGH POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS HELPED TO IMPROVE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDED CERTAIN CENTRAL BANK ACTIONS TO EASE MONETARY POLICY AND ADDRESS FUNDING RISKS FOR EUROPEAN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE U.S.

ECONOMY POSTED STABLE TO IMPROVING ECONOMIC DATA, INCLUDING FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. THESE IMPROVEMENTS RESULTED IN TIGHTER CREDIT SPREADS, HIGHER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES AND LOWER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY. HOWEVER, CONCERNS

ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND CONTINUED POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY, PARTICULARLY THE POLITICAL DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES SURROUNDING THE FISCAL CLIFF, GENERALLY RESULTED IN CLIENT RISK AVERSION AND LOWER ACTIVITY LEVELS. ALSO,

UNCERTAINTY OVER FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM PERSISTED.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $12.48 BILLION FOR 2012, 3% LOWER THAN 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, AND LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $5.64 BILLION IN 2012, 27% HIGHER

THAN 2011.

INVESTING & LENDING

INVESTING & LENDING INCLUDES OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND THE ORIGINATION OF LOANS TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO CLIENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED, AND LOANS ARE TYPICALLY

LONGER-TERM IN NATURE. WE MAKE INVESTMENTS, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE, IN DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND REAL ESTATE ENTITIES.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE $7.02 BILLION FOR 2013, 19% HIGHER THAN 2012, REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, DRIVEN BY

COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND STRONGER CORPORATE PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES. IN ADDITION, NET GAINS AND NET INTEREST INCOME FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER, WHILE OTHER NET REVENUES, RELATED

TO OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2012. IF EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE OR CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN, NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.68 BILLION FOR 2013, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2012. OPERATING EXPENSES DURING 2013 INCLUDED

LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUES COMPARED WITH 2012. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $4.33 BILLION IN

2012 VERSUS 2011.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE $5.89 BILLION FOR 2012 COMPARED WITH $2.14 BILLION FOR 2011. THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2011 REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET GAINS FROM

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIMARILY IN PUBLIC EQUITIES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES DURING 2012 AFTER EQUITY PRICES IN EUROPE AND ASIA DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING 2011. NET GAINS FROM EQUITY

SECURITIES INCLUDED A GAIN OF $408 MILLION IN 2012 AND A LOSS OF $517 MILLION IN 2011 RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC. THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2011 ALSO REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET GAINS FROM DEBT

SECURITIES AND LOANS, PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF HEDGES, IN 2011 AND THE IMPACT OF A MORE FAVORABLE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AS CREDIT SPREADS

TIGHTENED DURING 2012 AFTER WIDENING DURING 2011. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OTHER NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.67 BILLION FOR 2012, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2011. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $3.23 BILLION IN 2012, COMPARED WITH A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $531 MILLION

IN 2011.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND OFFERS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS (PRIMARILY THROUGH SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND COMMINGLED VEHICLES, SUCH AS MUTUAL FUNDS AND PRIVATE

INVESTMENT FUNDS) ACROSS ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES TO A DIVERSE SET OF INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ALSO OFFERS WEALTH ADVISORY SERVICES, INCLUDING PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL COUNSELING, AND BROKERAGE AND OTHER

TRANSACTION SERVICES TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES.

ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCLUDE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AND OTHER CLIENT ASSETS. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT INCLUDE CLIENT ASSETS WHERE WE EARN A FEE FOR MANAGING ASSETS ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS. THIS INCLUDES NET ASSETS IN OUR MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, CREDIT FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS (INCLUDING REAL

ESTATE FUNDS), AND SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS. OTHER CLIENT ASSETS INCLUDE CLIENT ASSETS INVESTED WITH THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS, BANK DEPOSITS AND ADVISORY RELATIONSHIPS WHERE WE EARN A FEE FOR ADVISORY AND

OTHER SERVICES, BUT DO NOT HAVE INVESTMENT DISCRETION. ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION DO NOT INCLUDE THE SELF-DIRECTED BROKERAGE ASSETS OF OUR CLIENTS. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION REPRESENT ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS.

LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS REPRESENT MONEY MARKETS AND BANK DEPOSIT ASSETS.

ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION TYPICALLY GENERATE FEES AS A

PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSET VALUE, WHICH VARY BY ASSET CLASS AND ARE AFFECTED BY INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS ASSET INFLOWS AND REDEMPTIONS. ASSET CLASSES SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND EQUITY ASSETS TYPICALLY GENERATE HIGHER FEES RELATIVE TO

FIXED INCOME AND LIQUIDITY PRODUCT ASSETS. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE (WHICH EXCLUDES NON-ASSET-BASED FEES) WE EARNED ON OUR ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION WAS 40 BASIS POINTS FOR 2013, 39 BASIS POINTS FOR 2012 AND 41 BASIS POINTS FOR 2011.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS OR A

SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS RETURN, OR WHEN THE RETURN EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED BENCHMARK OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGETS. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN ALL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES ARE RESOLVED.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2013 VERSUS 2012.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE $5.46 BILLION FOR 2013, 5% HIGHER THAN 2012, REFLECTING HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION. DURING

THE YEAR, TOTAL ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $77 BILLION TO $1.04 TRILLION. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $81 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $41 BILLION

1

, REFLECTING INFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY OUTFLOWS IN ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT ASSETS. NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $40 BILLION DURING THE YEAR WAS PRIMARILY IN EQUITY ASSETS. LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS DECREASED $4 BILLION.

DURING 2013, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED ASSET PRICES, PARTICULARLY IN EQUITIES,

RESULTING IN APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE MIX OF AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION SHIFTED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2012 FROM LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS TO LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN EQUITY

AND FIXED INCOME ASSETS. IN THE FUTURE, IF ASSET PRICES WERE TO DECLINE, OR INVESTORS FAVOR ASSET CLASSES THAT TYPICALLY GENERATE LOWER FEES OR INVESTORS WITHDRAW THEIR ASSETS, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, CONTINUED CONCERNS ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK COULD RESULT IN DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $4.35 BILLION FOR 2013, UP SLIGHTLY COMPARED TO 2012, DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HIGHER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE

$1.11 BILLION IN 2013, 20% HIGHER THAN 2012.

2012 VERSUS 2011.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE $5.22 BILLION FOR 2012, 4% HIGHER THAN 2011, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER TRANSACTION REVENUES AND SLIGHTLY LOWER

MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES. DURING 2012, ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $70 BILLION TO $965 BILLION. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $67 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $18 BILLION

2

, REFLECTING INFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

OUTFLOWS IN EQUITY ASSETS. NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $49 BILLION DURING 2012 WAS PRIMARILY IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS. IN ADDITION, LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS INCREASED $3 BILLION.

DURING 2012, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED ASSET PRICES, RESULTING IN APPRECIATION

IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION SHIFTED SLIGHTLY FROM ASSET CLASSES THAT TYPICALLY GENERATE HIGHER FEES, PRIMARILY EQUITY AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT ASSETS, TO ASSET CLASSES THAT TYPICALLY GENERATE

LOWER FEES, PRIMARILY FIXED INCOME ASSETS, COMPARED WITH 2011.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $4.29 BILLION FOR 2012, 7% HIGHER THAN 2011, DUE TO INCREASED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $928 MILLION IN 2012, 8% LOWER THAN 2011.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EVOLVING REGULATION. THE U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

(DODD-FRANK ACT), ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE. IN ADDITION, OTHER REFORMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY OTHER REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS WORLDWIDE. THE

DODD-FRANK ACT AND THESE OTHER REFORMS MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. WE EXPECT THAT THE PRINCIPAL AREAS OF IMPACT FROM REGULATORY REFORM FOR US WILL BE INCREASED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASED REGULATION AND RESTRICTION ON CERTAIN

ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT MANY OF THE NEW AND PROPOSED RULES ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, THE FULL IMPACT OF REGULATORY REFORM WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE RULES ARE IMPLEMENTED AND MARKET PRACTICES DEVELOP UNDER THE FINAL REGULATIONS.

SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE LAWS,

RULES AND REGULATIONS AND PROPOSED LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO US AND OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, SEE EQUITY CAPITAL  REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK BELOW AND NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY RELATE TO OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY RATIOS.

IMPACT OF INCREASED REGULATION AND RESTRICTION ON CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

THERE HAS BEEN

INCREASED REGULATION OF, AND LIMITATIONS ON, OUR ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING AND THE LIMITATION ON THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN COVERED FUNDS (AS DEFINED IN THE VOLCKER RULE). IN

ADDITION, THERE ARE INCREASED REGULATION OF, AND RESTRICTIONS ON, OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VOLCKER RULE.

IN DECEMBER 2013, THE FINAL RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE WERE ADOPTED. WE ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE

(INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM) BY JULY 2015 WITH CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RULE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS THROUGH JULY 2017.

THE VOLCKER RULE PROHIBITS PROPRIETARY TRADING, BUT WILL ALLOW ACTIVITIES SUCH AS UNDERWRITING, MARKET MAKING AND RISK-MITIGATION HEDGING. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FINAL RULE, WE EVALUATED THIS

PROHIBITION AND DETERMINED THAT BUSINESSES THAT ENGAGE IN BRIGHT LINE PROPRIETARY TRADING WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE PROHIBITED. IN 2010 AND 2011, WE LIQUIDATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR GLOBAL MACRO PROPRIETARY AND PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES

TRADING POSITIONS.

BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF THE PROHIBITION OF

PROPRIETARY TRADING TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, THE RULE IS HIGHLY COMPLEX, AND ITS IMPACT WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL MARKET PRACTICES ARE FULLY DEVELOPED.

IN ADDITION TO THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING, THE VOLCKER RULE LIMITS THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, COVERED

FUNDS (AS DEFINED IN THE RULE) BY BANKING ENTITIES, INCLUDING GROUP INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IT ALSO LIMITS CERTAIN TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN US AND OUR SPONSORED FUNDS, SIMILAR TO THE LIMITATIONS ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR AFFILIATES AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. COVERED FUNDS INCLUDE OUR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, CERTAIN OF OUR CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS, AND OUR HEDGE FUNDS. THE LIMITATION ON

INVESTMENTS IN COVERED FUNDS REQUIRES US TO REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT IN EACH SUCH FUND TO 3% OR LESS OF THE FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE, AND TO REDUCE OUR AGGREGATE INVESTMENT IN ALL SUCH FUNDS TO 3% OR LESS OF OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL. IN ANTICIPATION

OF THE FINAL RULE, WE LIMITED OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NEW COVERED FUNDS TO 3% OF THE FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE.

WE CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR EXISTING FUNDS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TRANSITION PERIODS UNDER

THE VOLCKER RULE. AS A RESULT, IN MARCH 2012, WE BEGAN REDEEMING CERTAIN INTERESTS IN OUR HEDGE FUNDS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.

FOR CERTAIN OF OUR COVERED FUNDS, IN ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE VOLCKER RULE BY THE PRESCRIBED COMPLIANCE DATE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THE PARTICULAR FUNDS ARE NOT SOLD, THE

FIRM MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUCH FUNDS. IF THAT OCCURS, THE FIRM MAY RECEIVE A VALUE FOR ITS INVESTMENTS THAT IS LESS THAN THE THEN CARRYING VALUE AS THERE COULD BE A LIMITED SECONDARY MARKET FOR THESE INVESTMENTS AND THE FIRM

MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEM IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS.

ALTHOUGH OUR NET REVENUES FROM INVESTMENTS IN OUR PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT,

REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, OUR AGGREGATE NET REVENUES FROM THESE INVESTMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR AGGREGATE TOTAL NET REVENUES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1999 THROUGH 2013.

SWAP DEALERS AND DERIVATIVES REGULATION.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED REGULATION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON DERIVATIVE MARKETS, AND WE HAVE REGISTERED CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AS SWAP DEALERS UNDER THE U.S.

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC) RULES. SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE DODD-FRANK AND THE STATUS OF SEC AND CFTC

RULEMAKING, AS WELL AS NON-U.S. REGULATION, IN THIS AREA. THE FULL APPLICATION OF NEW DERIVATIVES RULES ACROSS DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED.

BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES

BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT

ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT RISK MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES IS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE SIZE AND

COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET. WHILE OUR ASSET BASE CHANGES DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY, MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET REFLECT (I) OUR OVERALL RISK TOLERANCE, (II) OUR ABILITY

TO ACCESS STABLE FUNDING SOURCES AND (III) THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL WE HOLD.

ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET

FLUCTUATES ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AT QUARTERLY AND YEAR-END DATES ARE GENERALLY NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR REPORTING PERIODS.

IN ORDER TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DYNAMICALLY MANAGE OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHICH INCLUDE.

QUARTERLY PLANNING.

WE PREPARE A QUARTERLY BALANCE SHEET PLAN THAT COMBINES OUR PROJECTED TOTAL ASSETS AND COMPOSITION OF ASSETS WITH OUR EXPECTED FUNDING SOURCES AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR THE UPCOMING QUARTER. THE OBJECTIVES

OF THIS QUARTERLY PLANNING PROCESS ARE.



TO DEVELOP OUR NEAR-TERM BALANCE SHEET PROJECTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERAL STATE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND EXPECTED BUSINESS ACTIVITY

LEVELS;



TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROJECTED ASSETS ARE SUPPORTED BY AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT AND TENOR OF FUNDING AND THAT OUR PROJECTED CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY METRICS

ARE WITHIN MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND



TO ALLOW BUSINESS RISK MANAGERS AND MANAGERS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE BALANCE SHEET LIMIT REQUESTS

FROM BUSINESS MANAGERS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRMS OVERALL BALANCE SHEET CONSTRAINTS. THESE CONSTRAINTS INCLUDE THE FIRMS LIABILITY PROFILE AND EQUITY CAPITAL LEVELS, MATURITIES AND PLANS FOR NEW DEBT AND EQUITY ISSUANCES, SHARE

REPURCHASES, DEPOSIT TRENDS AND SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS.

TO PREPARE OUR QUARTERLY BALANCE SHEET PLAN,

BUSINESS RISK MANAGERS AND MANAGERS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS MEET WITH BUSINESS MANAGERS TO REVIEW CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIOD METRICS AND DISCUSS EXPECTATIONS FOR THE UPCOMING QUARTER. THE SPECIFIC METRICS REVIEWED INCLUDE

ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, AGED INVENTORY, LIMIT UTILIZATION, RISK AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES, AND CAPITAL USAGE.

OUR CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY PLAN, INCLUDING OUR BALANCE SHEET PLANS BY BUSINESS, FUNDING AND CAPITAL PROJECTIONS, AND PROJECTED CAPITAL AND

LIQUIDITY METRICS, IS REVIEWED BY THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE. SEE OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC LIMITS.

THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE SETS ASSET AND LIABILITY LIMITS FOR EACH BUSINESS AND AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO HOLD INVENTORY OVER LONGER PERIODS OF

TIME. THESE LIMITS ARE SET AT LEVELS WHICH ARE GENERALLY CLOSE TO ACTUAL OPERATING LEVELS IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROMPT ESCALATION AND DISCUSSION AMONG BUSINESS MANAGERS AND MANAGERS IN OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ON A ROUTINE BASIS.

THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES BALANCE SHEET LIMITS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND MAY ALSO APPROVE CHANGES IN LIMITS ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

MONITORING OF KEY

METRICS.

WE MONITOR KEY BALANCE SHEET METRICS DAILY BOTH BY BUSINESS AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, INCLUDING ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, AGED INVENTORY, LIMIT UTILIZATION,

RISK MEASURES AND CAPITAL USAGE. WE ALLOCATE ASSETS TO BUSINESSES AND REVIEW AND ANALYZE MOVEMENTS RESULTING FROM NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY AS WELL AS MARKET FLUCTUATIONS.

SCENARIO ANALYSES.

WE CONDUCT SCENARIO ANALYSES TO DETERMINE HOW WE WOULD MANAGE THE SIZE

AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE FUNDING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITIONS IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS.



THESE SCENARIOS COVER SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS USING VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS. WE USE THESE ANALYSES TO

ASSIST US IN DEVELOPING LONGER-TERM FUNDING PLANS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF UNSECURED DEBT ISSUANCES, THE SIZE OF OUR SECURED FUNDING PROGRAM AND THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL. WE ALSO CONSIDER ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE CONSTRAINTS, SUCH

AS LIMITS ON OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR ASSET BASE IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATE FUNDING.



THROUGH OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, WHICH INCORPORATES OUR INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE CCAR

AND DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TESTS (DFAST) AS WELL AS OUR RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING, WE FURTHER ANALYZE HOW WE WOULD MANAGE OUR BALANCE SHEET AND RISKS THROUGH THE DURATION OF A SEVERE CRISIS, AND WE DEVELOP PLANS TO ACCESS FUNDING, GENERATE

LIQUIDITY, AND/OR REDEPLOY OR ISSUE EQUITY CAPITAL, AS APPROPRIATE.

BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION

IN ADDITION TO PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE PREPARE A BALANCE SHEET THAT GENERALLY ALLOCATES ASSETS TO OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP

PRESENTATION AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING OUR ASSETS ON THIS BASIS IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY MANAGEMENT VIEWS AND MANAGES RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE FIRMS ASSETS AND BETTER ENABLES INVESTORS TO ASSESS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FIRMS ASSETS.

BELOW IS A

DESCRIPTION OF THE CAPTIONS IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, WHICH PRESENTS THIS BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION.

EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND CASH.

WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS AND COLLATERAL NEEDS IN THE

EVENT OF A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT BELOW FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPOSITION AND SIZING OF OUR EXCESS LIQUIDITY POOL OR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS (GCE). IN ADDITION TO OUR EXCESS LIQUIDITY, WE MAINTAIN OTHER

OPERATING CASH BALANCES, PRIMARILY FOR USE IN SPECIFIC CURRENCIES, ENTITIES, OR JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

SECURED CLIENT FINANCING.

WE PROVIDE COLLATERALIZED FINANCING FOR CLIENT POSITIONS,

INCLUDING MARGIN LOANS SECURED BY CLIENT COLLATERAL, SECURITIES BORROWED, AND RESALE AGREEMENTS PRIMARILY COLLATERALIZED BY GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT OF CLIENT ACTIVITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEGREGATE CASH AND SECURITIES TO SATISFY

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. OUR SECURED CLIENT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE OR AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, AND INCLUDE DAILY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

RISK.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS AND METRICS

AS OF DECEMBER 2013, TOTAL ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION WERE $911.51 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $27.05 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 2012. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE OF $67.89 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES, AND A DECREASE IN OTHER ASSETS OF $17.11 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE

BUSINESS IN APRIL 2013. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS OF $48.07 BILLION, DUE TO FIRM AND CLIENT ACTIVITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013, TOTAL LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE $833.04 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $29.80 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 2012. THIS DECREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES OF $26.35 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN BOTH OUR AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN APRIL 2013 AND OUR EUROPEAN INSURANCE BUSINESS IN

DECEMBER 2013, AND A DECREASE IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS OF $9.24 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO FIRM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES OF $10.21 BILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013, OUR TOTAL SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED

FINANCINGS, WERE $164.78 BILLION, WHICH WAS 5% HIGHER AND 4% HIGHER THAN THE DAILY AVERAGE AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

RELATIVE TO THE DAILY AVERAGE DURING 2013 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. AS OF DECEMBER 2012, OUR TOTAL SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS,

WERE $171.81 BILLION, WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED AND 3% HIGHER THAN THE DAILY AVERAGE AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

RELATIVE TO THE DAILY AVERAGE DURING 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN FIRM FINANCING ACTIVITIES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE LEVEL OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FLUCTUATES BETWEEN AND WITHIN PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO PROVIDING CLIENTS WITH

ACCESS TO HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL, SUCH AS U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY, AND INVESTMENT-GRADE SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS THROUGH COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

FUNDING SOURCES

OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDING ARE SECURED FINANCINGS, UNSECURED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS, AND DEPOSITS. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES GLOBALLY ACROSS PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS, MARKETS, CURRENCIES AND CREDITORS TO AVOID FUNDING CONCENTRATIONS.

WE RAISE FUNDING THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING.



COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, SUCH AS REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LOANED AND OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS;



LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT (INCLUDING STRUCTURED NOTES) THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS, U.S. REGISTERED AND RULE 144A MEDIUM-TERM

NOTE PROGRAMS, OFFSHORE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE OFFERINGS AND OTHER DEBT OFFERINGS;



SAVINGS AND DEMAND DEPOSITS THROUGH DEPOSIT SWEEP PROGRAMS AND TIME DEPOSITS THROUGH INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS; AND



SHORT-TERM UNSECURED DEBT THROUGH U.S. AND NON-U.S. HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND PROMISSORY NOTE ISSUANCES AND OTHER METHODS.

OUR FUNDING IS PRIMARILY RAISED IN U.S. DOLLAR, EURO, BRITISH POUND AND JAPANESE YEN. WE GENERALLY

DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDING PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR OWN SALES FORCE AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS TO A LARGE, DIVERSE CREDITOR BASE IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE CRITICAL TO

OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR CREDITORS INCLUDE BANKS, GOVERNMENTS, SECURITIES LENDERS, PENSION FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL GUIDELINES TO MONITOR CREDITOR CONCENTRATION ACROSS OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS.

SECURED FUNDING.

WE FUND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INVENTORY ON A SECURED BASIS. SECURED FUNDING IS LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT QUALITY THAN UNSECURED FUNDING, DUE TO OUR POSTING OF COLLATERAL TO OUR LENDERS.

NONETHELESS, WE CONTINUALLY ANALYZE THE REFINANCING RISK OF OUR SECURED FUNDING ACTIVITIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TRADE TENORS, MATURITY PROFILES, COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATIONS, COLLATERAL ELIGIBILITY AND COUNTERPARTY ROLLOVER PROBABILITIES. WE SEEK TO

MITIGATE OUR REFINANCING RISK BY EXECUTING TERM TRADES WITH STAGGERED MATURITIES, DIVERSIFYING COUNTERPARTIES, RAISING EXCESS SECURED FUNDING, AND PRE-FUNDING RESIDUAL RISK THROUGH OUR GCE.

WE SEEK TO RAISE SECURED FUNDING WITH A TERM APPROPRIATE FOR THE LIQUIDITY OF THE ASSETS THAT ARE BEING FINANCED, AND WE SEEK LONGER

MATURITIES FOR SECURED FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY ASSET CLASSES THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF MARKET STRESS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SECURED FUNDING, EXCLUDING FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY LIQUID GOVERNMENT

OBLIGATIONS, IS EXECUTED FOR TENORS OF ONE MONTH OR GREATER. ASSETS THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS DURING TIMES OF MARKET STRESS INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: MORTGAGE AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED LOANS

AND SECURITIES, NON-INVESTMENT GRADE CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES. ASSETS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE GENERALLY FUNDED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR SECURED FUNDING, EXCLUDING FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY

HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN OUR GCE, EXCEEDED 100 DAYS AS OF DECEMBER 2013.

A MAJORITY OF OUR

SECURED FUNDING FOR SECURITIES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN THE GCE IS EXECUTED THROUGH TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING CONTRACTS. WE ALSO RAISE FINANCING THROUGH OTHER TYPES OF COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, SUCH AS SECURED LOANS AND

NOTES.

GS BANK USA HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING THROUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHILE

WE DO NOT RELY ON THIS FUNDING IN OUR LIQUIDITY PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING, WE MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NECESSARY TO ACCESS THIS FUNDING AND TEST DISCOUNT WINDOW BORROWING PROCEDURES.

UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

WE ISSUE UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSETS AND TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR GCE. WE ISSUE IN DIFFERENT TENORS, CURRENCIES AND PRODUCTS TO MAXIMIZE THE

DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTOR BASE. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS OUR QUARTERLY UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS MATURITY PROFILE THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 AS OF DECEMBER 2013.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 WAS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT YEARS. TO MITIGATE REFINANCING RISK, WE SEEK TO LIMIT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT MATURING ON ANY ONE DAY OR DURING ANY WEEK OR YEAR. WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO CONVERT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF

OUR LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS INTO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013

AS OF

EQUITY CAPITAL

CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BE CONSERVATIVELY CAPITALIZED IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION

OF OUR EQUITY BASE, BOTH RELATIVE TO OUR RISK EXPOSURES AND COMPARED TO EXTERNAL REQUIREMENTS AND BENCHMARKS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK AND SET OF GUIDELINES TO ASSIST US IN

DETERMINING THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL THAT WE TARGET AND MAINTAIN.

WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND

COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL BY CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE RESULTS OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS AND OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS RATING AGENCY

GUIDELINES, SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AND ASSESSMENTS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND MARKET ENVIRONMENTS. OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS

TESTING PROCESS INCORPORATES OUR INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER CCAR AND DFAST, AND IS ALSO DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND

OPERATIONAL RISK. WE PROJECT SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL GIVEN A RANGE OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING STRESSED CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY, WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN THAT PROVIDES

A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO AN ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CAPITAL SHORTFALL.

AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS ANNUAL CCAR GUIDELINES, U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR GREATER SUBMIT CAPITAL PLANS FOR REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE PURPOSE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVIEW IS TO

ENSURE THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE A ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THEIR UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMITS CONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EVALUATES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY BASED, IN PART, ON WHETHER IT

HAS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO CONTINUE OPERATING UNDER THE BASELINE AND STRESS SCENARIOS PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND UNDER THE SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY. THIS EVALUATION ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT A BANK HOLDING

COMPANYS PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING RISK, ITS CONTROLS AND GOVERNANCE FOR CAPITAL PLANNING, AND ITS GUIDELINES FOR MAKING CAPITAL PLANNING DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF ITS REVIEW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EVALUATES A BANK HOLDING

COMPANYS PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (I.E., DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF STOCK, SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER CAPITAL SECURITIES) ACROSS A RANGE OF MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS. ADDITIONALLY,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EVALUATES A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS PLAN TO ISSUE CAPITAL.

IN ADDITION, THE DFAST RULES

REQUIRE US TO CONDUCT STRESS TESTS ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AND PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS. THE ANNUAL DFAST SUBMISSION IS INCORPORATED INTO THE CCAR SUBMISSION. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO CONDUCTS ITS OWN ANNUAL STRESS TESTS AND

PUBLISHES A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS.

AS PART OF OUR INITIAL 2013 CCAR SUBMISSION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFORMED

US THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE REPURCHASE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, A POTENTIAL INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND THE POSSIBLE ISSUANCE, REDEMPTION AND MODIFICATION OF OTHER CAPITAL

SECURITIES THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, WE RESUBMITTED OUR 2013 CAPITAL PLAN IN SEPTEMBER 2013, INCORPORATING CERTAIN ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR STRESS TESTING PROCESS. IN DECEMBER 2013, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD INFORMED US THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO OUR RESUBMITTED CAPITAL PLAN. WE SUBMITTED OUR 2014 CCAR TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN JANUARY 2014 AND EXPECT TO PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF OUR ANNUAL DFAST RESULTS IN MARCH 2014. SEE

BUSINESS AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013

FORM 10-K.

IN ADDITION, WE SUBMITTED THE RESULTS OF OUR MID-CYCLE DFAST TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN JULY 2013 AND PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF OUR MID-CYCLE DFAST RESULTS UNDER OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY

ADVERSE SCENARIO IN SEPTEMBER 2013. OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO IS DESIGNED TO STRESS THE FIRMS RISKS AND IDIOSYNCRATIC VULNERABILITIES AND ASSESS THE FIRMS PRO-FORMA CAPITAL POSITION AND RATIOS UNDER THE

HYPOTHETICAL STRESSED

ENVIRONMENT. WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR INTERNAL STRESS TESTING PROCESS, OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO USED FOR MID-CYCLE DFAST AND A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS ON

OUR WEB SITE AS DESCRIBED UNDER BUSINESS  AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013, OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $78.47 BILLION (CONSISTING OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $71.27 BILLION AND PREFERRED STOCK OF $7.20 BILLION). AS

OF DECEMBER 2012, OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $75.72 BILLION (CONSISTING OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $69.52 BILLION AND PREFERRED STOCK OF $6.20 BILLION). SEE  CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL

RATIOS BELOW FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.

CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF GROUP INC., A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (BHC

ACT) AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER AMENDMENTS TO THE BHC ACT EFFECTED BY THE U.S. GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT OF 1999. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED RISK-BASED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE

COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL REGULATIONS WHICH, AS OF DECEMBER 2013, WERE BASED ON THE BASEL I CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND ALSO REFLECTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPRESSED AS CAPITAL RATIOS THAT COMPARE MEASURES OF CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS). THE CAPITAL

REGULATIONS ALSO INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGE. THE FIRMS CAPITAL LEVELS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY ITS REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. BEGINNING

JANUARY 1, 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IMPLEMENTED REVISED CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS CURRENT RWAS, REQUIRED MINIMUM

ON JANUARY 1, 2013, WE BEGAN TO INCORPORATE THE DODD-FRANK ACTS PHASE-OUT OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TREATMENT FOR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED

TO TRUSTS BY ALLOWING FOR ONLY 75% OF THESE CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS TO BE INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL AND 25% TO BE DESIGNATED AS TIER 2 CAPITAL IN THE CALCULATION OF OUR CURRENT CAPITAL RATIOS. IN JULY 2013, THE AGENCIES FINALIZED THE

PHASE-OUT PROVISIONS OF THESE CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS.

2.

THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO EQUALS TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL DIVIDED BY RWAS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT IS ONE

OF THE MEASURES THAT WE, OUR REGULATORS AND INVESTORS USE TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 16.7%, UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2012

PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN RWAS, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE INCREASE IN RWAS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT

PART OF THE REGULATORY CAPITAL CHANGES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE REFLECTED IN OUR BASEL III CAPITAL RATIOS.

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS

RWAS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON MEASURES OF CREDIT RISK AND MARKET RISK.

RWAS FOR CREDIT RISK REFLECT AMOUNTS FOR ON-BALANCE-SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES. CREDIT RISK REQUIREMENTS FOR ON-BALANCE-SHEET

ASSETS, SUCH AS RECEIVABLES AND CASH, ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE BALANCE SHEET VALUE. CREDIT RISK REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON THE POSITIVE NET EXPOSURE FOR EACH TRADE, AND INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF

COUNTERPARTY NETTING AND COLLATERAL, AS APPLICABLE. FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES, INCLUDING COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, A CREDIT EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF EACH TRADE. REQUIREMENTS FOR OTC DERIVATIVES ARE

BASED ON A COMBINATION OF POSITIVE NET EXPOSURE AND A PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF EACH TRADE, AND INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF COUNTERPARTY NETTING AND COLLATERAL, AS APPLICABLE. ALL SUCH ASSETS AND EXPOSURES ARE THEN ASSIGNED A RISK WEIGHT

DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK OR A QUALIFYING SECURITIES FIRM OR OTHER ENTITY (OR IF COLLATERAL IS HELD, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE COLLATERAL).

AS OF DECEMBER 2012, RWAS FOR MARKET RISK WERE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE FIRMS VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL, SUPPLEMENTED BY

THE STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD USED TO DETERMINE RWAS FOR SPECIFIC RISK FOR CERTAIN POSITIONS. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013, THE

METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING RWAS FOR MARKET RISK WAS CHANGED. RWAS FOR MARKET RISK ARE DETERMINED USING VAR, STRESSED VAR, INCREMENTAL RISK, COMPREHENSIVE RISK AND A STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR SPECIFIC RISK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF INVENTORY POSITIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. FOR BOTH RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS WE USE A SINGLE VAR MODEL WHICH CAPTURES

RISKS INCLUDING INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. VAR USED FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (REGULATORY VAR) DIFFERS FROM RISK MANAGEMENT VAR DUE TO DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS AND CONFIDENCE LEVELS (10-DAY AND 99%

FOR REGULATORY VAR VS. ONE-DAY AND 95% FOR RISK MANAGEMENT VAR), AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES IN THE SCOPE OF POSITIONS ON WHICH VAR IS CALCULATED. STRESSED VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF INVENTORY POSITIONS DURING A PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT MARKET

STRESS. INCREMENTAL RISK IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF NON-SECURITIZED INVENTORY POSITIONS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR CREDIT MIGRATION OF ISSUERS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. COMPREHENSIVE RISK IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN

VALUE, DUE TO PRICE RISK AND DEFAULTS, WITHIN THE FIRMS CREDIT CORRELATION POSITIONS. THE STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE RWAS FOR SPECIFIC RISK FOR CERTAIN POSITIONS BY APPLYING SUPERVISORY DEFINED RISK-WEIGHTING FACTORS

TO SUCH POSITIONS AFTER APPLICABLE NETTING IS PERFORMED.

WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON REGULATORY VAR, STRESSED VAR,

INCREMENTAL RISK, COMPREHENSIVE RISK AND THE STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR SPECIFIC RISK ON OUR WEB SITE AS DESCRIBED UNDER BUSINESS  AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE 2013

SECURITIES FINANCING EXPOSURE. MARKET RWAS INCREASED BY $52.58 BILLION COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2012, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A DECREASE IN SPECIFIC RISK DUE TO A DECREASE IN INVENTORY.

WE ALSO ATTRIBUTE RWAS TO

OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, APPROXIMATELY 80% OF RWAS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING RWAS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT.

REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK

THE AGENCIES HAVE APPROVED REVISED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIO REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING A NEW COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR U.S. BANKING ORGANIZATIONS (REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK). THESE

REGULATIONS ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEES DECEMBER 2010 FINAL CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL III), AND SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIO

REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS U.S. RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIO RULES, AND THEREBY, IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE

DODD-FRANK

ACT.

UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, GROUP INC. IS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION. SEE NOTE 20 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND THE BASEL III

ADVANCED APPROACH.

ESTIMATED CAPITAL RATIOS.

WE ESTIMATE THAT THE FIRMS RATIO OF BASEL III COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1) TO RWAS CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH (BASEL III ADVANCED CET1 RATIO) AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 WOULD HAVE BEEN 9.8% ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS (I.E., AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF TRANSITION PROVISIONS). THE ESTIMATE OF THE BASEL III ADVANCED CET1 RATIO WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS WE ASSESS THE DETAILS OF THESE RULES AND

DISCUSS THEIR INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION WITH OUR REGULATORS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ESTIMATED BASEL III

ADVANCED CET1 RATIO IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE MEASURES THAT WE, OUR REGULATORS AND INVESTORS USE TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THE ESTIMATED BASEL III ADVANCED CET1 RATIO IS A

NON-GAAP

MEASURE

AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR

NON-GAAP

MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES (AS OF THAT DATE). IT WILL BECOME A FORMAL REGULATORY MEASURE FOR THE FIRM ON APRIL 1, 2014.

THIS DEDUCTION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE FULLY PHASED-IN REQUIREMENT, IS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE CAPITAL OF NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS EXCEED CERTAIN PRESCRIBED THRESHOLDS. DURING BOTH THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD AND THEREAFTER, NO DEDUCTION WILL BE REQUIRED IF THE APPLICABLE PROPORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE CAPITAL OF NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FALLS BELOW

THE PRESCRIBED THRESHOLDS.

2.

PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ON DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND DEBT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER REQUIRED CREDIT

RISK-BASED DEDUCTIONS.

IN ADDITION, BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, SUBJECT TO TRANSITIONAL

PROVISIONS, WE WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE RATIOS CALCULATED UNDER THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH. OUR ESTIMATED CET1 RATIO UNDER THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH (STANDARDIZED CET1 RATIO) ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS WAS APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS

LOWER THAN OUR ESTIMATED BASEL III ADVANCED CET1 RATIO IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

BOTH THE BASEL III ADVANCED CET1 RATIO

AND THE STANDARDIZED CET1 RATIO ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS. REFLECTING THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014, OUR ESTIMATED BASEL III ADVANCED CET1 RATIO AND OUR ESTIMATED STANDARDIZED CET1

RATIO ARE APPROXIMATELY 150 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN THE RESPECTIVE CET1 RATIOS ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS AS OF DECEMBER 2013.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014, GROUP INC.S CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS ARE

CALCULATED UNDER, AND SUBJECT TO THE MINIMUMS AS DEFINED IN, THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK. THE CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL AND MINIMUM RATIOS, SUBJECT TO TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, WERE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2014. RWAS ARE

BASED ON BASEL I ADJUSTED, AS DEFINED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013

FORM 10-K.

THE FIRM WILL TRANSITION TO BASEL III BEGINNING

ON APRIL 1, 2014. INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL AND REFLECTING THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS EFFECTIVE IN 2014, OUR ESTIMATED CET1 RATIO (CET1 TO RWAS ON A BASEL I ADJUSTED BASIS) AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 WOULD HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED AS COMPARED TO OUR TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL I.

REGULATORY LEVERAGE

RATIOS.

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INCREASED THE MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO APPLICABLE TO US FROM 3% TO 4% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014.

IN ADDITION, THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK WILL INTRODUCE A NEW TIER 1 SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO)

FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO COMPARES TIER 1 CAPITAL (AS DEFINED UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK) TO A MEASURE OF LEVERAGE EXPOSURE, DEFINED AS THE SUM OF THE FIRMS ASSETS LESS CERTAIN

CET1 DEDUCTIONS PLUS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES, INCLUDING A MEASURE OF DERIVATIVES EXPOSURES AND COMMITMENTS. THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK REQUIRES A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3%, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, BUT

WITH DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. IN ADDITION, SUBSEQUENT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, THE AGENCIES ISSUED A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR THE

LARGEST U.S. BANKS (THOSE DEEMED TO BE GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING INSTITUTIONS (G-SIBS) UNDER THE BASEL G-SIB FRAMEWORK). THESE PROPOSALS WOULD REQUIRE THE FIRM AND OTHER G-SIBS TO MEET A 5% SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (COMPRISED OF THE

MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF 3% PLUS A 2% BUFFER). AS OF DECEMBER 2013, OUR ESTIMATED SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO BASED ON THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK APPROXIMATES THIS PROPOSED MINIMUM.

IN ADDITION, THE BASEL COMMITTEE RECENTLY FINALIZED REVISIONS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE LEVERAGE EXPOSURE FOR PURPOSES OF THE

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO, BUT WOULD RETAIN A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 3%. IT IS NOT KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY AT THIS POINT WHETHER THE U.S. REGULATORS WILL ADOPT THIS REVISED DEFINITION OF LEVERAGE INTO THEIR RULES

AND PROPOSALS FOR THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (ESTABLISHED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP OF 20) HAVE ALSO RECENTLY ISSUED SEVERAL CONSULTATIVE PAPERS WHICH PROPOSE FURTHER CHANGES

TO CAPITAL REGULATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED CONSULTATION PAPERS ON A FUNDAMENTAL REVIEW OF THE TRADING BOOK AND REVISIONS TO THE SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORK THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE LEVEL OF THE

FIRMS RWAS AND REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS.

THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) FINALIZED LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT BASEL III,

WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2014. THE DODD-FRANK ACT, OTHER REFORM INITIATIVES PROPOSED AND ANNOUNCED BY THE AGENCIES, THE BASEL COMMITTEE, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS (INCLUDING THE EU AND THE U.K.S

FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA) WHICH WAS REPLACED BY THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FCA) ON APRIL 1, 2013) ARE NOT IN ALL CASES CONSISTENT WITH ONE ANOTHER, WHICH ADDS FURTHER UNCERTAINTY TO

THE FIRMS FUTURE CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, AND THOSE OF THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE

DODD-FRANK ACT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE REGISTRATION OF ALL SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS. THE FIRM HAS REGISTERED CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AS SWAP

DEALERS UNDER THE CFTC RULES, INCLUDING GS&CO., GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI), AND J. ARON & COMPANY. THESE ENTITIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER THE CFTC OR SEC RULES WILL BE

SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED BY THE CFTC AND SEC.

CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS

OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS INCORPORATES OUR INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER

CCAR AND DFAST. THE PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN.

STRESS TESTING.

OUR STRESS TESTING PROCESS INCORPORATES AN INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRM IS APPROPRIATELY CAPITALIZED RELATIVE TO THE RISKS IN OUR BUSINESS. AS PART OF

OUR ASSESSMENT, WE PROJECT SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL GIVEN A RANGE OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING STRESSED CONDITIONS. OUR STRESS SCENARIOS INCORPORATE OUR INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER CCAR AND DFAST AND ARE

DESIGNED TO CAPTURE OUR SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS AND TO ANALYZE WHETHER THE FIRM HOLDS AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL. OUR GOAL IS TO HOLD SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ENSURE WE REMAIN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AFTER EXPERIENCING A SEVERE STRESS

EVENT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS VIEWED IN TANDEM WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY AND IS INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND POLICY FRAMEWORK OF THE FIRM.

INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT.

AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, WE PERFORM AN INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT INCORPORATES MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK. MARKET RISK

IS CALCULATED BY USING VAR CALCULATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY RISK-BASED ADD-ONS WHICH INCLUDE RISKS RELATED TO RARE EVENTS (TAIL RISKS). CREDIT RISK UTILIZES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR COUNTERPARTIES PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE SIZE OF OUR LOSSES IN

THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT. OPERATIONAL RISK IS CALCULATED BASED ON SCENARIOS INCORPORATING MULTIPLE TYPES OF OPERATIONAL FAILURES AS WELL AS INCORPORATING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. BACKTESTING IS USED TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

MODELS AT CAPTURING AND MEASURING RELEVANT RISKS.

CAPITAL

ATTRIBUTION.

WE ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES BASED UPON REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS OUR INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. WE MANAGE THE LEVELS OF

OUR CAPITAL USAGE BASED UPON THE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS.

CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN.

AS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY, WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN. OUR CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO, IDENTIFICATION OF DRIVERS OF A CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, AS WELL AS MITIGANTS AND POTENTIAL ACTIONS. IT OUTLINES THE APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW DURING A CRISIS PERIOD, INCLUDING INTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION AS WELL AS

ENSURING TIMELY COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.

RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., WHICH DIRECTLY ISSUES OR GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS. GS&CO., GSI

AND GSIB HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED LONG- AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS BY CERTAIN CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. GS BANK USA HAS ALSO BEEN ASSIGNED LONG- AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS, AS WELL AS RATINGS ON ITS LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BANK DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION,

CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE ASSIGNED RATINGS TO DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF GROUP INC.

THE LEVEL AND

COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS OWN DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

A COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE CALCULATION. SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RATINGS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT RATINGS OF GROUP INC., GS BANK USA, GS&CO., GSI AND GSIB.

SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA AND OUR BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION AND CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

GS BANK

USA.

GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CALCULATED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND COMPUTES ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH, AS OF DECEMBER 2013, WERE BASED ON BASEL I, AND ALSO REFLECTED THE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE CAPITAL REGULATIONS ALSO INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGE. SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT GS BANK USAS REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS. GS BANK USA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2014.

IN ADDITION TO REVISIONS TO THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS, GS BANK USA IS NOW SUBJECT TO A

4% MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT, AND AS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION, WILL BE SUBJECT TO A NEW MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) OF 3% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.

SHORTLY AFTER THE APPROVAL OF THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, THE AGENCIES ISSUED A PROPOSAL THAT ALSO REQUIRES THAT U.S. INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF U.S. G-SIBS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA, MEET A WELL-CAPITALIZED SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 6%. IF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ENACTED AS PROPOSED, THESE HIGHER REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, GS BANK USAS ESTIMATED SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO BASED ON THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK APPROXIMATES THIS PROPOSED MINIMUM.

IN ADDITION, THE BASEL COMMITTEES RECENTLY FINALIZED REVISIONS REGARDING THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO DISCUSSED ABOVE MAY ALSO

BE APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA.

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE

2013 FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AS IT RELATES TO GS BANK USA AND INCREMENTAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DOMESTIC SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING INSTITUTIONS.

FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL, GS BANK USA ALSO PERFORMS AN INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT WHICH IS SIMILAR

TO THAT PERFORMED BY GROUP INC. IN ADDITION, THE RULES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRE GS BANK USA TO CONDUCT STRESS TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS. GS BANK USA SUBMITTED ITS

ANNUAL DFAST STRESS RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN JANUARY 2014 AND EXPECTS TO PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF ITS RESULTS IN MARCH 2014. GS BANK USAS CAPITAL LEVELS AND PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION CLASSIFICATION ARE SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE

JUDGMENTS BY ITS REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.

OUR REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER, GSI, IS ONE OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND IS REGULATED BY THE PRA AND THE FCA. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, GSI

WAS SUBJECT TO CAPITAL REGULATIONS, WHICH WERE BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEES JUNE 2006 FRAMEWORK (BASEL II) AS MODIFIED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEES FEBRUARY 2011 REVISIONS TO THE BASEL II MARKET RISK FRAMEWORK AND AS

IMPLEMENTED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THROUGH THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVES. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, GSI HAD A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 14.4% AND 11.5%, RESPECTIVELY, AND A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 18.5% AND 16.9%,

RESPECTIVELY. THE MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO UNDER PRA RULES WAS 4%, AND THE MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO WAS 8%. THE PRA HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED ITS CAPITAL REGULATIONS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2014; THE REVISED REGULATIONS

ARE LARGELY BASED ON BASEL III AND, SIMILAR TO THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, ALSO INTRODUCE LEVERAGE RATIO REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

WE EXPECT THAT THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES

ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTS ARISING FROM THE BASEL COMMITTEE, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS. SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF REGULATORY REFORM.

SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY HOLD CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX AND LEGAL GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS (FOR ENTITIES WITH ASSIGNED CREDIT RATINGS) OR

INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED ON ITS UNDERLYING LEVEL OF RISK. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, GROUP INC. MAY BE LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL HELD AT CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER CONSTRAINTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, GROUP INC.S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES WAS $73.39 BILLION AND $73.32 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH ITS TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $78.47 BILLION AND $75.72 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES.

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GS&CO., GS BANK USA, AND GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION &

CLEARING, L.P. (GSEC) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, GROUP INC. CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES INTO GS BANK USA, AND GROUP INC. AGREED TO GUARANTEE CERTAIN LOSSES, INCLUDING CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES, RELATING TO ASSETS HELD BY THE

CONTRIBUTED ENTITIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE, GROUP INC. ALSO AGREED TO PLEDGE TO GS BANK USA CERTAIN COLLATERAL, INCLUDING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS MANAGED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES AND NON-U.S. DENOMINATED DEBT.

EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

WE PRINCIPALLY MANAGE OUR CAPITAL THROUGH ISSUANCES AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO, FROM TIME TO TIME,

ISSUE OR REPURCHASE OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS, AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER FORMS OF CAPITAL AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT AND SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND/OR LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE BOTH AT THE CONSOLIDATED AND BUSINESS LEVELS. WE ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES BASED UPON OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

AS WELL AS OUR INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. WE MANAGE THE LEVELS OF OUR CAPITAL USAGE BASED UPON THE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS.

SEE NOTES 16 AND 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY

WARRANT.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2013, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY EXERCISED IN FULL A WARRANT TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK. THE WARRANT, AS AMENDED IN MARCH 2013,

REQUIRED NET SHARE SETTLEMENT, AND THE FIRM DELIVERED 13.1 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ON OCTOBER 4, 2013. THE NUMBER OF SHARES DELIVERED REPRESENTED THE VALUE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AVERAGE CLOSING

PRICE OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK OVER THE 10 TRADING DAYS PRECEDING OCTOBER 1, 2013 AND THE EXERCISE PRICE OF $115.00 MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (43.5 MILLION) COVERED BY THE WARRANT. THE IMPACT TO

BOTH THE FIRMS BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE WAS A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 3%.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

WE SEEK TO USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND

TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITIONS, BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

ON APRIL 15, 2013, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GROUP INC. (BOARD) AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 75.0 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE FIRMS EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD, WE CAN REPURCHASE UP TO 57.2 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK;

HOWEVER, ANY SUCH REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. SEE MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES IN PART II, ITEM 5

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING.



PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL AND OTHER INTERESTS IN SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIZATION VEHICLES;



HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT, INTERESTS IN LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK IN OTHER NONCONSOLIDATED



ENTERING INTO OPERATING LEASES; AND



PROVIDING GUARANTEES, INDEMNIFICATIONS, LOAN COMMITMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS. THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES THAT PURCHASE

MORTGAGES, CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MARKETS, SINCE THEY OFFER INVESTORS ACCESS TO

SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS CREATED THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS.

WE ALSO ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO UNDERWRITE

CLIENT SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDE SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS; PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH CREDIT-LINKED AND ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES; AND RECEIVE OR

PROVIDE LETTERS OF CREDIT TO SATISFY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS.

OUR

FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN, AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH, SUCH NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK

MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

WE BELIEVE THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE

FIRM. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH WE MONITOR, EVALUATE AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR ACTIVITIES. THESE INCLUDE MARKET, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND

REPUTATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS BUILT AROUND THREE CORE COMPONENTS: GOVERNANCE, PROCESSES AND PEOPLE.

GOVERNANCE.

RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STARTS WITH OUR BOARD, WHICH PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE

IN REVIEWING AND APPROVING RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS RISK COMMITTEE. THE BOARD ALSO RECEIVES REGULAR BRIEFINGS ON FIRMWIDE RISKS, INCLUDING MARKET RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT

RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND ON MATTERS IMPACTING OUR REPUTATION FROM THE CHAIR OF OUR FIRMWIDE CLIENT AND BUSINESS STANDARDS COMMITTEE. THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER,

AS PART OF THE REVIEW OF THE FIRMWIDE RISK PORTFOLIO, REGULARLY ADVISES THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF RELEVANT RISK METRICS AND MATERIAL EXPOSURES. NEXT, AT THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS OF THE FIRM, OUR LEADERS ARE EXPERIENCED RISK MANAGERS, WITH A

SOPHISTICATED AND DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WE TAKE. OUR SENIOR MANAGERS LEAD AND PARTICIPATE IN RISK-ORIENTED COMMITTEES, AS DO THE LEADERS OF OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS  INCLUDING THOSE IN COMPLIANCE,

CONTROLLERS, OUR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT (CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT), HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LEGAL, OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT (MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT), OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT (OPERATIONAL RISK

MANAGEMENT), TAX, TECHNOLOGY AND TREASURY.

THE FIRMS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE PROTOCOL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR

DECISION-MAKING ON RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND ENSURES IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE DECISIONS. WE MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF RISK-RELATED COMMITTEES THAT MEET REGULARLY AND SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO FACILITATE AND FOSTER ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO IDENTIFY,

MANAGE AND MITIGATE RISKS.

WE MAINTAIN STRONG COMMUNICATION ABOUT RISK AND WE HAVE A CULTURE OF COLLABORATION IN

DECISION-MAKING AMONG THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IN MANAGING RISK RESTS WITH THE MANAGERS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS,

WE DEDICATE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES TO INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE A STRONG OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE AND AN APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. WE REGULARLY REINFORCE THE FIRMS STRONG CULTURE OF ESCALATION AND

ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS ALL DIVISIONS AND FUNCTIONS.

PROCESSES.

WE MAINTAIN VARIOUS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS OUR DAILY DISCIPLINE OF MARKING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS INVENTORY TO

CURRENT MARKET LEVELS. GOLDMAN SACHS CARRIES ITS INVENTORY AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN VALUATION REFLECTED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND IN NET REVENUES. WE DO SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS DISCIPLINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE

TOOLS FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISK AND THAT IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENT AND REALISTIC INSIGHT INTO OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURES.

WE ALSO APPLY A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK OF LIMITS TO CONTROL RISK ACROSS MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS, PRODUCTS, BUSINESSES AND MARKETS. THIS INCLUDES

SETTING CREDIT AND MARKET RISK LIMITS AT A VARIETY OF LEVELS AND MONITORING THESE LIMITS ON A DAILY BASIS. LIMITS ARE TYPICALLY SET AT LEVELS THAT WILL BE PERIODICALLY EXCEEDED, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK APPETITE. THIS

FOSTERS AN ONGOING DIALOGUE ON RISK AMONG REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS RAPID ESCALATION OF RISK-RELATED MATTERS. SEE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR RISK LIMITS.

ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR POSITIONS IS

ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROCESS. PROACTIVE MITIGATION OF OUR MARKET AND CREDIT EXPOSURES MINIMIZES THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO TAKE OUTSIZED ACTIONS DURING PERIODS OF STRESS.

GOLDMAN SACHS 2013 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WE ALSO FOCUS ON THE RIGOR AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS RISK SYSTEMS. THE GOAL OF

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY IS TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME, WHICH REQUIRES SYSTEMS THAT ARE COMPREHENSIVE, RELIABLE AND TIMELY. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY TO

ENSURE THAT IT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES US WITH COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION.

PEOPLE.

EVEN THE BEST TECHNOLOGY SERVES ONLY AS A TOOL FOR HELPING TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN REAL TIME ABOUT THE RISKS WE ARE TAKING. ULTIMATELY,

EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES OUR PEOPLE TO INTERPRET OUR RISK DATA ON AN ONGOING AND TIMELY BASIS AND ADJUST RISK POSITIONS ACCORDINGLY. IN BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, THE EXPERIENCE OF

OUR PROFESSIONALS, AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NUANCES AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH RISK MEASURE, GUIDE THE FIRM IN ASSESSING EXPOSURES AND MAINTAINING THEM WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS.

WE REINFORCE A CULTURE OF EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IN OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE WAY WE EVALUATE PERFORMANCE,

AND RECOGNIZE AND REWARD OUR PEOPLE. OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN SESSIONS LED BY THE MOST SENIOR LEADERS OF THE FIRM, ARE FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RISK MANAGEMENT, CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND REPUTATIONAL EXCELLENCE. AS

PART OF OUR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW PROCESS, WE ASSESS REPUTATIONAL EXCELLENCE INCLUDING HOW AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISES GOOD RISK MANAGEMENT AND REPUTATIONAL JUDGMENT, AND ADHERES TO OUR CODE OF CONDUCT AND COMPLIANCE POLICIES. OUR REVIEW AND REWARD

PROCESSES ARE DESIGNED TO COMMUNICATE AND REINFORCE TO OUR PROFESSIONALS THE LINK BETWEEN BEHAVIOR AND HOW PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZED, THE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR CLIENTS AND OUR REPUTATION, AND THE NEED TO ALWAYS ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGHEST

STANDARDS OF THE FIRM.

STRUCTURE

ULTIMATE OVERSIGHT OF RISK IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FIRMS BOARD. THE BOARD OVERSEES RISK BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS RISK COMMITTEE. THE RISK COMMITTEE CONSISTS OF

ALL OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS. WITHIN THE FIRM, A SERIES OF COMMITTEES WITH SPECIFIC RISK MANAGEMENT MANDATES HAVE OVERSIGHT OR DECISION-MAKING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP GENERALLY CONSISTS OF SENIOR

MANAGERS FROM BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR THESE COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BARRIERS ARE IN PLACE. OUR PRIMARY RISK COMMITTEES, MOST OF

WHICH ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL SUB-COMMITTEES OR WORKING GROUPS, ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THESE COMMITTEES, WE HAVE OTHER RISK-ORIENTED COMMITTEES WHICH PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR DIFFERENT BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES, PRODUCTS, REGIONS AND LEGAL

ENTITIES. ALL OF OUR FIRMWIDE, REGIONAL AND DIVISIONAL COMMITTEES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSIDERING THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES WHICH THEY OVERSEE ON OUR REPUTATION.

MEMBERSHIP OF THE FIRMS RISK COMMITTEES IS REVIEWED REGULARLY AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE

COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT MEMBERS SERVE ON THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES VARIES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND BASED ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MEMBERS WITHIN THE FIRM.

IN ADDITION, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, WHICH REPORT TO THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND THE CHIEF

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAY-TO-DAY OVERSIGHT OR MONITORING OF RISK, AS DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS. INTERNAL AUDIT, WHICH REPORTS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AND INCLUDES PROFESSIONALS WITH A

BROAD RANGE OF AUDIT AND INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING AND VALIDATING KEY CONTROLS WITHIN THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES. THE HEAD OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT DIVISION RISK MANAGEMENT IS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT DIVISION RISK COMMITTEE REPORTS TO THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER.

CONFLICTS MANAGEMENT

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND THE FIRMS APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THEM ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, OUR REPUTATION AND OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. THE TERM CONFLICT OF INTEREST

DOES NOT HAVE A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED MEANING, AND CONFLICTS CAN ARISE IN MANY FORMS WITHIN A BUSINESS OR BETWEEN BUSINESSES. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS, AS WELL AS COMPLYING WITH THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES,

IS SHARED BY THE ENTIRE FIRM.

WE HAVE A MULTILAYERED APPROACH TO RESOLVING CONFLICTS AND ADDRESSING REPUTATIONAL RISK. THE

FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT OVERSEES POLICIES RELATED TO CONFLICTS RESOLUTION. THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BUSINESS SELECTION AND CONFLICTS RESOLUTION GROUP, THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT AND COMPLIANCE DIVISION, THE FIRMWIDE CLIENT AND BUSINESS

STANDARDS COMMITTEE AND OTHER INTERNAL COMMITTEES ALL PLAY ROLES IN THE FORMULATION OF POLICIES, STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES AND ASSIST IN MAKING JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION OF PARTICULAR CONFLICTS. RESOLVING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

NECESSARILY DEPENDS ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF A PARTICULAR SITUATION AND THE APPLICATION OF EXPERIENCED AND INFORMED JUDGMENT.

AT THE TRANSACTION LEVEL, VARIOUS PEOPLE AND GROUPS HAVE ROLES. AS A GENERAL MATTER, THE BUSINESS SELECTION AND CONFLICTS RESOLUTION GROUP REVIEWS ALL FINANCING AND ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS IN INVESTMENT

BANKING AND CERTAIN INVESTING, LENDING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM. VARIOUS TRANSACTION OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES, SUCH AS THE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL, COMMITMENTS AND SUITABILITY COMMITTEES AND OTHER COMMITTEES ACROSS THE FIRM, ALSO REVIEW NEW

UNDERWRITINGS, LOANS, INVESTMENTS AND STRUCTURED PRODUCTS. THESE COMMITTEES WORK WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LAWYERS AND THE COMPLIANCE DIVISION TO EVALUATE AND ADDRESS ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS.

WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN AN EFFORT TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MOST OF THE FAILURES OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSERVATIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES TO ADDRESS BOTH FIRM-SPECIFIC AND BROADER INDUSTRY OR MARKET

LIQUIDITY EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO FUND THE FIRM AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO SERVE CLIENTS AND GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.

EXCESS LIQUIDITY.

WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF

POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS AND COLLATERAL NEEDS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT.

WE ASSESS ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIODS FOR OUR ASSETS AND THEIR EXPECTED LIQUIDITY IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. WE MANAGE THE MATURITIES AND DIVERSITY OF OUR FUNDING ACROSS

MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND SEEK TO MAINTAIN LIABILITIES OF APPROPRIATE TENOR RELATIVE TO OUR ASSET BASE.

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.

WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A LIQUIDITY CRISIS SITUATION OR PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THIS FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH THE PLAN OF ACTION TO FUND NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN EMERGENCY AND

STRESS SITUATIONS. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.

EXCESS LIQUIDITY

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO PRE-FUND OUR ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD

THIS EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES AND CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS WOULD BE READILY CONVERTIBLE TO CASH IN A MATTER OF DAYS, THROUGH LIQUIDATION, BY ENTERING INTO

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR FROM MATURITIES OF RESALE AGREEMENTS, AND THAT THIS CASH WOULD ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES AND

CERTAIN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS INCLUDED IN OUR GCE TOTALED $184.07 BILLION AND $174.62 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNAL LIQUIDITY RISK MODEL, DISCUSSED BELOW, AS WELL AS OUR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER FACTORS

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR POTENTIAL INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE FIRM, WE BELIEVE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2013 AND

DECEMBER 2012 WAS APPROPRIATE.

DEPOSITS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN OUR GCE.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED EXCESS IS COMPOSED OF ONLY UNENCUMBERED GERMAN, FRENCH, JAPANESE AND UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS IN HIGHLY LIQUID CURRENCIES. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO THIS NARROWLY

DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES AND CASH BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY, SUCH AS LESS LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES,

IN OUR GCE.

OUR GCE REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS SURVIVAL.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. OUR BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND OUR

LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE,

AND THE TERMS (E.G., INTEREST RATES, COLLATERAL PROVISIONS AND TENOR) OR AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO PRE-FUND LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER

DEBT BALANCES THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND OUR FUNDING COSTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GCE PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE

AVAILABLE IN ADVANCE OF POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE SIZE OF OUR GCE, WE USE AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, WHICH CAPTURES AND QUANTIFIES THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISKS. WE

ALSO CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR POTENTIAL INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE FIRM.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR GCE ACROSS ENTITIES, ASSET TYPES, AND CLEARING AGENTS TO PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT OPERATING LIQUIDITY TO ENSURE TIMELY

SETTLEMENT IN ALL MAJOR MARKETS, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

WE MAINTAIN OUR GCE TO ENABLE US TO MEET CURRENT AND

POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW INCORPORATES A CONSOLIDATED REQUIREMENT FOR THE FIRM AS WELL AS A STANDALONE REQUIREMENT FOR EACH OF OUR MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND

BANK SUBSIDIARIES. LIQUIDITY HELD DIRECTLY IN EACH OF THESE MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS INTENDED FOR USE ONLY BY THAT SUBSIDIARY TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND IS ASSUMED NOT TO BE AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. UNLESS (I) LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR AND

(II) THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW INCORPORATES A BROADER ASSESSMENT OF STANDALONE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND WE HOLD A PORTION OF OUR GCE

DIRECTLY AT GROUP INC. TO SUPPORT SUCH REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE GCE, WE MAINTAIN OPERATING CASH BALANCES IN SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES, PRIMARILY FOR USE IN SPECIFIC CURRENCIES, ENTITIES, OR JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE

IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

IN ADDITION TO OUR GCE, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED CASH

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTHER GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS, MARGINABLE EQUITIES, LOANS AND CASH DEPOSITS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR GCE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AVERAGED

$90.77 BILLION FOR 2013 AND $87.09 BILLION FOR 2012. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THESE ASSETS LIQUID ENOUGH TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR GCE LIQUIDITY POOL AND THEREFORE CONSERVATIVELY DO NOT ASSUME WE WILL GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM THESE ASSETS IN OUR

MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.

OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW IS BASED ON CONDUCTING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF MARKET-WIDE AND FIRM-SPECIFIC STRESS. THESE SCENARIOS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE FOLLOWING

QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS.



SEVERELY CHALLENGED MARKET ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING LOW CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CONFIDENCE, FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY, ADVERSE CHANGES IN

MARKET VALUES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DECLINES IN EQUITY MARKETS AND WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS.



A FIRM-SPECIFIC CRISIS POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED BY MATERIAL LOSSES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, LITIGATION, EXECUTIVE DEPARTURE, AND/OR A RATINGS DOWNGRADE.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE CRITICAL MODELING PARAMETERS OF THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.



LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A 30-DAY SCENARIO.



A TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF THE FIRMS LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT RATINGS.



A COMBINATION OF CONTRACTUAL OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT, AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS (E.G., ACTIONS THOUGH NOT

CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED, WE MAY DEEM NECESSARY IN A CRISIS). WE ASSUME THAT MOST CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS WILL OCCUR WITHIN THE INITIAL DAYS AND WEEKS OF A CRISIS.



NO ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR UNSECURED DEBT.



NO SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENT FUNDING FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACCESS TO VARIOUS CENTRAL BANK FUNDING PROGRAMS, WE DO NOT ASSUME RELIANCE ON THEM

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS.



WE DO NOT ASSUME ASSET LIQUIDATION, OTHER THAN THE GCE.

THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW IS CALCULATED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY BASIS. WE REGULARLY REFINE OUR MODEL TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE FIRMS

BUSINESS MIX.

THE POTENTIAL CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS COVERED IN OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW

INCLUDE.

UNSECURED FUNDING



CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, PROMISSORY NOTES AND OTHER UNSECURED FUNDING PRODUCTS. WE ASSUME

THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT OR ROLL OVER ANY MATURING DEBT.



CONTINGENT: REPURCHASES OF OUR OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A

MARKET MAKER.

DEPOSITS



CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF TERM DEPOSITS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW TERM DEPOSITS OR ROLLOVER ANY MATURING TERM

DEPOSITS.



CONTINGENT: WITHDRAWALS OF BANK DEPOSITS THAT HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE WITHDRAWAL ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE TYPE OF

DEPOSIT, WHETHER THE DEPOSIT IS INSURED OR UNINSURED, AND THE FIRMS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPOSITOR.

SECURED FUNDING



CONTRACTUAL: A PORTION OF UPCOMING CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF SECURED FUNDING DUE TO EITHER THE INABILITY TO REFINANCE OR THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE

ONLY AT WIDER HAIRCUTS (I.E., ON TERMS WHICH REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL). OUR ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COUNTERPARTY ROLL PROBABILITIES (OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE

COUNTERPARTYS LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING TO PROVIDE FUNDING ON A SECURED BASIS AT THE MATURITY OF THE TRADE) AND COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION.



CONTINGENT: ADVERSE CHANGES IN VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL POSTINGS UNDER THOSE TRANSACTIONS.

OTC DERIVATIVES



CONTINGENT: COLLATERAL POSTINGS TO COUNTERPARTIES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE CLEARED AND

SETTLED THROUGH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES (OTC-CLEARED).



CONTINGENT: OTHER OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL RELATED TO OTC DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING OTC-CLEARED, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF TRADE TERMINATIONS,

COLLATERAL SUBSTITUTIONS, COLLATERAL DISPUTES, LOSS OF REHYPOTHECATION RIGHTS, COLLATERAL CALLS OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY A TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, AND COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS

AVAILABLE TO THEM.

EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES



CONTINGENT: VARIATION MARGIN POSTINGS REQUIRED DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES.



CONTINGENT: AN INCREASE IN INITIAL MARGIN AND GUARANTY FUND REQUIREMENTS BY DERIVATIVE CLEARING HOUSES.

CUSTOMER CASH AND SECURITIES



CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRIME BROKERAGE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WITHDRAWALS OF CUSTOMER CREDIT BALANCES, AND A REDUCTION IN

CUSTOMER SHORT POSITIONS, WHICH SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS



CONTINGENT: DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. DRAW ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE OF COMMITMENT AND COUNTERPARTY.

OTHER



OTHER UPCOMING LARGE CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS TAX PAYMENTS.

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO

ENSURE WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FINANCING, EVEN WHEN FUNDING MARKETS EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT STRESS. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A LONG-DATED AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF

OUR ASSETS.

OUR APPROACH TO ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT INCLUDES.



CONSERVATIVELY MANAGING THE OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR FUNDING BOOK, WITH A FOCUS ON MAINTAINING LONG-TERM, DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDING IN

EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. SEE BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  FUNDING SOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.



ACTIVELY MANAGING AND MONITORING OUR ASSET BASE, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE LIQUIDITY, HOLDING PERIOD AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A SECURED

BASIS. THIS ENABLES US TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FUNDING PRODUCTS AND TENORS. SEE BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT FOR MORE DETAIL ON OUR BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND

 FUNDING SOURCES  SECURED FUNDING FOR MORE DETAIL ON ASSET CLASSES THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS.



RAISING SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING THAT HAS A LONG TENOR RELATIVE TO THE LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS. THIS REDUCES THE RISK THAT OUR

LIABILITIES WILL COME DUE IN ADVANCE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS. BECAUSE WE MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET, THE HOLDING PERIOD OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS MAY BE MATERIALLY SHORTER THAN THEIR CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY DATES.

OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM MAINTAINS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS ASSETS AND

MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS IN NORMAL TIMES AS WELL AS DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THROUGH OUR DYNAMIC BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS (SEE BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  BALANCE SHEET

MANAGEMENT), WE USE ACTUAL AND PROJECTED ASSET BALANCES TO DETERMINE SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FUNDING PLANS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. IN ADDITION, SENIOR MANAGERS IN

OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS REGULARLY ANALYZE, AND THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE REVIEWS, OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL CAPITAL POSITION (UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) SO THAT WE MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF

LONG-TERM FUNDING THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WE WOULD FIRST USE OUR GCE IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES (OTHER THAN OUR GCE). HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ORDERLY ASSET SALES MAY

BE PRUDENT OR NECESSARY IN A SEVERE OR PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING

POLICIES.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY GROUP INC. WHICH LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET FINANCING,

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE KEY BENEFIT OF THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING IS GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET

THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES OVER TIME. FUNDING IS ALSO RAISED AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL THROUGH A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SECURED FUNDING, UNSECURED BORROWINGS AND DEPOSITS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ASSUME THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR, A

SUBSIDIARYS FUNDS OR SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE TO ITS PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ASSUME THAT THE CAPITAL PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO

GROUP INC. OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THE MATURITY OF SUCH FINANCING.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DECEMBER 2013, GROUP INC. HAD

$31.40 BILLION OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GS&CO., ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; $26.40 BILLION INVESTED IN GSI, A REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER; $2.26 BILLION INVESTED IN GSEC, A U.S.

REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; $2.82 BILLION INVESTED IN GSJCL, A REGULATED JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER; $20.04 BILLION INVESTED IN GS BANK USA, A REGULATED NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK; AND $3.50 BILLION INVESTED IN GSIB, A REGULATED U.K.

BANK. GROUP INC. ALSO PROVIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, $75.77 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS AND $9.93 BILLION OF COLLATERAL TO THESE ENTITIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS TO GS&CO., GSI AND GS BANK USA, AS OF DECEMBER 2013.

IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 2013, GROUP INC. HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN

THE

GOLDMAN SACHS CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN SETS OUT THE PLAN OF ACTION WE WOULD USE TO FUND BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN CRISIS SITUATIONS AND PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN OUTLINES A LIST OF POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS, KEY REPORTS AND

METRICS THAT ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ASSIST IN ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF, AND MANAGING THROUGH, A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND/OR MARKET DISLOCATION. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE FIRMS POTENTIAL RESPONSES IF

OUR ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THAT THE FIRM HAS ENTERED A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WHICH INCLUDE FUNDING OUR POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS AS WELL AS UTILIZING SECONDARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. MITIGANTS AND ACTION ITEMS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC RISKS WHICH MAY

ARISE ARE ALSO DESCRIBED AND ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTION.

THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN IDENTIFIES KEY GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS TO FOSTER EFFECTIVE

COORDINATION, CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION, ALL OF WHICH ARE CRITICAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DETAILS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, WHICH INCLUDE

MAKING AND DISSEMINATING KEY DECISIONS, COORDINATING ALL CONTINGENCY ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS, IMPLEMENTING LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND MANAGING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION.

PROPOSED LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISIONS INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MEASUREMENT, STANDARDS AND MONITORING CALLS FOR IMPOSITION OF A LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO, DESIGNED TO ENSURE

THAT BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS BASED ON EXPECTED CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER AN ACUTE LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO, AND A NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO, DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM-

AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. UNDER THE BASEL COMMITTEE FRAMEWORK, THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO WOULD BE INTRODUCED ON JANUARY 1, 2015; HOWEVER, THERE WOULD BE A PHASE-IN

PERIOD WHEREBY FIRMS WOULD HAVE A 60% MINIMUM IN 2015 WHICH WOULD BE RAISED 10% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 100% IN 2019. THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE INTRODUCED AS A REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2018.

IN ADDITION, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC HAVE ISSUED A PROPOSAL ON MINIMUM

LIQUIDITY STANDARDS THAT IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES FRAMEWORK AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, BUT, WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSET DEFINITION AND EXPECTED CASH OUTFLOW ASSUMPTIONS, AND ACCELERATED

TRANSITION PROVISIONS. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE PROPOSED ACCELERATED TRANSITION TIMELINE, THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO WOULD BE INTRODUCED ON JANUARY 1, 2015; HOWEVER, THERE WOULD BE AN ACCELERATED U.S. PHASE-IN PERIOD WHEREBY FIRMS WOULD

HAVE AN 80% MINIMUM IN 2015 WHICH WOULD BE RAISED 10% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 100% IN 2017.

THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO

EVALUATE THE IMPACT TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK GOING FORWARD. WHILE THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE NEW FRAMEWORKS PROPOSED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE AGENCIES ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STANDARDS COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES.

WE RELY ON THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING IS INFLUENCED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS, SUCH AS OTC DERIVATIVES, AND WHEN WE SEEK TO ENGAGE IN

LONGER-TERM TRANSACTIONS. SEE CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES BELOW AND RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WE BELIEVE OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES

ASSESSMENT OF.



OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES;



THE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY OF OUR EARNINGS;



OUR CAPITAL BASE;



OUR FRANCHISE, REPUTATION AND MANAGEMENT;



OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; AND



THE EXTERNAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE ASSUMED LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSACTED UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHO MAY REQUIRE US TO POST

COLLATERAL OR TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS BASED ON CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS. WE ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THESE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS BY DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT WOULD OCCUR ASSUMING A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. A

DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF THE FIRM AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. WE ALLOCATE A PORTION OF

OUR GCE TO ENSURE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A TWO-NOTCH REDUCTION IN OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY

COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED AT THE REPORTING DATE BY

COUNTERPARTIES IN THE EVENT OF A ONE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS.

CASH FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL

IN EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESSES.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2013.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $11.54 BILLION TO $61.13 BILLION AT THE END OF 2013. WE GENERATED $4.54 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. WE USED NET CASH OF

$16.08 BILLION FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY TO FUND LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2012.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY

$16.66 BILLION TO $72.67 BILLION AT THE END OF 2012. WE GENERATED $9.14 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES. WE GENERATED $7.52 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES FROM AN INCREASE IN BANK

DEPOSITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET REPAYMENTS OF UNSECURED AND SECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRM EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF RISK

MEASURES, EACH DESCRIBED IN THE RESPECTIVE SECTIONS BELOW, TO MONITOR MARKET RISK. WE HOLD INVENTORY PRIMARILY FOR MARKET MAKING FOR OUR CLIENTS AND FOR OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. OUR INVENTORY THEREFORE CHANGES BASED ON CLIENT DEMANDS

AND OUR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OUR INVENTORY IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATES ON A DAILY BASIS, WITH THE RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING, AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS.

CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



INTEREST RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF YIELD CURVES, THE VOLATILITIES OF INTEREST RATES,

MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, BASKETS OF EQUITIES AND EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRICITY, AND PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

WE MANAGE OUR MARKET RISK BY DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES, CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING ECONOMIC HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR

DERIVATIVES. THIS INCLUDES.



ACCURATE AND TIMELY EXPOSURE INFORMATION INCORPORATING MULTIPLE RISK METRICS;



A DYNAMIC LIMIT SETTING FRAMEWORK; AND



CONSTANT COMMUNICATION AMONG REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, RISK MANAGERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO

THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING MARKET RISK AT THE FIRM. WE MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS THROUGH STRONG FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ACROSS THE

FIRMS GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANAGING RISK WITHIN PRESCRIBED

LIMITS. THESE MANAGERS HAVE IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR POSITIONS, MARKETS AND THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO HEDGE THEIR EXPOSURES.

MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSS MARKET INFORMATION, POSITIONS AND ESTIMATED RISK AND LOSS SCENARIOS ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

RISK MEASURES

MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT PRODUCES RISK MEASURES AND MONITORS THEM AGAINST MARKET RISK LIMITS SET BY OUR FIRMS RISK COMMITTEES. THESE MEASURES REFLECT AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SCENARIOS AND THE RESULTS ARE AGGREGATED AT TRADING DESK, BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE

LEVELS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET

MOVES OVER BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS. OUR PRIMARY RISK MEASURES ARE VAR, WHICH IS USED FOR SHORTER-TERM PERIODS, AND STRESS TESTS. OUR RISK REPORTS DETAIL KEY RISKS, DRIVERS AND CHANGES FOR EACH DESK AND BUSINESS, AND ARE

DISTRIBUTED DAILY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS.

VALUE-AT-RISK

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. FOR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR, SEE  FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINKAGES TO MARKET RISK MEASURES. WE TYPICALLY EMPLOY A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. WE USE A SINGLE VAR MODEL WHICH CAPTURES RISKS INCLUDING

INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS SUCH, VAR FACILITATES COMPARISON ACROSS PORTFOLIOS OF DIFFERENT RISK CHARACTERISTICS. VAR ALSO CAPTURES THE DIVERSIFICATION OF AGGREGATED RISK AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WE ARE AWARE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR AND THEREFORE USE A VARIETY OF RISK

MEASURES IN OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR INCLUDE.



VAR DOES NOT ESTIMATE POTENTIAL LOSSES OVER LONGER TIME HORIZONS WHERE MOVES MAY BE EXTREME.



VAR DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIVE LIQUIDITY OF DIFFERENT RISK POSITIONS.



PREVIOUS MOVES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF ALL FUTURE MARKET MOVES.

WHEN CALCULATING VAR, WE USE HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS WITH FULL VALUATION OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000 MARKET FACTORS. VAR IS CALCULATED AT A

POSITION LEVEL BASED ON SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOCKING THE RELEVANT MARKET RISK FACTORS FOR THAT POSITION. WE SAMPLE FROM 5 YEARS OF HISTORICAL DATA TO GENERATE THE SCENARIOS FOR OUR VAR CALCULATION. THE HISTORICAL DATA IS WEIGHTED SO THAT THE

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA REDUCES OVER TIME. THIS GIVES GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTS CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WHICH IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL LOSS. AS A RESULT, EVEN IF OUR POSITIONS

INCLUDED IN VAR WERE UNCHANGED, OUR VAR WOULD INCREASE WITH INCREASING MARKET VOLATILITY AND VICE VERSA.

GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON

HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR VAR MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE.



POSITIONS THAT ARE BEST MEASURED AND MONITORED USING SENSITIVITY MEASURES; AND



THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON UNSECURED

BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED.

STRESS TESTING

STRESS TESTING IS A METHOD OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT ON THE FIRM OF VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL STRESS SCENARIOS. WE USE STRESS TESTING TO EXAMINE RISKS OF SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL

IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES ACROSS THE FIRM. WE USE A VARIETY OF STRESS TESTING TECHNIQUES TO CALCULATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF MARKET MOVES ON THE FIRMS PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, SCENARIO ANALYSIS

AND FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. THE RESULTS OF OUR VARIOUS STRESS TESTS ARE ANALYZED TOGETHER FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A MARKET MOVE IN A SINGLE RISK FACTOR ACROSS ALL POSITIONS (E.G., EQUITY PRICES OR

CREDIT SPREADS) USING A VARIETY OF DEFINED MARKET SHOCKS, RANGING FROM THOSE THAT COULD BE EXPECTED OVER A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON UP TO THOSE THAT COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS TO OCCUR. WE ALSO USE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT

OF A SINGLE CORPORATE ENTITY, WHICH CAPTURES THE RISK OF LARGE OR CONCENTRATED EXPOSURES.

SCENARIO ANALYSIS IS USED TO

QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A SPECIFIED EVENT, INCLUDING HOW THE EVENT IMPACTS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS SIMULTANEOUSLY. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR SOVEREIGN STRESS TESTING WE CALCULATE POTENTIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOVEREIGN INVENTORY AS WELL AS THE

CORRESPONDING DEBT, EQUITY AND CURRENCY EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NON-SOVEREIGN INVENTORY THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE SOVEREIGN DISTRESS. WHEN CONDUCTING SCENARIO ANALYSIS, WE TYPICALLY CONSIDER A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR EACH SCENARIO,

RANGING FROM MODERATE TO SEVERELY ADVERSE MARKET IMPACTS. IN ADDITION, THESE STRESS TESTS ARE CONSTRUCTED USING BOTH HISTORICAL EVENTS AND FORWARD-LOOKING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS.

FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTING COMBINES MARKET, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL AND LIQUIDITY RISKS INTO A SINGLE COMBINED SCENARIO. FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS

ARE PRIMARILY USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS; HOWEVER, WE ALSO ENSURE THAT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTING IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. THIS INCLUDES SELECTING APPROPRIATE

SCENARIOS TO USE FOR OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS. SEE EQUITY CAPITAL  CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS ABOVE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

UNLIKE VAR MEASURES, WHICH HAVE AN IMPLIED PROBABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE CALCULATED AT A

SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THERE IS GENERALLY NO IMPLIED PROBABILITY THAT OUR STRESS TEST SCENARIOS WILL OCCUR. INSTEAD, STRESS TESTS ARE USED TO MODEL BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MOVES IN UNDERLYING MARKET FACTORS. WHEN ESTIMATING POTENTIAL

LOSS, WE GENERALLY ASSUME THAT OUR POSITIONS CANNOT BE REDUCED OR HEDGED (ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO DO SO).

STRESS TEST SCENARIOS ARE CONDUCTED ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF THE FIRMS ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET EVENTS OR CONCERNS. STRESS TESTING IS AN

IMPORTANT PART OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO QUANTIFY OUR EXPOSURE TO TAIL RISKS, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, UNDERTAKE RISK/REWARD ANALYSIS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR RISK POSITIONS.

LIMITS

WE USE RISK

LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS IN THE FIRM (INCLUDING FIRMWIDE, PRODUCT AND BUSINESS) TO GOVERN RISK APPETITE BY CONTROLLING THE SIZE OF OUR EXPOSURES TO MARKET RISK. LIMITS ARE SET BASED ON VAR AND ON A RANGE OF STRESS TESTS RELEVANT TO THE FIRMS

EXPOSURES. LIMITS ARE REVIEWED FREQUENTLY AND AMENDED ON A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BASIS TO REFLECT CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR TOLERANCE FOR RISK.

THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE SETS MARKET RISK LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE AND PRODUCT LEVELS AND OUR SECURITIES DIVISION RISK COMMITTEE SETS SUB-LIMITS FOR MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES AT A BUSINESS

LEVEL. THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRMWIDE LIMITS IS TO ASSIST SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN CONTROLLING THE FIRMS OVERALL RISK PROFILE. SUB-LIMITS SET THE DESIRED MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE THAT MAY BE MANAGED BY ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS

WITHOUT ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, EFFECTIVELY LEAVING DAY-TO-DAY TRADING DECISIONS TO INDIVIDUAL DESK MANAGERS AND TRADERS. ACCORDINGLY, SUB-LIMITS ARE A MANAGEMENT TOOL DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE ESCALATION RATHER THAN TO

ESTABLISH MAXIMUM RISK TOLERANCE. SUB-LIMITS ALSO DISTRIBUTE RISK AMONG VARIOUS BUSINESSES IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR LEVEL OF ACTIVITY AND CLIENT DEMAND, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF EACH AREA.

OUR MARKET RISK LIMITS ARE MONITORED DAILY BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED. THE BUSINESS-LEVEL LIMITS THAT ARE SET BY THE SECURITIES DIVISION RISK COMMITTEE ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME SCRUTINY AND LIMIT ESCALATION POLICY AS THE

FIRMWIDE LIMITS.

WHEN A RISK LIMIT HAS BEEN EXCEEDED (E.G., DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED

VOLATILITIES OR CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS), IT IS REPORTED TO THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE AND A DISCUSSION TAKES PLACE WITH THE RELEVANT DESK MANAGERS, AFTER WHICH EITHER THE RISK POSITION IS REDUCED OR THE RISK LIMIT IS TEMPORARILY OR

PERMANENTLY INCREASED.

MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION

OUR VAR AND STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND VALIDATION BY OUR INDEPENDENT MODEL VALIDATION GROUP AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES.



A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE MODEL, ITS THEORETICAL SOUNDNESS AND ADEQUACY FOR INTENDED USE;



VERIFICATION OF THE TESTING STRATEGY UTILIZED BY THE MODEL DEVELOPERS TO ENSURE THAT THE MODEL FUNCTIONS AS INTENDED; AND



VERIFICATION OF THE SUITABILITY OF THE CALCULATION TECHNIQUES INCORPORATED IN THE MODEL.

OUR VAR AND STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED AND ENHANCED IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF POSITIONS

INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS MARKET RISK MEASURES, AS WELL AS VARIATIONS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND/OR MODELS, WE PERFORM MODEL VALIDATION AND TEST RUNS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR VAR AND

STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED WITH THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

WE EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF OUR VAR MODEL THROUGH DAILY BACKTESTING (I.E., COMPARING DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES TO THE VAR MEASURE CALCULATED AS OF THE PRIOR BUSINESS DAY) AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL AND FOR

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND MAJOR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CHART BELOW REFLECTS THE VAR OVER THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS.

DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES ARE COMPARED WITH VAR CALCULATED AS OF THE END OF THE PRIOR

BUSINESS DAY. TRADING LOSSES INCURRED ON A SINGLE DAY DID NOT EXCEED OUR 95% ONE-DAY VAR DURING 2013 OR 2012 (I.E., A VAR EXCEPTION).

DURING PERIODS IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE NET REVENUE DAYS THAN NET REVENUE LOSS DAYS, WE EXPECT TO HAVE FEWER VAR EXCEPTIONS BECAUSE, UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL

GENERALLY PRODUCES POSITIVE NET REVENUES. IN PERIODS IN WHICH OUR FRANCHISE

REVENUES ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WE GENERALLY HAVE MORE LOSS DAYS, RESULTING IN MORE VAR EXCEPTIONS. IN ADDITION, VAR BACKTESTING IS PERFORMED AGAINST TOTAL DAILY MARKET-MAKING REVENUES,

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY OF A COUNTERPARTY (E.G., AN OTC DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY OR A BORROWER) OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR

OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK COMES MOSTLY FROM CLIENT TRANSACTIONS IN OTC DERIVATIVES AND LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. CREDIT RISK ALSO COMES FROM CASH PLACED WITH BANKS, SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS (I.E., RESALE

AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES) AND RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS, CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK

AT THE FIRM. THE CREDIT POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE ESTABLISH AND REVIEW CREDIT POLICIES AND PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD OTHER POSITIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK (E.G., BONDS HELD IN OUR INVENTORY AND SECONDARY BANK

LOANS). THESE CREDIT RISKS ARE CAPTURED AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK MEASURES, WHICH ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, CONSISTENT WITH OTHER INVENTORY POSITIONS. THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK

EXPOSURES. SUCH DERIVATIVES ALSO GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK WHICH IS MONITORED AND MANAGED BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT.

POLICIES AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE CREDIT POLICY COMMITTEE PRESCRIBE THE LEVEL OF FORMAL APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR THE

FIRM TO ASSUME CREDIT EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY ACROSS ALL PRODUCT AREAS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY APPLICABLE NETTING PROVISIONS, COLLATERAL OR OTHER CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK REQUIRES ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION, A HIGH LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF CUSTOMERS, COUNTRIES, INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS. OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING CREDIT

RISK INCLUDES.



APPROVING TRANSACTIONS AND SETTING AND COMMUNICATING CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;



MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;



ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A COUNTERPARTY WILL DEFAULT ON ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS;



MEASURING THE FIRMS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT;



REPORTING OF CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD AND REGULATORS;



USE OF CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS, INCLUDING COLLATERAL AND HEDGING; AND



COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION WITH OTHER INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS SUCH AS OPERATIONS, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE.

AS PART OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS, CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PERFORMS CREDIT REVIEWS WHICH INCLUDE INITIAL

AND ONGOING ANALYSES OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES. A CREDIT REVIEW IS AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT ABOUT THE CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS OF A COUNTERPARTY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, THE CORE OF OUR PROCESS IS

AN ANNUAL COUNTERPARTY REVIEW. A COUNTERPARTY REVIEW IS A WRITTEN ANALYSIS OF A COUNTERPARTYS BUSINESS PROFILE AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RESULTING IN AN INTERNAL CREDIT RATING WHICH REPRESENTS THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ON FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS

TO THE FIRM. THE DETERMINATION OF INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS INCORPORATES ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COUNTERPARTYS FUTURE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, THE NATURE AND OUTLOOK FOR THE COUNTERPARTYS INDUSTRY, AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. SENIOR

PERSONNEL WITHIN CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, WITH EXPERTISE IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, INSPECT AND APPROVE CREDIT REVIEWS AND INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS.

OUR GLOBAL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CAPTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES (ECONOMIC GROUPS). THESE SYSTEMS ALSO

PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON OUR AGGREGATE CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT, INTERNAL CREDIT RATING, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND REGION.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RISK MEASURES AND LIMITS

WE MEASURE OUR CREDIT RISK BASED ON THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN AN EVENT OF NON-PAYMENT BY A COUNTERPARTY. FOR DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, THE PRIMARY MEASURE IS POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, WHICH

IS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR LOANS AND LENDING

COMMITMENTS, THE PRIMARY MEASURE IS A FUNCTION OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE POSITION. WE ALSO MONITOR CREDIT RISK IN TERMS OF CURRENT EXPOSURE, WHICH IS THE AMOUNT PRESENTLY OWED TO THE FIRM AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT APPLICABLE NETTING AND

COLLATERAL.

WE USE CREDIT LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS (COUNTERPARTY, ECONOMIC GROUP, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY) TO CONTROL THE SIZE OF

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES. LIMITS FOR COUNTERPARTIES AND ECONOMIC GROUPS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND REVISED TO REFLECT CHANGING APPETITES FOR A GIVEN COUNTERPARTY OR GROUP OF COUNTERPARTIES. LIMITS FOR INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES ARE BASED ON THE

FIRMS RISK TOLERANCE AND ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR REGULAR MONITORING, REVIEW, ESCALATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS.

STRESS

TESTS/SCENARIO ANALYSIS

WE USE REGULAR STRESS TESTS TO CALCULATE THE CREDIT EXPOSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS

THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING SHOCKS TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS OR CREDIT RISK FACTORS (E.G., CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES). THESE SHOCKS INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVEMENTS. SOME OF OUR STRESS

TESTS INCLUDE SHOCKS TO MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS, CONSISTENT WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF A SEVERE MARKET OR ECONOMIC EVENT. IN THE CASE OF SOVEREIGN DEFAULT, WE ESTIMATE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT ON OUR SOVEREIGN CREDIT EXPOSURES, CHANGES TO OUR

CREDIT EXPOSURES ARISING FROM POTENTIAL MARKET MOVES IN RESPONSE TO THE DEFAULT, AND THE IMPACT OF CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SOVEREIGN DEFAULT. UNLIKE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, WHICH IS

CALCULATED WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, WITH A STRESS TEST THERE IS GENERALLY NO ASSUMED PROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING.

WE RUN STRESS TESTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET DEVELOPMENTS. STRESS TESTS ARE REGULARLY

CONDUCTED JOINTLY WITH THE FIRMS MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK FUNCTIONS.

RISK MITIGANTS

TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY ENTER INTO NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH

COUNTERPARTIES. WE MAY ALSO REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH COUNTERPARTIES BY ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM THEM ON AN UPFRONT OR CONTINGENT BASIS AND/OR TO TERMINATE TRANSACTIONS IF THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT RATING

FALLS BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL. WE MONITOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL ON A DAILY BASIS TO ENSURE THAT OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE APPROPRIATELY COLLATERALIZED. WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURES WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN

THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES AND THE MARKET VALUE OF COLLATERAL WE RECEIVE.

FOR LOANS AND LENDING

COMMITMENTS, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE BORROWER AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL RISK MITIGANTS. RISK MITIGANTS INCLUDE: COLLATERAL PROVISIONS, GUARANTEES, COVENANTS, STRUCTURAL SENIORITY OF

THE BANK LOAN CLAIMS AND, FOR CERTAIN LENDING COMMITMENTS, PROVISIONS IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION THAT ALLOW THE FIRM TO ADJUST LOAN AMOUNTS, PRICING, STRUCTURE AND OTHER TERMS AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE TYPE AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MITIGANTS

EMPLOYED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK INVOLVED IN A LOAN.

WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT

VISIBILITY INTO A COUNTERPARTYS FINANCIAL STRENGTH OR WHEN WE BELIEVE A COUNTERPARTY REQUIRES SUPPORT FROM ITS PARENT COMPANY, WE MAY OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS. WE MAY ALSO MITIGATE OUR CREDIT RISK

USING CREDIT DERIVATIVES OR PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.

CREDIT EXPOSURES

AS OF DECEMBER 2013, OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES DECREASED AS COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2012, PRIMARILY REFLECTING DECREASES IN OTC

DERIVATIVES, CASH AND SECURITIES FINANCING EXPOSURES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ARISING FROM NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE COUNTERPARTIES (BASED ON OUR INTERNALLY DETERMINED PUBLIC

RATING AGENCY EQUIVALENTS) INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 2012, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. DURING 2013, COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTS PRIMARILY OCCURRED WITHIN OTC DERIVATIVES AND LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. THE

NUMBER OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTS DURING 2013 REMAINED LOW AND WAS LESS THAN 0.5% OF ALL COUNTERPARTIES. COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTS WERE HIGHER IN 2013 (THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 10 ADDITIONAL DEFAULTS COMPARED WITH 2012), PRIMARILY RELATED TO OTC

DERIVATIVES. ESTIMATED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEFAULTS WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AND WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE BOTH INTEREST-BEARING AND NON-INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS. TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CREDIT LOSS, WE PLACE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DEPOSITS

WITH HIGHLY-RATED BANKS AND CENTRAL BANKS.

OTC DERIVATIVES.

THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE ON OTC DERIVATIVES ARISES PRIMARILY FROM OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM, AS A MARKET MAKER, ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS AND

TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER AND HEDGING OF THEIR RISKS. THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. WE MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON OTC DERIVATIVES USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES, LIMITS AND RISK MITIGANTS

DESCRIBED ABOVE.

DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR A GIVEN COUNTERPARTY) WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED OR POSTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS. WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO OTC DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS UNDER BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH DAILY EXCHANGE OF COLLATERAL.

AS CREDIT RISK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM INCLUDES A CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA) IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK,

AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2013

FORM 10-K.

CVA IS A FUNCTION OF THE

PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED EXPOSURE, THE PROBABILITY OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT AND THE ASSUMED RECOVERY UPON DEFAULT.

THE

TABLES BELOW PRESENT THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR EXPOSURE TO OTC DERIVATIVES BY TENOR, BASED ON EXPECTED DURATION FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND GENERALLY ON REMAINING CONTRACTUAL MATURITY FOR OTHER DERIVATIVES, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE

EFFECT OF COLLATERAL AND NETTING AGREEMENTS. RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ACROSS TENOR CATEGORIES ARE NETTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED IS NETTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS. RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE BALANCES WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY IN THE SAME TENOR CATEGORY ARE NETTED WITHIN SUCH TENOR CATEGORY. NET CREDIT EXPOSURE IN THE TABLES BELOW REPRESENTS OTC DERIVATIVE ASSETS, ALL OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE, LESS CASH COLLATERAL AND THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, RECEIVED UNDER CREDIT

SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, WHICH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS WHEN DETERMINING CREDIT RISK, BUT SUCH COLLATERAL IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR NETTING UNDER U.S. GAAP. THE CATEGORIES SHOWN REFLECT OUR INTERNALLY DETERMINED PUBLIC RATING AGENCY EQUIVALENTS.

LENDING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES.

WE MANAGE THE FIRMS LENDING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES, LIMITS AND RISK MITIGANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. OTHER LENDING POSITIONS,

INCLUDING SECONDARY TRADING POSITIONS, ARE RISK-MANAGED AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK.



LENDING ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRMS

LENDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE LENDING TO INVESTMENT-GRADE AND NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BORROWERS. LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES ARE PRINCIPALLY USED FOR OPERATING LIQUIDITY AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES OR IN

CONNECTION WITH CONTINGENT ACQUISITIONS. THE FIRMS LENDING ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDE EXTENDING LOANS TO BORROWERS THAT ARE SECURED BY COMMERCIAL AND OTHER REAL ESTATE. SEE THE TABLES BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LENDING ACTIVITIES.



SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATE CLIENT ACTIVITIES, INVEST EXCESS CASH, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND FINANCE CERTAIN FIRM ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM BEARS CREDIT RISK

RELATED TO RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT CASH ADVANCED OR THE VALUE OF SECURITIES PLEDGED OR DELIVERED TO THE COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED. THE FIRM ALSO HAS CREDIT EXPOSURE ON

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LOANED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALUE OF SECURITIES PLEDGED OR DELIVERED TO THE COUNTERPARTY FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF CASH OR COLLATERAL RECEIVED. SECURITIES COLLATERAL OBTAINED FOR SECURITIES

FINANCING TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY INCLUDES U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. WE MANAGE OUR CREDIT RISK ON SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES, LIMITS

AND RISK MITIGANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $29 BILLION AND $37 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY, OF CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS REFLECTING BOTH NETTING

AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL THAT MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS WHEN DETERMINING CREDIT RISK.



OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES.

THE FIRM IS

EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK FROM ITS RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF INITIAL CASH MARGIN PLACED WITH

CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SALES OF SECURITIES WHICH HAVE TRADED, BUT NOT YET SETTLED. THESE RECEIVABLES GENERALLY HAVE MINIMAL CREDIT RISK DUE TO THE LOW PROBABILITY OF CLEARING ORGANIZATION DEFAULT AND THE SHORT-TERM NATURE

OF RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SECURITIES SETTLEMENTS. RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF COLLATERALIZED RECEIVABLES RELATED TO CUSTOMER SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND GENERALLY HAVE MINIMAL CREDIT RISK DUE TO BOTH THE

VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE RECEIVABLES. OUR NET CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $18 BILLION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, AND WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED

OF INITIAL MARGIN (BOTH CASH AND SECURITIES) PLACED WITH CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM EXTENDS OTHER LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS TO ITS PRIVATE WEALTH CLIENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY LONGER-TERM IN NATURE AND ARE PRIMARILY

SECURED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE OR OTHER ASSETS. THE GROSS EXPOSURE RELATED TO SUCH LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $11 BILLION AND $7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

COLLATERAL RECEIVED AGAINST SUCH LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS EXCEEDED THE GROSS EXPOSURE AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012.

SELECTED COUNTRY EXPOSURES

THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUING CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON

THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM AND A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT CREDIT DETERIORATION. THE MOST PRONOUNCED MARKET CONCERNS RELATE TO GREECE, IRELAND, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN. THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT OUR CREDIT

EXPOSURE (BOTH GROSS AND NET OF HEDGES) TO ALL SOVEREIGNS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CORPORATE COUNTERPARTIES OR BORROWERS IN THESE COUNTRIES. CREDIT EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY

OF A COUNTERPARTY OR BORROWER. IN ADDITION, THE TABLES INCLUDE THE MARKET EXPOSURE OF OUR LONG AND SHORT INVENTORY FOR WHICH THE ISSUER OR UNDERLIER IS LOCATED IN THESE COUNTRIES.

MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS IN VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY DUE TO CHANGES

IN MARKET PRICES. THERE IS NO OVERLAP BETWEEN THE CREDIT AND MARKET EXPOSURES IN THE TABLES BELOW.

THE COUNTRY OF RISK IS

DETERMINED BY THE LOCATION OF THE COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR UNDERLIERS ASSETS, WHERE THEY GENERATE REVENUE, THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE HEADQUARTERED, AND/OR THE GOVERNMENT WHOSE POLICIES AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

TO SUPPLEMENT OUR REGULAR STRESS TESTS, WE CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC BASIS

IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS THAT WE DEEM SIGNIFICANT. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RESPONSE TO THE EURO AREA DEBT CRISIS, WE CONDUCTED STRESS TESTS INTENDED TO ESTIMATE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACT THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE EVENTS

INVOLVING CERTAIN EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS AND THE EXIT OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES FROM THE EURO AREA. IN THE STRESS TESTS, DESCRIBED IN MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  STRESS TESTING AND CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT  STRESS TESTS/SCENARIO ANALYSIS, WE ESTIMATED THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE EVENT ON OUR CREDIT AND MARKET EXPOSURES RESULTING FROM SHOCKS TO RISK FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, AND

EQUITY PRICES. THE PARAMETERS OF THESE SHOCKS VARIED BASED ON THE SCENARIO REFLECTED IN EACH STRESS TEST. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE INDIRECT IMPACT ON OUR EXPOSURES ARISING FROM POTENTIAL MARKET MOVES IN RESPONSE TO THE EVENT, SUCH AS THE IMPACT OF

CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ALONG WITH THE SHOCKS TO THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE REVIEWED ESTIMATED LOSSES PRODUCED BY THE STRESS TESTS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MAGNITUDE, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL

LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURES WHERE NECESSARY.

EURO AREA EXIT SCENARIOS INCLUDED ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS ON EXPOSURE THAT MIGHT RESULT

FROM THE REDENOMINATION OF ASSETS IN THE EXITING COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES. WE ALSO TESTED OUR OPERATIONAL AND RISK MANAGEMENT READINESS AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO A REDENOMINATION EVENT. CONSTRUCTING STRESS TESTS FOR THESE SCENARIOS REQUIRES MANY

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW EXPOSURES MIGHT BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED AND HOW RESULTING SECONDARY MARKET MOVES WOULD INDIRECTLY IMPACT SUCH EXPOSURES. GIVEN THE MULTIPLE PARAMETERS INVOLVED IN SUCH SCENARIOS, LOSSES FROM SUCH EVENTS ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO

QUANTIFY AND MAY MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  MODELED LIQUIDITY

OUTFLOW, MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  STRESS TESTING AND CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  STRESS TESTS/SCENARIO ANALYSIS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK ARISES FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING

ERRORS AS WELL AS EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENTS, SUCH AS MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILURES. POTENTIAL TYPES OF LOSS EVENTS RELATED TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDE.



CLIENTS, PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES;



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT;



BUSINESS DISRUPTION AND SYSTEM FAILURES;



EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND WORKPLACE SAFETY;



DAMAGE TO PHYSICAL ASSETS;



INTERNAL FRAUD; AND



EXTERNAL FRAUD.

WE MAINTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A WELL-CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL RISKS. THE FIRMWIDE OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE, ALONG WITH THE SUPPORT OF REGIONAL

OR ENTITY-SPECIFIC WORKING GROUPS OR COMMITTEES, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK POLICIES AND FRAMEWORK. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS A RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF OUR

REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, REPORTS TO THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES, METHODOLOGIES AND A FORMALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT WITH THE GOAL OF MINIMIZING OUR EXPOSURE TO

OPERATIONAL RISK.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION AS WELL AS A STRONG CONTROL CULTURE. WE SEEK TO MANAGE OUR OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH.



THE TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE;



THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS ACROSS THE FIRM;



INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS THAT MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK ON A DAILY BASIS, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EXTENSIVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES,

AND CONTROLS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS;



PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS; AND



A NETWORK OF SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM TO FACILITATE THE COLLECTION OF DATA USED TO ANALYZE AND ASSESS OUR OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE.

WE COMBINE TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES TO MANAGE AND MEASURE OPERATIONAL RISK. FROM A TOP-DOWN

PERSPECTIVE, THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT ASSESSES FIRMWIDE AND BUSINESS LEVEL OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILES. FROM A BOTTOM-UP PERSPECTIVE, REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ON

A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING, MITIGATING, AND ESCALATING OPERATIONAL RISKS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

OUR OPERATIONAL

RISK FRAMEWORK IS IN PART DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER BASEL II AND HAS EVOLVED BASED ON THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE. OUR FRAMEWORK COMPRISES THE FOLLOWING PRACTICES.



RISK IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING;



RISK MEASUREMENT; AND



RISK MONITORING.

INTERNAL AUDIT PERFORMS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING OUR KEY CONTROLS, PROCESSES AND APPLICATIONS, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FRAMEWORK.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING

THE CORE OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS RISK IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING. WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, INCLUDING FIRMWIDE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, FOR OPERATIONAL

RISK EVENTS.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MANAGERS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND

SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO ESCALATE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WHEN OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS ARE IDENTIFIED, OUR POLICIES REQUIRE THAT THE EVENTS BE DOCUMENTED AND ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES ARE REQUIRED IN OUR SYSTEMS AND/OR PROCESSES TO FURTHER

MITIGATE THE RISK OF FUTURE EVENTS.

IN ADDITION, OUR FIRMWIDE SYSTEMS CAPTURE INTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA, KEY

METRICS SUCH AS TRANSACTION VOLUMES, AND STATISTICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS PERFORMANCE TRENDS. WE USE AN INTERNALLY-DEVELOPED OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION TO AGGREGATE AND ORGANIZE THIS INFORMATION. MANAGERS FROM BOTH REVENUE-PRODUCING

UNITS AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ANALYZE THE INFORMATION TO EVALUATE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES AND IDENTIFY BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES OR PRODUCTS WITH HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL RISK. WE ALSO PROVIDE PERIODIC OPERATIONAL RISK

REPORTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RISK COMMITTEES AND THE BOARD.

RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MEASURE OUR OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE OVER A TWELVE-MONTH TIME HORIZON USING BOTH STATISTICAL MODELING AND SCENARIO ANALYSES, WHICH

INVOLVE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE POTENTIAL FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF POTENTIAL OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES, FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES. OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT INCORPORATES QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF FACTORS INCLUDING.



INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA;



ASSESSMENTS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS;



EVALUATIONS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;



THE DEGREE OF AND POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION IN OUR PROCESSES;



NEW PRODUCT INFORMATION;



THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT;



CHANGES IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THE DIVERSITY AND SOPHISTICATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES; AND



THE LIQUIDITY OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE RELIABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE RESULTS FROM THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES ARE USED TO MONITOR CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RISK

AND TO DETERMINE BUSINESS LINES THAT MAY HAVE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK. THESE ANALYSES ULTIMATELY ARE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL TO HOLD.

RISK MONITORING

WE EVALUATE

CHANGES IN THE OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILE OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX OR JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BY MONITORING THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AT A FIRMWIDE LEVEL. WE HAVE BOTH DETECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS,

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES AND THE PROBABILITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WE MONITOR THE RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS AND INDEPENDENT INTERNAL AUDITS OF THESE INTERNAL CONTROLS.

CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL,

REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE RISKS, SEE OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT. A SUMMARY OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES FOLLOWS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY, SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE 2013

FORM 10-K.



OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.



OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE HAVE

NET LONG POSITIONS, RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL.



OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF

OBTAINING CREDIT.



OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY.



OUR INVESTMENT BANKING, CLIENT EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

(THE FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL

EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS

ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 WAS EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED

IN THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON PAGE 122, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL

BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

CONSOLIDATION

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE

ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY OR A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE).

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE

ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE LOSSES OF THE ENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE ENTITY. THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VOTING

INTEREST ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. IF THE FIRM HAS A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, THE ENTITY IS CONSOLIDATED.

VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES.

A VIE IS AN ENTITY THAT LACKS ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY. THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE WHEN THE FIRM HAS ONE OR

MORE VARIABLE INTERESTS THAT PROVIDE IT WITH (I) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND (II) THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. SEE NOTE 11 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT VIES.

EQUITY-METHOD

INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT CAN EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, THE

INVESTMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR EITHER (I) UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING OR (II) AT FAIR VALUE BY ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AVAILABLE UNDER U.S. GAAP. SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE GENERALLY EXISTS WHEN THE FIRM OWNS 20% TO 50% OF THE

ENTITYS COMMON STOCK OR IN-SUBSTANCE COMMON STOCK.

IN GENERAL, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED AFTER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION BECAME AVAILABLE, AT FAIR VALUE. IN

CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM APPLIES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO NEW INVESTMENTS THAT ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR CLOSELY RELATED TO THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHEN THE FIRM HAS A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH

FLOWS OR OPERATIONS OF THE INVESTEE OR WHEN COST-BENEFIT CONSIDERATIONS ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT. SEE NOTE 12 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENT FUNDS.

THE FIRM HAS FORMED NUMEROUS INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THESE FUNDS ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM ACTS AS GENERAL

PARTNER OR MANAGER. GENERALLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THESE FUNDS. THESE FUNDS ARE USUALLY VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES AND GENERALLY ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS TYPICALLY HAVE RIGHTS TO

TERMINATE THE FUNDS OR TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGER. INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTES 6, 18 AND 22 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN

FUNDS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH RELATE TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL

AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION BUT ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT

FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE EITHER UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN OF ITS

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE BY ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS. FAIR VALUE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE

GENERALLY INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING FOR POSITIONS IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS FOR POSITIONS IN INVESTING & LENDING. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS.

INVESTMENT BANKING.

FEES FROM FINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS AND UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE SERVICES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION ARE COMPLETED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ASSIGNMENT.

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OR THE ASSIGNMENT IS OTHERWISE CONCLUDED. EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS ARE RECORDED AS NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES, NET OF

CLIENT REIMBURSEMENTS. UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE PRESENTED NET OF RELATED EXPENSES.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM EARNS MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES FOR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES. MANAGEMENT FEES FOR MUTUAL FUNDS ARE

CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF DAILY NET ASSET VALUE AND ARE RECEIVED MONTHLY. MANAGEMENT FEES FOR HEDGE FUNDS AND SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF MONTH-END NET ASSET VALUE AND ARE GENERALLY RECEIVED QUARTERLY.

MANAGEMENT FEES FOR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF MONTHLY INVESTED CAPITAL OR COMMITMENTS AND ARE RECEIVED QUARTERLY, SEMI-ANNUALLY OR ANNUALLY, DEPENDING ON THE FUND. ALL MANAGEMENT FEES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD THAT

THE RELATED SERVICE IS PROVIDED. INCENTIVE FEES ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS OR SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS RETURN, OR EXCESS RETURN ABOVE A SPECIFIED BENCHMARK OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGET. INCENTIVE FEES ARE GENERALLY BASED

ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD OR OVER THE LIFE OF A FUND. FEES THAT ARE BASED ON PERFORMANCE OVER A

12-MONTH

PERIOD ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. FOR

FEES THAT ARE BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE LIFE OF THE FUND, FUTURE INVESTMENT UNDERPERFORMANCE MAY REQUIRE FEES PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM TO BE RETURNED TO THE FUND. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN ALL MATERIAL

CONTINGENCIES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEE REVENUES ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES.

THE FIRM MAKES PAYMENTS TO BROKERS AND ADVISORS RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE FIRMS INVESTMENT FUNDS. THESE PAYMENTS ARE COMPUTED BASED ON EITHER A PERCENTAGE OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE OR THE

INVESTMENT FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE. WHERE THE FIRM IS PRINCIPAL TO THE ARRANGEMENT, SUCH COSTS ARE RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS AND INCLUDED IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, AND WHERE THE FIRM IS AGENT TO THE

ARRANGEMENT, SUCH COSTS ARE RECORDED ON A NET BASIS IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES.

EXECUTED.

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES WHEN THE FIRM HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED. FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, ANY RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES. ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM THE FIRMS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, THE ASSETS REMAIN IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND THE TRANSFER IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A COLLATERALIZED FINANCING, WITH THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION. SEE

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE FIRM DEFINES CASH EQUIVALENTS AS HIGHLY LIQUID OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS HELD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES GENERALLY RELATE TO COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS. SUCH RECEIVABLES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF

CUSTOMER MARGIN LOANS, CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED LOANS RATHER THAN PURCHASES AT FAIR VALUE, COLLATERAL POSTED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING REVENUES. RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES NOT

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT AMORTIZED COST NET OF ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. INTEREST ON RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION

RECEIVABLES FROM AND PAYABLES TO BROKERS, DEALERS AND

CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS

RECEIVABLES FROM AND PAYABLES TO BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT

COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH GENERALLY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IN NOTES 6, 7 AND 8. HAD THESE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL WOULD HAVE

BEEN CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 AS OF DECEMBER 2013.

PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES

ACTIVITIES. PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH GENERALLY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE PAYABLES ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT

FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IN NOTES 6, 7 AND 8. HAD THESE PAYABLES BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 AS OF DECEMBER 2013.

OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

TO REDUCE CREDIT EXPOSURES ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS OR

SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, NETTING AGREEMENTS) WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT IT TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. A NETTING AGREEMENT IS A CONTRACT WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT PERMITS NET SETTLEMENT OF MULTIPLE

TRANSACTIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, INCLUDING UPON THE EXERCISE OF TERMINATION RIGHTS BY A NON-DEFAULTING PARTY. UPON EXERCISE OF SUCH TERMINATION RIGHTS, ALL TRANSACTIONS GOVERNED BY THE NETTING AGREEMENT ARE TERMINATED AND A NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT

IS CALCULATED. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM RECEIVES AND POSTS CASH AND SECURITIES COLLATERAL WITH RESPECT TO ITS DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE RELATED CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS

(COLLECTIVELY, CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS). AN ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENT GRANTS THE NON-DEFAULTING PARTY EXERCISING TERMINATION RIGHTS THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE THE COLLATERAL AND APPLY THE PROCEEDS TO ANY AMOUNTS OWED. IN ORDER TO ASSESS

ENFORCEABILITY OF THE FIRMS RIGHT OF SETOFF UNDER NETTING AND CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM EVALUATES VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING APPLICABLE BANKRUPTCY LAWS, LOCAL STATUTES AND REGULATORY PROVISIONS IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE PARTIES TO

THE AGREEMENT.

DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR A GIVEN COUNTERPARTY) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED

TRANSACTIONS WITH THE SAME TERM AND CURRENCY ARE PRESENTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN SUCH TRANSACTIONS MEET CERTAIN SETTLEMENT CRITERIA AND ARE SUBJECT TO NETTING AGREEMENTS.

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND POSTED

UNDER ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, WHEN TRANSACTED UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED ARE NOT REPORTED

NET OF THE RELATED CASH AND SECURITIES RECEIVED OR POSTED AS COLLATERAL. SEE NOTE 9 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PLEDGED, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO DELIVER OR REPLEDGE COLLATERAL. SEE NOTES 7 AND 9 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT OFFSETTING.

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM SOLD A MAJORITY STAKE IN EACH OF ITS AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS (APRIL 2013) AND ITS EUROPEAN INSURANCE BUSINESS (DECEMBER 2013). AS A RESULT, THE FIRM NO LONGER CONSOLIDATES THESE

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS MARKET MAKING REVENUES BY MAJOR PRODUCT TYPE, AS WELL

THE GAINS/(LOSSES) IN THE TABLE ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRM

MANAGES ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES BECAUSE MANY OF THE FIRMS MARKET-MAKING AND CLIENT FACILITATION STRATEGIES UTILIZE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACROSS VARIOUS PRODUCT TYPES. ACCORDINGLY, GAINS OR LOSSES IN ONE PRODUCT TYPE FREQUENTLY OFFSET GAINS OR

LOSSES IN OTHER PRODUCT TYPES. FOR EXAMPLE, MOST OF THE FIRMS LONGER-TERM DERIVATIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND MAY BE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS. SIMILARLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS CASH

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

NOTE 5.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN

ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT

INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS. THE FIRM MEASURES CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AS A PORTFOLIO (I.E., BASED ON ITS NET EXPOSURE TO MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISKS).

THE BEST EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE IS A QUOTED PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, QUOTED

PRICES OR RECENT TRANSACTIONS IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS, OR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED PARAMETERS AS INPUTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES,

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY PRICES, CREDIT SPREADS AND FUNDING SPREADS (I.E., THE SPREAD, OR DIFFERENCE, BETWEEN THE INTEREST RATE AT WHICH A BORROWER COULD FINANCE A GIVEN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RELATIVE TO A BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE).

U.S. GAAP HAS A THREE-LEVEL FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

PRIORITIZES INPUTS TO THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, GIVING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO LEVEL 1 INPUTS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO LEVEL 3 INPUTS. A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON

THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO ITS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1.

INPUTS ARE

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS TO WHICH THE FIRM HAD ACCESS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2.

INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.

LEVEL 3.

ONE OR MORE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND UNOBSERVABLE.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON

OBSERVABLE PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET

PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE FOR FACTORS SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET

CASH INSTRUMENTS

CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES, AND OTHER NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED. SEE BELOW FOR

THE TYPES OF CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN EACH LEVEL OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY AND THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND SIGNIFICANT INPUTS USED TO DETERMINE THEIR FAIR VALUES. SEE NOTE 5 FOR AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT POLICIES.

LEVEL 1 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 1 CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND MOST NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVELY TRADED LISTED EQUITIES, CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND MONEY MARKET

INSTRUMENTS. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL UNRESTRICTED INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME BOTH IN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND RELATIVE TO

THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION FOR THE INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS BASED ON BOTH THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS WITH TRADING ACTIVITY.

LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL

PAPER, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, MOST GOVERNMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, MOST CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED LOANS AND SECURITIES, CERTAIN BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE

LOANS, RESTRICTED OR LESS LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, MOST STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN LENDING COMMITMENTS.

VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS CAN BE VERIFIED TO QUOTED PRICES, RECENT

TRADING ACTIVITY FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE

RELATIONSHIP OF RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

TYPICALLY MADE TO LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS (I) IF THE CASH INSTRUMENT IS SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND/OR (II) FOR OTHER PREMIUMS AND LIQUIDITY DISCOUNTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE.

LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT VALUATION INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY,

LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRM USES OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF

INSTRUMENT. VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING VALUES REALIZED ON SALES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS.

SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE

FIRMS LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS. THESE RANGES REPRESENT THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE USED IN THE VALUATION OF EACH TYPE OF CASH INSTRUMENT. WEIGHTED AVERAGES IN THE TABLES BELOW ARE CALCULATED BY WEIGHTING EACH INPUT BY

THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RANGES AND WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THESE INPUTS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROPRIATE INPUTS TO USE WHEN

CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE CASH INSTRUMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HIGHEST MULTIPLE PRESENTED IN THE TABLES BELOW FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING A SPECIFIC PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENT BUT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING ANY OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE RANGES OF INPUTS PRESENTED BELOW DO NOT REPRESENT UNCERTAINTY IN, OR POSSIBLE RANGES OF, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF THE FIRMS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT CALCULATE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE

CASH INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE VALUED BASED ON THE

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE (NAV) OF THE INVESTMENT FUND. THE FIRM USES NAV AS ITS MEASURE OF FAIR VALUE FOR FUND INVESTMENTS WHEN (I) THE FUND INVESTMENT DOES NOT HAVE A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE AND (II) THE NAV OF THE INVESTMENT

FUND IS CALCULATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING MEASUREMENT OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT CALCULATE NAV PRIMARILY CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN FIRM-SPONSORED PRIVATE

EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS WHERE THE FIRM CO-INVESTS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS.

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS

PRIMARILY INVEST IN A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIES WORLDWIDE IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS, INCLUDING LEVERAGED BUYOUTS, RECAPITALIZATIONS, GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND DISTRESSED INVESTMENTS. CREDIT FUNDS GENERALLY INVEST IN LOANS AND OTHER FIXED INCOME

INSTRUMENTS AND ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING PRIVATE HIGH-YIELD CAPITAL FOR MID- TO LARGE-SIZED LEVERAGED AND MANAGEMENT BUYOUT TRANSACTIONS, RECAPITALIZATIONS, FINANCINGS, REFINANCINGS, ACQUISITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS FOR PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, PRIVATE

FAMILY COMPANIES AND CORPORATE ISSUERS. REAL ESTATE FUNDS INVEST GLOBALLY, PRIMARILY IN REAL ESTATE COMPANIES, LOAN PORTFOLIOS, DEBT RECAPITALIZATIONS AND PROPERTY. THE PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS ARE PRIMARILY CLOSED-END FUNDS IN

WHICH THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REDEMPTION. DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE RECEIVED FROM THESE FUNDS AS THE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE LIQUIDATED.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN HEDGE FUNDS, PRIMARILY MULTI-DISCIPLINARY HEDGE FUNDS THAT EMPLOY A FUNDAMENTAL BOTTOM-UP INVESTMENT APPROACH ACROSS VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND STRATEGIES INCLUDING LONG/SHORT

EQUITY, CREDIT, CONVERTIBLES, RISK ARBITRAGE, SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE ARBITRAGE. THESE INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS ARE GENERALLY REDEEMABLE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WITH 91 DAYS NOTICE, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM REDEMPTION LEVEL OF

25% OF THE FIRMS INITIAL INVESTMENTS AT ANY QUARTER-END; HOWEVER, THESE INVESTMENTS ALSO INCLUDE INTERESTS WHERE THE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE ILLIQUID IN NATURE, AND PROCEEDS FROM REDEMPTIONS WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED UNTIL THE UNDERLYING ASSETS

ARE LIQUIDATED.

MANY OF THE FUNDS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE COVERED FUNDS AS DEFINED BY THE VOLCKER

RULE OF THE U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT) WHICH HAS A CONFORMANCE PERIOD THAT ENDS IN JULY 2015 SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS THROUGH 2017.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MANAGE ITS EXISTING FUNDS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TRANSITION PERIODS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY

REDEEMING CERTAIN OF ITS INTERESTS IN HEDGE FUNDS TO COMPLY WITH THE VOLCKER RULE. SINCE MARCH 2012, THE FIRM HAS REDEEMED APPROXIMATELY $2.21 BILLION OF THESE INTERESTS IN HEDGE FUNDS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $1.15 BILLION DURING

2013 AND $1.06 BILLION DURING 2012.

FOR CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS COVERED FUNDS, IN ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE

VOLCKER RULE BY THE PRESCRIBED COMPLIANCE DATE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THE PARTICULAR FUNDS ARE NOT SOLD, THE FIRM MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUCH FUNDS. IF THAT OCCURS, THE FIRM COULD RECEIVE A VALUE FOR

ITS INVESTMENTS THAT IS LESS THAN THE THEN CARRYING VALUE, AS THERE COULD BE A LIMITED SECONDARY MARKET FOR THESE INVESTMENTS AND THE FIRM MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEM IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS.

NOTE 7. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

NOTE 7.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVES ARE INSTRUMENTS THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSET PRICES, INDICES,

REFERENCE RATES AND OTHER INPUTS, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVES MAY BE TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE (EXCHANGE-TRADED) OR THEY MAY BE PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY REFERRED TO AS OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS OTC DERIVATIVES ARE CLEARED AND SETTLED THROUGH CENTRAL CLEARING COUNTERPARTIES (OTC-CLEARED), WHILE OTHERS ARE BILATERAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN TWO COUNTERPARTIES (BILATERAL OTC).

MARKET-MAKING.

AS A

MARKET MAKER, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER AND HEDGING OF THEIR RISKS. IN THIS CAPACITY, THE FIRM TYPICALLY ACTS AS PRINCIPAL AND IS CONSEQUENTLY REQUIRED TO COMMIT

CAPITAL TO PROVIDE EXECUTION. AS A MARKET MAKER, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN AN INVENTORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET EXPECTED CLIENT AND MARKET DEMANDS.

RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE RISK EXPOSURES

THAT ARISE FROM ITS MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES IN DERIVATIVE AND CASH INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRMS HOLDINGS AND EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, IN MANY CASES, ON EITHER A PORTFOLIO OR RISK-SPECIFIC BASIS, AS OPPOSED TO AN

INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT BASIS. THE OFFSETTING IMPACT OF THIS ECONOMIC HEDGING IS REFLECTED IN THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENT AS THE RELATED REVENUES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE

DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN FIXED-RATE UNSECURED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AND DEPOSITS, TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON THE NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS, AND TO MANAGE THE

EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORECASTED SALES OF CERTAIN ENERGY COMMODITIES BY ONE OF THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING.



FUTURES AND FORWARDS.

CONTRACTS

THAT COMMIT COUNTERPARTIES TO PURCHASE OR SELL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES OR CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE.



SWAPS.

CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE

COUNTERPARTIES TO EXCHANGE CASH FLOWS SUCH AS CURRENCY OR INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED RATES, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES

OR INDICES.



OPTIONS.

CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE

OPTION PURCHASER HAS THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE FROM OR SELL TO THE OPTION WRITER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES OR CURRENCIES WITHIN A DEFINED TIME PERIOD FOR A SPECIFIED PRICE.

DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR A

GIVEN COUNTERPARTY) WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT (COUNTERPARTY NETTING). DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED OR POSTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS

(COLLATERAL NETTING). DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL GAINS

AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 ARE INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE AND THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

VALUATION TECHNIQUES FOR DERIVATIVES

THE FIRMS LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING DERIVATIVE PRICING MODELS (E.G., DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS,

CORRELATION MODELS, AND MODELS THAT INCORPORATE OPTION PRICING METHODOLOGIES, SUCH AS MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS). PRICE TRANSPARENCY OF DERIVATIVES CAN GENERALLY BE CHARACTERIZED BY PRODUCT TYPE.

INTEREST RATE.

IN

GENERAL, THE PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS USED TO VALUE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES ARE TRANSPARENT, EVEN FOR LONG-DATED CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND OPTIONS DENOMINATED IN THE CURRENCIES OF LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH

TRADING VOLUMES AND TIGHT BID/OFFER SPREADS. INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES THAT REFERENCE INDICES, SUCH AS AN INFLATION INDEX, OR THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE (E.G., 10-YEAR SWAP RATE VS. 2-YEAR SWAP RATE) ARE MORE COMPLEX, BUT THE PRICES AND OTHER

INPUTS ARE GENERALLY OBSERVABLE.

CREDIT.

PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, INCLUDING BOTH SINGLE NAMES AND BASKETS OF CREDITS, VARIES BY MARKET AND UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY OR OBLIGATION. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT REFERENCE

INDICES, LARGE CORPORATES AND MAJOR SOVEREIGNS GENERALLY EXHIBIT THE MOST PRICE TRANSPARENCY. FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS WITH OTHER UNDERLIERS, PRICE TRANSPARENCY VARIES BASED ON CREDIT RATING, THE COST OF BORROWING THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE

OBLIGATIONS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS FOR DELIVERY UPON THE DEFAULT OF THE ISSUER. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT REFERENCE LOANS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND EMERGING MARKET DEBT INSTRUMENTS TEND TO HAVE LESS PRICE

TRANSPARENCY THAN THOSE THAT REFERENCE CORPORATE BONDS. IN ADDITION, MORE COMPLEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, GENERALLY HAVE LESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

CURRENCY.

PRICES FOR CURRENCY DERIVATIVES BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATES OF LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH LONGER TENORS, ARE GENERALLY TRANSPARENT. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE TRANSPARENCY OF DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKET

CURRENCY DERIVATIVES IS THAT EMERGING MARKETS TEND TO BE OBSERVABLE FOR CONTRACTS WITH SHORTER TENORS.

COMMODITY.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS REFERENCED TO ENERGY (E.G., OIL AND NATURAL GAS), METALS (E.G., PRECIOUS AND BASE) AND SOFT COMMODITIES (E.G., AGRICULTURAL). PRICE TRANSPARENCY VARIES BASED ON

THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY, DELIVERY LOCATION, TENOR AND PRODUCT QUALITY (E.G., DIESEL FUEL COMPARED TO UNLEADED GASOLINE). IN GENERAL, PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR COMMODITY DERIVATIVES IS GREATER FOR CONTRACTS WITH SHORTER TENORS AND CONTRACTS THAT ARE

MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH MAJOR AND/OR BENCHMARK COMMODITY INDICES.

EQUITY.

PRICE

TRANSPARENCY FOR EQUITY DERIVATIVES VARIES BY MARKET AND UNDERLIER. OPTIONS ON INDICES AND THE COMMON STOCK OF CORPORATES INCLUDED IN MAJOR EQUITY INDICES EXHIBIT THE MOST PRICE TRANSPARENCY. EQUITY DERIVATIVES GENERALLY HAVE OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES, EXCEPT FOR CONTRACTS WITH LONG TENORS OR REFERENCE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES. MORE COMPLEX EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, GENERALLY HAVE

LESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OBSERVABILITY OF ALL PRODUCT TYPES. IF TRANSACTION VOLUMES DECLINE,

PREVIOUSLY TRANSPARENT PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS MAY BECOME UNOBSERVABLE. CONVERSELY, EVEN HIGHLY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS MAY AT TIMES HAVE TRADING VOLUMES LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE OBSERVABILITY OF PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS. SEE NOTE 5 FOR AN OVERVIEW

OF THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT POLICIES.

LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS FOR FUTURE DELIVERY OF SECURITIES WHEN THE UNDERLYING SECURITY IS A LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENT, AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES IF THEY ARE ACTIVELY

TRADED AND ARE VALUED AT THEIR QUOTED MARKET PRICE.

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES INCLUDE OTC DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT VALUATION INPUTS ARE CORROBORATED BY MARKET EVIDENCE AND

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT ACTIVELY TRADED AND/OR THAT ARE VALUED USING MODELS THAT CALIBRATE TO MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS OF OTC DERIVATIVES. IN EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A VALUATION INPUT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, A

PORTFOLIOS NET RISK EXPOSURE TO THAT INPUT.

149

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO VALUE A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS

OF AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN THE INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. FOR DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT BECAUSE OUTPUTS OF

MODELS CAN BE CALIBRATED TO MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.

VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, SUCH AS CONTRACTUAL TERMS,

MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, DISCOUNT RATES (INCLUDING THOSE DERIVED FROM INTEREST RATES ON COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND POSTED AS SPECIFIED IN CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FOR COLLATERALIZED DERIVATIVES), CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT

RATES, LOSS SEVERITY RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES CAN BE VERIFIED TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE

LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES.

LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MODELS WHICH UTILIZE OBSERVABLE LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS, AS WELL AS UNOBSERVABLE

LEVEL 3 INPUTS.



FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE

CORRELATIONS OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (E.G., THE CORRELATION BETWEEN EURO INFLATION AND EURO INTEREST RATES) AND SPECIFIC INTEREST RATE VOLATILITIES.



FOR LEVEL 3 CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE ILLIQUID CREDIT SPREADS AND UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS, WHICH ARE UNIQUE TO

SPECIFIC REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS AND REFERENCE ENTITIES, RECOVERY RATES AND CERTAIN CORRELATIONS REQUIRED TO VALUE CREDIT AND MORTGAGE DERIVATIVES (E.G., THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATION RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER).



FOR LEVEL 3 EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS GENERALLY INCLUDE EQUITY VOLATILITY INPUTS FOR OPTIONS THAT ARE VERY LONG-DATED

AND/OR HAVE STRIKE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES. IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED TRADES REQUIRES THE USE OF LEVEL 3 CORRELATION INPUTS, SUCH AS THE CORRELATION OF THE PRICE PERFORMANCE OF TWO OR

MORE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS OR THE CORRELATION OF THE PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR A BASKET OF STOCKS TO ANOTHER ASSET CLASS SUCH AS COMMODITIES.



FOR LEVEL 3 COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE VOLATILITIES FOR OPTIONS WITH STRIKE PRICES THAT DIFFER

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES AND PRICES OR SPREADS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE PRODUCT QUALITY OR PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THE COMMODITY IS NOT ALIGNED WITH BENCHMARK INDICES.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL VALUATION OF A LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE, THE FIRM UPDATES THE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 INPUTS TO REFLECT

OBSERVABLE MARKET CHANGES AND ANY RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN LEVEL 3. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR BROKER OR DEALER

QUOTATIONS OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL VALUE BY REFERENCE TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE. SEE BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES.

VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIOS AND ARE USED TO

ADJUST THE MID-MARKET VALUATIONS PRODUCED BY DERIVATIVE PRICING MODELS TO THE APPROPRIATE EXIT PRICE VALUATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCORPORATE BID/OFFER SPREADS, THE COST OF LIQUIDITY, CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS AND FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS,

WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE CREDIT AND FUNDING RISK INHERENT IN THE UNCOLLATERALIZED PORTION OF DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRM ALSO MAKES FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO COLLATERALIZED DERIVATIVES WHERE THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT DO NOT PERMIT THE FIRM

TO DELIVER OR REPLEDGE COLLATERAL RECEIVED. MARKET-BASED INPUTS ARE GENERALLY USED WHEN CALIBRATING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.

IN ADDITION, FOR DERIVATIVES THAT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THE FIRM MAKES MODEL OR EXIT PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VALUATION UNCERTAINTY PRESENT IN THE TRANSACTION.

SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE

FIRMS LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS THE AVERAGES AND MEDIANS OF THESE INPUTS. THE RANGES REPRESENT THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE USED IN THE VALUATION OF EACH TYPE OF DERIVATIVE. AVERAGES REPRESENT THE ARITHMETIC AVERAGE

OF THE INPUTS AND ARE NOT WEIGHTED BY THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OR NOTIONAL OF THE RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AN AVERAGE GREATER THAN THE MEDIAN INDICATES THAT THE MAJORITY OF INPUTS ARE BELOW THE AVERAGE. THE RANGES, AVERAGES AND

MEDIANS OF THESE INPUTS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROPRIATE INPUTS TO USE WHEN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE DERIVATIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HIGHEST CORRELATION PRESENTED IN THE TABLES

BELOW FOR INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES IS APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING A SPECIFIC INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE BUT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING ANY OTHER INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE. ACCORDINGLY, THE RANGES OF INPUTS PRESENTED BELOW DO NOT REPRESENT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RANGE OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE FIRMS LEVEL 3

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.



CORRELATION: RANGES FOR CORRELATION COVER A VARIETY OF UNDERLIERS BOTH WITHIN ONE MARKET (E.G., EQUITY INDEX AND EQUITY SINGLE STOCK NAMES) AND

ACROSS MARKETS (E.G., CORRELATION OF A COMMODITY PRICE AND A FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE), AS WELL AS ACROSS REGIONS. GENERALLY, CROSS-ASSET CORRELATION INPUTS ARE USED TO VALUE MORE COMPLEX INSTRUMENTS AND ARE LOWER THAN CORRELATION INPUTS ON ASSETS

WITHIN THE SAME DERIVATIVE PRODUCT TYPE.



VOLATILITY: RANGES FOR VOLATILITY COVER NUMEROUS UNDERLIERS ACROSS A VARIETY OF MARKETS, MATURITIES AND STRIKE PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, VOLATILITY

OF EQUITY INDICES IS GENERALLY LOWER THAN VOLATILITY OF SINGLE STOCKS.



CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES: THE RANGES FOR CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES COVER A VARIETY OF

UNDERLIERS (INDEX AND SINGLE NAMES), REGIONS, SECTORS, MATURITIES AND CREDIT QUALITIES (HIGH-YIELD AND INVESTMENT-GRADE). THE BROAD RANGE OF THIS POPULATION GIVES RISE TO THE WIDTH OF THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.



COMMODITY PRICES AND SPREADS: THE RANGES FOR COMMODITY PRICES AND SPREADS COVER VARIABILITY IN PRODUCTS, MATURITIES AND LOCATIONS, AS WELL AS PEAK

AND OFF-PEAK PRICES.

SENSITIVITY OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT TO CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIRECTIONAL SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS TO CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, IN ISOLATION. DUE TO THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF EACH OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES, THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF INPUTS IS NOT NECESSARILY UNIFORM WITHIN EACH PRODUCT TYPE.



CORRELATION: IN GENERAL, FOR CONTRACTS WHERE THE HOLDER BENEFITS FROM THE CONVERGENCE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR INDEX PRICES (E.G., INTEREST RATES,

CREDIT SPREADS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, INFLATION RATES AND EQUITY PRICES), AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION RESULTS IN A HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.



VOLATILITY: IN GENERAL, FOR PURCHASED OPTIONS AN INCREASE IN VOLATILITY RESULTS IN A HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.



CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES: IN GENERAL, THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASED CREDIT PROTECTION INCREASES AS CREDIT SPREADS OR

UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS INCREASE OR RECOVERY RATES DECREASE. CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES ARE STRONGLY RELATED TO DISTINCTIVE RISK FACTORS OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE REFERENCE ENTITY-SPECIFIC

FACTORS SUCH AS LEVERAGE, VOLATILITY AND INDUSTRY, MARKET-BASED RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS BORROWING COSTS OR LIQUIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATION, AND MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS.



COMMODITY PRICES AND SPREADS: IN GENERAL, FOR CONTRACTS WHERE THE HOLDER IS RECEIVING A COMMODITY, AN INCREASE IN THE SPREAD (PRICE DIFFERENCE FROM

A BENCHMARK INDEX DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN QUALITY OR DELIVERY LOCATION) OR PRICE RESULTS IN A HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

LEVEL 3 ROLLFORWARD

IF A DERIVATIVE WAS TRANSFERRED TO LEVEL 3 DURING A REPORTING PERIOD, ITS ENTIRE GAIN

OR LOSS FOR THE PERIOD IS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS ARE REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. IN THE TABLES BELOW, NEGATIVE AMOUNTS FOR TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 3 AND POSITIVE AMOUNTS FOR

TRANSFERS OUT OF LEVEL 3 REPRESENT NET TRANSFERS OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES

SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FOLLOWING.



A DERIVATIVE WITH LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 IN ITS ENTIRETY IF IT HAS AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT

LEVEL 3 INPUT.



IF THERE IS ONE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUT, THE ENTIRE GAIN OR LOSS FROM ADJUSTING ONLY OBSERVABLE INPUTS (I.E., LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2

INPUTS) IS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3.



GAINS OR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN LEVEL 3 RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE FREQUENTLY OFFSET BY GAINS

OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES AND/OR LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS. AS A RESULT, GAINS/(LOSSES) INCLUDED IN THE LEVEL 3 ROLLFORWARD BELOW DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE

DERIVATIVES WITH CREDIT-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSACTED UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO

POST COLLATERAL OR TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS. THE FIRM ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF THESE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS BY DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT WOULD OCCUR ASSUMING A DOWNGRADE

BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. A DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF THE FIRM AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. THE

TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING APPLICATION OF COLLATERAL POSTED TO REDUCE THESE LIABILITIES), THE RELATED AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL, AND THE

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED AT THE REPORTING DATE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN THE EVENT OF A ONE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO A BROAD ARRAY OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND TO MANAGE THE

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED BASED ON THE FIRMS NET RISK POSITION.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS AND CAN HAVE VARIOUS SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT CONVENTIONS. CREDIT EVENTS INCLUDE FAILURE TO PAY, BANKRUPTCY, ACCELERATION OF INDEBTEDNESS,

RESTRUCTURING, REPUDIATION AND DISSOLUTION OF THE REFERENCE ENTITY.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS PROTECT THE BUYER AGAINST THE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL ON ONE OR MORE BONDS, LOANS OR MORTGAGES (REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS) IN THE EVENT THE ISSUER (REFERENCE ENTITY) OF THE

REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS SUFFERS A CREDIT EVENT. THE BUYER OF PROTECTION PAYS AN INITIAL OR PERIODIC PREMIUM TO THE SELLER AND RECEIVES PROTECTION FOR THE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. IF THERE IS NO CREDIT EVENT, AS DEFINED IN THE CONTRACT, THE SELLER OF

PROTECTION MAKES NO PAYMENTS TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION. HOWEVER, IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS, THE SELLER OF PROTECTION IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION, WHICH IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT.

CREDIT INDICES, BASKETS AND TRANCHES.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE A BASKET OF SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS OR A BROAD-BASED INDEX. IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS IN ONE OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, THE PROTECTION SELLER PAYS

THE PROTECTION BUYER. THE PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY A PRO-RATA PORTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT BASED ON THE UNDERLYING DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION. IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, THE CREDIT RISK OF A BASKET OR INDEX IS SEPARATED INTO

VARIOUS PORTIONS (TRANCHES), EACH HAVING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. THE MOST JUNIOR TRANCHES COVER INITIAL DEFAULTS AND ONCE LOSSES EXCEED THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE JUNIOR TRANCHES, ANY EXCESS LOSS IS COVERED BY THE NEXT MOST SENIOR

TRANCHE IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

TOTAL RETURN SWAPS.

A TOTAL RETURN SWAP TRANSFERS THE RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF A REFERENCE OBLIGATION FROM THE PROTECTION BUYER TO THE PROTECTION SELLER. TYPICALLY, THE PROTECTION BUYER RECEIVES FROM THE

PROTECTION SELLER A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST AND PROTECTION AGAINST ANY REDUCTION IN FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, AND IN RETURN THE PROTECTION SELLER RECEIVES THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, PLUS ANY INCREASE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.

CREDIT OPTIONS.

IN A CREDIT OPTION, THE OPTION WRITER ASSUMES THE OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OR SELL A REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT A SPECIFIED PRICE OR CREDIT SPREAD. THE OPTION PURCHASER BUYS THE RIGHT, BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE

OBLIGATION, TO SELL THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION TO, OR PURCHASE IT FROM, THE OPTION WRITER. THE PAYMENTS ON CREDIT OPTIONS DEPEND EITHER ON A PARTICULAR CREDIT SPREAD OR THE PRICE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.

THE FIRM ECONOMICALLY HEDGES ITS EXPOSURE TO WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVES PRIMARILY BY

ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES WITH IDENTICAL UNDERLYINGS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO STRINGENT COLLATERAL THRESHOLDS. IN

ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A SPECIFIED TRIGGER EVENT, THE FIRM MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS UNDERLYING A PARTICULAR WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVE, AND CONSEQUENTLY MAY, UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, RECOVER

AMOUNTS ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013, WRITTEN AND PURCHASED

CREDIT DERIVATIVES HAD TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $1.43 TRILLION AND $1.52 TRILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TOTAL NET NOTIONAL PURCHASED PROTECTION OF $81.55 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 2012, WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES

HAD TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $1.76 TRILLION AND $1.86 TRILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TOTAL NET NOTIONAL PURCHASED PROTECTION OF $98.33 BILLION.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES. IN THE TABLE BELOW.



FAIR VALUES EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF BOTH NETTING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES WITH PAYABLE BALANCES UNDER ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND NETTING OF

TENOR IS BASED ON EXPECTED DURATION FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND ON REMAINING CONTRACTUAL MATURITY FOR OTHER CREDIT DERIVATIVES; AND

ACCOUNTING, THE DERIVATIVE HEDGE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK FROM THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MUST FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AT INCEPTION AND TEST THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AT LEAST ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THE DERIVATIVE HEDGE CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE OVER THE LIFE OF THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE FIRM DESIGNATES CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS HEDGE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DESIGNATED BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE (E.G., LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) OR OIS), EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS INTO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM APPLIES A STATISTICAL METHOD THAT UTILIZES REGRESSION ANALYSIS WHEN ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FAIR VALUE HEDGING

RELATIONSHIPS IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE RISK BEING HEDGED (I.E., INTEREST RATE RISK). AN INTEREST RATE SWAP IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CHANGES IN THE HEDGED RISK WHEN THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS IN A COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION OF 80% OR GREATER AND A SLOPE BETWEEN 80% AND 125%.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES ARE INCLUDED IN

INTEREST EXPENSE. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED IS REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER ITS REMAINING LIFE. GAINS OR

LOSSES RESULTING FROM HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. WHEN A DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, ANY REMAINING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND PAR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM IS AMORTIZED TO

INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE HEDGED ITEM USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. SEE NOTE 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE GAINS/(LOSSES) FROM INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES, THE RELATED HEDGED

BORROWINGS AND BANK DEPOSITS, AND THE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE DERIVATIVES, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF AMORTIZATION OF PREPAID CREDIT SPREADS RESULTING FROM THE PASSAGE OF TIME.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE FIRM SEEKS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON ITS NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE OVERALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS (I.E., BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD RATES). FOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE IS ASSESSED BASED ON CHANGES IN SPOT RATES.

FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

THE GAIN/(LOSS) RELATED TO INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR 2013, 2012 OR 2011. THE LOSS RECLASSIFIED TO

AS

OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THE FIRM HAD DESIGNATED $1.97 BILLION AND $2.77 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT, INCLUDED IN UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND UNSECURED

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AS HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM DESIGNATED CERTAIN COMMODITIES-RELATED SWAP AND FORWARD CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THESE SWAP AND FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO

THE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORECASTED SALES OF CERTAIN ENERGY COMMODITIES BY ONE OF THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM APPLIES A STATISTICAL METHOD THAT UTILIZES REGRESSION ANALYSIS WHEN ASSESSING

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS.

A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FORECASTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK WHEN THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS IN A COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION OF 80% OR GREATER AND A SLOPE

BETWEEN 80% AND 125%.

FOR QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES, TO THE EXTENT

EFFECTIVE, ARE INCLUDED IN CASH FLOW HEDGES WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAINS, BEFORE TAXES, RECOGNIZED ON THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES WAS $14 MILLION FOR 2013.

THE GAIN/(LOSS) RELATED TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR 2013. THERE WERE NO GAINS/(LOSSES) EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS OR RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME DURING 2013.

THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN CASH FLOW HEDGES WILL BE RECLASSIFIED TO OTHER

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS AS THE CORRESPONDING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE SALE OF THE HEDGED ENERGY COMMODITIES, WHICH IS ALSO RECORDED IN OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS.

THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY $5 MILLION OF GAINS, NET OF TAXES, RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES FROM CASH FLOW HEDGES TO EARNINGS WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH THE FIRM IS HEDGING ITS

EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS IS APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE

IN ADDITION TO ALL CASH AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE PRIMARILY UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE TO.



REFLECT ECONOMIC EVENTS IN EARNINGS ON A TIMELY BASIS;



MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES (E.G., TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED ACCOUNTED FOR AS

FINANCINGS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WHEREAS THE RELATED SECURED FINANCING WOULD BE RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS ABSENT ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION); AND



ADDRESS SIMPLIFICATION AND COST-BENEFIT CONSIDERATIONS (E.G., ACCOUNTING FOR HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN THEIR ENTIRETY VERSUS

BIFURCATION OF EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DEBT HOSTS).

HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN BIFURCATABLE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND DO NOT REQUIRE SETTLEMENT BY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS (E.G., PHYSICAL COMMODITIES). IF THE FIRM ELECTS TO BIFURCATE THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE FROM THE ASSOCIATED DEBT, THE

DERIVATIVE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THE HOST CONTRACT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT AMORTIZED COST, ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY FAIR VALUE HEDGES. IF THE FIRM DOES NOT ELECT TO BIFURCATE, THE ENTIRE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION INCLUDE.



REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL RESALE AGREEMENTS;



SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION;



SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS, INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCINGS RATHER THAN SALES;



CERTAIN UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, CONSISTING OF ALL PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER AND CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS;



CERTAIN UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PREPAID COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS;



CERTAIN INSURANCE CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN GUARANTEES;



CERTAIN RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED LOANS RATHER THAN PURCHASES AND

CERTAIN MARGIN LOANS;



CERTAIN TIME DEPOSITS ISSUED BY THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES (DEPOSITS WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A FAIR VALUE OPTION

ELECTION), INCLUDING STRUCTURED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, WHICH ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; AND



CERTAIN SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES.

THESE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE ARE GENERALLY VALUED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

TECHNIQUES, WHICH INCORPORATE INPUTS WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY, AND ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 BECAUSE THE INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE FOR LIQUIDITY AND FOR COUNTERPARTY AND THE

FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY.

VALUATION OF EACH TYPE OF OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE RANGES AND WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THESE INPUTS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROPRIATE INPUTS TO USE WHEN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE INSTRUMENT.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE HIGHEST YIELD PRESENTED BELOW FOR RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IS APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING A SPECIFIC AGREEMENT IN THAT CATEGORY BUT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS IN THAT CATEGORY. ACCORDINGLY, THE

RANGES OF INPUTS PRESENTED BELOW DO NOT REPRESENT UNCERTAINTY IN, OR POSSIBLE RANGES OF, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES.

RESALE AND

INSURANCE CONTRACTS.

DURING 2013, THE FIRM SOLD A MAJORITY STAKE IN BOTH ITS AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS (APRIL 2013) AND ITS EUROPEAN INSURANCE BUSINESS (DECEMBER 2013). SEE NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ABOUT THESE SALES. PRIOR TO SELLING THESE BUSINESSES, THE FIRM HAD ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ON CERTAIN INSURANCE CONTRACTS. THESE CONTRACTS COULD BE SETTLED ONLY IN CASH AND QUALIFIED FOR THE FAIR VALUE OPTION BECAUSE THEY WERE RECOGNIZED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THESE CONTRACTS WERE VALUED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET EVIDENCE WHERE POSSIBLE, INCLUDING MARKET-BASED INPUTS TO MODELS, CALIBRATION TO MARKET-CLEARING TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH

REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SIGNIFICANT INPUTS WERE INTEREST RATES, INFLATION RATES, VOLATILITIES, FUNDING SPREADS, YIELD AND DURATION, WHICH INCORPORATED POLICY LAPSE AND PROJECTED MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS. WHEN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO A

VALUATION MODEL WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF AN INSTRUMENT, THE INSTRUMENT WAS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3. AS OF DECEMBER 2012, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EUROPEAN INSURANCE BUSINESS WERE INCLUDED IN

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE AMERICAS REINSURANCE BUSINESS, WHICH WAS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AS OF

DECEMBER 2012, WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY.

THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE LEVEL 3 INSURANCE CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 2012 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

YIELD: 4.4% TO 15.1% (WEIGHTED AVERAGE: 6.2%)



DURATION: 5.3 TO 8.8 YEARS (WEIGHTED AVERAGE: 7.6 YEARS)

GENERALLY, INCREASES IN FUNDING SPREADS, YIELD OR DURATION, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A LOWER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

FINANCE CERTAIN FIRM ACTIVITIES.

COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND FINANCINGS ARE PRESENTED ON A

NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS. INTEREST ON COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION AND INCLUDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

A RESALE AGREEMENT IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM PURCHASES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM A SELLER, TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO RESELL THE SAME OR

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO THE SELLER AT A STATED PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST AT A FUTURE DATE.

A

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM SELLS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO A BUYER, TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM

THE BUYER AT A STATED PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST AT A FUTURE DATE.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED OR SOLD IN RESALE

AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY, AND INVESTMENT-GRADE SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM RECEIVES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, MAKES DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON A DAILY BASIS, AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR RESALE AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM

TYPICALLY REQUIRES DELIVERY OF COLLATERAL WITH A FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELEVANT ASSETS IN THE STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION.

EVEN THOUGH REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS INVOLVE THE LEGAL

TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO BE REPURCHASED OR RESOLD AT THE MATURITY OF THE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, REPOS TO MATURITY ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES. A REPO TO MATURITY IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM TRANSFERS A SECURITY UNDER AN AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE THE SECURITY WHERE THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT MATCHES THE MATURITY DATE OF THE UNDERLYING

SECURITY. THEREFORE, THE FIRM EFFECTIVELY NO LONGER HAS A REPURCHASE OBLIGATION AND HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE UNDERLYING SECURITY AND, ACCORDINGLY, ACCOUNTS FOR THE TRANSACTION AS A SALE. THE FIRM HAD NO REPOS TO MATURITY OUTSTANDING AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 OR DECEMBER 2012.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED TRANSACTIONS

IN A SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTION, THE FIRM BORROWS SECURITIES FROM A COUNTERPARTY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH OR SECURITIES. WHEN THE FIRM

RETURNS THE SECURITIES, THE COUNTERPARTY RETURNS THE CASH OR SECURITIES. INTEREST IS GENERALLY PAID PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION.

IN A SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTION, THE FIRM LENDS SECURITIES TO A COUNTERPARTY TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH OR SECURITIES. WHEN THE COUNTERPARTY RETURNS THE SECURITIES, THE FIRM RETURNS THE CASH OR

SECURITIES POSTED AS COLLATERAL. INTEREST IS GENERALLY PAID PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE FIRM

RECEIVES SECURITIES BORROWED, MAKES DELIVERY OF SECURITIES LOANED, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES ON A DAILY BASIS, AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, AS APPROPRIATE.

FOR SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM TYPICALLY REQUIRES COLLATERAL WITH A FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTION.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND

COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. SEE NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN SECURITIES SERVICES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED PLUS

ACCRUED INTEREST. AS THESE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY CAN BE TERMINATED ON DEMAND, THEY EXHIBIT LITTLE, IF ANY, SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THEREFORE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE

ARRANGEMENTS ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY IN NOTES 6, 7 AND 8. HAD THESE ARRANGEMENTS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012.

THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS BECAUSE THE USE OF FAIR VALUE ELIMINATES NON-ECONOMIC VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS THAT WOULD ARISE FROM USING DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES. SEE NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER SECURED

FINANCINGS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE.

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ARE

RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH GENERALLY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE FINANCINGS ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IN NOTES 6, 7 AND 8. HAD THESE FINANCINGS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, THEY WOULD HAVE

NOTE 10. SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES

NOTE 10.

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CORPORATE BONDS, LOANS AND OTHER

TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS BY SELLING THESE ASSETS TO SECURITIZATION VEHICLES (E.G., TRUSTS, CORPORATE ENTITIES AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES) OR THROUGH A RESECURITIZATION. THE FIRM ACTS AS UNDERWRITER OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THAT ARE SOLD TO

INVESTORS. THE FIRMS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IN CONNECTION WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIZATIONS.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION ENTITIES ARE DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES THAT GIVE THE INVESTORS RIGHTS TO RECEIVE ALL OR PORTIONS OF SPECIFIED CASH INFLOWS TO A SECURITIZATION VEHICLE AND

INCLUDE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND/OR OTHER CASH INFLOWS. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE USED TO PAY THE TRANSFEROR FOR THE FINANCIAL ASSETS SOLD TO THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLE OR TO PURCHASE

SECURITIES WHICH SERVE AS COLLATERAL.

THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR

A SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN IT HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. PRIOR TO SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ASSETS PENDING TRANSFER AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE DOES NOT TYPICALLY RECOGNIZE SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES UPON

THE TRANSFER OF ASSETS. NET REVENUES FROM UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF THE UNDERLYING BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO INVESTORS.

FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, THE ASSETS REMAIN IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND THE TRANSFER IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A COLLATERALIZED FINANCING,

WITH THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION. SEE NOTES 9 AND 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM GENERALLY RECEIVES CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BUT MAY ALSO HAVE

CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH TRANSFERRED ASSETS, INCLUDING OWNERSHIP OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS, PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED SECURITIES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PURCHASE SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED SECURITIES

ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION VEHICLES (WHICH ARE TYPICALLY VIES) IN CONNECTION WITH SECONDARY MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES.

THE

PRIMARY RISKS INCLUDED IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND OTHER INTERESTS FROM THE FIRMS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH SECURITIZATION VEHICLES ARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, THE POSITION OF THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CAPITAL

STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLE AND THE MARKET YIELD FOR THE SECURITY. THESE INTERESTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE INTERESTS IN THE TABLE ABOVE, THE FIRM HAD OTHER CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT

IN THE FORM OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND GUARANTEES WITH CERTAIN NONCONSOLIDATED VIES. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES AND GUARANTEES WAS A NET ASSET OF $26 MILLION AND $45 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012,

RESPECTIVELY. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE DERIVATIVES AND GUARANTEES ARE INCLUDED IN MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN THE NONCONSOLIDATED VIE TABLES IN NOTE 11.

THE TABLES BELOW DO NOT GIVE EFFECT TO THE OFFSETTING BENEFIT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE HELD TO MITIGATE RISKS INHERENT IN THESE RETAINED INTERESTS. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON AN ADVERSE

VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS NOT USUALLY LINEAR. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION IN THE BELOW TABLES ARE

CALCULATED INDEPENDENTLY OF CHANGES IN ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN PRACTICE, SIMULTANEOUS CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES DISCLOSED BELOW.

THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE KEY ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF RETAINED INTERESTS AND THE

SENSITIVITY OF THIS FAIR VALUE TO IMMEDIATE ADVERSE CHANGES OF 10% AND 20% IN THOSE ASSUMPTIONS. IN THE TABLES BELOW, THE CONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATE IS INCLUDED ONLY FOR POSITIONS FOR WHICH IT IS A KEY ASSUMPTION IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR RETAINED INTERESTS THAT RELATE TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY-ISSUED COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY CREDIT LOSS. EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS ASSUMPTIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

VIES GENERALLY FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF ASSETS BY ISSUING DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES THAT

ARE EITHER COLLATERALIZED BY OR INDEXED TO THE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE. THE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ISSUED BY A VIE MAY INCLUDE TRANCHES OF VARYING LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES INCLUDES SECURITIZATION OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10, AND INVESTMENTS IN AND LOANS TO OTHER TYPES OF VIES, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. SEE NOTE 10 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. SEE

NOTE 3 FOR THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATION POLICIES, INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF A VIE.

THE FIRM IS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED

WITH VIES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

MORTGAGE-BACKED VIES

AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES.

THE FIRM SELLS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES TO MORTGAGE-BACKED VIES AND CORPORATE BONDS AND LOANS TO CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES

AND MAY RETAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS SOLD TO THESE VIES. THE FIRM PURCHASES AND SELLS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY MORTGAGE-BACKED AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES IN CONNECTION WITH MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY

ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES WITH CERTAIN OF THESE VIES, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS. THE FIRM GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK FROM DERIVATIVES WITH

THESE VIES.

CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES, USUALLY REFERRED TO AS SYNTHETIC CDOS OR

CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VIES, SYNTHETICALLY CREATE THE EXPOSURE FOR THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THEY ISSUE BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVES, RATHER THAN PURCHASING THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE A SINGLE ASSET, AN INDEX, OR

A PORTFOLIO/BASKET OF ASSETS OR INDICES. SEE NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES. THESE VIES USE THE FUNDS FROM THE SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND THE PREMIUMS RECEIVED FROM CREDIT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES TO PURCHASE

SECURITIES WHICH SERVE TO COLLATERALIZE THE BENEFICIAL INTEREST HOLDERS AND/OR THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THESE VIES MAY ENTER INTO OTHER DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS. THE FIRM MAY

BE A COUNTERPARTY TO DERIVATIVES WITH THESE VIES AND GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK.

REAL ESTATE, CREDIT-RELATED AND OTHER

INVESTING VIES.

THE FIRM PURCHASES EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY AND MAKES LOANS TO VIES THAT HOLD REAL ESTATE, PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, DISTRESSED LOANS AND EQUITY

SECURITIES. THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT SELL ASSETS TO, OR ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES WITH, THESE VIES.

OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES.

THE FIRM STRUCTURES VIES THAT ISSUE NOTES TO CLIENTS, AND PURCHASES AND SELLS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY OTHER

ASSET-BACKED VIES IN CONNECTION WITH MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES WITH CERTAIN OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES, PRIMARILY TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ON THE COLLATERAL ASSETS HELD BY THESE VIES UNDER WHICH THE FIRM PAYS

THE VIE THE RETURN DUE TO THE NOTE HOLDERS AND RECEIVES THE RETURN ON THE COLLATERAL ASSETS OWNED BY THE VIE. THE FIRM GENERALLY CAN BE REMOVED AS THE TOTAL RETURN SWAP COUNTERPARTY. THE FIRM GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER

COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK FROM DERIVATIVES WITH THESE VIES. THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT SELL ASSETS TO THE OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES IT STRUCTURES.

POWER-RELATED VIES.

THE FIRM PURCHASES DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ISSUED BY, AND MAY

PROVIDE COMMITMENTS TO, VIES THAT HOLD POWER-RELATED ASSETS. THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT SELL ASSETS TO, OR ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES WITH, THESE VIES.

INVESTMENT FUND VIES.

THE FIRM MAKES EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN, AND IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FEES

FROM, CERTAIN OF THE INVESTMENT FUND VIES IT MANAGES. THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT SELL ASSETS TO, OR ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES WITH, THESE VIES.

PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTE VIES.

THE FIRM STRUCTURES VIES THAT ISSUE PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED

NOTES TO CLIENTS. THESE VIES OWN PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY WITH EXPOSURE TO HEDGE FUNDS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PRINCIPAL PROTECTION ON THE NOTES ISSUED BY THESE VIES IS PROVIDED BY THE ASSET PORTFOLIO REBALANCING THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE NOTES. THE FIRM ENTERS INTO TOTAL RETURN SWAPS WITH THESE VIES UNDER WHICH THE FIRM PAYS THE VIE THE RETURN DUE TO THE PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTE HOLDERS AND RECEIVES THE RETURN ON THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE VIE. THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO

VIE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

A VARIABLE INTEREST IN A VIE IS AN INVESTMENT (E.G., DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES) OR OTHER INTEREST (E.G., DERIVATIVES OR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS) IN A VIE THAT WILL ABSORB PORTIONS OF THE VIES

EXPECTED LOSSES AND/OR RECEIVE PORTIONS OF THE VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS.

THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN

VIES INCLUDE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, CDOS AND CLOS; LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS; LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; PREFERRED AND COMMON

EQUITY; DERIVATIVES THAT MAY INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY AND/OR CREDIT RISK; GUARANTEES; AND CERTAIN OF THE FEES THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS. CERTAIN INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES THE FIRM ENTERS INTO WITH

VIES ARE NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS BECAUSE THEY CREATE RATHER THAN ABSORB RISK.

THE ENTERPRISE WITH A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE IS

KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE BY PERFORMING AN ANALYSIS THAT PRINCIPALLY CONSIDERS.



WHICH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE;



WHICH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE;

THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE;



RELATED-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS.

THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS INITIAL EVALUATION OF WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A VIE WHEN CERTAIN RECONSIDERATION EVENTS OCCUR. THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE

ON AN ONGOING BASIS BASED ON CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

NONCONSOLIDATED VIES

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF VIES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE FIRM PROVIDES GUARANTEES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES, TO VIES OR

HOLDERS OF VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES.

THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT NONCONSOLIDATED VIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HOLDS

VARIABLE INTERESTS. NONCONSOLIDATED VIES ARE AGGREGATED BASED ON PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS CAN TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS, AS DESCRIBED IN THE ROWS UNDER MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS. IN THE TABLES BELOW.



THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS EXCLUDES THE BENEFIT OF OFFSETTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE HELD TO MITIGATE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

VARIABLE INTERESTS.



FOR RETAINED AND PURCHASED INTERESTS, AND LOANS AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INTERESTS.



FOR COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, AND DERIVATIVES, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANTICIPATED LOSSES

AND ALSO HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED BY UNREALIZED LOSSES ALREADY RECORDED. AS A RESULT, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS EXCEEDS LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, AND DERIVATIVES PROVIDED TO VIES.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED VIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AS FOLLOWS.



SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM RELATED TO MORTGAGE-BACKED, CORPORATE CDO AND CLO, OTHER ASSET-BACKED, AND INVESTMENT FUND VIES ARE

IMPAIRMENTS

THE FIRM TESTS PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE

USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSAL OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, THE FIRM DETERMINES THE ASSET IS IMPAIRED AND RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP. IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM WILL RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS PRIOR TO THE SALE OF AN ASSET IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A DECLINE IN THE MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

INVESTMENTS OPERATE, DURING 2013 AND 2012, THE FIRM DETERMINED CERTAIN ASSETS WERE IMPAIRED AND RECORDED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $216 MILLION ($160 MILLION RELATED TO PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT AND $56 MILLION RELATED

BUSINESS IN APRIL 2013. SEE NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SALE.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL IS ASSESSED ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FOR IMPAIRMENT OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF

EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. FIRST, QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE ASSESSED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF RESULTS OF

THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE TEST WOULD BE PERFORMED.

THE QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS.



THE FIRST STEP COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS). IF THE REPORTING UNITS FAIR VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED.



IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS

PERFORMED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 (2012 QUANTITATIVE

GOODWILL TEST) AND DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED.

WHEN PERFORMING THE QUANTITATIVE TEST IN 2012, THE FIRM

ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT AND COMPARED IT TO THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING UNITS NET BOOK VALUE (ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUE). THE REPORTING UNITS WERE VALUED USING RELATIVE VALUE AND RESIDUAL INCOME VALUATION TECHNIQUES BECAUSE

THE FIRM BELIEVES MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE THESE TECHNIQUES TO VALUE THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT REFLECTED AN ALLOCATION OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND REPRESENTED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT UNDER GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL COMMITTEE) IN DECEMBER 2010. IN PERFORMING ITS 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST, THE

FIRM DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED, AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS, IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS GOODWILL IS HELD, SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THEIR ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUES.

186

GOLDMAN SACHS 2013 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM ASSESSED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. MULTIPLE

FACTORS WERE ASSESSED WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS WAS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT CONSIDERED

CHANGES SINCE THE 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350, THE FIRM CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING FACTORS

IN THE 2013 QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WHEN EVALUATING WHETHER IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WAS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.



MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

SINCE THE

2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST WAS PERFORMED, THE FIRMS GENERAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED AS CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED, GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, LEVELS OF VOLATILITY WERE GENERALLY LOWER AND INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY IMPROVED.



INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATIONS.

SINCE THE 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST WAS PERFORMED, INDUSTRY-WIDE METRICS HAVE TRENDED POSITIVELY AND MANY INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN STOCK PRICE, PRICE-TO-BOOK MULTIPLES AND PRICE-TO-EARNINGS MULTIPLES.

IN ADDITION, CLARITY WAS OBTAINED ON A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS. IT IS EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF THESE REGULATIONS, THE RULES ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND THEIR FULL IMPACT WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL MARKET PRACTICES ARE FULLY DEVELOPED.

HOWEVER, THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT COMPLIANCE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REPORTING UNIT RESULTS.



COST FACTORS.

ALTHOUGH CERTAIN

EXPENSES INCREASED, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CHANGES TO THE FIRMS OVERALL COST STRUCTURE SINCE THE 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST WAS PERFORMED.



OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

DURING 2013, THE FIRMS NET EARNINGS, PRE-TAX MARGIN, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE INCREASED AS COMPARED WITH 2012.



ENTITY-SPECIFIC EVENTS.

THERE WERE

NO ENTITY-SPECIFIC EVENTS SINCE THE 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST WAS PERFORMED THAT WOULD HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VALUATION OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS.



EVENTS AFFECTING REPORTING UNITS.

THERE WERE NO EVENTS SINCE THE 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST WAS PERFORMED THAT WOULD HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VALUATION OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS.



SUSTAINED CHANGES IN STOCK PRICE.

SINCE THE 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST WAS PERFORMED, THE FIRMS STOCK PRICE HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK PRICE EXCEEDED BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE THROUGHOUT MOST OF 2013.

THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERED OTHER FACTORS IN ITS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE BOOK VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS, THE

ESTIMATED EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUES AS COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING VALUES FOR THE REPORTING UNITS IN THE 2012 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST, PROJECTED EARNINGS AND THE COST OF EQUITY. THE FIRM CONSIDERED ALL OF THE ABOVE FACTORS IN THE AGGREGATE AS PART

OF ITS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT.

AS A RESULT OF THE 2013 QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED ITS RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNT. THEREFORE, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AND THAT A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED.

REPRESENT DEPOSITS WITH NO STATED MATURITY, WERE $46.02 BILLION AND $46.51 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

DESIGNATES CERTAIN DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS TIME DEPOSITS FOR WHICH IT HAS NOT ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY, $17.53 BILLION AND $18.52 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND

DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY, OF TIME DEPOSITS WERE EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED FROM FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS AND WERE RECORDED AT AMOUNTS THAT GENERALLY APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE SAVINGS AND DEMAND DEPOSITS AND

TIME DEPOSITS ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY IN NOTES 6, 7 AND 8. HAD THESE DEPOSITS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT HELD BY 2012 TRUSTS.

IN 2012, THE VESEY STREET INVESTMENT TRUST I

AND THE MURRAY STREET INVESTMENT TRUST I (TOGETHER, THE 2012 TRUSTS) ISSUED AN AGGREGATE OF $2.25 BILLION OF SENIOR GUARANTEED TRUST SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES. THE PROCEEDS OF THAT OFFERING WERE USED TO FUND PURCHASES OF $1.75 BILLION OF

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY GROUP INC. THAT PAY INTEREST SEMI-ANNUALLY AT A FIXED ANNUAL RATE OF 4.647% AND MATURE ON MARCH 9, 2017, AND $500 MILLION OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY GROUP INC. THAT

PAY INTEREST SEMI-ANNUALLY AT A FIXED ANNUAL RATE OF 4.404% AND MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2016.

THE 2012 TRUSTS PURCHASED THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT FROM GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL II

AND GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL III (APEX TRUSTS). THE APEX TRUSTS USED THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH SALES TO PURCHASE SHARES OF GROUP INC.S PERPETUAL NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES E (SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK) AND PERPETUAL

NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES F (SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK). SEE NOTE 19 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SERIES E AND SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK.

THE 2012 TRUSTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS ON THEIR SENIOR GUARANTEED TRUST SECURITIES IN THE SAME AMOUNTS AND ON THE SAME DATES THAT THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO RECEIVE INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT THEY HOLD, AND ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM THEIR RESPECTIVE SENIOR GUARANTEED TRUST SECURITIES UPON THE MATURITY OR EARLIER REDEMPTION OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT THEY HOLD.

THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFER PAYMENTS ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS. DURING ANY SUCH DEFERRAL PERIOD, THE

FIRM WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR MAKE CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK. HOWEVER, AS GROUP INC. FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEES THE PAYMENT OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND REDEMPTION AMOUNTS WHEN

DUE ON A SENIOR BASIS ON THE SENIOR GUARANTEED TRUST SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE 2012 TRUSTS, IF THE 2012 TRUSTS ARE UNABLE TO MAKE SCHEDULED DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE HOLDERS OF THE SENIOR GUARANTEED TRUST SECURITIES, UNDER THE GUARANTEE, GROUP INC. WOULD

BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS. AS SUCH, THE $2.25 BILLION OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT HELD BY THE 2012 TRUSTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF INVESTORS IS NOT CLASSIFIED AS JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT.

THE APEX TRUSTS AND THE 2012 TRUSTS ARE DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUSTS SPONSORED BY THE FIRM AND WHOLLY-OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM

FOR REGULATORY AND LEGAL PURPOSES BUT ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE FIRM HAS COVENANTED IN FAVOR OF THE

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

THE

FIRM HAS NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ORIGINATOR OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. THE FIRM DID PURCHASE LOANS ORIGINATED BY OTHERS AND GENERALLY RECEIVED LOAN-LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED BELOW FROM THE ORIGINATORS. DURING THE PERIOD 2005

THROUGH 2008, THE FIRM SOLD APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION OF LOANS TO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES AND APPROXIMATELY $11 BILLION OF LOANS TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED LOANS TO TRUSTS AND OTHER MORTGAGE

SECURITIZATION VEHICLES. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES DURING THE PERIOD 2005 THROUGH 2008 WAS APPROXIMATELY $29 BILLION

AND $35 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS REFLECT PAYDOWNS AND CUMULATIVE LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $96 BILLION ($22 BILLION OF WHICH ARE CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND APPROXIMATELY $90 BILLION

($20 BILLION OF WHICH ARE CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2012. A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE GOLDMAN SACHS-ISSUED SECURITIZATIONS WITH AN OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF $463 MILLION AND TOTAL PAYDOWNS AND CUMULATIVE LOSSES OF

$1.60 BILLION ($534 MILLION OF WHICH ARE CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2013, AND AN OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF $540 MILLION AND TOTAL PAYDOWNS AND CUMULATIVE LOSSES OF $1.52 BILLION ($508 MILLION OF WHICH ARE

CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2012, WERE STRUCTURED WITH CREDIT PROTECTION OBTAINED FROM MONOLINE INSURERS. IN CONNECTION WITH BOTH SALES OF LOANS AND SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM PROVIDED LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED BELOW

AND/OR ASSIGNED THE LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE PARTY FROM WHOM THE FIRM PURCHASED THE LOANS.

THE LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS VARIED AMONG TRANSACTIONS BUT WERE GENERALLY DETAILED

REPRESENTATIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH LOAN IN THE PORTFOLIO AND ADDRESSED MATTERS RELATING TO THE PROPERTY, THE BORROWER AND THE NOTE. THESE REPRESENTATIONS GENERALLY INCLUDED, BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: (I) CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE

BORROWERS FINANCIAL STATUS; (II) LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, OWNER OCCUPANCY STATUS AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPERTY; (III) THE LIEN POSITION; (IV) THE FACT THAT THE LOAN WAS ORIGINATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; AND

(V) COMPLETENESS OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTATION.

THE FIRM HAS RECEIVED REPURCHASE CLAIMS FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BASED ON ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS FROM GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES, OTHER THIRD PARTIES, TRUSTS AND OTHER

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THE FIRM REPURCHASED LOANS WITH AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF LESS THAN $10 MILLION. THE LOSS RELATED TO THE

REPURCHASE OF THESE LOANS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR 2013 OR 2012. THE FIRM HAS RECEIVED A COMMUNICATION FROM COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IN PORTIONS OF GOLDMAN SACHS-ISSUED SECURITIZATIONS BETWEEN 2003 AND 2007, SUCH

SECURITIZATIONS HAVING A TOTAL ORIGINAL NOTIONAL FACE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $150 BILLION, OFFERING TO ENTER INTO A SETTLEMENT DIALOGUE WITH RESPECT TO ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY GOLDMAN SACHS IN CONNECTION WITH

SUCH OFFERINGS.

ULTIMATELY, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS FOR REPURCHASE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BASED ON ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: (I) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CLAIMS ARE ACTUALLY MADE WITHIN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGREEMENTS TO TOLL THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO WITH TRUSTEES

REPRESENTING TRUSTS; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE ARE UNDERLYING BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO VALID CLAIMS FOR REPURCHASE; (III) IN THE CASE OF LOANS ORIGINATED BY OTHERS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FIRM COULD BE HELD

LIABLE AND, IF IT IS, THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PURSUE AND COLLECT ON ANY CLAIMS AGAINST THE PARTIES WHO MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE FIRM; (IV) MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET; AND

(V) LEGAL AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS. SEE NOTE 27 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AGREEMENTS THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO TO TOLL THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

BASED UPON THE LARGE NUMBER OF DEFAULTS IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, INCLUDING THOSE SOLD OR SECURITIZED BY THE FIRM, THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR INCREASING CLAIMS FOR

REPURCHASES. HOWEVER, THE FIRM IS NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THAT EXPOSURE AT THIS TIME.

FORECLOSURE AND OTHER MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES.

THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED A NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM REGULATORS AND OTHER AGENCIES, INCLUDING STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND BANKING REGULATORS, AS PART OF AN INDUSTRY-WIDE FOCUS ON THE PRACTICES

OF LENDERS AND SERVICERS IN CONNECTION WITH FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES. THE REQUESTS SOUGHT INFORMATION ABOUT THE FORECLOSURE AND SERVICING PROTOCOLS AND ACTIVITIES OF LITTON, A

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING SUBSIDIARY SOLD BY THE FIRM TO OCWEN FINANCIAL CORPORATION (OCWEN) IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. THE FIRM IS COOPERATING WITH THE REQUESTS AND THESE INQUIRIES MAY RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF FINES OR OTHER

REGULATORY ACTION.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF LITTON, THE FIRM PROVIDED CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AND INDEMNITIES FOR BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES, TO OCWEN. THESE INDEMNITIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LIMITATIONS, AND ARE CAPPED AT APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION. THE FIRM HAS NOT YET RECEIVED ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. THE FIRM ALSO AGREED TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC INDEMNITIES TO

OCWEN RELATED TO CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD THAT LITTON WAS OWNED BY THE FIRM AND WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF THE RELATED RESERVES ACCRUED FOR SUCH MATTERS BY LITTON AT THE TIME OF THE SALE. THESE

INDEMNITIES ARE CAPPED AT APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION. THE FIRM HAS RECORDED A RESERVE FOR THE PORTION OF THESE POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT IT BELIEVES IS PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, CLAIMS UNDER THESE

INDEMNITIES, AND PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE CLAIMS, WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRM.

THE FIRM FURTHER AGREED TO PROVIDE INDEMNITIES TO OCWEN NOT SUBJECT TO A CAP, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATE TO POTENTIAL LIABILITIES CONSTITUTING FINES OR CIVIL

MONETARY PENALTIES WHICH COULD BE IMPOSED IN SETTLEMENTS WITH CERTAIN TERMS WITH U.S. STATES ATTORNEYS GENERAL OR IN CONSENT ORDERS WITH CERTAIN TERMS WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF

THE CURRENCY, THE FDIC OR THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, IN EACH CASE RELATING TO LITTONS FORECLOSURE AND SERVICING PRACTICES WHILE IT WAS OWNED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE BOARD OF

GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) RELATING TO FORECLOSURE AND SERVICING MATTERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

UNDER THE LITTON SALE AGREEMENT THE FIRM ALSO RETAINED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CLAIMS RELATED TO LITTONS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN LENDER-PLACED MORTGAGE INSURANCE, OBLIGATIONS TO REPURCHASE

CERTAIN LOANS FROM GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES, SUBPOENAS FROM ONE OF LITTONS REGULATORS, AND FINES OR CIVIL PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OR THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN

COMPLIANCE MATTERS. MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS RECEIVED NO CLAIMS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES OTHER THAN AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT WITH RESPECT

TO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2011, GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA ENTERED INTO A CONSENT ORDER (THE ORDER) WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RELATING TO THE SERVICING OF

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. THE TERMS OF THE ORDER WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AND, IN MANY RESPECTS, IDENTICAL TO THE ORDERS ENTERED INTO WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BY OTHER LARGE U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE ORDER SET FORTH VARIOUS

ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER CONDUCT IN SERVICING BY LITTON, REQUIRES THAT GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA CEASE AND DESIST SUCH CONDUCT, AND REQUIRED THAT GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA, AND THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS, TAKE VARIOUS AFFIRMATIVE STEPS. THE ORDER

REQUIRED (I) GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA TO ENGAGE A THIRD-PARTY CONSULTANT TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF CERTAIN FORECLOSURE ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS THAT OCCURRED OR WERE PENDING BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010; (II) THE

ADOPTION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO MANAGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES USED TO OUTSOURCE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, LOSS MITIGATION OR FORECLOSURE; (III) A VALIDATION REPORT FROM AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY CONSULTANT

REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER FOR THE FIRST YEAR; AND (IV) SUBMISSION OF QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORTS AS TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (OR COMMITTEES THEREOF) OF GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RELATING TO THE SERVICING OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND FORECLOSURE PROCESSING. THIS

SETTLEMENT AMENDS THE ORDER WHICH IS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PROVIDES FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW UNDER THE ORDER AND CALLS FOR GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA COLLECTIVELY TO: (I) MAKE CASH PAYMENTS INTO A SETTLEMENT FUND FOR

DISTRIBUTION TO ELIGIBLE BORROWERS; AND (II) PROVIDE OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR FORECLOSURE PREVENTION AND LOSS MITIGATION THROUGH JANUARY 2015. THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE ORDER WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT.

GUARANTEES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO

VARIOUS DERIVATIVES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S. GAAP, INCLUDING WRITTEN EQUITY AND COMMODITY PUT OPTIONS, WRITTEN CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS, FLOORS AND SWAPTIONS. DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVES ARE NOT REQUIRED

IF THEY MAY BE CASH SETTLED AND THE FIRM HAS NO BASIS TO CONCLUDE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES HELD THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS AT INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET FOR CERTAIN LARGE,

INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANK COUNTERPARTIES, CENTRAL CLEARING COUNTERPARTIES AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTERPARTIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT INCLUDED SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE TABLE BELOW.

THE FIRM, IN ITS CAPACITY AS AN AGENCY LENDER, INDEMNIFIES MOST OF ITS SECURITIES LENDING

CUSTOMERS AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED IN THE EVENT THAT BORROWERS DO NOT RETURN SECURITIES AND THE COLLATERAL HELD IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM PROVIDES OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES (E.G., STANDBY

LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER GUARANTEES TO ENABLE CLIENTS TO COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS AND FUND-RELATED GUARANTEES). THESE GUARANTEES REPRESENT OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES IF THE GUARANTEED PARTY FAILS TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER A

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THAT BENEFICIARY.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT DERIVATIVES THAT MEET

THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE AND CERTAIN OTHER GUARANTEES. THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT IN THE TABLE BELOW IS BASED ON THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE CONTRACT AND THEREFORE DOES NOT REPRESENT ANTICIPATED LOSSES. SEE NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW.

BECAUSE DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AT FAIR VALUE, THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED THE BEST INDICATION OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK FOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE CARRYING VALUES BELOW EXCLUDE THE EFFECT OF A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF THAT MAY EXIST UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING

AGREEMENT AND THE EFFECT OF NETTING OF COLLATERAL POSTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS.

1.

THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RISK MANAGED TOGETHER WITH DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE, AND THEREFORE THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT REFLECT THE

FIRMS OVERALL RISK RELATED TO ITS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2012, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET LIABILITY AND THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT RELATED TO DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES WERE $8.58 BILLION AND $663.15 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

2.

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS WAS $27.14 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2013. BECAUSE THE

CONTRACTUAL NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE THAT EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES LENT TO THE BORROWER, THERE IS MINIMAL PERFORMANCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES. AS OF

DECEMBER 2012, THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT AND COLLATERAL HELD RELATED TO SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS WERE $27.12 BILLION AND $27.89 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

3.

OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES EXCLUDES CERTAIN COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT ARE INCLUDED IN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT. SEE

TABLE IN COMMITMENTS ABOVE FOR A SUMMARY OF THE FIRMS COMMITMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2012, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET LIABILITY AND THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT RELATED TO OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES WERE $152 MILLION AND

GUARANTEES OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY

TRUSTS.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED TRUSTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL I, THE APEX TRUSTS, THE 2012 TRUSTS, AND OTHER ENTITIES FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF ISSUING SECURITIES TO THIRD

PARTIES, LENDING THE PROCEEDS TO THE FIRM AND ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FIRM AND THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO THIS PURPOSE. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES. SEE NOTE 16 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL I, THE APEX TRUSTS, AND THE 2012 TRUSTS.

THE FIRM EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES FOR

THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES. TIMELY PAYMENT BY THE FIRM OF AMOUNTS DUE TO THESE ENTITIES UNDER THE GUARANTEE, BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

COVER PAYMENTS DUE ON THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY

CIRCUMSTANCES WILL OCCUR, SUCH AS NONPERFORMANCE ON THE PART OF PAYING AGENTS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR THE FIRM TO MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE ENTITIES OTHER THAN THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

GUARANTEE, BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED BY THESE ENTITIES.

INDEMNITIES AND GUARANTEES OF SERVICE PROVIDERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE

FIRM INDEMNIFIES AND GUARANTEES CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS CLEARING AND CUSTODY AGENTS, TRUSTEES AND ADMINISTRATORS, AGAINST SPECIFIED POTENTIAL LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACTING AS AN AGENT OF, OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO, THE FIRM OR

ITS AFFILIATES.

THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE LIABLE TO SOME CLIENTS FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDERS, INCLUDING SUB-CUSTODIANS AND THIRD-PARTY BROKERS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF PAYMENT, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT NETWORKS AS WELL AS SECURITIES EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF SUCH

NETWORKS AND EXCHANGES IN THE EVENT OF MEMBER DEFAULTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PRIME BROKERAGE AND CLEARING BUSINESSES, THE FIRM AGREES TO CLEAR

AND SETTLE ON BEHALF OF ITS CLIENTS THE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY THEM WITH OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS. THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE SECURED BY THE ASSETS IN THE CLIENTS ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ANY PROCEEDS RECEIVED

FROM THE TRANSACTIONS CLEARED AND SETTLED BY THE FIRM ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT. IN CONNECTION WITH JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS, THE FIRM MAY ISSUE LOAN GUARANTEES UNDER WHICH IT MAY BE LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF FRAUD, MISAPPROPRIATION, ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS INVOLVING THE BORROWER.

THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM

PAYOUT UNDER THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO MATERIAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE GUARANTEES AND

INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012.

OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS.

THE FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS

AND WARRANTIES TO COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH A VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND OCCASIONALLY INDEMNIFIES THEM AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY THE BREACH OF THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE

INDEMNIFICATIONS PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN OR ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN U.S. TAX LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH ORDINARY-COURSE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS SECURITIES ISSUANCES, BORROWINGS OR DERIVATIVES.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS TO SOME COUNTERPARTIES TO PROTECT THEM IN THE EVENT ADDITIONAL TAXES ARE OWED OR

PAYMENTS ARE WITHHELD, DUE EITHER TO A CHANGE IN OR AN ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

THESE

INDEMNIFICATIONS GENERALLY ARE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. GENERALLY, THERE ARE NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND THE CONTINGENCIES TRIGGERING THE OBLIGATION

TO INDEMNIFY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR. THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS

UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO MATERIAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 OR DECEMBER 2012.

DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF $0.55 PER COMMON SHARE TO BE PAID ON MARCH 28, 2014 TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON FEBRUARY 28, 2014.

THE FIRMS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL

OF COMMON EQUITY. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY THE FIRMS CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITIONS (I.E., COMPARISONS OF THE

FIRMS DESIRED LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL TO ITS ACTUAL LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL), BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK. ANY

REPURCHASE OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

DURING 2013, 2012 AND 2011,

THE FIRM REPURCHASED 39.3 MILLION, 42.0 MILLION AND 47.0 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE COST PER SHARE OF $157.11, $110.31 AND $128.33, FOR A TOTAL COST OF $6.17 BILLION, $4.64 BILLION AND

$6.04 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF CERTAIN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS, EMPLOYEES MAY REMIT SHARES TO THE FIRM OR THE FIRM MAY CANCEL RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) TO

SATISFY MINIMUM STATUTORY EMPLOYEE TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THESE PLANS, DURING 2013, 2012 AND 2011, EMPLOYEES REMITTED 161,211 SHARES, 33,477 SHARES AND 75,517 SHARES WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF $25 MILLION, $3 MILLION AND

$12 MILLION, AND THE FIRM CANCELLED 4.0 MILLION, 12.7 MILLION AND 12.0 MILLION OF RSUS WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF $599 MILLION, $1.44 BILLION AND $1.91 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2013, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY) EXERCISED IN FULL

A WARRANT TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK. THE WARRANT, AS AMENDED IN MARCH 2013, REQUIRED NET SHARE SETTLEMENT, AND THE FIRM DELIVERED 13.1 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ON

OCTOBER 4, 2013. THE NUMBER OF SHARES DELIVERED REPRESENTED THE VALUE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK OVER THE 10 TRADING DAYS PRECEDING OCTOBER 1, 2013 AND THE EXERCISE PRICE

OF $115.00 MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (43.5 MILLION) COVERED BY THE WARRANT.

NOTE 20. REGULATION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

NOTE 20.

REGULATION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF GROUP INC., A BANK HOLDING COMPANY

UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (BHC ACT) AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER AMENDMENTS TO THE BHC ACT EFFECTED BY THE U.S. GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT OF 1999. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED RISK-BASED

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL REGULATIONS WHICH, AS OF DECEMBER 2013, WERE BASED ON THE BASEL I CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND

ALSO REFLECTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPRESSED AS CAPITAL RATIOS THAT COMPARE MEASURES OF CAPITAL TO

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS). THE CAPITAL REGULATIONS ALSO INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGE. THE FIRMS CAPITAL LEVELS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY ITS REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND

OTHER FACTORS. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IMPLEMENTED REVISED CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE FIRMS U.S. BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, GS BANK USA, IS SUBJECT TO SIMILAR CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REGULATIONS. UNDER

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION, THE FIRM AND GS BANK USA MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRMS AND GS BANK USAS CAPITAL LEVELS, AS

WELL AS GS BANK USAS PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.

MANY OF THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO. AND THE FIRMS OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE

REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

GROUP INC.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013, FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATIONS REQUIRED BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4% AND A MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 8%. THE REQUIRED

MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO IN ORDER TO MEET THE QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING A WELL-CAPITALIZED BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES ARE 6% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY. BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING ON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, THE MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES THAT HAD RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR THAT HAD IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2014, ALL BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES BECAME SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%.

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS

TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY AVERAGE ADJUSTED TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTION

FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL).

RWAS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE CALCULATED

BASED ON MEASURES OF CREDIT RISK AND MARKET RISK. CREDIT RISK REQUIREMENTS FOR ON-BALANCE-SHEET ASSETS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE BALANCE SHEET VALUE. FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, A CREDIT

EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF EACH TRADE AND, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, POSITIVE NET EXPOSURE. ALL SUCH ASSETS AND EXPOSURES ARE THEN ASSIGNED A RISK WEIGHT DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY

IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK OR A QUALIFYING SECURITIES FIRM OR OTHER ENTITY (OR IF COLLATERAL IS HELD, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE COLLATERAL).

AS OF DECEMBER 2012, RWAS FOR MARKET RISK WERE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE FIRMS VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL, SUPPLEMENTED BY THE STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD USED TO DETERMINE RWAS FOR

SPECIFIC RISK FOR CERTAIN POSITIONS. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013, RWAS FOR MARKET RISK ARE DETERMINED USING VAR, STRESSED VAR,

INCREMENTAL RISK, COMPREHENSIVE RISK AND A STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR SPECIFIC RISK.

REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK

THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES (AGENCIES) HAVE APPROVED REVISED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIO REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING A NEW COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR U.S. BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS (REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK). THESE REGULATIONS ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEES DECEMBER 2010 FINAL CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL III) AND ALSO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN

PROVISIONS OF THE

DODD-FRANK ACT.

UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, GROUP INC.

IS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION. BELOW ARE THE ASPECTS OF THE RULES THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT TO THE FIRM, AS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION.

DEFINITION OF CAPITAL AND CAPITAL RATIOS.

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INTRODUCED CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL, WHICH, SUBJECT TO TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, BECAME EFFECTIVE ACROSS THE FIRMS REGULATORY CAPITAL AND

LEVERAGE RATIOS ON JANUARY 1, 2014. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CAPITAL MEASURE CALLED COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1), AND THE RELATED REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIO OF CET1 TO RWAS (CET1 RATIO). IN ADDITION, THE DEFINITION

OF TIER 1 CAPITAL HAS BEEN NARROWED TO INCLUDE ONLY CET1 AND INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS PERPETUAL NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA.

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE REVISED REQUIREMENTS PHASE IN OVER TIME. THESE INCLUDE INCREASES IN

THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW CAPITAL BUFFERS AND CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS FROM REGULATORY CAPITAL (SUCH AS INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS). IN ADDITION, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS

IS BEING PHASED OUT OF REGULATORY CAPITAL.

THE MINIMUM CET1 RATIO IS 4.0% AS OF JANUARY 1, 2014 AND WILL

INCREASE TO 4.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2015. THE MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO INCREASED FROM 4.0% TO 5.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2014 AND WILL INCREASE TO 6.0% BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015. THE MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO REMAINS

UNCHANGED AT 8.0%. THESE MINIMUM RATIOS WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY A NEW CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER THAT PHASES IN, BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016, IN INCREMENTS OF 0.625% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 2.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE

REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ALSO INTRODUCES A NEW COUNTER-CYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, TO BE IMPOSED IN THE EVENT THAT NATIONAL SUPERVISORS DEEM IT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT EXCESSIVE CREDIT GROWTH.

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

IN

FEBRUARY 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFORMED US THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL RUN, AS REQUIRED OF ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AND THEREFORE CHANGES TO RWAS

WILL TAKE EFFECT BEGINNING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014. ACCORDINGLY, THE CALCULATION OF RWAS IN FUTURE QUARTERS WILL BE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES.



DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014  THE BASEL I RISK-BASED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS RELATED TO EXISTING CAPITAL

DEDUCTIONS AND THE PHASE-IN OF NEW CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS (BASEL I ADJUSTED);



DURING THE REMAINING QUARTERS OF 2014  THE HIGHER OF RWAS COMPUTED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH OR THE BASEL I

ADJUSTED CALCULATION; AND



BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015  THE HIGHER OF RWAS COMPUTED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED OR STANDARDIZED APPROACH.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND THE BASEL III ADVANCED

APPROACH IS THAT THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH UTILIZES PRESCRIBED RISK-WEIGHTINGS AND DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE THE USE OF INTERNAL MODELS TO COMPUTE EXPOSURE FOR CREDIT RISK ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHEREAS THE BASEL III

ADVANCED APPROACH PERMITS THE USE OF SUCH MODELS, SUBJECT TO SUPERVISORY APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, RWAS UNDER THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH DEPEND LARGELY ON THE TYPE OF COUNTERPARTY (E.G., WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK, BROKER-DEALER OR

OTHER ENTITY), RATHER THAN ON ASSESSMENTS OF EACH COUNTERPARTYS CREDITWORTHINESS. FURTHERMORE, THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH DOES NOT INCLUDE A CAPITAL REQUIREMENT FOR OPERATIONAL RISK. RWAS FOR MARKET RISK UNDER BOTH THE STANDARDIZED AND BASEL

III ADVANCED APPROACHES ARE BASED ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

REGULATORY LEVERAGE RATIOS.

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INCREASED THE MINIMUM TIER 1

LEVERAGE RATIO APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM FROM 3% TO 4% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014.

IN ADDITION, THE REVISED CAPITAL

FRAMEWORK WILL INTRODUCE A NEW TIER 1 SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO) FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH COMPARES TIER 1 CAPITAL (AS DEFINED UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK) TO A MEASURE OF

LEVERAGE EXPOSURE (DEFINED AS THE SUM OF THE FIRMS ASSETS LESS CERTAIN CET1 DEDUCTIONS PLUS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES). EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT WILL BE 3%; HOWEVER,

DISCLOSURE WILL BE REQUIRED BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. WHILE A DEFINITION OF THE LEVERAGE EXPOSURE MEASURE WAS SET OUT IN THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, THIS MEASURE AND/OR THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE MAY BE AMENDED BY THE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES PRIOR TO THE JANUARY 2018 EFFECTIVE DATE.

GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING INSTITUTIONS (G-SIBS)

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS UPDATED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING THE GLOBAL SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND DETERMINING THE

RANGE OF ADDITIONAL CET1 THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY THOSE DEEMED TO BE G-SIBS. THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CET1 FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS WILL INITIALLY RANGE FROM 1% TO 2.5% AND COULD BE HIGHER IN THE FUTURE FOR A BANKING INSTITUTION THAT

INCREASES ITS SYSTEMIC FOOTPRINT (E.G., BY INCREASING TOTAL ASSETS). IN NOVEMBER 2013, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (ESTABLISHED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP OF 20) INDICATED THAT THE FIRM, BASED ON ITS 2012 FINANCIAL DATA,

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HOLD AN ADDITIONAL 1.5% OF CET1 AS A G-SIB. THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CET1 THAT THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO HOLD WILL INITIALLY BE BASED ON THE FIRMS 2013 FINANCIAL DATA AND THE MANNER AND TIMING

OF THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY. THE BASEL COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT G-SIBS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE CAPITAL SURCHARGES ON A PHASED-IN BASIS BEGINNING IN 2016 THROUGH 2019.

BANK SUBSIDIARIES

GS

BANK USA, AN FDIC-INSURED, NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, IS SUPERVISED AND REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC, THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PROTECTION BUREAU, AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (DESCRIBED BELOW) THAT ARE CALCULATED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL, GS BANK USA COMPUTES

ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH, AS OF DECEMBER 2013, WERE BASED ON BASEL I AND ALSO REFLECTED THE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IMPLEMENTED THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UNDER THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA, IN

ORDER TO MEET THE QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING A WELL-CAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, GS BANK USA IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10% AND A TIER 1

LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. GS BANK USA AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THESE WELL-CAPITALIZED LEVELS. ACCORDINGLY, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, GS BANK USA IS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 11% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%. AS NOTED IN THE TABLE BELOW, GS BANK USA WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS INFORMATION REGARDING GS BANK USAS REGULATORY

CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL I, AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 REFLECTS THE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THESE

CHANGES RESULTED IN INCREASED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET RISK. THE INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 2012 IS PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

ORGANIZATION UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK. GS BANK USA HAS ALSO BEEN INFORMED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THAT IT HAS COMPLETED A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL RUN, AS REQUIRED OF ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AND

THEREFORE CHANGES TO ITS CALCULATIONS OF RWAS WILL TAKE EFFECT BEGINNING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014. UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2014, GS

BANK USA BECAME SUBJECT TO A NEW MINIMUM CET1 RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 4%, INCREASING TO 4.5% IN 2015. IN ADDITION, THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK CHANGES THE STANDARDS FOR

WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGULATIONS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015 BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INTRODUCING A CET1 RATIO REQUIREMENT OF 6.5% AND INCREASING THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENT FROM 6%

TO 8%. IN ADDITION, COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2018, ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE A SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3% OR GREATER.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED ITS FINAL GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING INCREMENTAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DOMESTIC SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING INSTITUTIONS (D-SIBS). THESE GUIDELINES ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO

THE FRAMEWORK OUTLINED ABOVE FOR G-SIBS. THE IMPACT OF THESE GUIDELINES ON THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF GS BANK USA WILL DEPEND ON HOW THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE DEPOSITS OF GS BANK USA ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AMOUNT DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION HELD AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK WAS APPROXIMATELY $50.39 BILLION AND $58.67 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNTS BY $50.29 BILLION AND $58.59 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND GROUP INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES (OTHER THAN, GENERALLY,

SUBSIDIARIES OF GS BANK USA) ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THESE REGULATIONS GENERALLY LIMIT THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM GS BANK USA) THAT MAY TAKE PLACE AND GENERALLY REQUIRE THOSE

TRANSACTIONS TO BE ON MARKET TERMS OR BETTER TO GS BANK USA.

THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARY, GSIB, IS

A WHOLLY-OWNED CREDIT INSTITUTION, REGULATED BY THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA) AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FCA) AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, GSIB WAS IN

COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES

THE FIRMS U.S. REGULATED BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE GS&CO. AND GSEC. GS&CO. AND GSEC ARE REGISTERED U.S. BROKER-DEALERS AND FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY THE SEC, THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC), THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, INC. (FINRA) AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES

ASSOCIATION. RULE 15C3-1 OF THE SEC AND RULE 1.17 OF THE CFTC SPECIFY UNIFORM MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS DEFINED, FOR THEIR REGISTRANTS, AND ALSO EFFECTIVELY REQUIRE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE REGISTRANTS ASSETS BE KEPT

IN RELATIVELY LIQUID FORM. GS&CO. AND GSEC HAVE ELECTED TO COMPUTE THEIR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT AS PERMITTED BY

RULE 15C3-1.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, GS&CO. HAD

REGULATORY NET CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY RULE 15C3-1, OF $15.81 BILLION AND $14.12 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY $13.76 BILLION AND $12.42 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND

DECEMBER 2012, GSEC HAD REGULATORY NET CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY RULE 15C3-1, OF $1.38 BILLION AND $2.02 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY $1.21 BILLION AND $1.92 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION TO ITS ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, GS&CO. IS ALSO REQUIRED TO HOLD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN

EXCESS OF $1 BILLION AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK STANDARDS OF APPENDIX E OF RULE 15C3-1. GS&CO. IS ALSO REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE SEC IN THE EVENT THAT ITS TENTATIVE NET

CAPITAL IS LESS THAN $5 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, GS&CO. HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF BOTH THE MINIMUM AND THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.

OTHER NON-U.S. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) AND GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL). GSI, THE FIRMS REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER, IS

REGULATED BY THE PRA AND THE FCA. GSJCL, THE FIRMS JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER, IS REGULATED BY JAPANS FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. THESE AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS

PROMULGATED BY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR LOCAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS.

THE BASEL COMMITTEES GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING INCREMENTAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR D-SIBS MAY ALSO IMPACT CERTAIN OF THE

FIRMS NON-U.S. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GSI. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF THESE GUIDELINES WILL DEPEND ON HOW THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENTS

THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE RESTRICT

GROUP INC.S ABILITY TO WITHDRAW CAPITAL FROM ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, GROUP INC. WAS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN APPROXIMATELY $31.20 BILLION AND $31.01 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF MINIMUM

EQUITY CAPITAL IN THESE REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. THIS MINIMUM EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENT INCLUDES CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AS TO THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO GROUP INC. BY ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION TO

LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC AND THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE (INCLUDING GS BANK USA) IF, IN THE RELEVANT REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN THE LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AND OUTSTANDING LOANS AND GUARANTEES TO ITS FUNDS OF $582 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT AS OF DECEMBER 2013 PRIMARILY RELATES TO A GUARANTEE THAT THE FIRM HAS VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH A FINANCING AGREEMENT WITH A

THIRD-PARTY LENDER EXECUTED BY ONE OF THE FIRMS REAL ESTATE FUNDS THAT IS NOT COVERED BY THE VOLCKER RULE. THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEE COULD BE INCREASED UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $300 MILLION. THE AMOUNT AS OF DECEMBER 2012 WAS

COLLATERALIZED BY CERTAIN FUND ASSETS AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO CERTAIN REAL ESTATE FUNDS FOR WHICH THE FIRM VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ALLEVIATE LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND TO ENABLE THEM TO FUND CERTAIN

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THE FIRM HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT OR OTHER GUARANTEES TO ITS FUNDS.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE NET TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULT IN TAXABLE OR

DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS IN FUTURE YEARS AND ARE MEASURED USING THE TAX RATES AND LAWS THAT WILL BE IN EFFECT WHEN SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT WILL BE REALIZED AND PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE LOSSES IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS. TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM HAS RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $232 MILLION AND $222 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY, IN CONNECTION WITH U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. THE FIRM ALSO RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $45 MILLION AND $60 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.

AS OF

DECEMBER 2013, THE U.S. FEDERAL AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WERE $38 MILLION AND $854 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IF NOT UTILIZED, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN 2014. THE FOREIGN

NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS CAN BE CARRIED FORWARD INDEFINITELY. STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS OF $781 MILLION WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN 2014. IF THESE CARRYFORWARDS EXPIRE, THEY WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE FIRM HAD NO FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS AND NO RELATED NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 2013 OR DECEMBER 2012.

THE FIRM HAD NO CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND NO RELATED NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 2013 OR DECEMBER 2012.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCREASED BY $15 MILLION AND $103 MILLION DURING 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE

IN 2013 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FROM WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO REALIZE ANY BENEFIT. THE INCREASE IN 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS CONSIDERED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO

BE UNREALIZABLE.

THE FIRM PERMANENTLY REINVESTS ELIGIBLE EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND,

ACCORDINGLY, DOES NOT ACCRUE ANY U.S. INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD ARISE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED. AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THIS POLICY RESULTED IN AN UNRECOGNIZED NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $4.06 BILLION AND

$3.75 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO REINVESTED EARNINGS OF $22.54 BILLION AND $21.69 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

THE FIRM RECOGNIZES TAX POSITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY BASED ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. A POSITION THAT MEETS THIS STANDARD IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REALIZED ON SETTLEMENT. A LIABILITY IS ESTABLISHED FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN IN A TAX

RETURN AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2013 AND DECEMBER 2012, THE ACCRUED LIABILITY FOR INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO INCOME TAX

MATTERS AND INCOME TAX PENALTIES WAS $410 MILLION AND $374 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED $53 MILLION FOR 2013, $95 MILLION FOR 2012 AND $21 MILLION FOR 2011 OF INTEREST AND INCOME TAX PENALTIES. IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 2013 DUE TO POTENTIAL AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE ANY POTENTIAL CHANGE.

JAPAN, HONG KONG, KOREA AND VARIOUS STATES, SUCH AS NEW YORK. THE TAX YEARS UNDER EXAMINATION VARY BY JURISDICTION. THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT COMPLETION OF THESE AUDITS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION BUT IT MAY BE

MATERIAL TO OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, ON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THAT PERIOD.

FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IT HAS ESTABLISHED IS ADEQUATE IN RELATION TO THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS.

IN JANUARY 2013, THE FIRM WAS ACCEPTED INTO THE COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROCESS PROGRAM BY THE IRS. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS THE FIRM TO WORK WITH THE IRS TO IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX

ISSUES BEFORE THE FILING OF TAX RETURNS. THE 2013 TAX YEAR IS THE FIRST YEAR BEING EXAMINED UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE FIRM WAS ACCEPTED INTO THE PROGRAM AGAIN FOR THE 2014 TAX YEAR.

NOTE 25.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

THE FIRM REPORTS ITS ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING FOUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INVESTMENT

BANKING, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, INVESTING & LENDING AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS LINES HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND

ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS: (I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, (II) THEIR METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF CLIENTS THEY SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS A WHOLE  COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY  ARE

BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AS WELL AS THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES.

CONSEQUENTLY, PRE-TAX MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES ASSETS (INCLUDING ALLOCATIONS OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND CASH, SECURED CLIENT FINANCING AND OTHER ASSETS), REVENUES AND EXPENSES AMONG THE FOUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED

NATURE OF THESE SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE MADE IN ALLOCATING CERTAIN ASSETS, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY VIEWS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SEGMENTS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN

SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE THIRD-PARTY RATES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE SEGMENT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW IS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING

METHODOLOGIES.



REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN DETERMINING PRE-TAX EARNINGS.



NET REVENUES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS OF INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE TO SPECIFIC SECURITIES, COMMODITIES AND OTHER

POSITIONS IN RELATION TO THE CASH GENERATED BY, OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF, SUCH UNDERLYING POSITIONS. NET INTEREST IS INCLUDED IN SEGMENT NET REVENUES AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH MANAGEMENT ASSESSES SEGMENT PERFORMANCE.



OVERHEAD EXPENSES NOT DIRECTLY ALLOCABLE TO SPECIFIC SEGMENTS ARE ALLOCATED RATABLY BASED ON DIRECT SEGMENT EXPENSES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION PROVIDES A REASONABLE REPRESENTATION OF EACH

SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTION TO CONSOLIDATED

PRE-TAX

EARNINGS AND TOTAL ASSETS.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS MAY ARISE FROM MARKET MAKING, CLIENT FACILITATION, INVESTING,

UNDERWRITING, LENDING AND COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL FACTORS. THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK BY ACTIVELY MONITORING EXPOSURES AND OBTAINING COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES AS

DEEMED APPROPRIATE.

WHILE THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES EXPOSE IT TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, THE FIRM

ROUTINELY EXECUTES A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSET MANAGERS, INVESTMENT FUNDS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, BROKERS AND DEALERS, CLEARING HOUSES AND EXCHANGES, WHICH RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER

OR ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, OR TO A PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSE OR EXCHANGE.

TO REDUCE CREDIT EXPOSURES, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT

PERMIT THE FIRM TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES AND/OR ENABLE THE FIRM TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL ON AN UPFRONT OR CONTINGENT BASIS. COLLATERAL OBTAINED BY THE FIRM RELATED TO DERIVATIVE ASSETS IS PRINCIPALLY CASH AND IS HELD

BY THE FIRM OR A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN. COLLATERAL OBTAINED BY THE FIRM RELATED TO RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS IS PRIMARILY U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. SEE

(INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW) CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE IN EARLY STAGES, AND MANY OF THESE CASES SEEK AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES.

UNDER ASC 450, AN EVENT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IF THE CHANCE OF THE FUTURE EVENT OR EVENTS OCCURRING IS MORE

THAN REMOTE BUT LESS THAN LIKELY AND AN EVENT IS REMOTE IF THE CHANCE OF THE FUTURE EVENT OR EVENTS OCCURRING IS SLIGHT. THUS, REFERENCES TO THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FOR CASES IN WHICH THE

FIRM IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS MEAN THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF LOSS FOR CASES FOR WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES THE RISK OF LOSS IS MORE THAN SLIGHT.

WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS WHERE

(I) ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS HAVE CLAIMED AN AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES, (II) THE FIRM IS BEING, OR THREATENED TO BE, SUED BY PURCHASERS IN AN UNDERWRITING AND IS NOT BEING INDEMNIFIED BY A PARTY THAT THE FIRM BELIEVES WILL PAY ANY

JUDGMENT, OR (III) THE PURCHASERS ARE DEMANDING THAT THE FIRM REPURCHASE SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT HAS ESTIMATED THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS AS BEING EQUAL TO (A) IN THE CASE OF (I), THE AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES

CLAIMED, (B) IN THE CASE OF (II), THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM SOLD IN THE UNDERWRITINGS AND (C) IN THE CASE OF (III), THE PRICE THAT PURCHASERS PAID FOR THE SECURITIES LESS THE ESTIMATED VALUE, IF ANY, AS OF DECEMBER 2013

OF THE RELEVANT SECURITIES, IN EACH OF CASES (I), (II) AND (III), TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY FACTORS BELIEVED TO BE RELEVANT TO THE PARTICULAR MATTER OR MATTERS OF THAT TYPE. AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, THE FIRM HAS ESTIMATED THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE

OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS FOR SUCH MATTERS AND FOR ANY OTHER MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW WHERE MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION IN EXCESS OF THE

AGGREGATE RESERVES FOR SUCH MATTERS.

MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY UNABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FOR MATTERS

OTHER THAN THOSE INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE ABOVE, INCLUDING WHERE (I) ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT CLAIMED AN AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES, UNLESS MANAGEMENT CAN OTHERWISE DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT, (II) THE MATTERS ARE IN EARLY

STAGES (SUCH AS THE ACTION FILED BY THE LIBYAN INVESTMENT AUTHORITY DISCUSSED BELOW), (III) THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CLASS BEING CERTIFIED OR THE ULTIMATE SIZE OF THE CLASS, (IV) THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE OUTCOME

OF PENDING APPEALS OR MOTIONS, (V) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTUAL ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED, AND/OR (VI) THERE ARE NOVEL LEGAL ISSUES PRESENTED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE MORTGAGE-RELATED

PUT-BACK CLAIMS AND ANY FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES WORKING GROUP OF THE U.S. FINANCIAL FRAUD ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE (RMBS WORKING GROUP) MAY ULTIMATELY

RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FIRMS LIABILITIES FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS, BUT IS NOT INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, THOUGH THE OUTCOMES COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON

THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD. SEE NOTE 18 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON MORTGAGE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES.
