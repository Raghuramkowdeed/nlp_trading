BUSINESSES IN THREE WAYS.



FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL

POSITION, WE UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WHERE

SPREADS AND FEES ARE GENERALLY LARGER.



FINALLY, WE STRUCTURE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS THAT ADDRESS

COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

OUR FICC AND EQUITIES BUSINESSES OPERATE IN CLOSE COORDINATION

TO PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH SERVICES AND CROSS-MARKET KNOWLEDGE AND

EXPERTISE.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES IN BOTH FICC AND EQUITIES, WE

ASSUME A VARIETY OF RISKS AND DEVOTE RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY,

ANALYZE AND BENEFIT FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE CAPITALIZE ON OUR

ANALYTICAL MODELS TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE INFORMED

TRADING JUDGMENTS, AND WE SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED

DISPARITIES IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND

FROM MACROECONOMIC AND ISSUER-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

INVESTMENT FUNDS. OUR STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO THESE FUNDS

GENERALLY IS TO INVEST OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF

INVESTMENTS THAT IS DIVERSIFIED BY INDUSTRY, PRODUCT TYPE,

GEOGRAPHIC REGION, AND TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND TYPE. OUR

CORPORATE INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUE, ON A GLOBAL BASIS, LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES IN PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, LEVERAGED BUYOUTS, ACQUISITIONS AND

INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL PARTIES. OUR REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS INVEST IN REAL ESTATE OPERATING

COMPANIES, DEBT AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, AND

OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR MERCHANT

BANKING FUNDS INCLUDE A FUND THAT INVESTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND

INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED ASSETS AND COMPANIES ON A GLOBAL BASIS.

SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED $118 BILLION OF COMMITTED

EQUITY CAPITAL IN THESE FUNDS, CONSISTING OF $96 BILLION

OUR REAL ESTATE FUNDS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, $68 BILLION OF

THE COMMITTED EQUITY CAPITAL WAS FUNDED AND THE AMOUNT OF AUM

REMAINING IN THESE FUNDS AFTER DISTRIBUTIONS WAS

$64 BILLION.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE THREE PRIMARY REVENUE

STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS GENERALLY A

PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL, INVESTED CAPITAL,

TOTAL GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE. THESE ANNUAL

MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT NET

REVENUES. SECOND, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTOR IN

SOME OF THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON

REALIZATION. THIRD, AFTER A FUND HAS ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN

FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE RECEIVE AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE

FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS THAT IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME

AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS. THE SECOND AND THIRD

OF THESE REVENUE STREAMS ARE INCLUDED IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

WITHIN OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT.

TECHNOLOGY

GOLDMAN SACHS IS COMMITTED TO THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT,

MAINTENANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION.

OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES CAN BE BROADLY CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR

EFFORTS.



ENHANCING CLIENT SERVICE THROUGH INCREASED CONNECTIVITY AND THE

PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED, TAILORED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



IMPROVING OUR TRADING, EXECUTION AND CLEARING CAPABILITIES;



RISK MANAGEMENT; AND

WITH ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN

PARTICULAR, WE PROVIDE GLOBAL ELECTRONIC TRADING AND INFORMATION

DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES COVERING MANY OF OUR FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY, COMMODITY, EQUITY AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS AROUND THE

WORLD.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE CHANGED AND WILL

CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE WAYS THAT SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS ARE TRADED, DISTRIBUTED AND SETTLED. THIS CREATES BOTH

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR OUR BUSINESSES. WE REMAIN

COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

BUSINESS

CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY ARE HIGH PRIORITIES

FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN

DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY

IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE FIRMS CRITICAL

FACILITIES AND TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA). THE SEC ALSO

REVIEWS OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE

PROGRAM ARE CRISIS MANAGEMENT, PEOPLE RECOVERY FACILITIES,

BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, AND PROCESS

IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY, WE HAVE

DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES, POLICIES

AND TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION ASSETS OF THE FIRM AND

OUR CLIENTS. SAFEGUARDS ARE APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION

RESOURCES.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON

FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION

OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE

STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS

PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG OUR

EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE AND HIGH STANDARDS OF BUSINESS ETHICS.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A

CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART.

ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT VARIOUS

LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW

PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND

EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A

360-DEGREE

REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, WE HAD 30,522 EMPLOYEES, EXCLUDING

4,572 EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT ARE

HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD

ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR

PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER BROKERS AND

DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT

OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY,

DUE IN PART TO U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT HAS EXPANDED

THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A

U.S. BANK. IN PARTICULAR, A NUMBER OF LARGE COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRMS HAVE ESTABLISHED OR ACQUIRED BROKER-DEALERS OR

HAVE MERGED WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE

FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM

LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND INSURANCE TO BROKERAGE, ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING SERVICES, WHICH MAY ENHANCE

THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES PRODUCTS WITH

COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH HAS RESULTED

IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING AND TRADING

BUSINESSES AND COULD RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OTHER OF OUR

BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE,

PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO

BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY

NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS INCREASINGLY SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS AGREEMENTS

TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR OTHER LOAN

FACILITIES) FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH

INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. WE PROVIDE THESE

COMMITMENTS THROUGH OUR WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES OR THROUGH GS

BANK USA, PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENT-GRADE CLIENTS, OR THROUGH

GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. OR OUR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES,

PRIMARILY FOR OTHER CLIENTS. WITH RESPECT TO MOST OF THE WILLIAM

STREET COMMITMENTS, SMFG PROVIDES US WITH CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION

THAT IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS WE REALIZE ON

$1.00 BILLION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF

CERTAIN CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL PROVIDE

PROTECTION FOR 70% OF THE SECOND LOSS ON SUCH COMMITMENTS, UP TO

A MAXIMUM OF $1.13 BILLION. WE ALSO USE OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN WILLIAM

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND

BETTER CAPITALIZED AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE

AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR

BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE

IN THE PRICING OF BLOCK TRADES. ALSO, EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS TRADING SPREADS, HAVE BEEN

UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE

TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH OTHER

ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON

TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD

ELECTRONIC AND OTHER LOW-TOUCH, LOW-COMMISSION

TRADING WILL CONTINUE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE

FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING PRICES.

GS&CO. FINRA WAS FORMED WHEN THE NASD AND THE NYSE MERGED

THEIR REGULATORY OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH THE NYSE CONTINUES TO HAVE

OVERSIGHT OVER NYSE-RELATED MARKET ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION,

STATE SECURITIES AND OTHER REGULATORS ALSO HAVE REGULATORY OR

OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER GS&CO. SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESSES

ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS

GS&CO. AND GSEC ARE SUBJECT TO

RULE 15C3-1

OF THE SEC AND RULE 1.17 OF THE CFTC, WHICH SPECIFY UNIFORM

MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO EFFECTIVELY REQUIRE

THAT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE REGISTRANTS ASSETS BE KEPT

IN RELATIVELY LIQUID FORM. GS&CO. AND GSEC HAVE ELECTED TO

COMPUTE THEIR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT AS PERMITTED

BY

RULE 15C3-1.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, GS&CO. AND GSEC HAD NET CAPITAL IN

EXCESS OF THEIR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION TO ITS

INDUSTRIAL BANK, TO EXTEND CREDIT AND TO TAKE DEPOSITS, OTHER

THAN DEMAND DEPOSITS. GS BANK USA IS REGULATED BY THE FDIC AND

THE STATE OF UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND IS

SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, GS

BANK USA WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ACCEPT DEMAND DEPOSITS, GS

BANK USA IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A BANK FOR PURPOSES OF THE BANK

HOLDING COMPANY ACT. THE DEPOSITS MAINTAINED AT GS BANK USA ARE

REGULATION OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES

GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDES INVESTMENT SERVICES IN AND FROM THE

UNITED KINGDOM UNDER THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AUTHORITY (FSA). GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI), OUR

REGULATED U.K.

BROKER-DEALER,

IS SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE FSA. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007, GSI WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FSA CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS

INTERNATIONAL BANK, ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE FSA.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED TWO WHOLLY OWNED BANKS IN DUBLIN,

IRELAND. THESE BANKS ARE REGULATED BY THE IRISH FINANCIAL

SERVICES REGULATORY AUTHORITY. BECAUSE OUR IRISH BANKS HAVE NO

BRANCHES, AGENCIES OR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES IN THE UNITED STATES,

THEY DO NOT SUBJECT GOLDMAN SACHS TO THE U.S. BANK HOLDING

COMPANY ACT. AS OF THE COMMENCEMENT OF BUSINESS IN DECEMBER

2007, THESE BANKS WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS.

VARIOUS OTHER GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE

BANKING, INSURANCE AND SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (BAFIN) AND

THE BUNDESBANK IN GERMANY, BANQUE DE FRANCE AND THE

AUTORITÉ DES MARCHÉS FINANCIERS IN FRANCE, BANCA

DITALIA AND THE COMMISSIONE NAZIONALE PER LE SOCIETÀ

SERVICE IN RUSSIA AND THE SWISS FEDERAL BANKING COMMISSION.

CERTAIN GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE

EUROPEAN SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES EXCHANGES OF

WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS.

THE INVESTMENT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FSA

AND OTHER REGULATORS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE REGULATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH NATIONAL LAWS, MANY OF WHICH IMPLEMENT EUROPEAN

UNION DIRECTIVES REQUIRING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH

CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS, CUSTOMER PROTECTION

DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2004/39/EC, KNOWN AS MIFID) BECAME

EFFECTIVE IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY AND

FRANCE. MIFID AFFECTS SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY IMPOSING

DETAILED PAN-EUROPEAN REQUIREMENTS IN AREAS SUCH AS INTERNAL

ORGANIZATION (INCLUDING CONFLICT MANAGEMENT, OUTSOURCING AND

RECORDKEEPING), BEST EXECUTION, REAL-TIME DISCLOSURE OF

COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS IN SHARES, QUOTING OBLIGATIONS FOR

GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL), OUR REGULATED JAPANESE

BROKER-DEALER, IS SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF

JAPANS FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007,

GSJCL WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS.

GSJCL IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE, THE OSAKA

APPLICABLE IN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

THE U.S. AND

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES, REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS,

AS WELL AS STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND OTHER STATE

REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE

ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS, OR THE SUSPENSION OR

EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR

EMPLOYEES. FROM TIME TO TIME, OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT

TO INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN

IMPOSED FOR INFRACTIONS OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR

ACTIVITIES, NONE OF WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

US OR OUR BUSINESSES.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION HAS ISSUED THE

BASEL II CAPITAL STANDARDS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE

ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS BY ALIGNING REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS MORE CLOSELY WITH THE UNDERLYING RISKS FACED BY

THESE FIRMS. GSI, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE, BECAME SUBJECT TO THE

BASEL II REQUIREMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE

CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY RULES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

 REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH

PROVIDE FOR GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION, ARE CONSISTENT WITH BASEL

II. COMPLYING WITH THESE NEW STANDARDS HAS REQUIRED US TO

DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW AND SOPHISTICATED MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES

TO DETERMINE OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY. AS AN INCREASING

NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BECOME SUBJECT TO BASEL II, NEW

INTERPRETATIONS MAY ARISE, AND HARMONIZATION AMONG REGULATORS

COULD THEN IMPACT THE REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS UNDER WHICH

WE OPERATE AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY, AS WELL AS THE

REQUIREMENTS FOR SOME OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN THE

SUBJECT OF REGULATORY SCRUTINY. THE SEC, THE NYSE AND FINRA HAVE

ADOPTED RULES GOVERNING RESEARCH ANALYSTS, INCLUDING RULES

IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH

ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING PERSONNEL AT MEMBER SECURITIES

FIRMS. VARIOUS

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS

HAVE IMPOSED BOTH SUBSTANTIVE AND

DISCLOSURE-BASED

REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH AND MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL

REGULATIONS. IN 2003, GS&CO. AGREED TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT

WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO

EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT INCLUDES CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND

UNDERTAKINGS THAT HAVE IMPOSED ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIMITATIONS

ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERACTION BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BANKING AREAS.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESEARCH SETTLEMENT, WE HAVE ALSO

SUBSCRIBED TO A VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON

THE ALLOCATION OF SHARES IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS TO

EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE FSA IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM HAS IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF THE

ALLOCATION PROCESS IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES

OFFERINGS (INCLUDING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND SECONDARY

DISTRIBUTIONS). THE SEC, THE FSA, THE NYSE, FINRA AND OTHER

U.S. OR

NON-U.S. REGULATORS

MAY IN THE FUTURE ADOPT ADDITIONAL AND MORE STRINGENT RULES WITH

RESPECT TO OFFERING PROCEDURES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS

OF INTEREST, AND WE CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE EFFECT THAT ANY NEW

REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

REGULATION IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD RELATING

TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT ASSETS AND

OUR MANAGEMENT OF CLIENT FUNDS.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION MAY HOLD

CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY

REQUIREMENTS OR INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING

THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED

UPON ITS UNDERLYING RISK.

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH

REGULATIONS ENACTED BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS,

THE EUROPEAN UNION OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS

AND/OR

ENACTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS OR EXCHANGES

RELATING TO THE PRIVACY OF THE INFORMATION OF CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES

OR OTHERS, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS

COULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY

AND/OR

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME

OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS. WHILE WE HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE IN EACH OF OUR LAST FOUR FISCAL YEARS, REFLECTING A

FAVORABLE TRADING AND INVESTING ENVIRONMENT AND AN INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY, AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THESE MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, AND

THESE CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY. A

FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH,

STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND

EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE

OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED

BY: OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY;

DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR

BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR

INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN

INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT

RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR

OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL

MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE OR OTHER FACTORS, HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE

FUTURE ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY

WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES

AND/OR

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH CHANGES ARE RAPID,

MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES, AND MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT WE ISSUE OR HOLD. FOR EXAMPLE, BEGINNING IN THE

SECOND HALF OF 2007, DIFFICULTIES IN THE MORTGAGE AND BROADER

CREDIT MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE RESULTED IN A

RELATIVELY SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN FUNDING

COSTS. CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED SIGNIFICANTLY, AFFECTING

VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES AND

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS. THIS NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED PRICES OF THESE SECURITIES AND LOANS (AS WELL AS

COMMITMENTS FOR THESE LOANS), AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SOUGHT

TO DO SO, OUR ABILITY TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND LOANS (AND

LOAN COMMITMENTS). THE SUDDEN DECLINE IN LIQUIDITY AND PRICES OF

THESE TYPES OF SECURITIES AND LOANS MADE IT GENERALLY MORE

DIFFICULT TO VALUE THEM. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE PERSISTED THROUGH

THE END OF 2007 AND WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW LONG THESE CONDITIONS

WILL EXIST OR HOW OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE AFFECTED.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST

AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS, AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING

INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW

TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT

TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF MARKET TURBULENCE. CONVERSELY,

CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, SUCH AS OCCURRED IN

THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A

SECURED OR UNSECURED BASIS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE SEEK TO FINANCE OUR LESS

LIQUID ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT

MARKETS ARE LIKELY TO MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO FUND

THESE ASSETS. IN DIFFICULT CREDIT MARKETS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO

FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST OR WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

RAISE AS MUCH FUNDING AS WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES AND COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH

COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.



OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF

UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDUCE

EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR

UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS. OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED

CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR TRANSACTIONS. THE LACK OF

AVAILABLE CREDIT OR INCREASED COST OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER

AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE

TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.



WE RECEIVE ASSET-BASED MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS AND, IN SOME CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE

INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY

MARKETS OR INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE

OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE

FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS. INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR

ATTRACTIVE CONDITIONS IN OTHER INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE OUR

CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER

PRODUCTS. EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE

ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR

ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR

COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THROUGH REDEMPTIONS, AND IN THE INCENTIVE

AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE AND MIGHT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

TO ATTRACT NEW INVESTORS.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS



MARKET VOLATILITY HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS,

ALTHOUGH IT GENERALLY INCREASED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007. AN

INCREASE IN VOLATILITY INCREASES OUR MEASURED RISK, WHICH MIGHT

CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR TO REDUCE

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS OR OUR EXPOSURE IN A

TIMELY, COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OR IN A MANNER SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET

THE INCREASE IN MEASURED RISK.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND

AS A SPECIALIST OR MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE

THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES

TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN

A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS

AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON

MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES

AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.



THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH

EMERGENCY, OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN

EMERGENCY, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS IN

EMERGING MARKETS AND OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND COULD

LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS)

THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES AROUND

THE WORLD. IN ADDITION, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING HEALTH EMERGENCIES, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL

DISASTERS, COULD EXPOSE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND

STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK

AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND

LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW

PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY

A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK

MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT

ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES.

THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES

REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK

THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS, AND IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN

CIRCUMSTANCES PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME

CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY

MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. IN THE PAST, THESE TYPES OF MARKET

MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING

STRATEGIES AND HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND

THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN

BE EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR

TRADING MODELS WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR

TO OURS. IN THESE CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK

POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE INCREASINGLY INVESTING OUR OWN CAPITAL IN OUR

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS, AND

LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR

OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE

RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR LIQUIDITY,

PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS,

BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INABILITY OF THE

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM

OUR INVESTMENTS, OR

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY

ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL,

SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM

THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION

AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER

LIQUIDITY RISK. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE

CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AS

WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND

OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT

HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY

STRESS. GROWTH OF OUR PROPRIETARY INVESTING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD

TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT

LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS

MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL

SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A

LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS

OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN

DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND,

THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER

PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO

FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO.,

ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR

REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN

SACHS GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE

ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE

PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS.

OUR

BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS

BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS

OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN

INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH AND

SIZE OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. WE ARE

EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST

THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY

SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS.

DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO

THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF MARKET

STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR

CLIENT POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY

REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES

AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE

BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR

A DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT

LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

CONCENTRATION

OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING,

BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING AND LENDING

BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL

TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF

SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

GIVEN PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE, WE REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE

TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING LARGE

BLOCKS OF SECURITIES SOLD IN BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A

MARKETED BASIS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE

MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND

LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING

OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

POSITIONS, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH

SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND

COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS,

INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, RESULTING IN

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER.

THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE

WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING PRICES. OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, WHICH

SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS

AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK, HAS ACCELERATED THIS

CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASED COMPETITION. THIS TREND

TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS

TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. AS WE EXPAND INTO NEW

BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE

COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO EXPAND.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, HAVE

CONTINUED TO INCREASE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TREND IN THE

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND

CO-MANAGERS HANDLING TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD

HAVE BEEN A SINGLE BOOK RUNNER, HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR

BUSINESS AND REDUCED OUR REVENUES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS

SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

FINALLY, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND OTHER INDUSTRY FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE INCREASING USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING, HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE A

REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE

ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET

CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT BASE AND EXPOSE US TO NEW

ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RECENT YEARS WE

HAVE BEGUN PROVIDING LOANS TO SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES,

ORIGINATING AND ACQUIRING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AND

ORIGINATING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, AND WE ARE INCREASINGLY

TRANSACTING BUSINESS AND INVESTING IN NEW REGIONS, INCLUDING A

WIDER RANGE OF EMERGING MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE

INCREASINGLY OFFERING COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

SECURITIZED DERIVATIVES, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS TO A WIDER

INVESTOR BASE, INCLUDING RETAIL INVESTORS, BOTH DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. FURTHERMORE, A NUMBER

OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR PROPRIETARY INVESTING AND

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, CAUSE US TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

OWN INTERESTS IN, OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE

OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF, PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS,

TOLL ROADS, SHIPPING PORTS, ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES

AND OTHER COMMODITIES INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS, BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY

TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE DISTRESSED

ASSETS, AND WE MAY DETERMINE OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO INCREASE OUR

EXPOSURE TO THESE TYPES OF ASSETS. THESE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL

CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED

COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED CREDIT-RELATED AND OPERATIONAL

RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND

REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE

BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO THE

COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO NOT

HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION AND MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION THROUGH THE

PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE

SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION WITHIN THE REQUIRED

CONTRACTUAL TIME FRAME FOR DELIVERY, PARTICULARLY IF DEFAULT

RATES INCREASE FROM THE HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE

TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH

THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED

COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH

THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES ON

A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, WE

ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE

EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE THE

CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE

PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING

CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE

UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY

TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND

SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS.

A FAILURE IN

OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES,

RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR

SYSTEMS COULD LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL

LOSS, DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS,

REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. OUR BUSINESSES

ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A

DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO

CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY

STANDARDS. AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH

EXPANDS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND

INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL,

ACCOUNTING,

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY

FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF

EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS

A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY

TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. THE

INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES,

CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO

FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR

INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE WILL INCREASINGLY

FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR

CLIENTS SYSTEMS. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN

SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND

CLEARING HOUSES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL

FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE

EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT. ANY SUCH

FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS AND MANAGE

OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK.

DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION

OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR, FOR

EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY THE BUILDINGS OF

GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS

WITH A BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES

WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES

IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN

AREA, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG, TOKYO AND BANGALORE, WORK IN

CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY,

GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR

EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, DEPENDING ON

THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT

IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES COULD VERY

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE

LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY

OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS,

OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER,

AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY

PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE

AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR

MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED

THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE

INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE

VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED

AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO

DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE,

AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL

OF OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. AN INTERCEPTION OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT OR COUNTERPARTY COULD

RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL

HARM. WE ARE EXPOSED TO SIMILAR RISKS ARISING FROM THE

INTERCEPTION OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY

INFORMATION SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM, OR THE MISUSE OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BY, VENDORS, SERVICE

PROVIDERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY RECEIVE SUCH

INFORMATION FROM US, AND OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD

PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY

AND DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS. AS WE HAVE

EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT BASE, WE

INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,

INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT

OR OUR OWN PROPRIETARY INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT,

OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER

CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT

MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM.

THE SEC, THE NYSE, FINRA, OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS AND

REGULATORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM AND JAPAN, HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO INCREASE

THEIR SCRUTINY OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING

THROUGH DETAILED EXAMINATIONS OF SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS. THERE

HAVE BEEN COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS, ALLEGING THE VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST

LAWS ARISING FROM THEIR JOINT PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN LEVERAGED

BUYOUTS, REFERRED TO AS CLUB DEALS, AS DISCUSSED

UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  PRIVATE

EQUITY-SPONSORED ACQUISITIONS LITIGATION IN PART I,

ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS HAVE ALSO BEEN

FILED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SPECIFIC CLUB DEAL

TRANSACTIONS WHICH NAME THE RELEVANT CLUB DEAL

PARTICIPANTS AMONG THE DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS

AFFILIATES IN SEVERAL CASES, AND GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE

TRANSACTIONS CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BY THE TARGET

COMPANY AND THAT THE CLUB PARTICIPANTS AIDED AND

ABETTED SUCH BREACH. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE

LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY, AND WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO

FURTHER LITIGATION OR REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN THE FUTURE IN THIS

REGARD.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE

DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR

REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO

ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MIGHT ARISE MAY

BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY AND DEAL

APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL

OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES

AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE

REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS

AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION

BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED,

PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR

SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING

LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR

CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. REGULATORY

CHANGES COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, COULD REQUIRE US TO

CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD EXPOSE US TO

ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL HARM.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AT A

NUMBER OF LEVELS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I,

ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL STANDARDS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. A NUMBER OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO., GSEC, GSI, GS BANK USA, OUR

IRISH BANKING ENTITIES, GSJCL AND GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

OHG, ARE SEPARATELY SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN MINIMUM CAPITAL

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES. COMPLYING

WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE US TO LIMIT OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR REQUIRE US TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE RAISE

CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND

CREDITORS. WHILE WE CURRENTLY DISCLOSE THESE RATIOS TO THE SEC

AND THE FSA AND TO RATING AGENCIES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED OR MAY

DETERMINE TO DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OUR GROUP-WIDE CONSOLIDATED

SUPERVISED ENTITY CAPITAL RATIOS BEGINNING IN MID-2008. IT IS

UNCLEAR HOW OUR RATIOS WILL COMPARE TO THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS,

OR HOW OUR INVESTORS, COUNTERPARTIES OR CLIENTS MAY REACT TO ANY

DIFFERENCE, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN SUCH RATIOS.

FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN

A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED

INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY

IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, CONTINUE

TO SCRUTINIZE COMPLEX, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE

BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS. WE SEEK TO

CREATE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS NEEDS,

AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO, AND CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO, STRUCTURED

TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS.

THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS LED SOME OF OUR CLIENTS TO BE LESS WILLING

TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY CARRY A RISK OF INCREASED

SCRUTINY BY REGULATORS AND HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT

TO A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN ENTERED

INTO BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR FIRM, AND THAT

WERE GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE PERMISSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. THIS

ENVIRONMENT ALSO HAS LED US AND OUR COMPETITORS TO MODIFY

TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND, IN SOME CASES, TO LIMIT OR CEASE OUR

EXECUTION OF SOME TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE

TRANSACTIONS WE ENTER INTO ARE APPROPRIATELY REVIEWED AND COMPLY

WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR THAT THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND

LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH, TRANSACTIONS WILL MAKE OUR

CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS WITH US,

AND WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

SUBSTANTIAL

LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN

SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE

SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN

COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

PART I, ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR

PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO

PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL

CASES.

THE GROWTH OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE

COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE

INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING

SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. AS

OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE DIRECTLY IN

THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR USE

OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

NYSES ADOPTION AND CONTINUED REFINEMENT OF ITS HYBRID

MARKET FOR TRADING SECURITIES MAY INCREASE PRESSURE ON OUR

EQUITIES BUSINESS AS CUSTOMERS EXECUTE MORE OF THEIR

NYSE-RELATED TRADES ELECTRONICALLY. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT

RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND

EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY

LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM

BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, SUCH AS

HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, FOR

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN

EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION. OUR

PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF

HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW

BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS (INCLUDING LAWS

RELATING TO IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING) MAY RESTRICT OUR

ABILITY TO MOVE RESPONSIBILITIES OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE

JURISDICTION TO ANOTHER. THIS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES.

OUR POWER

GENERATION INTERESTS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES.

THE POWER GENERATION FACILITIES THAT WE OWN AND THOSE THAT WE

OPERATE, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER POWER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, ARE

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE

MANAGEMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND

SAFETY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INTENSIFIED SCRUTINY OF THE

ENERGY MARKET BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE

PUBLIC HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING COMPANIES ENGAGED IN ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND

NATURAL GAS.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POWER

GENERATION, INCLUDING HAVING TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION

CONTROL EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER

TAXES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES

AT OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES,

COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US

TO CEASE OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES.

OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF

UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE

MAY NOT HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST THESE RISKS OR OTHER RISKS,

INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, THAT SUCH FACILITIES FACE, AND,

IN CASES IN WHICH WE DO HAVE INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS

MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES. OUR OVERALL BUSINESSES

AND REPUTATION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS, ARISING OUT OF OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS, AS WELL

AS BY THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR

NEGATIVE PUBLICITY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR POWER-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

THE OPERATION OF OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY BE

DISRUPTED FOR MANY REASONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OUR

CONTROL, INCLUDING THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION

EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES,

AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OR EFFICIENCY. IN ADDITION, THESE FACILITIES COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE OF ANY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR

SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR

OPERATION AT REASONABLE PRICES. MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER

FACTORS COULD CAUSE A FAILURE TO SATISFY OR OBTAIN WAIVERS UNDER

AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING LENDERS AND UTILITIES,

WHICH IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT

OWN SUCH FACILITIES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY

PREVENT THE AFFECTED FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER APPLICABLE

POWER SALES AGREEMENTS, MAY IMPAIR THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

IN CONDUCTING

OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT

IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN MANY

COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES

AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS

IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY

BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL

LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT

WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL

LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE

WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN

THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE

MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO

NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS,

AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET

COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR

NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS

OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS

GENERALLY.

BEING HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH OR TO REPLACE CURRENTLY OCCUPIED

SPACE THAT WE MAY EXIT IN THE FUTURE. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE OUR

CURRENT AND FUTURE SPACE CAPACITY IN RELATION TO CURRENT AND

PROJECTED STAFFING LEVELS. IN 2007, WE INCURRED EXIT COSTS OF

WE (I) REDUCE OUR SPACE CAPACITY OR (II) COMMIT TO, OR

OCCUPY, NEW PROPERTIES IN THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND,

CONSEQUENTLY, DISPOSE OF EXISTING SPACE THAT HAD BEEN HELD FOR

POTENTIAL GROWTH. THESE EXIT COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND

ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW)

CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXECUTIVE

OVERVIEW

OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $24.73 FOR 2007

COMPARED WITH $19.69 FOR 2006. DURING 2007, WE ACHIEVED RECORD

RESULTS IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA, AND DERIVED OVER

ONE-HALF OF OUR PRE-TAX EARNINGS OUTSIDE OF THE AMERICAS. RETURN

ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY

(1)

WAS 38.2% AND RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

WAS 32.7% FOR 2007. BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE INCREASED 25% TO

$90.43 AT YEAR END. DURING 2007, WE REPURCHASED

41.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL COST OF

$8.96 BILLION.

IN 2007, WE GENERATED RECORD DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE,

WHICH EXCEEDED THE PRIOR YEAR RECORD RESULTS BY 26%. EACH OF OUR

THREE SEGMENTS PRODUCED RECORD NET REVENUES. THE INCREASE IN

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED HIGHER NET REVENUES

IN EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC) AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES INCREASED 33%

COMPARED WITH 2006, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES

IN BOTH OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESSES AND PRINCIPAL

STRATEGIES. DURING 2007, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY

HIGHER EQUITY PRICES AND HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY,

PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THE INCREASE IN

FICC REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES

AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN

MORTGAGES WERE HIGHER DESPITE A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE

MORTGAGE MARKET THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WHILE NET REVENUES IN

CREDIT PRODUCTS WERE STRONG, BUT SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH

2006. CREDIT PRODUCTS INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL GAINS FROM EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION

RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF HORIZON WIND ENERGY L.L.C., AS

WELL AS A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, NET OF HEDGES,

RELATED TO NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

DURING 2007, FICC OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, DURING THE YEAR, THE MORTGAGE

MARKET EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION AND, IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR, THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS WERE CHARACTERIZED

BY WIDER SPREADS AND REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY. WE CONTINUED

TO CAPITALIZE ON TRADING AND INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR

CLIENTS AND OURSELVES AND, ACCORDINGLY, OUR MARKET RISK

INCREASED, PARTICULARLY IN INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, OUR TOTAL ASSETS SURPASSED $1 TRILLION DURING THE

YEAR, AS WE GREW OUR BALANCE SHEET IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THESE

OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT INCREASED ACTIVITY IN

SECURITIES SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

REFLECTED STRONG RESULTS IN BOTH CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE

INVESTING.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING REFLECTED A 64% INCREASE IN

FINANCIAL ADVISORY NET REVENUES AND A STRONG PERFORMANCE IN OUR

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY

PRIMARILY REFLECTED GROWTH IN INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS

AND ACQUISITIONS. THE INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING REFLECTED HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, AS LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY

WAS STRONG DURING THE FIRST HALF OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WHILE NET

REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE STRONG BUT ESSENTIALLY

UNCHANGED FROM 2006. OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG

AT THE END OF 2007 WAS HIGHER THAN IT WAS AT THE END OF

2006.

(2)

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES ALSO

INCREASED. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES SERVICES PRIMARILY

REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN GLOBAL CUSTOMER BALANCES. THE

INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

INCENTIVE FEES. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

INCREASED $192 BILLION, OR 28%, TO A RECORD

$868 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $161 BILLION.

RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

(ROTE) IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS BY AVERAGE MONTHLY TANGIBLE COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. SEE  RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW BELOW FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CALCULATION OF ROTE.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG REPRESENTS AN

ESTIMATE OF OUR FUTURE NET REVENUES FROM INVESTMENT BANKING

TRANSACTIONS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE REVENUE REALIZATION IS

MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2008, WE WILL REMAIN FOCUSED ON OUR CLIENTS, GEOGRAPHIC

EXPANSION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT. WE

CONTINUE TO SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH IN THE BUSINESSES AND

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, IN PARTICULAR, WE

BELIEVE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE ECONOMIES OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA,

INDIA AND CHINA, AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE MIDDLE EAST, WILL OFFER

OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN THOSE MARKETS.

THOUGH WE GENERATED PARTICULARLY STRONG RESULTS IN 2007, OUR

BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN

THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH IN

THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. A FAVORABLE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT

CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR

CONFIDENCE AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. THESE FACTORS PROVIDE A

POSITIVE CLIMATE FOR OUR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES, FOR MANY

OF OUR TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES AND FOR WEALTH CREATION,

WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO GROWTH IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS.

DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2007, GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS

GENERALLY SOLID, INFLATION REMAINED CONTAINED, GLOBAL EQUITY

MARKETS ROSE AND CORPORATE ACTIVITY LEVELS WERE STRONG. HOWEVER,

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS AND

VOLATILITY IN GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S.

AND EUROPE, SPREAD TO BROADER FINANCIAL MARKETS AND BEGAN TO

AFFECT GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW

MARKET CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2007 IS SET

FORTH BELOW.

GLOBAL.

GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SLOWED OVER THE

COURSE OF 2007. ALTHOUGH THE PACE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS SOLID

THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER, GLOBAL GROWTH

IN THE LATTER PART OF OUR FISCAL YEAR WAS IMPACTED BY VOLATILITY

IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE, AND

ACCELERATED WEAKNESS IN THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET. FIXED INCOME

AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED HIGH VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THE U.S. MORTGAGE MARKET

EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,

PARTICULARLY IN SUBPRIME LOANS AND SECURITIES. THE BROADER

GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS

IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHICH WAS EVIDENT IN THE

SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATION IN MONEY MARKET RATES IN THE U.S. AND

EUROPE. THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE LOWERED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS

TARGET RATE TOWARDS THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WHILE CENTRAL

BANKS IN THE EUROZONE, UNITED KINGDOM, JAPAN AND CHINA ALL

RAISED RATES DURING THE YEAR. OIL PRICES ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY

DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR AND, IN THE CURRENCY MARKETS, THE U.S.

DOLLAR WEAKENED AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY

AGAINST THE EURO AND THE BRITISH POUND. CORPORATE ACTIVITY WAS

GENERALLY STRONG DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT

GROWTH IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND EQUITY UNDERWRITINGS, AS

WELL AS STRENGTH IN LEVERAGED FINANCE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF

OUR FISCAL YEAR.

UNITED STATES.

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH IN

THE U.S. ECONOMY SLOWED TO AN ESTIMATED 2.2% IN CALENDAR YEAR

2007, DOWN FROM 2.9% IN 2006. WHILE ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS

GENERALLY SOLID DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR,

ACTIVITY APPEARED TO DECELERATE SHARPLY DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER. MUCH OF THE SLOWDOWN WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HOUSING

MARKET, AS SALES OF NEW AND EXISTING HOMES AND RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENT DECLINED, AS WELL AS TO THE WEAKNESS IN CREDIT

MARKETS. GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION SLOWED FROM 2006

LEVELS, REFLECTING REDUCED GROWTH IN DOMESTIC DEMAND, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY STRONGER GROWTH IN NET EXPORTS. ALTHOUGH BUSINESS

CONFIDENCE REMAINED FAIRLY STRONG, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DECLINED

OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. GROWTH IN CONSUMER EXPENDITURE WAS

STRONG IN THE FIRST QUARTER BUT DECLINED THEREAFTER, AS CONCERNS

ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET INTENSIFIED AND OIL PRICES ROSE. THE

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ROSE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL YEAR

AND ENDED THE YEAR HIGHER. THE RATE OF INFLATION INCREASED

SHARPLY OVER OUR FISCAL YEAR, AS ENERGY PRICES ROSE

SIGNIFICANTLY. MEASURES OF CORE INFLATION, WHILE SLOWING FROM

2006 LEVELS, ACCELERATED TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR. THE U.S.

FEDERAL RESERVE REDUCED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS TARGET RATE BY A TOTAL

OF 75 BASIS POINTS TO 4.50% DURING OUR FOURTH QUARTER, THE

FIRST REDUCTIONS SINCE 2003. BEGINNING IN AUGUST, THE U.S.

FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO TOOK OTHER MEASURES TO IMPROVE LIQUIDITY IN

CREDIT MARKETS. ALTHOUGH THE

10-YEAR

U.S.

TREASURY NOTE YIELD ROSE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF OUR FISCAL

YEAR, IT SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED AS CREDIT CONCERNS TOOK HOLD, AND

ENDED THE YEAR 58 BASIS POINTS LOWER AT 3.97%. THE DOW JONES

INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE, THE S&P 500 INDEX AND THE NASDAQ

COMPOSITE INDEX ENDED OUR FISCAL YEAR HIGHER BY 9%, 6% AND 8%,

RESPECTIVELY.

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EUROPE.

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH IN THE

EUROZONE ECONOMIES SLOWED TO AN ESTIMATED 2.7% IN CALENDAR YEAR

2007, DOWN FROM 2.9% IN 2006. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND FIXED

INVESTMENT SLOWED AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED, WHILE GROWTH IN

CONSUMER EXPENDITURE WAS WEAK THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SURVEYS OF

BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DECLINED. HOWEVER, THE LABOR

MARKET STRENGTHENED, AS EVIDENCED BY A DECLINE IN THE

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. MEASURES OF CORE INFLATION INCREASED DURING

THE YEAR. THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) CONTINUED TO RAISE

INTEREST RATES, INCREASING ITS MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS RATE

BY A TOTAL OF 75 BASIS POINTS TO 4.00% BY THE END OF JUNE. THE

ECB LEFT THE RATE UNCHANGED FOR THE REST OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, BUT

ENGAGED IN MEASURES TO IMPROVE LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS IN THE LAST

FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, REAL GROSS

DOMESTIC PRODUCT ROSE BY AN ESTIMATED 3.1% FOR CALENDAR YEAR

2007, UP FROM 2.9% IN 2006, BUT SHOWED SIGNS OF SLOWING LATE IN

THE YEAR DUE TO CREDIT MARKET CONCERNS AND A SLOWDOWN IN THE

U.K. HOUSING MARKET. MEASURES OF INFLATION REMAINED ELEVATED

DURING THE YEAR. THE BANK OF ENGLAND INCREASED INTEREST RATES,

RAISING ITS OFFICIAL BANK RATE BY A TOTAL OF 75 BASIS POINTS TO

5.75%. LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS IN BOTH THE EUROZONE AND THE U.K.

ENDED THE YEAR HIGHER. THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND APPRECIATED BY

11% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING OUR

FISCAL YEAR. MAJOR EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS ENDED OUR FISCAL YEAR

HIGHER.

ASIA.

IN JAPAN, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH

SLOWED TO AN ESTIMATED 1.9% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2007 FROM 2.4% IN

2006. MEASURES OF INVESTMENT ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSING SECTOR AND

GROWTH IN CONSUMPTION DECLINED DURING THE YEAR. EXPORT GROWTH

REMAINED SOLID BUT SHOWED SIGNS OF DETERIORATION TOWARDS YEAR

END AS THE ENVIRONMENT OUTSIDE OF JAPAN WORSENED. THE RATE OF

INFLATION REMAINED NEAR ZERO PERCENT DURING THE YEAR. THE BANK

OF JAPAN RAISED ITS TARGET OVERNIGHT CALL RATE BY 25 BASIS

POINTS FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR, BRINGING IT TO 0.50%,

WHILE THE YIELD ON

10-YEAR

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS DECLINED SLIGHTLY DURING OUR FISCAL

YEAR. THE YEN APPRECIATED BY 4% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE

NIKKEI 225 INDEX ROSE DURING THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF OUR

FISCAL YEAR BUT DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN AUGUST, AND ENDED OUR

FISCAL YEAR ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.

IN CHINA, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH ACCELERATED TO AN

ESTIMATED 11.4% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2007 FROM 11.1% IN 2006, WITH

CONTINUED STRENGTH IN EXPORTS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY CHINAS

LARGE AND GROWING CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RESERVES. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ACCELERATED DURING THE YEAR,

WHILE DOMESTIC DEMAND SOFTENED BUT REMAINED SOLID. THE RATE OF

INFLATION INCREASED, PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR. THE PEOPLES BANK OF CHINA RAISED ITS ONE-YEAR

BENCHMARK LENDING RATE BY A TOTAL OF 117 BASIS POINTS TO 7.29%

AND TOOK ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO REDUCE LIQUIDITY IN THE

FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO ALLOW THE STEADY

APPRECIATION OF ITS CURRENCY, WHICH ENDED OUR FISCAL YEAR NEARLY

6% HIGHER AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. ELSEWHERE IN ASIA, REAL GROSS

DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH IN INDIA SLOWED TO AN ESTIMATED 8.7% IN

CALENDAR YEAR 2007 FROM 9.4% IN 2006, AS ITS CURRENCY

STRENGTHENED AND THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED MONETARY POLICY. THE

RATE OF WHOLESALE INFLATION FELL, BUT THE RATE OF CONSUMER PRICE

INFLATION REMAINED ELEVATED. OTHER CURRENCIES IN THE REGION ALSO

GENERALLY APPRECIATED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. EQUITY MARKETS

ROSE SHARPLY ACROSS THE REGION, WITH THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE

INDEX UP 138%, AND MARKETS IN HONG KONG, INDIA AND SOUTH KOREA

ENDING THE YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.

OTHER MARKETS.

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN BRAZIL

ROSE BY AN ESTIMATED 5.4% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2007, SUPPORTED BY

STRONG CAPITAL INFLOWS, STRONG DEMAND AND RISING PRICES IN

COMMODITIES, AND EXPANSIONARY FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES. THE

CENTRAL BANK REDUCED INTEREST RATES EVEN AS THE RATE OF

INFLATION ROSE. IN RUSSIA, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ROSE BY

AN ESTIMATED 7.3% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2007, SUPPORTED BY STRONG

HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AND INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENT,

PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE RATE OF

INFLATION ROSE SHARPLY IN THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR. BRAZILIAN

AND RUSSIAN EQUITY PRICES ENDED OUR FISCAL YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER.

CERTAIN RISK

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW

MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE RISKS, SEE

 RISK MANAGEMENT BELOW. A SUMMARY OF THE

MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS FOLLOWS

BELOW. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT

FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, SEE RISK

FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE ANNUAL REPORT

ON

FORM 10-K.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MARKET RISK.

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, AND THESE

CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY. A FAVORABLE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT

CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR

CONFIDENCE, AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR

UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED

BY: OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY;

DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR

BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR

INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN

INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT

RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR

OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL

MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE OR OTHER FACTORS

,

HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY

IN THE FUTURE ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY

IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR WIDENING CREDIT

SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH CHANGES ARE RAPID, MAY CREATE A LESS

FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY

AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE ISSUE OR

HOLD. FOR EXAMPLE, BEGINNING IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007,

DIFFICULTIES IN THE MORTGAGE AND BROADER CREDIT MARKETS RESULTED

IN A RELATIVELY SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED SIGNIFICANTLY,

AFFECTING VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT AND EQUITY

MARKETS.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST

AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS OR MAY REDUCE OUR

WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW TRANSACTIONS. CONVERSELY, CERTAIN

OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE

TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY

MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS

OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, CAN AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED OR UNSECURED BASIS, WHICH MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE

SEEK TO FINANCE OUR LESS LIQUID ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS AND

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS ARE LIKELY TO MAKE IT HARDER

AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO FUND THESE ASSETS. IN DIFFICULT CREDIT

MARKETS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER

COST OR WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE AS MUCH FUNDING AS WE NEED TO

SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO CURTAIL

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING,

BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS

AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES

CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND

UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR TRANSACTIONS. THE LACK

OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR INCREASED COST OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER

AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE

TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS OR INCREASES IN

INTEREST RATES TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR

MANAGING ASSETS.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES OR ATTRACTIVE CONDITIONS IN OTHER

INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT

OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS. EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN

OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE

PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A

DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND IN THE INCENTIVE AND

MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE AND MIGHT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

ATTRACT NEW INVESTORS.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING,

BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING AND LENDING

BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL

TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS.



AN INCREASE IN MARKET VOLATILITY INCREASES OUR MEASURED RISK,

WHICH MIGHT CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR TO

REDUCE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN SUCH

CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS OR OUR

EXPOSURE IN A TIMELY, COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OR IN A MANNER

SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE INCREASE IN MEASURED RISK.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND

AS A SPECIALIST OR MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE

THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES

TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN

A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS

AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON

MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES

AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

LIQUIDITY RISK.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR

BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS

OR REDEEM OUR INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR

COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION

OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR

EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE ARE

EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO

BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED

PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS

IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. GROWTH OF OUR PROPRIETARY

INVESTING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS

FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR

POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED

IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS

AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER

MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE

INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS,

WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GOLDMAN SACHS OF A

REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE  LIQUIDITY

AND FUNDING RISK  CREDIT RATINGS BELOW.

CREDIT RISK.

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR

CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH AND SIZE OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE

HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD

PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT

PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE

RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR

OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY

PURPOSES. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FOR COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS.

IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR

CLIENT POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY

REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES

AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE

BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE,

PARTICULARLY AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET

CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A

DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY

PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN

TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO

EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY

COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR

INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS, OR EXTERNAL EVENTS COULD

LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL LOSS, DISRUPTION

OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY INTERVENTION

OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE

NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS

NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE

TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE

PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC

GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. DESPITE

THE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR

ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION

OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE

CONDUCT BUSINESS.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND, AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY

(CSE), WE ARE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS. SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A SIGNIFICANT

REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US,

WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS. FIRMS

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A

DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF

DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY

EXPOSURES, SEE  USE OF ESTIMATES BELOW.

FAIR

VALUE

THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WITH

RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND IS

OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO

SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE

(THE EXIT PRICE). INSTRUMENTS THAT WE OWN (LONG POSITIONS) ARE

MARKED TO BID PRICES, AND INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HAVE SOLD, BUT NOT

YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES.

CASH INSTRUMENTS.

CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CASH

TRADING INSTRUMENTS, PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND PRIVATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.



CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS.

OUR CASH TRADING

INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDE MOST U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY

SECURITIES, MANY OTHER SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVE

LISTED EQUITIES AND MOST MONEY MARKET SECURITIES.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR

ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY INCLUDE MOST INVESTMENT-GRADE AND HIGH-YIELD

CORPORATE BONDS, MOST MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, CERTAIN CORPORATE BANK

AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL

AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS, MOST PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND

CERTAIN LOAN COMMITMENTS.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND

THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUND INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN

CORPORATE BANK AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS LIQUID MORTGAGE WHOLE

LOANS, DISTRESSED DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN LOAN COMMITMENTS.

THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF

FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE

SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL

VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION PRICE. THIS VALUATION

IS ADJUSTED ONLY WHEN CHANGES TO INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED OR PENDING THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS IN

THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OR COMPARABLE ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT

ROUNDS OF FINANCING, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

ACROSS THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN THE EQUITY OR DEBT

CAPITAL MARKETS, AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS OR ARE

SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT ILLIQUIDITY AND/OR NON-TRANSFERABILITY, AND SUCH

ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET EVIDENCE. IN

THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE IS

USED.



PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OUR PUBLIC PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS HELD WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT OF

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT TEND TO BE LARGE,

CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS RESULTING FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR

OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, AND ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES. FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT TRADED IN ACTIVE

MARKETS OR ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, VALUATIONS ARE

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ILLIQUIDITY

AND/OR

NON-TRANSFERABILITY, AND SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

AVAILABLE MARKET EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE,

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT IS OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC. OUR INVESTMENT IN

ICBC IS VALUED USING THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ADJUSTED FOR

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. THE ORDINARY SHARES ACQUIRED FROM ICBC

ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

PROHIBIT ANY SALE, DISPOSITION OR OTHER TRANSFER UNTIL

APRIL 28, 2009. FROM APRIL 28, 2009 TO

OCTOBER 20, 2009, WE MAY TRANSFER UP TO 50% OF THE

AGGREGATE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC THAT WE OWNED AS OF

OCTOBER 20, 2006. WE MAY TRANSFER THE REMAINING SHARES

AFTER OCTOBER 20, 2009. A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST IS HELD

BY INVESTMENT FUNDS MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS.

WE ALSO HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SMFG. THIS INVESTMENT IS VALUED USING A MODEL THAT IS

PRINCIPALLY BASED ON SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007, THE CONVERSION PRICE OF OUR SMFG CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK INTO SHARES OF SMFG COMMON STOCK WAS

¥318,800. THIS PRICE IS SUBJECT TO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IF

THE PRICE OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF CONVERSION IS LESS

THAN THE CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT TO A FLOOR OF ¥105,100).

AS A RESULT OF DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STOCK

PRICE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT AND CHANGES IN SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE WOULD

BE NONLINEAR FOR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK

PRICE. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, WE HAD HEDGED APPROXIMATELY 90% OF

THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT IN SMFG AND THERE

WERE NO RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE THE REMAINDER.



PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OUR PRIVATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS HELD WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT OF

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT INCLUDE

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY, DEBT AND REAL ESTATE, PRIMARILY

HELD THROUGH INVESTMENT FUNDS. BY THEIR NATURE, THESE

INVESTMENTS HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. WE VALUE SUCH

INSTRUMENTS INITIALLY AT TRANSACTION PRICE AND ADJUST VALUATIONS

WHEN EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. SUCH

EVIDENCE INCLUDES TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED

OR PENDING THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT

OR COMPARABLE ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING,

RECAPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CAN BE

EXCHANGE-TRADED OR OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC). WE GENERALLY VALUE

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES WITHIN PORTFOLIOS USING MODELS WHICH

CALIBRATE TO MARKET CLEARING LEVELS AND ELIMINATE TIMING

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES AND THEIR UNDERLYING CASH INSTRUMENTS.

OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

MARKET EVIDENCE WHENEVER POSSIBLE, INCLUDING MARKET-BASED INPUTS

TO MODELS, MODEL CALIBRATION TO MARKET CLEARING TRANSACTIONS,

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH

REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. WHERE MODELS ARE USED,

THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE

DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF, AND SPECIFIC RISKS

INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF

PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. WE GENERALLY USE SIMILAR

MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE A

VARIETY OF INPUTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES,

YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT

RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT

TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND

OPTIONS, MODEL INPUTS CAN GENERALLY BE VERIFIED AND MODEL

SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WITH

LIMITED PRICING INFORMATION, AND THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

FOR THESE DERIVATIVES IS INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT. WHERE WE DO

NOT HAVE CORROBORATING MARKET EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT

MODEL INPUTS AND CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH

AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT

INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION PRICE. SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL

RECOGNITION, WE ONLY UPDATE VALUATION INPUTS WHEN CORROBORATED

BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRICING SERVICES AND/OR BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR OTHER

EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY

THE MODEL VALUE TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A

DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SEE  CREDIT

RISK  DERIVATIVES BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ON OUR OTC DERIVATIVES.

WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED FOR VARIOUS FACTORS

SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET

EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  LEVEL 3

ASSETS.

SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES

USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE OBJECTIVE OF A FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT IS TO DETERMINE THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO

SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE

(AN EXIT PRICE). THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS

OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST

PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS).

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON

THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT. SEE NOTES 2 AND 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 159.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

A CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE,

INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, IS

FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

APPROPRIATELY VALUED AND THAT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE

RELIABLE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHERE PRICES OR

VALUATIONS THAT REQUIRE INPUTS ARE LESS OBSERVABLE.

WE EMPLOY AN OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES APPROPRIATE

SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INDEPENDENT OF THE

TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

OVERSIGHT OF CONTROL AND VALUATION POLICIES AND FOR REPORTING

THE RESULTS OF THESE POLICIES TO OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE SEEK TO

MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL

FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS. WE EMPLOY

PROCEDURES FOR THE APPROVAL OF NEW TRANSACTION TYPES AND

MARKETS, PRICE VERIFICATION, REVIEW OF DAILY PROFIT AND LOSS,

AND REVIEW OF VALUATION MODELS BY PERSONNEL WITH APPROPRIATE

TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE OF RELEVANT PRODUCTS AND MARKETS. THESE

PROCEDURES ARE PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING

AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS. FOR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

WHERE PRICES OR VALUATIONS THAT REQUIRE INPUTS ARE LESS

OBSERVABLE, WE EMPLOY, WHERE POSSIBLE, PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE

COMPARISONS WITH SIMILAR OBSERVABLE POSITIONS, ANALYSIS OF

ACTUAL TO PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, COMPARISONS WITH SUBSEQUENT

SALES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR BUSINESS LEADERS. SEE

 MARKET RISK BELOW FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE THE RISKS INHERENT IN OUR TRADING

GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRINCIPALLY SLK LLC (SLK) IN

2000, THE AYCO COMPANY, L.P. (AYCO) IN 2003 AND OUR VARIABLE

ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN 2006, WE HAVE ACQUIRED

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL IS THE

COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET

ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL.

WE TEST THE GOODWILL IN EACH OF OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE COMPONENTS ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR

THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. WE

DERIVE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS

PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE-EARNINGS AND PRICE-BOOK MULTIPLES. WE

DERIVE THE NET BOOK VALUE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS BY

ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO

SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT. OUR LAST

ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS PERFORMED DURING OUR 2007 FOURTH

QUARTER AND NO IMPAIRMENT WAS IDENTIFIED.

WE AMORTIZE OUR

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, AND TEST FOR

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING

VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED

IF THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO

THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING

A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE

TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE

EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE

VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND/OR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT

OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING

(I) CHANGES IN MARKET STRUCTURE THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES (SEE DISCUSSION BELOW), (II) AN

ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR, OR

(III) ADVERSE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ON THE CONTRACTS IN OUR

VARIABLE ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING

WEAK OPERATING RESULTS IN OUR NYSE SPECIALIST BUSINESS, WE

TESTED OUR NYSE SPECIALIST RIGHTS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT

OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. UNDER

SFAS NO. 144, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NYSE SPECIALIST RIGHTS EXCEEDS THE

PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE BUSINESS OVER THE

ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF OUR NYSE SPECIALIST RIGHTS.

PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF OUR NYSE SPECIALIST RIGHTS, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE DID NOT

RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS.

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE EXPECT THAT THE NYSE WILL ENACT NUMEROUS RULE CHANGES IN 2008

THAT WILL FURTHER ALIGN ITS MODEL WITH INVESTOR REQUIREMENTS FOR

SPEED AND EFFICIENCY OF EXECUTION AND WILL ESTABLISH SPECIALISTS

AS DESIGNATED MARKET MAKERS (DMMS). AS DMMS, SPECIALISTS WILL

RETAIN THEIR OBLIGATION TO COMMIT CAPITAL BUT FOR THE FIRST

TIME, SPECIALISTS WILL BE ABLE TO TRADE ON PARITY WITH OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS. IN ADDITION, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE NYSE

PLANS TO INTRODUCE A RESERVE ORDER SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW FOR

ANONYMOUS TRADE EXECUTION AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY

AND MARKET SHARE. THE NEW RULES ARE EXPECTED TO BOLSTER THE

NYSES COMPETITIVE POSITION BY SIMPLIFYING TRADING AND

ADVANCING THE NYSES GOAL OF INCREASING EXECUTION SPEEDS.

IN PROJECTING THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE BUSINESS FOR

THE PURPOSE OF PERFORMING OUR IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE MADE SEVERAL

IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF

THE EXPECTED RULE AND MARKET STRUCTURE CHANGES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

SPECIFICALLY, WE ASSUMED THAT.



OVERALL EQUITY TRADING VOLUMES WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AT A RATE

CONSISTENT WITH RECENT HISTORICAL TRENDS;



THE NYSE WILL BE ABLE TO RECAPTURE APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE

MARKET SHARE THAT IT LOST IN 2007; AND



WE WILL INCREASE THE MARKET SHARE OF OUR NYSE SPECIALIST

BUSINESS AND, AS A DMM, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH SHARE TRADED.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS, RULE OR

STRUCTURE CHANGES DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL RESULT IN SUFFICIENT CASH

FLOWS TO AVOID FUTURE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR NYSE SPECIALIST RIGHTS.

AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2007, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NYSE

SPECIALIST RIGHTS WAS $502 MILLION. TO THE EXTENT THAT

THERE WERE TO BE AN IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE, IT COULD RESULT IN

A SIGNIFICANT WRITEDOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE

SPECIALIST RIGHTS.

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN

ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO

IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT

MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX

AUDITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT

OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS TO THE

EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE ESTIMATED, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONTINGENCIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING

THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT

OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A

CASE-BY-CASE

BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER

CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE OR

PROCEEDING, OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN

SIMILAR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF

LEGAL COUNSEL. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE

OUTCOME OF OUR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY

IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE

DAMAGES OR FINES ARE SOUGHT, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES

OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS WHERE THERE IS ONLY A

REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED. SEE

REVENUES

2007 VERSUS 2006.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$45.99 BILLION IN 2007, AN INCREASE OF 22% COMPARED WITH

2006, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING, AND HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES. THE

INCREASE IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES, FICC AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. NET

REVENUES IN EQUITIES INCREASED 33% COMPARED WITH 2006,

REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN BOTH OUR

CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESSES AND PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES. DURING

2007, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES

AND HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR. THE INCREASE IN FICC REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES WERE HIGHER DESPITE A

SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET THROUGHOUT THE

YEAR, WHILE NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS WERE STRONG, BUT

SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2006. CREDIT PRODUCTS INCLUDED

SUBSTANTIAL GAINS FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A GAIN OF

APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF

HORIZON WIND ENERGY L.L.C., AS WELL AS A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1 BILLION, NET OF HEDGES, RELATED TO NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. DURING 2007, FICC OPERATED IN AN

ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, DURING THE

YEAR, THE MORTGAGE MARKET EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION

AND, IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS

WERE CHARACTERIZED BY WIDER SPREADS AND REDUCED LEVELS OF

LIQUIDITY. THE INCREASE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED

STRONG RESULTS IN BOTH CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE INVESTING.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING REFLECTED A 64% INCREASE IN

FINANCIAL ADVISORY NET REVENUES AND A STRONG PERFORMANCE IN OUR

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY

PRIMARILY REFLECTED GROWTH IN INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS

AND ACQUISITIONS. THE INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING REFLECTED HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, AS LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY

WAS STRONG DURING THE FIRST HALF OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WHILE NET

REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE STRONG BUT ESSENTIALLY

UNCHANGED FROM 2006.

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES ALSO

INCREASED. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES SERVICES PRIMARILY

REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN GLOBAL CUSTOMER BALANCES. THE

INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

INCENTIVE FEES. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

INCREASED $192 BILLION, OR 28%, TO A RECORD

$868 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $161 BILLION.

2006 VERSUS 2005.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$37.67 BILLION IN 2006, AN INCREASE OF 49% COMPARED WITH

2005, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENT BANKING, AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN FICC, EQUITIES AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. THE

INCREASE IN FICC REFLECTED PARTICULARLY STRONG PERFORMANCES

ACROSS ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES. DURING 2006, FICC OPERATED IN AN

ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND

FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, CORPORATE CREDIT

SPREADS TIGHTENED, THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENED AND VOLATILITY

LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOW IN INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKETS.

THE INCREASE IN EQUITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESSES. DURING

2006, EQUITIES OPERATED IN A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY

PRICES AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, ALTHOUGH VOLATILITY

LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOW. THE INCREASE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC AND HIGHER GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM

OTHER PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SMALLER, BUT

STILL SIGNIFICANT, GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY, AS

WE BENEFITED FROM STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, REFLECTING

FAVORABLE EQUITY AND FINANCING MARKETS, STRONG CEO CONFIDENCE

AND GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SPONSOR ACTIVITY.

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER GLOBAL CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES SERVICES. ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT INCREASED $144 BILLION OR 27% TO A RECORD

$676 BILLION, INCLUDING NET ASSET INFLOWS OF

$94 BILLION DURING 2006.

OPERATING

EXPENSES

OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY COMPENSATION,

HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION

OF OUR COMPENSATION EXPENSE REPRESENTS DISCRETIONARY BONUSES

WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

LEVEL OF NET REVENUES, PREVAILING LABOR MARKETS, BUSINESS MIX

AND THE STRUCTURE OF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. FOR

2007, OUR RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES WAS

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ARE ENTITIES

THAT ARE HELD STRICTLY FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION, HAVE A DEFINED

EXIT STRATEGY AND ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY

RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT HOLD REAL ESTATE

ASSETS, SUCH AS HOTELS, BUT EXCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT

PRIMARILY HOLD FINANCIAL ASSETS. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS

MEANINGFUL TO REVIEW NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES EXCLUDING

EXPENSES RELATED TO THESE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES IN ORDER TO

EVALUATE TRENDS IN NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR

PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. REVENUES RELATED TO SUCH ENTITIES

ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

2007 VERSUS 2006.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE

$28.38 BILLION FOR 2007, 23% HIGHER THAN 2006. COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $20.19 BILLION INCREASED 23%

COMPARED WITH 2006, REFLECTING INCREASED DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION AND GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS. THE RATIO OF

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2007 WAS 43.9%

COMPARED WITH 43.7% FOR 2006. EMPLOYMENT LEVELS INCREASED 15%

COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 2006.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF $8.19 BILLION FOR 2007

INCREASED 23% COMPARED WITH 2006, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED GEOGRAPHIC

EXPANSION.

ONE-HALF

OF

THIS INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE

AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION

VOLUMES IN EQUITIES. OTHER EXPENSES, PROFESSIONAL FEES AND

COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED, PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. OCCUPANCY AND

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES INCLUDED EXIT COSTS OF

$128 MILLION RELATED TO THE FIRMS OFFICE SPACE.

2006 VERSUS 2005.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE

$23.11 BILLION FOR 2006, 36% HIGHER THAN 2005. COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $16.46 BILLION INCREASED 40%

COMPARED WITH 2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUES, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF

EMPLOYMENT. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET

REVENUES FOR 2006 WAS 43.7% COMPARED WITH 46.6% FOR 2005. THIS

LOWER RATIO PRIMARILY REFLECTED OUR STRONG NET REVENUES IN 2006.

EMPLOYMENT LEVELS INCREASED 12% COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 123-R,

WHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES BE EXPENSED IN THE YEAR OF GRANT.

IN ADDITION TO EXPENSING CURRENT YEAR AWARDS, PRIOR YEAR AWARDS

MUST CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE RELEVANT SERVICE PERIOD.

THEREFORE, OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS IN 2006 INCLUDED BOTH

AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR YEAR SHARE-BASED AWARDS HELD BY EMPLOYEES

THAT WERE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 123-R

AND NEW AWARDS GRANTED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES IN 2006 INCLUDED

$637 MILLION IN CONTINUED AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR YEAR AWARDS

HELD BY EMPLOYEES THAT WERE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF

ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 123-R.

THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPENSE TO BE

RECOGNIZED WITH RESPECT TO THESE AWARDS.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF $6.65 BILLION FOR 2006

INCREASED 28% COMPARED WITH 2005. EXCLUDING NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES, NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE 24% HIGHER THAN 2005,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND

DISTRIBUTION FEES IN EQUITIES AND FICC, AND INCREASED OTHER

EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO COSTS RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE

BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN 2006. IN ADDITION, MARKET

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE HIGHER, REFLECTING

INCREASED LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY, AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES

INCREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING NEW OFFICE SPACE AND HIGHER

FACILITY EXPENSES.

PROVISION FOR

TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 34.1% FOR 2007, DOWN FROM

34.5% FOR 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX

OF EARNINGS. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 34.5% FOR 2006,

UP FROM 32.0% FOR 2005. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATE FOR 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A

REDUCTION IN THE IMPACT OF PERMANENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGHER

LEVELS OF EARNINGS IN 2006 AND AUDIT SETTLEMENTS IN 2005.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD

DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GEOGRAPHIC AND BUSINESS

MIX OF OUR EARNINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR PRE-TAX EARNINGS, THE

LEVEL OF OUR TAX CREDITS AND THE EFFECT OF TAX AUDITS. CERTAIN

OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR HISTORY OF PRE-TAX

EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING OUR ABILITY TO

REALIZE OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8

OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

WITH 2006. NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY OF

$4.22 BILLION INCREASED 64% COMPARED WITH 2006, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING GROWTH IN INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS. NET REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS OF

$3.33 BILLION INCREASED 9% COMPARED WITH 2006, DUE TO

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

STRENGTH IN LEVERAGED FINANCE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2007. NET

REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE ALSO STRONG, BUT

ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2006. OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

TRANSACTION BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2007 WAS HIGHER THAN AT THE

END OF 2006.

(1)

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $4.99 BILLION FOR 2007 INCREASED 23%

COMPARED WITH 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER DISCRETIONARY

REFLECTING INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY. NET REVENUES WERE ALSO

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY DUE TO A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY AND, TO A

LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT-GRADE ACTIVITY. OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2006 WAS AT

ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE 2000.

(1)

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $4.06 BILLION FOR 2006 INCREASED 25%

WERE $1.57 BILLION IN 2006 COMPARED WITH $413 MILLION

IN 2005.

TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO

THREE COMPONENTS.



FICC.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN AND TRADE INTEREST

RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES AND LOAN

PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED INSTRUMENTS, CURRENCIES AND

COMMODITIES, STRUCTURE AND ENTER INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY TRADING AND

INVESTING.



EQUITIES.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN AND TRADE

EQUITIES AND EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS, STRUCTURE AND ENTER INTO

EQUITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY

TRADING. WE GENERATE COMMISSIONS FROM EXECUTING AND CLEARING

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES

EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE THROUGH OUR EQUITIES CUSTOMER FRANCHISE AND

CLEARING ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO ENGAGE IN SPECIALIST AND INSURANCE

ACTIVITIES.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE REAL ESTATE AND

CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENTS IN

THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC AND THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

OF SMFG. WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM RETURNS ON THESE

INVESTMENTS AND FROM THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS

DERIVED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WHEN THE RETURN ON A

FUNDS INVESTMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE FUND EXCEEDS

CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS (TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS AN OVERRIDE).

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS MARKED-TO-MARKET DAILY

AND, THEREFORE, ITS VALUE AND OUR NET REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO

FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS. IN ADDITION, NET

REVENUES DERIVED FROM OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY

HELD CONCERNS AND IN REAL ESTATE MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDING ON THE REVALUATION OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS PART

OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH

TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN

PERIOD.

NET REVENUES FROM PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE

MANAGEMENT FEES GENERATED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS. THESE

MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN THE NET REVENUES OF THE ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES SEGMENT.

NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $16.17 BILLION FOR 2007 INCREASED

13% COMPARED WITH 2006, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION,

NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES WERE HIGHER DESPITE A SIGNIFICANT

DETERIORATION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET THROUGHOUT 2007, WHILE NET

REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS WERE STRONG, BUT SLIGHTLY LOWER

COMPARED WITH 2006. CREDIT PRODUCTS INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL GAINS

FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY

$900 MILLION RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF HORIZON WIND

ENERGY L.L.C., AS WELL AS A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1 BILLION, NET OF HEDGES, RELATED TO NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES WERE

ALSO STRONG BUT LOWER COMPARED WITH 2006. DURING 2007, FICC

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.

HOWEVER, DURING 2007, THE MORTGAGE MARKET EXPERIENCED

SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION AND, IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR,

THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY WIDER SPREADS

AND REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $11.30 BILLION FOR 2007

INCREASED 33% COMPARED WITH 2006, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN BOTH OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESSES

AND PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES. THE CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESSES

BENEFITED FROM SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMMISSION VOLUMES. DURING

2007, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES

AND HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET REVENUES OF

$3.76 BILLION FOR 2007, REFLECTING GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM

CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. RESULTS IN

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDED A $495 MILLION GAIN RELATED

TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC AND A

$129 MILLION LOSS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG.

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $18.00 BILLION FOR 2007 INCREASED 20%

COMPARED WITH 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM HIGHER DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION AND GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS. NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF

BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION. THE

MAJORITY OF THIS INCREASE WAS IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE

AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER

TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN EQUITIES. OTHER EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL

FEES ALSO INCREASED, REFLECTING INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY.

PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $13.23 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED 25%

COMPARED WITH 2006.

2006 VERSUS 2005.

NET REVENUES IN TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS OF $25.56 BILLION FOR 2006 INCREASED

52% COMPARED WITH 2005.

NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $14.26 BILLION INCREASED 60%

COMPARED WITH 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS (WHICH INCLUDES DISTRESSED

INVESTING) AND COMMODITIES. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES WERE

HIGHER IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND MORTGAGES.

DURING 2006, THE BUSINESS OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS

TIGHTENED, THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENED AND VOLATILITY LEVELS WERE

GENERALLY LOW IN INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKETS.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $8.48 BILLION INCREASED 50%

COMPARED WITH 2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN DERIVATIVES, ACROSS ALL REGIONS, AS WELL AS

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN SHARES. THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTED THE

CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN

2006. IN ADDITION, PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES PERFORMED WELL, ALTHOUGH

NET REVENUES WERE LOWER THAN A PARTICULARLY STRONG 2005. DURING

2006, EQUITIES OPERATED IN A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY

PRICES AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, ALTHOUGH VOLATILITY

LEVELS WERE GENERALLY LOW.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET REVENUES OF

$2.82 BILLION FOR 2006, REFLECTING A $937 MILLION GAIN

RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC, A

$527 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AND $1.35 BILLION IN

GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM OTHER PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $14.96 BILLION FOR 2006 INCREASED 41%

COMPARED WITH 2005, DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUES AND

INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT, AS WELL AS HIGHER

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES. EXCLUDING NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES

RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES,

THE INCREASE IN NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, IN

EQUITIES AND FICC, AND INCREASED OTHER EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE

TO COSTS RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED

IN 2006, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION,

PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE HIGHER, DUE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND

CONSULTING FEES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $10.60 BILLION IN 2006

INCREASED 70% COMPARED WITH 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE

ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT

IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING

PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL AND OTHER INTERESTS IN

MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION VEHICLES;

HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT, INTERESTS IN LIMITED AND

GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK IN OTHER

NONCONSOLIDATED VEHICLES; ENTERING INTO INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN

CURRENCY, EQUITY, COMMODITY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING

TOTAL RETURN SWAPS; ENTERING INTO OPERATING LEASES; AND

PROVIDING GUARANTEES, INDEMNIFICATIONS, LOAN COMMITMENTS,

LETTERS OF CREDIT AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS

PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE SECURITIZATION OF COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY AND AUTO LOANS, GOVERNMENT

AND CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. OTHER

REASONS FOR ENTERING INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE

UNDERWRITING CLIENT SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING

SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKING INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND

NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS;

PROVIDING INVESTORS WITH CREDIT-LINKED AND ASSET-REPACKAGED

NOTES; AND RECEIVING OR PROVIDING LETTERS OF CREDIT TO SATISFY

MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE CLEARANCE AND

SETTLEMENT PROCESS.

WE ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES)

AND QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES). SUCH VEHICLES

ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR

MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES MARKETS, SINCE THEY OFFER INVESTORS ACCESS TO

SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS CREATED THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION

PROCESS. OUR FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN, AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

WITH, SUCH NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE, IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

WHILE WE ARE ROUTINELY INVOLVED WITH VIES AND QSPES IN

CONNECTION WITH OUR SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WE DID NOT HAVE

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR FINANCE

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS HELD BY STRUCTURED INVESTMENT

VEHICLES AS OF NOVEMBER 2007.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUITY

CAPITAL

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE PRINCIPALLY

DETERMINED BY OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

BUT MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES,

SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT,

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ASSESSMENTS OF POTENTIAL

FUTURE LOSSES DUE TO EXTREME AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS

AND MARKET ENVIRONMENTS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, OUR TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $42.80 BILLION (CONSISTING OF

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $39.70 BILLION AND

PREFERRED STOCK OF $3.10 BILLION) COMPARED WITH TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $35.79 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER

2006 (CONSISTING OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF

$32.69 BILLION AND PREFERRED STOCK OF $3.10 BILLION).

IN ADDITION TO TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WE CONSIDER THE

$5.00 BILLION OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS

(SEE DISCUSSION BELOW) TO BE PART OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL, AS IT

QUALIFIES AS CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY AND CERTAIN RATING AGENCY

PURPOSES.

CONSOLIDATED

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

GOLDMAN SACHS IS REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) AS A CSE AND, AS SUCH, IS SUBJECT TO GROUP-WIDE

SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE SEC AND TO MINIMUM CAPITAL

ADEQUACY STANDARDS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. MINIMUM CAPITAL

ADEQUACY STANDARDS ARE PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY THE AMOUNT OF OUR

MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS CALCULATED BY

METHODOLOGIES APPROVED BY THE SEC. ELIGIBLE SOURCES OF

REGULATORY CAPITAL INCLUDE COMMON EQUITY AND CERTAIN TYPES OF

PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT AND HYBRID CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS. THE RECOGNITION

OF PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT AND HYBRID CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS AS

REGULATORY CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS. GOLDMAN SACHS WAS

IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CSE CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006.

RATING AGENCY

GUIDELINES

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE

OBLIGATIONS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., WHICH DIRECTLY

ISSUES OR GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF GOLDMAN SACHS

SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS. THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR

EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN

DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS OWN

DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING

CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON A

COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE CALCULATION. SEE

 LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK  CREDIT

RATINGS BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CREDIT

RATINGS.

SUBSIDIARY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

MANY OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE

REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND/OR

ELSEWHERE. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. AND GOLDMAN SACHS

EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P. ARE REGISTERED U.S.

BROKER-DEALERS AND FUTURES COMMISSIONS MERCHANTS, AND ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE

IMPOSED BY THE SEC, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION,

THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY

AUTHORITY (FINRA) AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. GOLDMAN

SACHS INTERNATIONAL, OUR REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER, IS

SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE

U.K.S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. GOLDMAN SACHS

JAPAN CO., LTD., OUR REGULATED JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER,

IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY

JAPANS FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. SEVERAL OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS ARE REGULATED BY SECURITIES,

INVESTMENT ADVISORY, BANKING, INSURANCE, AND OTHER REGULATORS

AND AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND

NOVEMBER 2006, THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR

LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION MAY HOLD

CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY

REQUIREMENTS (FOR ENTITIES WITH ASSIGNED CREDIT RATINGS) OR

INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING THE MINIMUM

AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED ON ITS

UNDERLYING LEVEL OF RISK. SEE  LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING RISK  CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE

BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR POTENTIAL INABILITY TO ACCESS

FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH

PARENT COMPANY EQUITY CAPITAL. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, GROUP

INC.S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES WAS

$40.00 BILLION COMPARED WITH ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY OF $42.80 BILLION.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK,

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS MANAGED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND

NON-U.S.

DENOMINATED DEBT. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY MANAGE THE

NON-TRADING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THAT ARISES FROM

TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

TRANSACTING ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

EQUITY CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT LEVEL AND OPTIMAL

COMPOSITION OF EQUITY CAPITAL. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL THROUGH

REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND ISSUANCES OF PREFERRED

STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER

SUBORDINATED DEBT. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND/OR

LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE AT BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED AND

BUSINESS UNIT LEVELS. WE ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF OUR

BUSINESS UNITS BASED UPON THE CSE REGULATORY CAPITAL FRAMEWORK

AND MANAGE THE LEVELS OF USAGE BASED UPON THE BALANCE SHEET AND

RISK LIMITS ESTABLISHED.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

WE USE OUR SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF

COMMON EQUITY AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE

COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY

THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED

CAPITAL POSITIONS (I.E., COMPARISONS OF OUR DESIRED LEVEL OF

CAPITAL TO OUR ACTUAL LEVEL OF CAPITAL) BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE

INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE

AND TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS IN CONNECTION WITH

NORMAL AUTOMATIC PREFERRED ENHANCED CAPITAL

SECURITIES.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, WE ISSUED

$1.75 BILLION OF FIXED RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT TO

GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL II AND $500 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT TO GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL III, DELAWARE

STATUTORY TRUSTS THAT, IN TURN, ISSUED $2.25 BILLION OF

GUARANTEED PERPETUAL AUTOMATIC PREFERRED ENHANCED CAPITAL

SECURITIES (APEX) TO THIRD PARTIES AND A DE MINIMIS AMOUNT OF

COMMON SECURITIES TO GOLDMAN SACHS. THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT

IS INCLUDED IN UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN CONNECTION

WITH THE APEX ISSUANCE, WE ENTERED INTO STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS

WITH GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL II AND III UNDER WHICH WE WILL BE

OBLIGATED TO SELL AND THESE ENTITIES WILL BE OBLIGATED TO

PURCHASE $2.25 BILLION OF PERPETUAL NON-CUMULATIVE

PREFERRED STOCK THAT WE WILL ISSUE IN THE FUTURE. GOLDMAN SACHS

CAPITAL II AND III ARE REQUIRED TO REMARKET THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT IN ORDER TO FUND THEIR PURCHASE OF THE

PREFERRED STOCK, BUT IN THE EVENT THAT A REMARKETING IS

UNSUCCESSFUL, THEY WILL RELINQUISH THE SUBORDINATED DEBT TO US

IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PREFERRED STOCK. BECAUSE OF CERTAIN

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT (AND THE

ASSOCIATED APEX), INCLUDING ITS LONG-TERM NATURE, THE FUTURE

ISSUANCE OF PERPETUAL NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK UNDER THE

STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS, OUR ABILITY TO DEFER PAYMENTS DUE ON

STATUTORY TRUST THAT, IN TURN, ISSUED $2.75 BILLION OF

GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO THIRD PARTIES AND

$85 MILLION OF COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO GOLDMAN

SACHS. THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ARE INCLUDED IN

UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. BECAUSE OF CERTAIN

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT (AND THE

ASSOCIATED TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES), INCLUDING ITS LONG-TERM

NATURE, OUR ABILITY TO DEFER COUPON INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN

CONSECUTIVE SEMIANNUAL PERIODS AND THE SUBORDINATED NATURE OF

OUR COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE AGREEMENTS TO LEND TO

COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE FIXED TERMINATION DATES AND ARE

CONTINGENT ON THE SATISFACTION OF ALL CONDITIONS TO BORROWING

SET FORTH IN THE CONTRACT. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR LENDING

ACTIVITIES, WE HAD OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT OF

$82.75 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 COMPARED WITH

$100.48 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2006. SINCE THESE

COMMITMENTS MAY EXPIRE UNUSED OR BE REDUCED OR CANCELLED AT THE

COUNTERPARTYS REQUEST, THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT DOES

NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE ACTUAL FUTURE CASH FLOW

REQUIREMENTS. OUR COMMERCIAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ARE GENERALLY

EXTENDED IN CONNECTION WITH CONTINGENT ACQUISITION FINANCING AND

OTHER TYPES OF CORPORATE LENDING AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL REAL

ESTATE FINANCING. WE MAY SEEK TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK ON THESE

COMMITMENTS BY SYNDICATING ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF

COMMITMENTS TO OTHER INVESTORS. IN ADDITION, COMMITMENTS THAT

ARE EXTENDED FOR CONTINGENT ACQUISITION FINANCING ARE OFTEN

INTENDED TO BE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AS BORROWERS OFTEN SEEK TO

REPLACE THEM WITH OTHER FUNDING SOURCES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMMITMENTS PROVIDED UNDER THE WILLIAM

STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM ARE TO INVESTMENT-GRADE

CORPORATE BORROWERS. COMMITMENTS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE EXTENDED

BY WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENT CORPORATION (COMMITMENT CORP.), A

CONSOLIDATED WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GROUP INC. WHOSE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARE LEGALLY SEPARATED FROM OTHER ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS, WILLIAM STREET CREDIT CORPORATION,

GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. OR OTHER

CONSOLIDATED WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF GROUP INC. THE

COMMITMENTS EXTENDED BY COMMITMENT CORP. ARE SUPPORTED, IN PART,

BY FUNDING RAISED BY WILLIAM STREET FUNDING CORPORATION (FUNDING

CORP.), ANOTHER CONSOLIDATED WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GROUP

INC. WHOSE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO LEGALLY SEPARATED

FROM OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS. WITH RESPECT

TO MOST OF THE WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENTS, SMFG PROVIDES US WITH

CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION THAT IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE

FIRST LOSS WE REALIZE ON APPROVED LOAN COMMITMENTS, UP TO A

MAXIMUM OF $1.00 BILLION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO THE

SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL

PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR 70% OF THE SECOND LOSS ON SUCH

COMMITMENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.13 BILLION. WE ALSO USE

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISKS RELATED TO

CERTAIN WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENTS NOT COVERED BY SMFG.

OUR COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ALSO INCLUDE FINANCING FOR THE

WAREHOUSING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO BE SECURITIZED. THESE

FINANCINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPAID FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE

RELATED SECURITIZATIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY OR MAY NOT ACT AS

UNDERWRITER. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE SECURED BY THE WAREHOUSED

ASSETS, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF CORPORATE BANK LOANS AND

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND RESIDENTIAL

RISK

MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS OF PRIMARY

IMPORTANCE TO THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE

A COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO MONITOR, EVALUATE AND

MANAGE THE PRINCIPAL RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR

ACTIVITIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE MARKET, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL EXPOSURES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

STRUCTURE

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A

VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS. IN

ADDITION, A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING

RISK EXPOSURES AND FOR GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET

RISK

THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR TRADING AND

INVESTING POSITIONS IS REFERRED TO AS MARKET RISK. SUCH

POSITIONS RESULT FROM MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING,

UNDERWRITING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF OUR INVENTORY POSITIONS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET ON A DAILY

BASIS AND CHANGES ARE RECORDED IN NET REVENUES.

CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATES,

EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. A

DESCRIPTION OF EACH MARKET RISK CATEGORY IS SET FORTH BELOW.



INTEREST RATE RISKS PRIMARILY RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES

IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE, THE

VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND

CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES

AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, EQUITY BASKETS AND

EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS

ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND

PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THESE RISKS BY DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES,

CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING ECONOMIC HEDGES IN

RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY HEDGE A

PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCKS BY TAKING AN OFFSETTING POSITION IN A

RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AN

EXPOSURE MAY, HOWEVER, BE LIMITED BY ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE

LIQUIDITY OF THE SECURITY OR THE RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT AND IN

THE CORRELATION OF PRICE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND

RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT.

IN ADDITION TO APPLYING BUSINESS JUDGMENT, SENIOR MANAGEMENT

USES A NUMBER OF QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

MARKET RISK FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR

VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET

PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE TOOLS INCLUDE.



RISK LIMITS BASED ON A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE

REFERRED TO AS VAR;



SCENARIO ANALYSES, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT

MEASURE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON OUR TRADING NET REVENUES OF

VARIOUS MARKET EVENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A LARGE

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT MOVES IN SELECTED EMERGING MARKETS; AND



INVENTORY POSITION LIMITS FOR SELECTED BUSINESS UNITS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VAR

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF TRADING POSITIONS DUE TO

ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A

SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

FOR THE VAR NUMBERS REPORTED BELOW, A

ONE-DAY

TIME

HORIZON AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL WERE USED. THIS MEANS THAT

THERE IS A 1 IN 20 CHANCE THAT DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES WILL

FALL BELOW THE EXPECTED DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES BY AN AMOUNT

AT LEAST AS LARGE AS THE REPORTED VAR. THUS, SHORTFALLS FROM

EXPECTED TRADING NET REVENUES ON A SINGLE TRADING DAY GREATER

THAN THE REPORTED VAR WOULD BE ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR, ON AVERAGE,

ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. SHORTFALLS ON A SINGLE DAY CAN EXCEED

REPORTED VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. SHORTFALLS CAN ALSO

ACCUMULATE OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON SUCH AS A NUMBER OF

CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

THE MODELING OF THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR TRADING

POSITIONS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS.

WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND

APPROXIMATIONS ARE REASONABLE, THERE IS NO STANDARD METHODOLOGY

FOR ESTIMATING VAR, AND DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND/OR

APPROXIMATIONS COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR ESTIMATES.

WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OUR VAR AND, TO BETTER

REFLECT CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WE GENERALLY WEIGHT

HISTORICAL DATA TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT

OBSERVATIONS. GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST

EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE

ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION OF VAR IS THAT THE

DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT

PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK. DIFFERENT

VAR METHODOLOGIES AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS COULD PRODUCE A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR. MOREOVER, VAR CALCULATED FOR A

ONE-DAY

TIME

HORIZON DOES NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE MARKET RISK OF POSITIONS THAT

CANNOT BE LIQUIDATED OR OFFSET WITH HEDGES WITHIN ONE DAY.

RISK MEASURES

CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS AND INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

VAR, WHERE VAR IS NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF RISK

(E.G., DUE TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND/OR ILLIQUIDITY). THE

MARKET RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF

ICBC AND THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS MEASURED BY

ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED

WITH A 10% DECLINE IN THE ICBC ORDINARY SHARE PRICE AND A 10%

DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE, RESPECTIVELY. THE MARKET

RISK RELATED TO THE REMAINING POSITIONS IS MEASURED BY

ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED

WITH A 10% DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES FOR EQUITY AND DEBT POSITIONS IN OUR

TRADING PORTFOLIO AND EQUITY, DEBT (PRIMARILY MEZZANINE

INSTRUMENTS) AND REAL ESTATE POSITIONS IN OUR NON-TRADING

PORTFOLIO ARE MEASURED BY THE IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN THE ASSET

VALUES (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LEVERAGE IN THE UNDERLYING

INVESTMENTS FOR REAL ESTATE POSITIONS IN OUR NON-TRADING

PORTFOLIO) OF SUCH POSITIONS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

POSITIONS MAY BE IMPACTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS TRANSACTIONS IN

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED OR PENDING THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OR COMPARABLE

ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN

THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL

RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC EXCLUDES INTERESTS HELD BY INVESTMENT FUNDS

MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG, NET OF THE ECONOMIC HEDGE ON A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING OUR

INVESTMENT, IS

MEASURED BY THE IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK

SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE WOULD BE NONLINEAR DUE TO DOWNSIDE

PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STOCK PRICE.

RELATES TO INTERESTS IN OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS.

THE INCREASE IN OUR 10% SENSITIVITY MEASURES DURING 2007 IN OUR

TRADING AND NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS (EXCLUDING ICBC AND SMFG) WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW INVESTMENTS.

IN ADDITION, AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, IN OUR BANK

AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WE HELD APPROXIMATELY

$10.58 BILLION AND $9.95 BILLION OF SECURITIES,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF MORTGAGE-BACKED, FEDERAL

AGENCY AND INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BONDS.

CREDIT

RISK

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS THAT WE WOULD INCUR IF A

COUNTERPARTY OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE

HOLD FAILS TO PERFORM UNDER ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO US,

OR UPON A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTC

DERIVATIVES, WE HOLD. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY

ARISES THROUGH OUR TRADING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE SEEK TO ENTER INTO NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION,

WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES BY (I) ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE

US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM A COUNTERPARTY ON AN UPFRONT OR

CONTINGENT BASIS, (II) SEEKING

THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS, AND/OR

(III) TRANSFERRING OUR CREDIT RISK TO THIRD PARTIES USING

CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND/OR OTHER STRUCTURES AND TECHNIQUES.

TO MEASURE AND MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE USE A VARIETY OF

TOOLS, INCLUDING CREDIT LIMITS REFERENCED TO BOTH CURRENT

EXPOSURE AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE IS GENERALLY

BASED ON PROJECTED WORST-CASE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF

A TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESS, FOR POSITIONS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN CREDIT

SPREADS, WE USE VAR

91

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND OTHER SENSITIVITY MEASURES. TO SUPPLEMENT OUR PRIMARY CREDIT

EXPOSURE MEASURES, WE ALSO USE SCENARIO ANALYSES, SUCH AS CREDIT

SPREAD WIDENING SCENARIOS, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER QUANTITATIVE

TOOLS.

OUR GLOBAL CREDIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MONITOR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO

COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. THESE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRMWIDE RISK AND CREDIT POLICY

COMMITTEES, WITH INFORMATION REGARDING CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT,

INDUSTRY SECTOR, COUNTRY AND REGION.

WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND

COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS,

INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, RESULTING IN

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, WE HELD

$45.75 BILLION (4% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND $46.20 BILLION

(6% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY

THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION AND THE FEDERAL HOME

LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION) INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND CASH AND

SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, WE HELD $31.65 BILLION (3%

OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND $23.64 BILLION (3% OF TOTAL ASSETS),

RESPECTIVELY, OF OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS, PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTING OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF JAPAN AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN ADDITION, AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND

NOVEMBER 2006, $144.92 BILLION AND $104.76 BILLION OF

OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL

AND SECURITIES BORROWED, RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLATERALIZED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER

2007 AND 2006, $41.26 BILLION AND $38.22 BILLION OF

OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL

AND SECURITIES BORROWED, RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLATERALIZED BY

OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER

2006, WE DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY

THAT EXCEEDED 2% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES

HAVE BEEN INCREASING, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GROWTH OF

OUR LENDING AND OTC DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET EVOLUTION

TOWARD LONGER DATED TRANSACTIONS. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS BELOW.

DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED

INTO TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY

POSITIONS OR AS A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, WE

ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON

OUR NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS AND TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE

ON OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND WE BELIEVE

THAT THE ASSOCIATED MARKET RISK CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD RELATIVE

TO ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OR RISKS BEING HEDGED, OR AS

PART OF A BROADER TRADING STRATEGY. ACCORDINGLY, THE MARKET RISK

OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS IS MANAGED TOGETHER WITH OUR

NONDERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IS REFLECTED NET OF

CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND

IS REPORTED ON A

NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY

BASIS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN

ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. FOR AN OTC DERIVATIVE, OUR CREDIT

EXPOSURE IS DIRECTLY WITH OUR COUNTERPARTY AND CONTINUES UNTIL

THE MATURITY OR TERMINATION OF SUCH CONTRACT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE LEGAL RISKS INCLUDING

THE RISK THAT THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATE FOR A

COUNTERPARTY, THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY EXECUTED

OR THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE

COUNTERPARTY. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS BY OBTAINING

ADVICE OF COUNSEL ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS

ON THE AUTHORITY OF A COUNTERPARTY TO EFFECT THE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS (E.G.,

CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS) INVOLVE THE RISK THAT WE MAY HAVE

DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING

SECURITY OR OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO SATISFY ANY PHYSICAL

SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENT.

LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING RISK

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO COMPANIES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOST FAILURES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT

LIQUIDITY RESULTING FROM ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY,

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING POLICIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS BOTH GOLDMAN SACHS-SPECIFIC AND BROADER

INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS

TO BE ABLE TO FUND GOLDMAN SACHS AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE

BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE

CIRCUMSTANCES.

MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES ACCORDING TO THE

FOLLOWING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.



EXCESS LIQUIDITY  WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS

LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS IN A

STRESSED ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING FINANCING OBLIGATIONS.



ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN

FUNDING SOURCES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY LONG-TERM IN ORDER TO

WITHSTAND A PROLONGED OR SEVERE LIQUIDITY-STRESSED ENVIRONMENT

WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON ASSET SALES.



CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE  WE ACCESS FUNDING

ACROSS A DIVERSE RANGE OF MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES,

EMPHASIZE LESS CREDIT-SENSITIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING AND

CONSERVATIVELY MANAGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING ACROSS OUR

ENTITY STRUCTURE.



CRISIS PLANNING  WE BASE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING

MANAGEMENT ON STRESS-SCENARIO PLANNING AND MAINTAIN A CRISIS

PLAN DETAILING OUR RESPONSE TO A LIQUIDITY-THREATENING EVENT.

EXCESS

LIQUIDITY

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO PRE-FUND WHAT WE

ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR LIKELY CASH NEEDS DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS

AND HOLD SUCH EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF UNENCUMBERED,

HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT MAY BE SOLD OR PLEDGED TO PROVIDE

SAME-DAY

LIQUIDITY. THIS GLOBAL CORE EXCESS LIQUIDITY IS

INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT

NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING

FROM CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POOL OF

EXCESS LIQUIDITY PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS

AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A

DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS REFLECTS

THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST

CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS SURVIVAL.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL

OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. GOLDMAN

SACHS BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND ITS CASH NEEDS ARE

DRIVEN BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE

DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING

UNSECURED DEBT AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS,

MAY BE UNAVAILABLE AND THE TERMS OR AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES

OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO PRE-FUND LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE

MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES

AND HAVE LARGER UNSECURED DEBT BALANCES THAN OUR BUSINESSES

WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS

STRONGER WITH GREATER

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH

IT INCREASES OUR UNSECURED LIABILITIES.

THE SIZE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL

LIQUIDITY MODEL TOGETHER WITH A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE

CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OF GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR

LIQUIDITY MODEL IDENTIFIES AND ESTIMATES CASH AND COLLATERAL

OUTFLOWS OVER A SHORT-TERM HORIZON IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.



UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT AND LETTERS OF CREDIT;



POTENTIAL BUYBACKS OF A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING NEGOTIABLE

UNSECURED DEBT;



ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE TERMS OR AVAILABILITY OF SECURED FUNDING;



DERIVATIVES AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, INCLUDING

THOSE DUE TO MARKET MOVES;



POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRIME BROKERAGE

BUSINESS;



ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL THAT COULD BE CALLED IN THE EVENT OF A

TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS;



DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS NOT SUPPORTED BY WILLIAM

STREET FUNDING CORPORATION

AND



THE U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED EXCESS IS COMPRISED OF ONLY

UNENCUMBERED U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES

AND HIGHLY LIQUID U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF

WHICH ARE FEDERAL RESERVE REPO-ELIGIBLE, AS WELL AS OVERNIGHT

CASH DEPOSITS. OUR

NON-U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED EXCESS IS COMPRISED OF ONLY UNENCUMBERED

FRENCH, GERMAN, UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS AND

EURO, BRITISH POUND AND JAPANESE YEN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS. WE

STRICTLY LIMIT OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO THIS NARROWLY DEFINED

LIST OF SECURITIES AND CASH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE HIGHLY

LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT

BELIEVE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY, SUCH AS

LOWER-QUALITY UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT

FACILITIES, ARE AS RELIABLE IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT

IT IS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT

COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE REMAINDER

IS HELD IN OUR PRINCIPAL

NON-U.S.

OPERATING ENTITIES, PRIMARILY TO BETTER MATCH THE CURRENCY AND

TIMING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE ENTITIES POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY

OBLIGATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AS A RESULT OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THESE ASSETS, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA, INCLUDE OTHER GOVERNMENT BONDS,

HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND

MARGINABLE EQUITIES. WE DO NOT INCLUDE THESE SECURITIES IN OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS.

(1)

THE

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS EXCLUDES LIQUID ASSETS OF $6.17 BILLION

HELD SEPARATELY BY WILLIAM STREET FUNDING CORPORATION. SEE

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

ABOVE FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE WILLIAM STREET CREDIT

EXTENSION PROGRAM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAINTAIN GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS IN

AN AMOUNT THAT, IF PLEDGED OR SOLD, WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDS

NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST 110% OF OUR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS

THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE (OR WHERE HOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION

TO REDEEM) WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ASSUME

CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES THAT ARE BASED ON STRESS-SCENARIO

BORROWING CAPACITY AND WE REGULARLY REVIEW THESE ASSUMPTIONS

ASSET CLASS BY ASSET CLASS. THE ESTIMATED AGGREGATE LOAN VALUE

OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND OUR OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS

AVERAGED $156.74 BILLION AND $134.38 BILLION FOR THE

FISCAL YEARS ENDED 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS

MARKED-TO-MARKET

DAILY. WE UTILIZE AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO OUR BUSINESSES TO HOLD

INVENTORY OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

LIMITS PROVIDE A COMPLEMENTARY MECHANISM FOR ENSURING

APPROPRIATE BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY IN ADDITION TO OUR STANDARD

POSITION LIMITS. ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES DUE TO

SEASONAL ACTIVITY, MARKET CONVENTIONS AND PERIODIC MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND

ADJUSTED ASSETS AT FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATES ARE NOT MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR REPORTING PERIODS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THE MATURITY PROFILE OF OUR FUNDING BASE SUCH

THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS PRIOR TO OUR

LIABILITIES COMING DUE, EVEN IN TIMES OF PROLONGED OR SEVERE

LIQUIDITY STRESS. WE DO NOT RELY ON IMMEDIATE SALES OF ASSETS

(OTHER THAN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS) TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY IN A

DISTRESSED ENVIRONMENT, ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE ORDERLY ASSET

SALES MAY BE PRUDENT AND NECESSARY IN A PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY

CRISIS.

IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES, OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE

THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL CAPITAL (UNSECURED LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) TO FUND OUR

BALANCE SHEET FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE AMOUNT OF OUR TOTAL

CAPITAL IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, WHICH

INCORPORATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM

FINANCING REQUIREMENTS.



THE PORTION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED THAT WE BELIEVE COULD

NOT BE FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS,

ASSUMING CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES;



GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS;



DERIVATIVE AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS;



ANTICIPATED DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS; AND



CAPITAL OR OTHER FORMS OF FINANCING IN OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS IN EXCESS OF THEIR

LONG-TERM

FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. SEE  CONSERVATIVE

LIABILITY STRUCTURE BELOW FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW

WE FUND OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

(5)

INCLUDES INTERESTS IN OTHER

INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE.

A LARGE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS ARE FUNDED THROUGH SECURED

FUNDING MARKETS OR NONRECOURSE FINANCING. WE FOCUS ON

DEMONSTRATING A CONSISTENT ABILITY TO FUND THESE ASSETS ON A

SECURED BASIS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME TO REDUCE REFINANCING

RISK AND TO HELP ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED AMOUNT OF

LOAN VALUE IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN BE FUNDED IN PERIODS OF MARKET

STRESS.

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

HOLD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSERVATIVE

LIABILITY STRUCTURE

WE SEEK TO STRUCTURE OUR LIABILITIES CONSERVATIVELY TO REDUCE

REFINANCING RISK AND THE RISK THAT WE MAY REDEEM OR REPURCHASE

CERTAIN OF OUR BORROWINGS PRIOR TO THEIR CONTRACTUAL MATURITY.

OUR CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING

POLICIES.



WE FUND A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR INVENTORY ON A SECURED

BASIS. WE BELIEVE SECURED FINANCING PROVIDES GOLDMAN SACHS WITH

A MORE STABLE SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY THAN UNSECURED FINANCING, AS

IT IS LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT DUE TO THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.



OUR LIQUIDITY DEPENDS TO AN IMPORTANT DEGREE ON THE STABILITY OF

OUR SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FINANCING BASE. ACCORDINGLY, WE PREFER

THE USE OF PROMISSORY NOTES (IN WHICH GOLDMAN SACHS DOES NOT

MAKE A MARKET) OVER COMMERCIAL PAPER, WHICH WE MAY REPURCHASE

PRIOR TO MATURITY THROUGH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A

MARKET MAKER. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, OUR

UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION

OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, WERE $71.56 BILLION AND

$47.90 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8

OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS.



WE RECOGNIZE THAT SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS HAVE GREATER

REFINANCING RISK WHEN THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL IS MORE

DIFFICULT TO FUND. CONSEQUENTLY, WE SEEK LONGER MATURITIES FOR

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COLLATERALIZED BY THESE ASSETS. IN

SOME CASES, WE USE EXTENDIBLE MATURITY FEATURES TO OBTAIN A

ROLLING MINIMUM TERM TO THE FUNDING.



WE ISSUE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT WITHOUT

PROVISIONS THAT WOULD, BASED SOLELY UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN

OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR

STOCK PRICE, TRIGGER A REQUIREMENT FOR AN EARLY PAYMENT,

COLLATERAL SUPPORT, CHANGE IN TERMS, ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OR

THE CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES

GLOBALLY FOR BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING. WE MAKE

EXTENSIVE USE OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES LENDING

MARKETS, AS WELL AS OTHER SECURED FUNDING MARKETS. IN ADDITION,

WE ISSUE DEBT THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS, U.S.

REGISTERED AND 144A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAMS, OFFSHORE

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE OFFERINGS AND OTHER BOND OFFERINGS, U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND PROMISSORY NOTE ISSUANCES, AND OTHER

METHODS. WE ALSO ARRANGE FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT TO BE ISSUED ON

OUR BEHALF.

WE BENEFIT FROM DISTRIBUTING OUR DEBT ISSUANCES THROUGH OUR OWN

SALES FORCE TO A LARGE, DIVERSE GLOBAL CREDITOR BASE AND WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE CRITICAL

TO OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR CREDITORS INCLUDE BANKS, GOVERNMENTS,

SECURITIES LENDERS, PENSION FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

MUTUAL FUNDS. WE ACCESS FUNDING IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS IN THE

AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL

GUIDELINES ON INVESTOR CONCENTRATION, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER THAT CAN BE OWNED AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

THAT CAN BE ISSUED BY ANY SINGLE INVESTOR OR GROUP OF INVESTORS.

99

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO MITIGATE REFINANCING RISK, WE HAVE CREATED INTERNAL

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 WAS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS. WE

SWAP A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO U.S.

EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP

INC. THE PARENT COMPANY THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET

FINANCING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT

COMPANY PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY

CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF

THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING INCLUDE ENHANCED CONTROL AND

GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ARE PREDICATED ON AN

ASSUMPTION THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR, FUNDS OR

SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE FROM A SUBSIDIARY TO ITS

PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR LIMIT THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD

IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. AS SUCH, WE ASSUME THAT

CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE ASSUME THAT THE GLOBAL CORE EXCESS

HELD IN OUR PRINCIPAL

NON-U.S.

OPERATING ENTITIES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY

OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND THEREFORE IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO MEET

THE POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE ENTITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY RISK BY REQUIRING SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR

SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE

PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES

OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN

ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY BORROWINGS. IN

ADDITION, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES MAINTAIN

UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TO COVER THEIR INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS

(OTHER THAN SUBORDINATED DEBT) IN ORDER TO MITIGATE PARENT

COMPANY LIQUIDITY RISK.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES; FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF NOVEMBER 2007,

GROUP INC. HAD $24.49 BILLION OF SUCH EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GOLDMAN, SACHS &

CO., ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED

BROKER-DEALER;

$27.51 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL, A

REGULATED U.K.

BROKER-DEALER;

$2.40 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS

EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P., A U.S. REGISTERED

BROKER-DEALER; AND $3.15 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS

JAPAN CO., LTD., A REGULATED JAPANESE

BROKER-DEALER.

GROUP INC. ALSO HAD $44.99 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS

TO THESE ENTITIES AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS

OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRISIS

PLANNING

IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR A LIQUIDITY EVENT, OR A PERIOD OF

MARKET STRESS, WE BASE OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

AND OUR RESULTING FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY POLICIES ON CONSERVATIVE

STRESS-SCENARIO

ASSUMPTIONS. OUR PLANNING INCORPORATES SEVERAL MARKET-BASED AND

OPERATIONAL STRESS SCENARIOS. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY CONDUCT

LIQUIDITY CRISIS DRILLS TO TEST OUR LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND

BACKUP FUNDING PROCEDURES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS PLAN THAT SPECIFIES

AN APPROACH FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A

LIQUIDITY-THREATENING EVENT. THE PLAN PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK TO

ESTIMATE THE LIKELY IMPACT OF A LIQUIDITY EVENT ON GOLDMAN SACHS

BASED ON SOME OF THE RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE AND OUTLINES WHICH

AND TO WHAT EXTENT LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE

IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. IT ALSO LISTS

THE CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTIES TO

BE CONTACTED TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION.

CREDIT

RATINGS

WE RELY UPON THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS

TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. THE

COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING IS INFLUENCED BY OUR

CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE

COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND WHEN WE SEEK TO ENGAGE IN

LONGER TERM TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES. WE BELIEVE

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT RATING

AGENCIES ASSESSMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT AND

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY

OF OUR EARNINGS, OUR CAPITAL BASE, OUR FRANCHISE, REPUTATION AND

MANAGEMENT, OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE EXTERNAL OPERATING

ENVIRONMENT. SEE  CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS ABOVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS PURSUANT

TO BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES OF

APPROXIMATELY $728 MILLION WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED IN THE

EVENT OF A

ONE-NOTCH

REDUCTION IN OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS. IN EVALUATING OUR

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE CONSIDER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR

TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A

TWO-NOTCH

DOWNGRADE IN OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL

THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO

THEM.

CASH

FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX

AND INTERRELATED AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS

AND NET ASSETS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN EVALUATING OUR

LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY,

HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESS.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2007.

OUR CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $5.59 BILLION TO

$11.88 BILLION AT THE END OF 2007. WE RAISED

$73.79 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING AND INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED

BORROWINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. WE

USED NET CASH OF $68.20 BILLION IN OUR OPERATING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE ON TRADING AND INVESTING

OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2006.

OUR CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $3.97 BILLION TO

$6.29 BILLION AT THE END OF 2006. WE RAISED

$64.09 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS WELL AS THROUGH SECURED

FINANCINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. WE

USED NET CASH OF $68.06 BILLION IN OUR OPERATING AND

INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE ON TRADING AND

INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES.

OPERATIONAL

RISK

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR

SYSTEMS, OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN ARISE

FROM MANY FACTORS RANGING FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS TO

POTENTIALLY COSTLY INCIDENTS RELATED TO, FOR EXAMPLE, MAJOR

SYSTEMS FAILURES. OPERATIONAL RISK MAY ALSO CAUSE REPUTATIONAL

HARM. THUS, EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY, MANAGE AND MITIGATE OPERATIONAL

RISK MUST BE EQUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE RISK OF REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AS WELL AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS.

WE MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF

LONG-STANDING, BUT CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING, FIRMWIDE CONTROL

STANDARDS WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY THE TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND

DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE; THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND

COMMITMENT OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF

IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS ACROSS GOLDMAN

SACHS; AND A FRAMEWORK OF STRONG AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL

DEPARTMENTS THAT MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK ON A DAILY BASIS.

TOGETHER, THESE ELEMENTS FORM A STRONG FIRMWIDE CONTROL CULTURE

THAT SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE

OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK DEPARTMENT, AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT

FUNCTION, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A

STANDARDIZED FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, AND REPORT

OPERATIONAL RISKS TO SUPPORT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT ACROSS

GOLDMAN SACHS. THIS FRAMEWORK, WHICH EVOLVES WITH THE CHANGING

NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE, INCORPORATES

ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS,

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL FACTORS, AND SCENARIO

ANALYSIS. THE FRAMEWORK ALSO PROVIDES REGULAR REPORTING OF OUR

OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES TO OUR BOARD, RISK COMMITTEES AND

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONAL RISK

FIN NO. 48.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED

FIN NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 109. FIN NO. 48 REQUIRES THAT WE

DETERMINE WHETHER A TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE

SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED

APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS

OF THE POSITION. ONCE IT IS DETERMINED THAT A POSITION MEETS

THIS RECOGNITION THRESHOLD, THE POSITION IS MEASURED TO

DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE WILL ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF

FIN NO. 48 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. ADOPTION OF

FIN NO. 48 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

SFAS NO. 157.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 CLARIFIES THAT FAIR

VALUE IS AN EXIT PRICE, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE

RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. UNDER

SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT ADJUSTED

FOR TRANSACTION COSTS.

SFAS NO. 157 NULLIFIES THE GUIDANCE INCLUDED IN

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO. 02-3,

ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY

TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, THAT PROHIBITED

THE RECOGNITION OF A DAY ONE GAIN OR LOSS ON DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS (AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE UNDER SFAS NO. 155) WHERE WE WERE UNABLE TO

VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA AND/OR VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. HOWEVER,

SFAS NO. 157 REQUIRES THAT A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

REFLECT THE ASSUMPTIONS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING

AN ASSET OR LIABILITY BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR VALUATION

TECHNIQUE (SUCH AS A PRICING MODEL) AND/OR THE RISKS INHERENT IN

THE INPUTS TO THE MODEL.

IN ADDITION, SFAS NO. 157 PROHIBITS THE RECOGNITION OF

BLOCK DISCOUNTS FOR LARGE HOLDINGS OF UNRESTRICTED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE QUOTED PRICES ARE READILY AND

REGULARLY AVAILABLE FOR AN IDENTICAL ASSET OR LIABILITY IN AN

ACTIVE MARKET.

THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 157 ARE TO BE APPLIED

PROSPECTIVELY, EXCEPT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS THAT

RESULT FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 157 TO

EXISTING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED UNDER EITF

ISSUE

NO. 02-3,

EXISTING HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AND

BLOCK DISCOUNTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE TO BE RECORDED AS AN

ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE YEAR OF

ADOPTION.

WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 157 AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2007.

THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS WAS A

GAIN OF $51 MILLION, NET OF TAX. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2007, THE EFFECT OF THE NULLIFICATION OF EITF ISSUE

NO. 02-3

AND THE REMOVAL OF LIQUIDITY DISCOUNTS FOR ACTIVELY TRADED

POSITIONS WAS NOT MATERIAL. IN ADDITION, UNDER

SFAS NO. 157, GAINS ON PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ARE

RECORDED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUBSTANTIAL THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

IF MARKET EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007,

WE RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION OF SUCH GAINS AS A

RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 157.

SFAS NO. 158.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND

132-R. SFAS NO. 158 REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO

RECOGNIZE IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION THE FUNDED

STATUS OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS,

MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN

ASSETS AND THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION. SFAS NO. 158 ALSO

REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS OF

A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLAN WITHIN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, TO THE

EXTENT SUCH CHANGES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS COMPONENTS

OF PERIODIC NET BENEFIT COST. SFAS NO. 158 IS

EFFECTIVE AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2006. WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 158 AS OF

THE END OF 2007. THE ADJUSTMENT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF

SFAS NO. 158 WAS $194 MILLION, NET OF TAX.

SFAS NO. 159.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, WHICH GIVES

ENTITIES THE OPTION TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL ASSETS,

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS AT FAIR VALUE (I.E.,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION), ON AN

INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT

BASIS, THAT ARE OTHERWISE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER

OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THE ELECTION TO USE THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION IS AVAILABLE AT SPECIFIED ELECTION DATES, SUCH AS WHEN AN

ENTITY FIRST RECOGNIZES A FINANCIAL ASSET OR FINANCIAL LIABILITY

OR UPON ENTERING INTO A FIRM COMMITMENT. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE MUST BE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. ADDITIONALLY,

SFAS NO. 159 ALLOWS FOR A ONE-TIME ELECTION FOR

EXISTING POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION, WITH THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT

RECORDED TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS.

WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 159 AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2007

AND ELECTED TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO THE FOLLOWING

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THE TIME OF

ADOPTION.



CERTAIN UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, CONSISTING OF ALL

PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER;



CERTAIN OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS, PRIMARILY TRANSFERS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS FINANCINGS RATHER THAN SALES UNDER SFAS NO. 140

AND DEBT RAISED THROUGH OUR WILLIAM STREET PROGRAM;



CERTAIN UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING PREPAID

PHYSICAL COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS;



RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS;



SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, CONSISTING OF OUR MATCHED BOOK AND CERTAIN FIRM

FINANCING ACTIVITIES;



SECURITIES HELD BY GS BANK USA, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED

FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE; AND



RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ARISING FROM

TRANSFERS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED LOANS RATHER THAN PURCHASES

UNDER SFAS NO. 140.

THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS RELATED

TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 159 WAS A LOSS OF

$45 MILLION, NET OF TAX, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH RELATED

TO APPLYING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO PREPAID PHYSICAL COMMODITY

TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 159, WE HAVE

ELECTED TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION (I) TO NEW POSITIONS

WITHIN THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, (II) TO CORPORATE LOANS,

CORPORATE LOAN COMMITMENTS AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT ISSUED BY

GS BANK USA AND (III) GENERALLY TO INVESTMENTS WHERE WE

WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. IN

CERTAIN CASES, WE MAY CONTINUE TO APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING TO THOSE INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR

CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHERE WE

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH FLOWS OR

OPERATIONS OF THE INVESTEE, AND/OR WHERE COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT.

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE

MITIGATING VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING DIFFERENT

MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES, SIMPLIFICATION AND COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS.

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE SUPERVISION

OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

AS OF THE END OF THE FIRMS 2007 FISCAL YEAR, MANAGEMENT

CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS

ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

NOVEMBER 30, 2007 WAS EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT,

IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS

AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT

AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

NOVEMBER 30, 2007 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON

PAGE 108, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2007.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC..

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT NOVEMBER 30, 2007 AND

NOVEMBER 24, 2006, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND

ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE FISCAL YEARS IN THE PERIOD

ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2007 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2007, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING ON

PAGE 107. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE,

AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR

AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A

MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN

AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE

ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND SFAS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTE 2.

SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

GROUP INC. AND ALL OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS

A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) OR A

QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITY (QSPE) UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.



VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES

ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT

RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS

ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE

THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES, THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE RESIDUAL

RETURNS AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE ENTITYS

ACTIVITIES. VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 51,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED. ARB

NO. 51 STATES THAT THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A

MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS A MAJORITY VOTING

INTEREST.



VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT

LACK ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST

ENTITY. A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE IS PRESENT

WHEN AN ENTERPRISE HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST, OR A COMBINATION OF

VARIABLE INTERESTS, THAT WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE

114

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

VIES EXPECTED LOSSES, RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VIES

EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. THE ENTERPRISE WITH A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY, CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION (FIN)

NO. 46-R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, THE

FIRM CONSOLIDATES VIES FOR WHICH IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A

VIE BY FIRST PERFORMING A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VIE THAT

INCLUDES A REVIEW OF, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ITS CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL TERMS, WHICH INTERESTS CREATE OR ABSORB

VARIABILITY, RELATED PARTY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DESIGN OF THE

VIE. WHERE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE FIRM

PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING A

VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS TO ITS

VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, THE FIRM UTILIZES THE TOP

DOWN METHOD. UNDER THAT METHOD, THE FIRM CALCULATES ITS

SHARE OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL

RETURNS USING THE SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO

IT, BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

AND/OR

THE

FIRMS POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE VIE, UNDER

VARIOUS PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED SCENARIOS.



QSPES.

QSPES ARE PASSIVE ENTITIES THAT ARE COMMONLY

USED IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 140,

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES, SETS FORTH THE

CRITERIA AN ENTITY MUST SATISFY TO BE A QSPE. THESE CRITERIA

INCLUDE THE TYPES OF ASSETS A QSPE MAY HOLD, LIMITS ON ASSET

SALES, THE USE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, AND THE

LEVEL OF DISCRETION A SERVICER MAY EXERCISE IN ATTEMPTING TO

COLLECT RECEIVABLES. THESE CRITERIA MAY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT COMPLEX MATTERS, INCLUDING WHETHER A

DERIVATIVE IS CONSIDERED PASSIVE AND THE DEGREE OF DISCRETION A

SERVICER MAY EXERCISE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 140

AND

FIN NO. 46-R,

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE QSPES.



EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT

HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT EXERTS

SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING AND

FINANCIAL POLICIES (GENERALLY DEFINED AS OWNING A VOTING

INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%) AND HAS AN INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OR

IN-SUBSTANCE

COMMON STOCK, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18, THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK. FOR

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY OR

APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ALSO HAS FORMED NUMEROUS

NONCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS THAT

ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE FIRM ACTS

AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR THESE FUNDS AND GENERALLY DOES NOT HOLD A

MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THESE FUNDS. THE FIRM HAS

GENERALLY PROVIDED THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS WITH RIGHTS TO

TERMINATE THE FUNDS OR TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS THE GENERAL

PARTNER. THESE FUND INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT

REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL

LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND OTHER ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

ARE COMPLETED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ENGAGEMENT. EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE RELATED

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OR THE ENGAGEMENT IS OTHERWISE CONCLUDED.

UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE PRESENTED NET OF RELATED EXPENSES.

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS ARE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

TOTAL FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE ARE

REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

ON A TRADE-DATE BASIS. RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT

WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (THE EXIT PRICE). INSTRUMENTS THAT THE

FIRM OWNS (LONG POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES, AND

INSTRUMENTS THAT THE FIRM HAS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT

POSITIONS), ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ARE NOT ADJUSTED FOR TRANSACTION COSTS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2007.

SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY THAT

PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE

FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS

OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST

PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). THE

THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY UNDER

SFAS NO. 157 ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

BASIS OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT

LEVEL 1

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2

QUOTED PRICES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE OR FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE,

EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY;

LEVEL 3

PRICES OR VALUATIONS THAT REQUIRE INPUTS THAT ARE BOTH

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND UNOBSERVABLE.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. SEE

 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 157.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM SEPARATES ITS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND ITS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR

VALUE INTO TWO CATEGORIES: CASH INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS.



CASH INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRMS CASH INSTRUMENTS

ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BECAUSE THEY ARE VALUED USING QUOTED

MARKET PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDE MOST U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY

SECURITIES, MANY OTHER SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVE

LISTED EQUITIES AND MOST MONEY MARKET SECURITIES. SUCH

INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. THE FIRM DOES NOT ADJUST THE QUOTED PRICE

FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS, EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE FIRM HOLDS A

LARGE POSITION AND A SALE COULD REASONABLY IMPACT THE QUOTED

PRICE.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR

ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY INCLUDE MOST INVESTMENT-GRADE AND HIGH-YIELD

CORPORATE BONDS, MOST MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, CERTAIN CORPORATE BANK

AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL

AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS, MOST PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND

CERTAIN LOAN COMMITMENTS. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BECAUSE THEY TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND

THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUND INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN

CORPORATE BANK AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS LIQUID MORTGAGE WHOLE

LOANS, DISTRESSED DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN LOAN COMMITMENTS.

THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF

FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE

SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL

VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION PRICE. THIS VALUATION

IS ADJUSTED ONLY WHEN CHANGES TO INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED OR PENDING

THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OR COMPARABLE

ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN

THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL

RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS OR ARE

SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT ILLIQUIDITY

AND/OR

NON-TRANSFERABILITY, AND SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

AVAILABLE MARKET EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE,

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.



DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CAN BE

EXCHANGE-TRADED OR OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC). EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES TYPICALLY FALL WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2

OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY ARE DEEMED

TO BE ACTIVELY TRADED OR NOT. THE FIRM GENERALLY VALUES

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES WITHIN PORTFOLIOS USING MODELS WHICH

CALIBRATE TO MARKET CLEARING LEVELS AND ELIMINATE TIMING

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES AND THEIR UNDERLYING CASH INSTRUMENTS. IN SUCH

CASES,

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY.

OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

MARKET EVIDENCE WHENEVER POSSIBLE, INCLUDING MARKET-BASED INPUTS

TO MODELS, MODEL CALIBRATION TO MARKET CLEARING TRANSACTIONS,

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH

REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. WHERE MODELS ARE USED,

THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE

DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF, AND SPECIFIC RISKS

INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF

PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. THE FIRM GENERALLY

117

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

USES SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. VALUATION

MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS,

MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF

VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS.

FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS

GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL INPUTS CAN GENERALLY

BE VERIFIED AND MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WITH

LIMITED PRICING INFORMATION, AND THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

FOR THESE DERIVATIVES IS INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT. SUCH

INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY. WHERE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE CORROBORATING MARKET

EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS AND CANNOT VERIFY

THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY

USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A

PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS

ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE

TRANSACTION PRICE. THE VALUATIONS OF THESE LESS LIQUID OTC

DERIVATIVES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON LEVEL 1

AND/OR

LEVEL 2 INPUTS THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE MARKET, AS WELL

AS UNOBSERVABLE LEVEL 3 INPUTS. SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL

RECOGNITION, THE FIRM UPDATES THE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2

INPUTS TO REFLECT OBSERVABLE MARKET CHANGES, WITH RESULTING

GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED WITHIN LEVEL 3. LEVEL 3

INPUTS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS

SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES

AND/OR

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL VALUE TO

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION

MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE.

WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED FOR VARIOUS FACTORS

SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET

EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND

FINANCINGS.

COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS CONSIST OF RESALE

AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED. COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS

CONSIST OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LOANED AND OTHER

SECURED FINANCINGS. INTEREST ON COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS IS RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST

INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY, OVER

THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION.



RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, PRINCIPALLY

U.S. GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL AGENCY AND INVESTMENT-GRADE

SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS, REPRESENT COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM RECEIVES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED

UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL, MAKES DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, MONITORS THE

MARKET VALUE OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON A DAILY BASIS AND

DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AS APPROPRIATE. RESALE

AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE CARRIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT FAIR VALUE AS ALLOWED BY

SFAS NO. 159. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 159, THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE RECORDED AT

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. RESALE AND REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY VALUED BASED ON INPUTS WITH REASONABLE

LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY AND ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. RESALE AND REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS ARE PRESENTED ON A

NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY

BASIS WHEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF FIN NO. 41,

OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND

REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OR FIN NO. 39,

OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS,

ARE SATISFIED.



SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED.

SECURITIES BORROWED

AND LOANED ARE GENERALLY COLLATERALIZED BY CASH, SECURITIES OR

LETTERS OF CREDIT. THE FIRM RECEIVES SECURITIES BORROWED, MAKES

DELIVERY OF SECURITIES LOANED, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF

SECURITIES BORROWED AND

118

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

LOANED, AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AS

APPROPRIATE. SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN SECURITIES

SERVICES, RELATING TO BOTH CUSTOMER ACTIVITIES AND, TO A LESSER

EXTENT, CERTAIN FIRM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, ARE RECORDED BASED ON

THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED

INTEREST. AS THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY TRANSACTED

ON-DEMAND, THEY EXHIBIT LITTLE, IF ANY, SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES

IN INTEREST RATES. SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE FIRMS

MATCHED BOOK AND CERTAIN FIRM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE AS ALLOWED BY SFAS NO. 159. PRIOR TO THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 159, THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE

RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR

RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. THESE SECURITIES BORROWED AND

LOANED TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY VALUED BASED ON INPUTS WITH

REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY AND ARE CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.



OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS.

IN ADDITION TO REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LOANED, THE FIRM FUNDS ASSETS THROUGH

THE USE OF OTHER SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PLEDGES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS AS COLLATERAL IN THESE

TRANSACTIONS. SFAS NO. 159 HAS BEEN ADOPTED FOR THOSE

FINANCINGS FOR WHICH THE USE OF FAIR VALUE WOULD ELIMINATE

NON-ECONOMIC

VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT

ATTRIBUTES (I.E., ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH RELATED

NONRECOURSE FINANCINGS RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH

RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST), PRIMARILY TRANSFERS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS FINANCINGS RATHER THAN SALES UNDER SFAS NO. 140

AND DEBT RAISED THROUGH THE FIRMS WILLIAM STREET PROGRAM.

THESE OTHER SECURED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY VALUED

BASED ON INPUTS WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY AND

ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ARE

RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED

INTEREST. SEE NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS.

HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN BIFURCATABLE EMBEDDED

DERIVATIVES UNDER SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND DO NOT

REQUIRE SETTLEMENT BY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

(E.G., PHYSICAL COMMODITIES). IF THE FIRM ELECTS TO BIFURCATE

THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE, IT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND

THE HOST CONTRACT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT AMORTIZED COST, ADJUSTED

FOR THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING

RELATIONSHIPS. IF THE FIRM DOES NOT ELECT TO BIFURCATE, THE

ENTIRE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE UNDER SFAS NO. 155, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN

HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS

NO. 133 AND 140. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR ELECTING THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

MITIGATING VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING DIFFERENT

MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES, SIMPLIFICATION AND COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS. SEE NOTES 3 AND 4 FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS.

IN GENERAL, TRANSFERS

OF FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES UNDER

SFAS NO. 140 WHEN THE FIRM HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL

OVER THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. FOR TRANSFERS ACCOUNTED FOR AS

SALES, ANY RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET

REVENUES. TRANSFERS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, WITH THE RELATED

INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES OVER THE LIFE OF THE

TRANSACTION.

POWER GENERATION.

POWER GENERATION REVENUES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS

WHEN POWER IS DELIVERED. THESE REVENUES WERE $421 MILLION,

$553 MILLION AND $496 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED

NOVEMBER 2007, NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

DIRECT EMPLOYEE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED POWER GENERATION FACILITIES OF $97 MILLION,

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES.

REVENUES FROM VARIABLE ANNUITY

AND LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS, AND FROM PROVIDING REINSURANCE OF

SUCH CONTRACTS, GENERALLY CONSIST OF FEES ASSESSED ON CONTRACT

HOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES FOR MORTALITY CHARGES, POLICY

ADMINISTRATION AND SURRENDER CHARGES. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED

WITHIN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THAT SERVICES

ARE PROVIDED.

INTEREST CREDITED TO VARIABLE ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE ACCOUNT

BALANCES AND CHANGES IN RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER

EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

PREMIUMS EARNED FOR PROVIDING PROPERTY CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

ARE RECOGNIZED WITHIN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS

OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD, NET OF PREMIUMS CEDED FOR THE COST OF

REINSURANCE. EXPENSES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO PROPERTY

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE CLAIMS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS

THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED, ARE RECOGNIZED WITHIN

OTHER EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS.

MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES.

THE FIRM IS ENTITLED TO

RECEIVE MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES (I.E., AN INCREASED SHARE OF

A FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS) WHEN THE RETURN ON THE

FUNDS INVESTMENTS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS.

OVERRIDES ARE BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE LIFE OF

EACH MERCHANT BANKING FUND, AND FUTURE INVESTMENT

UNDERPERFORMANCE MAY REQUIRE AMOUNTS OF OVERRIDE PREVIOUSLY

DISTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM TO BE RETURNED TO THE FUNDS.

ACCORDINGLY, OVERRIDES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS ONLY WHEN ALL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES HAVE

BEEN RESOLVED. OVERRIDES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT.

MANAGEMENT FEES ARE RECOGNIZED

OVER THE PERIOD THAT THE RELATED SERVICE IS PROVIDED BASED UPON

AVERAGE NET ASSET VALUES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM IS

ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF

A FUNDS RETURN OR WHEN THE RETURN ON ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT EXCEEDS SPECIFIED BENCHMARK RETURNS OR OTHER

PERFORMANCE TARGETS. INCENTIVE FEES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER A

12-MONTH

PERIOD AND ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE

MEASUREMENT PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WHEN THE MEASUREMENT

PERIOD ENDS. ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES ARE

INCLUDED IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE FIRM ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 123-R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, WHICH IS A REVISION TO

SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION.

SFAS NO. 123-R

FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN

ENTITY OBTAINS EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARE-BASED

PAYMENTS. UNDER

SFAS NO. 123-R,

THE COST OF EMPLOYEE SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR A

SHARE-BASED AWARD IS GENERALLY MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE

FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD. UNDER

SFAS NO. 123-R,

SHARE-BASED AWARDS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE (I.E.,

VESTED AWARDS, INCLUDING AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES) ARE EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY. SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE AWARDS

THAT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE RELEVANT

SERVICE PERIOD. THE FIRM ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 123-R

UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION METHOD. UNDER THAT

METHOD OF ADOPTION, THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 123-R

SFAS NO. 123-R

REQUIRES EXPECTED FORFEITURES TO BE INCLUDED IN DETERMINING

SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

THE FIRM PAYS CASH DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS ON OUTSTANDING

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123 AND

SFAS NO. 123-R

ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

SFAS NO. 123-R

REQUIRES DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED TO BE INCLUDED IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 123-R,

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT WERE

LATER FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FROM RETAINED EARNINGS. THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE (SEE

 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS FOR A

DISCUSSION OF EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO. 06-11,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF DIVIDENDS ON

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS).

IN CERTAIN CASES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DEATH OF AN EMPLOYEE

OR CONFLICTED EMPLOYMENT (AS OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE AWARD

AGREEMENTS), THE FIRM MAY CASH SETTLE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS. FOR AWARDS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY INSTRUMENTS,

ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL IS ADJUSTED TO THE EXTENT

OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE AWARD AND THE

GRANT-DATE VALUE OF THE AWARD.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR

VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS AT ACQUISITION DATE. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL IS TESTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY

FOR IMPAIRMENT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS TRIGGERED IF THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH IS A COMPONENT ONE

LEVEL BELOW THE FIRMS THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IS LESS

THAN ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. SUCH LOSS IS CALCULATED AS

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND

ITS CARRYING VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

CUSTOMER LISTS, SPECIALIST RIGHTS AND THE VALUE OF BUSINESS

ACQUIRED (VOBA) AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS (DAC) IN THE

FIRMS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 142. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

TESTED FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS

CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS,

CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED

IF THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO

THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING

VALUE.

PROPERTY,

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, NET OF

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

FIN NO. 48.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED

FIN NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 109. FIN NO. 48 REQUIRES THAT THE FIRM

DETERMINE WHETHER A TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE

SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED

APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS

OF THE POSITION. ONCE IT IS DETERMINED THAT A POSITION MEETS

THIS RECOGNITION THRESHOLD, THE POSITION IS MEASURED TO

DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FIRM WILL ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF

FIN NO. 48 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. ADOPTION OF

FIN NO. 48 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH

FLOWS.

SFAS NO. 157.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 CLARIFIES THAT FAIR

VALUE IS AN EXIT PRICE, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE

RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. UNDER

SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT ADJUSTED

FOR TRANSACTION COSTS.

SFAS NO. 157 NULLIFIES THE GUIDANCE INCLUDED IN EITF

ISSUE

NO. 02-3,

ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY

TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, THAT PROHIBITED

THE RECOGNITION OF A DAY ONE GAIN OR LOSS ON DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS (AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE UNDER SFAS NO. 155) WHERE THE FIRM WAS UNABLE TO

VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA

AND/OR

VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. HOWEVER,

SFAS NO. 157 REQUIRES THAT A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

REFLECT THE ASSUMPTIONS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING

AN ASSET OR LIABILITY BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR VALUATION

TECHNIQUE (SUCH AS A PRICING MODEL)

AND/OR

THE

RISKS INHERENT IN THE INPUTS TO THE MODEL.

IN ADDITION, SFAS NO. 157 PROHIBITS THE RECOGNITION OF

BLOCK DISCOUNTS FOR LARGE HOLDINGS OF UNRESTRICTED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE QUOTED PRICES ARE READILY AND

REGULARLY AVAILABLE FOR AN IDENTICAL ASSET OR LIABILITY IN AN

ACTIVE MARKET.

THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 157 ARE TO BE APPLIED

PROSPECTIVELY, EXCEPT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS THAT

RESULT FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 157 TO

EXISTING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED UNDER EITF

ISSUE

NO. 02-3,

EXISTING HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AND

BLOCK DISCOUNTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE TO BE RECORDED AS AN

ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE YEAR OF

ADOPTION.

THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS NO. 157 AS OF THE BEGINNING OF

2007. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS

WAS A GAIN OF $51 MILLION, NET OF TAX. FOR THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2007, THE EFFECT OF THE NULLIFICATION OF EITF ISSUE

NO. 02-3

AND THE REMOVAL OF LIQUIDITY DISCOUNTS FOR ACTIVELY TRADED

POSITIONS WAS NOT MATERIAL. IN ADDITION, UNDER

SFAS NO. 157, GAINS ON PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ARE

RECORDED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUBSTANTIAL THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

IF MARKET EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007,

THE FIRM RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION OF SUCH GAINS

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 157.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND

132-R. SFAS NO. 158 REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO

RECOGNIZE IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION THE FUNDED

STATUS OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS,

MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN

ASSETS AND THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION. SFAS NO. 158 ALSO

REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS OF

A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLAN WITHIN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, TO THE

EXTENT SUCH CHANGES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS COMPONENTS

OF PERIODIC NET BENEFIT COST. SFAS NO. 158 IS

EFFECTIVE AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2006. THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS NO. 158

AS OF THE END OF 2007. THE ADJUSTMENT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF

SFAS NO. 158 WAS $194 MILLION, NET OF TAX.

SFAS NO. 159.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, WHICH GIVES

ENTITIES THE OPTION TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL ASSETS,

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS AT FAIR VALUE (I.E.,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION), ON AN

INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT

BASIS, THAT ARE OTHERWISE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER

OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THE ELECTION TO USE THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION IS AVAILABLE AT SPECIFIED ELECTION DATES, SUCH AS WHEN AN

ENTITY FIRST RECOGNIZES A FINANCIAL ASSET OR FINANCIAL LIABILITY

OR UPON ENTERING INTO A FIRM COMMITMENT. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE MUST BE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. ADDITIONALLY,

SFAS NO. 159 ALLOWS FOR A ONE-TIME ELECTION FOR

EXISTING POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION, WITH THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT

RECORDED TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS NO. 159 AS OF THE BEGINNING OF

2007 AND ELECTED TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO THE FOLLOWING

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THE TIME OF

ADOPTION.



CERTAIN UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, CONSISTING OF ALL

PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER;



CERTAIN OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS, PRIMARILY TRANSFERS ACCOUNTED

UNDER SFAS NO. 140.

THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS RELATED

TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 159 WAS A LOSS OF

$45 MILLION, NET OF TAX, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH RELATED

TO APPLYING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO PREPAID PHYSICAL COMMODITY

TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 159, THE FIRM

HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION (I) TO NEW

POSITIONS WITHIN THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, (II) TO CORPORATE

LOANS, CORPORATE LOAN COMMITMENTS AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT

ISSUED BY GS BANK USA AND (III) GENERALLY TO INVESTMENTS

WHERE THE FIRM WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM MAY CONTINUE TO APPLY THE

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO THOSE INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE

STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR CLOSELY RELATED TO THE FIRMS

PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHERE THE FIRM HAS A SIGNIFICANT

DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH FLOWS OR OPERATIONS OF THE

INVESTEE,

THE NET UNREALIZED LOSS ON LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS WAS

$2.59 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2007 (WHICH

INCLUDED $2.29 BILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES ON ASSETS AND

$294 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES ON LIABILITIES),

PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF UNREALIZED LOSSES ON SUBPRIME

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES AS WELL AS

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE LOAN COMMITMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

UNREALIZED GAINS ON PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. LEVEL 3 CASH

INSTRUMENTS ARE FREQUENTLY HEDGED WITH INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN

THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN LEVEL 3 ARE FREQUENTLY OFFSET BY

GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN

LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 OR BY GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS

THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN ON LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WAS

$4.54 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2007.

LEVEL 3 GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS SHOULD BE

CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.



A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2

INPUTS IS CLASSIFIED AS A LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IN

ITS ENTIRETY IF IT HAS AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3

INPUT.



IF THERE IS ONE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUT, THE ENTIRE GAIN

OR LOSS FROM ADJUSTING ONLY OBSERVABLE INPUTS (I.E.,

LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2) IS STILL CLASSIFIED AS

LEVEL 3.



GAINS OR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN LEVEL 3

RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS

ARE FREQUENTLY OFFSET BY GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO

INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 OR BY

CASH INSTRUMENTS REPORTED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY.

THE UNREALIZED GAINS REFERENCED ABOVE PRINCIPALLY RESULTED FROM

CHANGES IN LEVEL 2 INPUTS, AS OPPOSED TO CHANGES IN

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

RECEIVABLES (INCLUDING SECURITIES BORROWED AND RESALE

AGREEMENTS) FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED THAT

WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT

SPREADS WERE NOT MATERIAL. DURING 2007, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED

GAINS OF $216 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OBSERVABLE IMPACT

OF THE MARKETS WIDENING OF THE FIRMS OWN CREDIT

SPREAD ON LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS

ELECTED. THE FIRM CALCULATES THE IMPACT OF ITS OWN CREDIT SPREAD

ON LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE BY DISCOUNTING FUTURE CASH

FLOWS AT A RATE WHICH INCORPORATES THE FIRMS OBSERVABLE

CREDIT SPREADS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

FAIR VALUE AND THE AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

BOTH LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES AND LONG-TERM DEBT INSTRUMENTS

(PRINCIPAL AND NON-PRINCIPAL PROTECTED) FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS NOT MATERIAL.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE GAINS AND (LOSSES) INCLUDED

IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2007 RELATED TO

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS ELECTED

TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION UNDER SFAS NO. 155 AND

SFAS NO. 159. THE TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE IMPACT TO

THE FIRMS EARNINGS OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 159

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THESE GAINS AND LOSSES WOULD

HAVE ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED UNDER PREVIOUSLY ISSUED GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IN ADDITION, INSTRUMENTS FOR

WHICH THE FIRM HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE

CREDIT

CONCENTRATIONS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS MAY ARISE FROM TRADING, INVESTING,

UNDERWRITING AND SECURITIES BORROWING ACTIVITIES AND MAY BE

IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL FACTORS.

THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK BY ACTIVELY MONITORING

EXPOSURES AND OBTAINING COLLATERAL AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. WHILE

THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES EXPOSE IT TO MANY DIFFERENT

INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES A

HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS,

RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO

THIS INDUSTRY. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM MAY

ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A

PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER OR ISSUER.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, THE FIRM HELD

$45.75 BILLION (4% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND $46.20 BILLION

(6% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY

THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION AND THE FEDERAL HOME

LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION) INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND CASH AND

SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, THE FIRM HELD

$31.65 BILLION (3% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND $23.64 BILLION

(3% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF OTHER SOVEREIGN

OBLIGATIONS, PRINCIPALLY CONSISTING OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE

GOVERNMENTS OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN ADDITION, AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, $144.92 BILLION AND

$104.76 BILLION OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL

AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND 2006,

$41.26 BILLION AND $38.22 BILLION OF THE FIRMS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND

SECURITIES BORROWED, RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLATERALIZED BY OTHER

SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006,

THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY

THAT EXCEEDED 2% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS.

DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES MAY INVOLVE FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR COMMODITIES, OR TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY OR

INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE

SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED

RATES, SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES,

INTEREST-ONLY AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY OBLIGATIONS, AND INDEXED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES EVEN THOUGH THEIR

VALUES OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED CASH FLOWS ARE DERIVED FROM THE

PRICE OF SOME OTHER SECURITY OR INDEX. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

COMMODITY-RELATED CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURE, AS THESE CONTRACTS MAY BE SETTLED IN

CASH OR THE ASSETS TO BE DELIVERED UNDER THE CONTRACT ARE

READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS AND AS A

MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. RISK EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED THROUGH

DIVERSIFICATION, BY CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND BY ENTERING

INTO OFFSETTING POSITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAY MANAGE THE

RISK RELATED TO A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCK BY ENTERING INTO AN

OFFSETTING POSITION IN A RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS NO. 133

TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FIRM USES THESE DERIVATIVES

TO MANAGE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURES,

INCLUDING THE FIRMS NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS. THE FIRM DESIGNATES CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONTRACTS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONTRACTS HEDGE CHANGES IN THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE

(E.G., LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR)), EFFECTIVELY

CONVERTING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FIRMS UNSECURED

LONG-TERM AND CERTAIN UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS INTO

FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 2 FOR INFORMATION

REGARDING THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM APPLIES A LONG-HAUL METHOD TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS

HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS TO PERFORM AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS IN ACHIEVING

OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR OFFSETTING CASH FLOWS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE FIRM UTILIZES A

DOLLAR-OFFSET METHOD, WHICH COMPARES THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE HEDGED ITEM, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME,

TO PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS.

THE FIRMS PROSPECTIVE DOLLAR-OFFSET ASSESSMENT UTILIZES

SCENARIO ANALYSES TO TEST HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS VIA SIMULATIONS OF

NUMEROUS PARALLEL AND SLOPE SHIFTS OF THE RELEVANT YIELD CURVE.

PARALLEL SHIFTS CHANGE THE INTEREST RATE OF ALL MATURITIES BY

IDENTICAL AMOUNTS. SLOPE SHIFTS CHANGE THE CURVATURE OF THE

YIELD CURVE. FOR BOTH THE PROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, IN RESPONSE TO

EACH OF THE SIMULATED YIELD CURVE SHIFTS, AND THE RETROSPECTIVE

ASSESSMENT, A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS DEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IF

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM

CHANGE INVERSELY WITHIN A RANGE OF 80% TO 125%.

FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED

IS REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AND IS

SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER ITS REMAINING

LIFE. GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS FOR ALL

HEDGES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.

THESE GAINS OR LOSSES AND THE COMPONENT OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS (E.G., THE EFFECT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME ON FAIR

VALUE HEDGES OF THE FIRMS BORROWINGS) WERE NOT MATERIAL TO

THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED

NOVEMBER 2007, NOVEMBER 2006 AND NOVEMBER 2005.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES USED FOR TRADING PURPOSES ARE

INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IS

REFLECTED NET OF CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT

SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND IS REPORTED ON A

NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY

BASIS IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME

EQUITY AND AUTO LOANS, GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE BONDS AND OTHER

TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE FIRM ACTS AS UNDERWRITER OF THE

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INVESTORS. THE FIRM

DERECOGNIZES FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED IN SECURITIZATIONS

PROVIDED IT HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER SUCH ASSETS.

TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE PRIOR TO

SECURITIZATION. NET REVENUES RELATED TO THESE UNDERWRITING

ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF THE

UNDERLYING BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO INVESTORS.

THE FIRM MAY RETAIN INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS,

PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED SECURITIES,

INCLUDING RESIDUAL INTERESTS. RETAINED INTERESTS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2007, THE FIRM SECURITIZED

$81.40 BILLION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS ($24.95 BILLION OF

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, $19.50 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGES AND $36.95 BILLION OF OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS,

PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH COLLATERALIZED DEBT AND LOAN

OBLIGATIONS (CDOS AND CLOS)). DURING THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER

SERVICING RIGHTS WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $93 MILLION AND

$62 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WERE

RETAINED IN CONNECTION WITH RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

SECURITIZATIONS. THESE SERVICING ASSETS REPRESENT THE

FIRMS RIGHT TO RECEIVE A FUTURE STREAM OF CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS OBLIGATION TO SERVICE

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. THE FAIR VALUE OF MORTGAGE SERVICING

RIGHTS WILL FLUCTUATE IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN CERTAIN ECONOMIC

VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, LOAN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS

VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES)

THE FIRM, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, RETAINS INTERESTS

IN VIES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. THE

FIRM ALSO PURCHASES AND SELLS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES, WHICH

PRIMARILY ISSUE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES, CDOS AND CLOS, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES AND MAKES INVESTMENTS IN AND LOANS TO VIES THAT HOLD

PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL ESTATE,

POWER-RELATED AND OTHER ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM UTILIZES

VIES TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTES,

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES AND ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES DESIGNED TO MEET

THEIR OBJECTIVES.

VIES GENERALLY PURCHASE ASSETS BY ISSUING DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE FIRM PROVIDES GUARANTEES

TO VIES OR HOLDERS OF VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES. IN SUCH CASES,

THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS INCLUDED IN THE TABLES SET FORTH

BELOW IS THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF SUCH GUARANTEES. SUCH AMOUNTS DO

NOT REPRESENT ANTICIPATED LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

GUARANTEES.

THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES INCLUDE SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED DEBT; LOAN COMMITMENTS; LIMITED AND GENERAL

PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK; INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY, COMMODITY AND CREDIT

DERIVATIVES; GUARANTEES; AND RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN

EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. THESE

PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE BENEFITS BASED ON YEARS OF CREDITED

SERVICE AND A PERCENTAGE OF THE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION. THE FIRM MAINTAINS A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.K. EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO CLOSE

THE U.K. PENSION PLAN TO NEW PARTICIPANTS DURING THE FIRST HALF

OF 2008, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE BENEFITS FOR EXISTING

PARTICIPANTS.

THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO

NOVEMBER 1, 2003. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, THIS PLAN HAS BEEN

CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS AND NO FURTHER BENEFITS WILL BE

ACCRUED TO EXISTING PARTICIPANTS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS

UNFUNDED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND

LIFE INSURANCE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS

ON NOVEMBER 30, 2007, THE FIRM ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 158 WHICH REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE IN

ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION THE FUNDED STATUS OF ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, MEASURED AS

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS AND THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION. UPON ADOPTION, SFAS NO. 158

REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED

ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS, AND TRANSITION

OBLIGATIONS AND ASSETS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. ADDITIONAL MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITIES ARE DERECOGNIZED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW

STANDARD.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 158, THE FIRM

RECORDED INCREASES OF $59 MILLION AND $253 MILLION TO

OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED

GENERALLY, THE FIRM DETERMINED THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS BY REFERENCING INDICES FOR LONG-TERM,

HIGH-QUALITY BONDS AND ENSURING THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE DOES NOT

EXCEED THE YIELD REPORTED FOR THOSE INDICES AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR

THE DURATION OF THE PLANS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH IN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL FINANCIAL MARKET

RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE EXISTED OVER TIME WITH THE PRESUMPTION

THAT THIS TREND WILL GENERALLY REMAIN CONSTANT IN THE FUTURE.

FOR MEASUREMENT PURPOSES, AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN THE PER

CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS OF 10.02% WAS ASSUMED

FOR THE YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2008. THE RATE WAS ASSUMED TO

DECREASE RATABLY TO 5.00% FOR THE YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2015 AND

REMAIN AT THAT LEVEL THEREAFTER.

THE ASSUMED COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS AN EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS

REPORTED FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. A 1% CHANGE

IN THE ASSUMED HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE WOULD HAVE THE

FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS INVOLVES EMPLOYING A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF

WHILE MAINTAINING REASONABLE PARAMETERS TO ENSURE THAT PRUDENCE

APPROACH, WHEREBY A MIX, WHICH IS BROADLY SIMILAR TO THE ACTUAL

ASSET ALLOCATION AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, OF EQUITY SECURITIES, DEBT

SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS, IS TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE THE

LONG-TERM RETURN ON ASSETS FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF RISK. INVESTMENT

INCENTIVE PLAN

THE FIRM SPONSORS A STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, THE GOLDMAN SACHS

AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE AMENDED SIP),

WHICH PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS,

NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, DIVIDEND

EQUIVALENT RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS,

AWARDS WITH PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED AWARDS.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE AMENDED SIP WAS APPROVED BY

THE FIRMS SHAREHOLDERS, EFFECTIVE FOR GRANTS AFTER

APRIL 1, 2003.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED

UNDER THE AMENDED SIP THROUGH 2008 MAY NOT EXCEED

250 MILLION SHARES AND, IN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER, MAY NOT

EXCEED 5% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK,

DETERMINED AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING YEAR,

INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS IN

PREVIOUS YEARS BUT NOT COVERED BY AWARDS GRANTED IN SUCH YEARS.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, 160.6 MILLION AND

180.0 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE AVAILABLE FOR

GRANT UNDER THE AMENDED SIP.

OTHER

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

THE FIRM HAS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES.

IN GENERAL, UNDER THE PLANS, PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO DEFER

PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THEIR CASH YEAR-END COMPENSATION. DURING

THE DEFERRAL PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO NOMINALLY INVEST

THEIR DEFERRALS IN CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE UNDER THE

PLANS. GENERALLY, UNDER CURRENT TAX LAW, PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX ON AMOUNTS DEFERRED OR ON ANY NOTIONAL

INVESTMENT EARNINGS UNTIL THE RETURNS ARE DISTRIBUTED, AND THE

FIRM IS NOT ENTITLED TO A CORRESPONDING TAX DEDUCTION UNTIL THE

AMOUNTS ARE DISTRIBUTED. THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR THE AMOUNTS DEFERRED UNDER THESE PLANS. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006, $281 MILLION AND

$245 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE PLANS WAS

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE FIRM HAS A DISCOUNT STOCK PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH ELIGIBLE

SENIOR EXECUTIVES MAY ACQUIRE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT AN

EFFECTIVE 25% DISCOUNT. THE 25% DISCOUNT IS EFFECTED BY AN

ADDITIONAL GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF

THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS PURCHASED BY QUALIFYING

PARTICIPANTS. THE PURCHASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE 100%

VESTED WHEN GRANTED, BUT THE SHARES UNDERLYING THEM ARE NOT ABLE

TO BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED (OTHER THAN TO SATISFY TAX

OBLIGATIONS) BEFORE THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. THE

SHARES UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT ARE GRANTED IN

ORDER TO EFFECT THE 25% DISCOUNT WILL GENERALLY VEST IN EQUAL

INSTALLMENTS ON THE SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES FOLLOWING THE

GRANT DATE AND WILL NOT BE TRANSFERABLE BEFORE THE THIRD

ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO

THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING

PERIOD. THE TOTAL VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED IN

2007 AND 2006 IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE 25% DISCOUNT WAS

$66 MILLION AND $72 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS

THE FIRM ISSUED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE

AMENDED SIP, PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH YEAR-END COMPENSATION

AND ACQUISITIONS. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE VALUED BASED ON THE

CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES AT THE DATE OF GRANT.

YEAR-END RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GENERALLY VEST AS OUTLINED IN

THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENTS AND DELIVER

SHORTLY AFTER THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. ALL

EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT VESTING

IS ACCELERATED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS UPON

RETIREMENT, DEATH AND EXTENDED ABSENCE. OF THE TOTAL RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS OUTSTANDING AS OF NOVEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2006,

(I) 22.0 MILLION UNITS AND 26.4 MILLION UNITS,

RESPECTIVELY, REQUIRED FUTURE SERVICE AS A CONDITION TO THE

DELIVERY OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND

(II) 51.6 MILLION UNITS AND 38.9 MILLION UNITS,

RESPECTIVELY, DID NOT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE. IN ALL CASES,

DELIVERY OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IS CONDITIONED

ON THE GRANTEES SATISFYING CERTAIN VESTING AND OTHER

REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN THE AWARD AGREEMENTS. WHEN DELIVERING

ATTRIBUTABLE TO REINVESTED EARNINGS OF $4.97 BILLION.

DURING 2007, THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS INCREASED BY

$31 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX

SEGMENTS

IN REPORTING TO MANAGEMENT, THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS

ARE CATEGORIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INVESTMENT BANKING, TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS LINES

HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS.

(I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE,

(II) THEIR METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF

CLIENTS THEY SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS A WHOLE 

COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY  ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES WITHIN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AS WELL AS THE

PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS. CONSEQUENTLY, PRE-TAX

MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES REVENUES AND EXPENSES AMONG THE THREE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF THESE

SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ALLOCATING

CERTAIN REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS

ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE THIRD-PARTY RATES.

TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT HAVE NOT

BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE ALLOCATION

PROCESS IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE

BUSINESS OF THE FIRM.

THE SEGMENT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW IS PREPARED

ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES.



REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE

INCLUDED IN DETERMINING PRE-TAX EARNINGS.



NET REVENUES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS OF

INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE TO SPECIFIC SECURITIES,

COMMODITIES AND OTHER POSITIONS IN RELATION TO THE CASH

GENERATED BY, OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF, SUCH UNDERLYING

POSITIONS. NET INTEREST IS INCLUDED WITHIN SEGMENT NET REVENUES

AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH MANAGEMENT ASSESSES

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE.



OVERHEAD EXPENSES NOT DIRECTLY ALLOCABLE TO SPECIFIC SEGMENTS

CLIENTS, THE METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING THE FIRMS

OF MANAGEMENT.



INVESTMENT BANKING: LOCATION OF THE CLIENT AND INVESTMENT

BANKING TEAM.



FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES, AND EQUITIES: LOCATION

OF THE TRADING DESK.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS: LOCATION OF THE INVESTMENT.



ASSET MANAGEMENT: LOCATION OF THE SALES TEAM.



SECURITIES SERVICES: LOCATION OF THE PRIMARY MARKET FOR THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY.

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (THE PARENT COMPANY), A DELAWARE

CORPORATION, SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND

SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM) AND NOTES THERETO (THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

THESE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS FOR

THE PARENT COMPANY ONLY. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PRESCRIBED

BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18,

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON

STOCK. FOR INVESTMENTS, OTHER THAN INVESTMENTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES, ACQUIRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES, AT THE BEGINNING OF 2007, THE PARENT COMPANY

GENERALLY HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION IN

ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH INVESTMENTS. SEE NOTES 2 AND 3 TO THE

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THESE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING

FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE

PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION

AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND

OTHER ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

THESE ESTIMATES.

FINANCING OF

SUBSIDIARIES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED

BY THE PARENT COMPANY. THE PARENT COMPANY THEN LENDS THE

NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE

REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET FINANCING AND CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES ITS

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. SUCH FUNDING IS INCLUDED IN LOANS

TO SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBORDINATED LOANS TO

SUBSIDIARIES IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. INTERCOMPANY EXPOSURE IS MANAGED BY

REQUIRING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE
