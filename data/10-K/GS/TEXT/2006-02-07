INDUSTRY EXPERTISE. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS AND ADAPT OUR

ORGANIZATION TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR CLIENTS IN EACH GEOGRAPHIC

REGION. THROUGH OUR COMMITMENT TO TEAMWORK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE

PROVIDE SERVICES IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR

CLIENTS.

OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO OUR

CLIENTS THE ENTIRE RESOURCES OF THE FIRM IN A SEAMLESS FASHION,

WITH INVESTMENT BANKING SERVING AS FRONT OF THE HOUSE. TO

ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE, WE FOCUS ON COORDINATION AMONG OUR

EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES AND OUR CORPORATE RISK AND

LIABILITY MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES. THIS COORDINATION IS INTENDED TO

ASSIST OUR INVESTMENT BANKING CLIENTS IN MANAGING THEIR ASSET AND

LIABILITY EXPOSURES.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING SEGMENT IS

DIVIDED INTO TWO COMPONENTS: FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING.

FINANCIAL ADVISORY

FINANCIAL ADVISORY INCLUDES ADVISORY

ASSIGNMENTS WITH RESPECT TO MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES,

CORPORATE DEFENSE ACTIVITIES, RESTRUCTURINGS AND SPIN-OFFS. OUR

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS CAPABILITIES ARE EVIDENCED BY OUR

SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF ASSIGNMENTS IN LARGE, COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS FOR

WHICH WE PROVIDE MULTIPLE SERVICES, INCLUDING ONE-STOP

ACQUISITION FINANCING AND CROSS-BORDER STRUCTURING EXPERTISE, AS

WELL AS SERVICES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE FIRM, SUCH AS INTEREST RATE

AND CURRENCY HEDGING.

UNDERWRITING

UNDERWRITING INCLUDES PUBLIC

DEBT, BANK LOANS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED

SECURITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND THE SECURITIES

OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS.

EQUITY UNDERWRITING.

EQUITY

UNDERWRITING HAS BEEN A LONG-TERM CORE STRENGTH OF GOLDMAN SACHS.

AS WITH MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY

SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING MANDATES FOR LARGE, COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. WE

BELIEVE OUR LEADERSHIP IN WORLDWIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND

WORLDWIDE PUBLIC COMMON STOCK OFFERINGS REFLECTS OUR EXPERTISE IN

COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS, PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND DISTRIBUTION

CAPABILITIES.

DEBT UNDERWRITING.

WE ENGAGE IN THE

UNDERWRITING AND ORIGINATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES, HIGH-YIELD DEBT

SECURITIES, BANK AND BRIDGE LOANS AND EMERGING MARKET DEBT

SECURITIES, WHICH INSTRUMENTS MAY BE ISSUED BY, AMONG OTHERS,

CORPORATE, SOVEREIGN AND AGENCY ISSUERS. IN ADDITION, WE UNDERWRITE

AND ORIGINATE STRUCTURED SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE MORTGAGE-BACKED

AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT

OBLIGATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRADING OF AND INVESTING IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES,

COMMODITIES AND DERIVATIVES ON SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE

ENGAGE IN SPECIALIST AND MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES ON EQUITIES AND

OPTIONS EXCHANGES AND WE CLEAR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK,

OPTIONS AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MERCHANT BANKING AND OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WE MAKE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE RAISE AND MANAGE.

TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS,

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A WIDE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE OUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO TAKE

RISK TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS DISTINGUISHES US FROM MANY

OF OUR COMPETITORS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES OUR CLIENT

RELATIONSHIPS.

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPONENTS: FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY

AND COMMODITIES, EQUITIES AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND

COMMODITIES (FICC) AND EQUITIES ARE LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED

OPERATIONS THROUGH WHICH WE ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

AND PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

IN THEIR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESSES,

FICC AND EQUITIES STRIVE TO DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY SERVICE BY

OFFERING BROAD MARKET-MAKING AND MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON

A GLOBAL BASIS. IN ADDITION, WE USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TAKE POSITIONS

IN MARKETS, BY COMMITTING CAPITAL AND TAKING RISK, TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. OUR WILLINGNESS TO

MAKE MARKETS, COMMIT CAPITAL AND TAKE RISK IN A BROAD RANGE OF

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRODUCTS AND THEIR

DERIVATIVES IS CRUCIAL TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND TO SUPPORT

OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY.

A CORE ACTIVITY IN FICC AND EQUITIES

IS MARKET MAKING IN A BROAD ARRAY OF SECURITIES AND PRODUCTS. FOR

EXAMPLE, WE ARE A PRIMARY DEALER IN MANY OF THE LARGEST GOVERNMENT

BOND MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN

AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE MAJOR FUTURES

EXCHANGES, AND ALSO HAVE INTERBANK DEALER STATUS IN THE CURRENCY

MARKETS IN NEW YORK, LONDON, TOKYO AND HONG KONG.

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM

OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESSES IN THREE WAYS.



FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL POSITION, WE UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN LESS

LIQUID MARKETS WHERE SPREADS AND FEES ARE GENERALLY LARGER.



FINALLY, WE STRUCTURE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS THAT ADDRESS COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE COORDINATION

AMONG OUR FICC AND EQUITIES BUSINESSES AS WE RESPOND TO WHAT WE

BELIEVE IS CLIENT DEMAND FOR MORE COORDINATED SERVICES AND FOR

CROSS-MARKET KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES IN BOTH

FICC AND EQUITIES, WE ASSUME A VARIETY OF RISKS AND DEVOTE

RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY, ANALYZE AND BENEFIT FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE

CAPITALIZE ON OUR ANALYTICAL MODELS TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE

INFORMED TRADING JUDGMENTS AND WE SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED

DISPARITIES IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND FROM

MACROECONOMIC AND ISSUER-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

THROUGH ALLMERICA FINANCIAL LIFE

INSURANCE AND ANNUITY COMPANY, AN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY THAT WE

ACQUIRED IN DECEMBER 2005, WE NOW MANAGE INTERESTS IN VARIABLE

ANNUITY AND VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. WE ALSO PLAN TO

PARTICIPATE OPPORTUNISTICALLY IN BOTH THE LIFE AND ANNUITY AND

PROPERTY REINSURANCE BUSINESSES.

MANAGEMENT OF MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS.

GOLDMAN SACHS SPONSORS NUMEROUS CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE PRIVATE

INVESTMENT FUNDS. OUR STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO THESE FUNDS

GENERALLY IS TO INVEST OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF

INVESTMENTS THAT IS DIVERSIFIED BY INDUSTRY, PRODUCT TYPE,

GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND TYPE. OUR CORPORATE

INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUE, ON A GLOBAL BASIS, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS

IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS,

LEVERAGED BUYOUTS, ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS MANAGED BY

EXTERNAL PARTIES. OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS INVEST IN REAL

ESTATE OPERATING COMPANIES, DEBT AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN REAL

ESTATE ASSETS, AND OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS. OUR

CLIENTS IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS INCLUDE PENSION PLANS,

ENDOWMENTS, CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED $52.53 BILLION

OF COMMITTED EQUITY CAPITAL IN THESE FUNDS, OF WHICH

$37.23 BILLION RELATES TO OUR CORPORATE FUNDS AND $15.30 BILLION

RELATES TO OUR REAL ESTATE FUNDS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005,

$37.30 BILLION OF THE COMMITTED EQUITY CAPITAL WAS FUNDED AND

THE AMOUNT OF AUM REMAINING IN THESE FUNDS AFTER DISTRIBUTIONS WAS

$28.85 BILLION.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE

THREE PRIMARY REVENUE STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE

THAT IS GENERALLY A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL,

INVESTED CAPITAL, TOTAL GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE.

THESE ANNUAL MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET REVENUES. SECOND, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTOR IN

SOME OF THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING FROM CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON REALIZATION. THIRD,

AFTER A FUND HAS ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE

RECEIVE AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS THAT IS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS. THE

SECOND AND THIRD OF THESE REVENUE STREAMS ARE INCLUDED IN NET

REVENUES OF THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT.

AND SERVICES. IN PARTICULAR, WE PROVIDE GLOBAL ELECTRONIC TRADING

AND INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES COVERING MANY OF OUR

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY, EQUITY AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS

AROUND THE WORLD.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND TECHNOLOGY

HAVE CHANGED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE WAYS THAT SECURITIES

AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE TRADED, DISTRIBUTED AND SETTLED.

THIS CREATES BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR OUR BUSINESSES.

WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION

SECURITY ARE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS

CONTINUITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE

FIRMS CRITICAL FACILITIES AND TO COMPLY WITH NYSE AND NATIONAL

ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. (NASD) REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE CRISIS

MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, PEOPLE

RECOVERY FACILITIES AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF

INFORMATION SECURITY, A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND

TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION ASSETS OF

THE FIRM AND OUR CLIENTS. SAFEGUARDS ARE APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION

RESOURCES.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR

STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS

THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF

BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT

FOSTERS PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG

OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE AND HIGH STANDARDS OF BUSINESS ETHICS.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE

IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS

AN IMPORTANT PART. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT

VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW

PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND

EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS

INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, WE HAD 22,425

EMPLOYEES (EXCLUDING 1,437 EMPLOYEES OF GOLDMAN SACHS PROPERTY

MANAGEMENT AND LOAN SERVICING SUBSIDIARIES, FOR WHOM THE MAJORITY

OF THE COSTS ARE REIMBURSED TO GOLDMAN SACHS BY THE INVESTMENT

FUNDS FOR WHICH THESE SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE SERVICES, AND 7,143

EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY). CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES INCLUDE ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD STRICTLY FOR

CAPITAL APPRECIATION, HAVE A DEFINED EXIT STRATEGY AND ARE ENGAGED

IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL

BUSINESSES.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY 

AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE

EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER BROKERS AND

DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, INVESTMENT

ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS,

COMMERCIAL BANKS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS GLOBALLY AND WITH

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN

ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO

CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR

EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, DUE IN PART TO U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT

HAS EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A

U.S. BANK. IN PARTICULAR, A NUMBER OF LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS,

INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS

HAVE ESTABLISHED OR ACQUIRED BROKER-DEALERS OR HAVE MERGED WITH

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY

TO OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND

INSURANCE TO BROKERAGE, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING

SERVICES, WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY ALSO

HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES

PRODUCTS WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH HAS

RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURE IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND COULD

RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT

TO CONTINUE TO FACE, PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING

CAPITAL TO BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS

THAT MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR,

CORPORATE CLIENTS INCREASINGLY SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS

AGREEMENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR

OTHER REVOLVING LOAN FACILITIES) FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. TO

RESPOND TO THIS TREND, WE ESTABLISHED THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES,

THROUGH WHICH WE HAVE ISSUED COMMITMENTS TO LEND TO COUNTERPARTIES,

PRIMARILY INVESTMENT-GRADE CLIENTS. WITH RESPECT TO THESE

COMMITMENTS, WE HAVE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION PROVIDED TO US BY SMFG,

WHICH IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS WE REALIZE ON

APPROVED LOAN COMMITMENTS, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.00 BILLION.

IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN

CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR 70%

OF THE SECOND LOSS ON SUCH COMMITMENTS, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF

$1.13 BILLION. WE ALSO USE OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE

CERTAIN WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENTS NOT COVERED BY SMFG. SEE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND NOTE 6 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE WILLIAM

STREET ENTITIES AND FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION

PROVIDED BY SMFG.

INCREASINGLY, IN CONNECTION WITH

INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS, WE ARE BEING CALLED UPON TO

PROVIDE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED FOR THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

ISSUED THROUGH GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. OR OUR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND

GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO

HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO

SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND BETTER CAPITALIZED

AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE AND LONGER OPERATING

HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE

COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. THERE HAS

BEEN CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE IN THE PRICING OF BLOCK TRADES. ALSO,

EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS TRADING SPREADS,

HAVE BEEN UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE ABILITY TO

EXECUTE TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH

OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON

TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD ELECTRONIC

AND OTHER LOW-TOUCH, LOW-COMMISSION TRADING WILL CONTINUE. WE

BELIEVE THAT WE

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES

IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS

SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, GS&CO. HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL AND

NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF BOTH THE MINIMUM AND THE NOTIFICATION

REQUIREMENTS. THESE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF

PROHIBITING THESE ENTITIES FROM DISTRIBUTING OR WITHDRAWING CAPITAL

AND MAY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE TO THE SEC FOR CERTAIN WITHDRAWALS OF

CAPITAL. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED THREE

LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANIES WITH LIMITED POWERS UNDER STATE AND

FEDERAL LAW. THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCEPT DEPOSITS OR MAKE

LOANS AND, AS A RESULT, ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE BANKS FOR PURPOSES

OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT, NOR ARE THEY INSURED BY THE FDIC

OR SUBJECT TO THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT. THESE ENTITIES AND

THEIR REGULATORS ARE: THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY, N.A., A

NATIONAL BANK WITH LIMITED TRUST POWERS THAT IS REGULATED BY THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND IS A MEMBER BANK OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM; THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY, A NEW

YORK LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY THAT IS REGULATED BY THE NEW

YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT; AND THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY

OF DELAWARE, A DELAWARE LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY THAT IS

REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE DELAWARE STATE BANK COMMISSIONER.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED GOLDMAN

SACHS BANK USA (GS BANK), A UTAH-CHARTERED INDUSTRIAL BANK, TO

EXTEND CREDIT AND TO TAKE DEPOSITS, OTHER THAN DEMAND DEPOSITS. GS

BANK IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FDIC AND THE UTAH COMMISSIONER

OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ACCEPT DEMAND

DEPOSITS, GS BANK IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A BANK FOR PURPOSES OF

THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT. THE DEPOSITS MAINTAINED AT GS BANK

ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW AND GS BANK

IS SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT.

J. ARON & COMPANY IS

AUTHORIZED BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION (FERC) TO

SELL WHOLESALE PHYSICAL POWER AT MARKET-BASED RATES. AS A

FERC-AUTHORIZED POWER MARKETER, J. ARON & COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER ACT AND FERC

REGULATIONS.

IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF OUR

INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES, WE ARE SUBJECT

TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS DISCUSSED UNDER RISK FACTORS 

OUR POWER GENERATION INTERESTS SUBJECT US TO THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING POWER GENERATION FACILITIES IN PART I,

ITEM 1A OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

ARE SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE STATES IN WHICH

THEY ARE DOMICILED AND IN THE OTHER STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE

LICENSED.

THE EFFORT TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING

AND TERRORIST FINANCING IS A PRIORITY IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICY WITH

RESPECT TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001

CONTAINS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND

MANDATES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS NEW REGULATIONS APPLICABLE

TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, INCLUDING

STANDARDS FOR VERIFYING CLIENT IDENTIFICATION AT ACCOUNT OPENING,

AND OBLIGATIONS TO MONITOR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS, THE USA

PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES

THAT MAY BE INVOLVED IN TERRORISM OR MONEY LAUNDERING. ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING LAWS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES CONTAIN SOME SIMILAR

PROVISIONS. THE OBLIGATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

GOLDMAN SACHS, TO IDENTIFY THEIR CLIENTS, TO WATCH FOR AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND LAW

ANY FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA

COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY AND REGULATORY FINES.

REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

GOLDMAN SACHS IS AN ACTIVE

PARTICIPANT IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS.

MANY OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THESE

MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ELSEWHERE THAT INCLUDE SOME FORM OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY

RULES AND OTHER CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES. GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDES

INVESTMENT SERVICES IN AND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM UNDER THE

REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA). VARIOUS

GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BANKING AND REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES OF THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN WHICH GOLDMAN SACHS

OPERATES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (BAFIN) AND THE BUNDESBANK IN GERMANY, THE

AUTORITÉ DES MARCHÉS FINANCIERS AND BANQUE DE FRANCE IN FRANCE,

BANCA DITALIA AND THE COMMISSIONE NAZIONALE PER LE SOCIETÀ E LA

BORSA (CONSOB) IN ITALY AND THE SWISS FEDERAL BANKING

COMMISSION. GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE

EUROPEAN SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES EXCHANGES OF WHICH

THEY ARE MEMBERS. THE INVESTMENT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

OVERSIGHT BY THE FSA AND OTHER EUROPEAN REGULATORS ARE REGULATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES REQUIRING, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS,

CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS RULES.

THESE STANDARDS, REQUIREMENTS AND RULES ARE SIMILARLY IMPLEMENTED,

UNDER THE SAME DIRECTIVES, THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ARE

BROADLY COMPARABLE IN SCOPE AND PURPOSE TO THE REGULATORY CAPITAL

AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED UNDER THE SEC AND CFTC

RULES. SOME EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES ALSO PERMIT LOCAL REGULATION

IN EACH JURISDICTION, INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO BE

MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH DIRECTIVES AND THESE

LOCAL REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN CERTAIN COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES

TO GOLDMAN SACHS.

THE EUROPEAN UNIONS EUROPEAN

FINANCIAL GROUPS DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2002/87/EC) INTRODUCED

CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE WAY FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN EUROPE ARE REGULATED.

AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CONDUCTED IN

OTHERWISE UNREGULATED ENTITIES ARE NOW SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FORMS OF

REGULATION, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

REQUIREMENTS. THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO COMPLY WITH THE

DIRECTIVE INCLUDE BECOMING SUBJECT TO THE CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED

ENTITY RULES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER  REGULATION IN THE UNITED

STATES.

THE EUROPEAN UNIONS EUROPEAN MARKETS

IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2004/39/EC) WILL

AFFECT SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY IMPOSING DETAILED

PAN-EUROPEAN REQUIREMENTS IN AREAS SUCH AS INTERNAL ORGANIZATION

(INCLUDING CONFLICT MANAGEMENT), BEST EXECUTION, REAL-TIME

DISCLOSURE OF COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS IN SHARES, QUOTING OBLIGATIONS

FOR INTERNALIZED CLIENT ORDERS IN SHARES, TRANSACTION REPORTING TO

REGULATORS, CLIENT DOCUMENTATION AND REGULATION OF INVESTMENT

SERVICES RELATED TO COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. THE PRACTICAL

CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THESE CHANGES ON THE EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE

STILL UNCLEAR. THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE

EUROPEAN UNION ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A NEW DIRECTIVE THAT WOULD

DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE FROM APRIL 30, 2006 TO

NOVEMBER 1, 2007.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AGENCY, THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE, THE OSAKA SECURITIES EXCHANGE,

THE TOKYO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL FUTURES EXCHANGE, THE JAPAN

SECURITIES DEALERS ASSOCIATION, THE TOKYO COMMODITY EXCHANGE AND

THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, TRADE AND INDUSTRY IN JAPAN, THE

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION IN HONG KONG, THE MONETARY

AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE AND THE CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY

COMMISSION, AMONG OTHERS, REGULATE VARIOUS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN

ASIA AND ALSO HAVE CAPITAL STANDARDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS

COMPARABLE TO THE RULES OF THE SEC. CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BERMUDA REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE IN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES, REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, AS

WELL AS STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE

EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN

CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS, OR THE

SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR ITS DIRECTORS,

OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. FROM TIME TO TIME, OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

BEEN SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE

BEEN IMPOSED FOR INFRACTIONS OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR

ACTIVITIES, NONE OF WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US

OR OUR BUSINESSES.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY

AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS

COULD LIMIT THOSE OPERATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT

REQUIRE THE INTENSIVE USE OF CAPITAL, SUCH AS UNDERWRITING AND

TRADING ACTIVITIES, SPECIALIST ACTIVITIES AND THE FINANCING OF

CLIENT ACCOUNT BALANCES, AND ALSO COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO

WITHDRAW CAPITAL FROM OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH IN TURN

COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT OR TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR

PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK.

IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON

BANKING SUPERVISION ISSUED THE BASEL II CAPITAL STANDARDS,

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO

PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS BY ALIGNING

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MORE CLOSELY WITH THE UNDERLYING

RISKS FACED BY THESE FIRMS. UNDER THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED TIME

SCHEDULE, GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL WOULD BECOME SUBJECT TO THE

BASEL II REQUIREMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE CONSOLIDATED

SUPERVISED ENTITY RULES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER  REGULATION IN

THE UNITED STATES, WHICH PROVIDE FOR GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION, ARE

CONSISTENT WITH BASEL II. COMPLYING WITH THESE NEW STANDARDS

REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW AND ADVANCED MEASUREMENT

TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT

TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY A NUMBER OF SECURITIES EXCHANGES. THE

RULES OF THESE EXCHANGES GENERALLY REQUIRE OUR SPECIALISTS TO

MAINTAIN ORDERLY MARKETS IN THE SECURITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE

SPECIALISTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS, IN TURN, MAY REQUIRE US TO COMMIT

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES.

CHANGES TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS

GOVERNING STOCK MARKETS AND THE CONDUCT OF PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE

MARKETS, INCLUDING THE NYSE, MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US,

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN OR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES OR

IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

RELATING TO THOSE BUSINESSES.

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT

BANKS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN THE SUBJECT OF REGULATORY SCRUTINY. THE

SEC, NYSE AND NASD HAVE ADOPTED RULES IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING

PERSONNEL AT MEMBER SECURITIES FIRMS. VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS

HAVE IMPOSED BOTH SUBSTANTIVE AND DISCLOSURE-BASED

REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH, AND CONTINUE TO CONSIDER

ADDITIONAL REGULATION. IN ADDITION, WE ARE A PARTY TO A SETTLEMENT

WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS THAT IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERACTION BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BANKING DEPARTMENTS AND

REQUIRES US TO FUND THE PROVISION OF INDEPENDENT RESEARCH TO OUR

CLIENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESEARCH

SETTLEMENT, THE FIRM HAS ALSO SUBSCRIBED TO A VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE

IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE ALLOCATION OF SHARES IN INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS TO EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE FSA

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF

THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES

OFFERINGS (INCLUDING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND SECONDARY

DISTRIBUTIONS). THE SEC, NYSE AND NASD HAVE PROPOSED RULES THAT

WOULD FURTHER AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH SECURITIES ARE DISTRIBUTED

AND ALLOCATED IN REGISTERED PUBLIC OFFERINGS. WE CANNOT FULLY

PREDICT THE PRACTICAL EFFECT THAT THESE NEW AND PROPOSED

REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, AND THE SEC, NYSE, NASD AND

NON-U.S. REGULATORS, SUCH AS THE FSA, MAY ADOPT ADDITIONAL AND

MORE STRINGENT RULES WITH RESPECT TO OFFERING PROCEDURES AND THE

MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE FUTURE.

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE

SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET,

LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. OUR

BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS. THE

FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

WE HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS PER

COMMON SHARE IN EACH OF OUR LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS, REFLECTING A

FAVORABLE TRADING ENVIRONMENT IN FICC, AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE

TRADING ENVIRONMENT FOR EQUITIES AND AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT

BANKING ACTIVITY. AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THESE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY AND THESE CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND

DRAMATICALLY. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ADVERSELY

AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE

FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH

CHANGES ARE RAPID, MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE

OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE INCURRED

SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF MARKET TURBULENCE. CONVERSELY, CERTAIN OF

OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE

OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM

OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE

TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE CONTINUED, EVEN AS THE VOLUME AND

NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS HAVE INCREASED. IN ADDITION, THE TREND IN

THE UNDERWRITING BUSINESS TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND CO-MANAGERS HANDLING

TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE BOOK RUNNER, MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS ALSO TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS.

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF

BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND

IN THE INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND

OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE BLOCKS OF SECURITIES ARE INCREASINGLY

BEING SOLD IN BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A MARKETED BASIS, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK

THAT GOLDMAN SACHS MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE PURCHASED SECURITIES AT FAVORABLE

PRICES AND MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AS A RESULT. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF

CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO

LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH

TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND AS A SPECIALIST OR

MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM

COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND OTHER INDUSTRY

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE INCREASING USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING,

COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE

ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY

PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF

SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN THE

CONTEXT OF BLOCK TRADES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR

RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY

FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING

SYSTEMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR

ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF

RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES

AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT

ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS

AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR

ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR

BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO SELL

ASSETS OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION

MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL,

SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT

AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS

MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL

SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND BUSINESSES IN MANY WAYS.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO

OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER

OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR

TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE

PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERMINATE

CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY

BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

AN INABILITY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A

HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS

AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO., ARE

SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE

THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO

FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN

ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (OR ANY

OTHER ENTITY) HOLDS EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS REGULATED OR

UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, ITS RIGHTS AS AN EQUITY HOLDER TO THE

ASSETS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE

CLAIMS OF THE CREDITORS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD

PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT

PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR

RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL

CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD

RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR

LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES

HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAS THE

BREADTH OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. THE

SCOPE OF OUR LENDING BUSINESSES HAS ALSO BEEN EXPANDING AND

INCLUDES LOANS TO SMALL AND MID-SIZE BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE NOT

TRADITIONAL GOLDMAN SACHS CLIENTS. AS A CLEARING MEMBER FIRM, WE

FINANCE OUR CLIENT POSITIONS AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR

THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR

THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK

TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT

BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION,

CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

MANDATORY PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LOSSES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER THE UNDERLYING SECURITY OR OBLIGATION.

LIKE MANY PARTICIPANTS IN THE

DERIVATIVES MARKETPLACE, WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES, THAT REQUIRE

THAT WE DELIVER TO THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY OR

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO

NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY OR OBLIGATION AND MAY HAVE

DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING

SECURITY OR OBLIGATION THROUGH THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OF OTHER

TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE SECURITY OR OBLIGATION WITHIN THE

REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO

FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN

SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM. THE DERIVATIVES INDUSTRY IS

WORKING ON VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. A FAILURE OF

THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE COULD RESULT IN AN UNWILLINGNESS

OF COUNTERPARTIES TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN TYPES OF DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

UNCONFIRMED DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND UNAUTHORIZED ASSIGNMENTS OF DERIVATIVES BY COUNTERPARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER

TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS

CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE

TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND

IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE THE CONTRACT. THE GROWTH IN THE

DERIVATIVES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER SWAP

TRANSACTIONS, HAS ALSO EXPOSED US AND OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

TO AN INCREASING INCIDENCE OF COUNTERPARTIES SEEKING TO

UNILATERALLY ASSIGN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT REQUIRED PRIOR NOTICE AND

CONSENT. ALTHOUGH INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO

ELIMINATE THIS PRACTICE AND ITS EFFECTS ON A GOING-FORWARD BASIS,

INCLUDING THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2005 ISDA NOVATION PROTOCOL,

IT IS NOT YET CLEAR HOW EFFECTIVE THESE EFFORTS WILL BE, AND THE

STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE INDUSTRY DO NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE

FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO.

UNAUTHORIZED ASSIGNMENTS COULD INTRODUCE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

STATUS OF A TRANSACTION, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE CREDIT RISK

AND IMPEDE TRADE RECONCILIATIONS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A HIGHER

NUMBER OF FAILED TRANSACTIONS AND COLLATERAL CALL DEFAULTS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR

INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS COULD LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL LOSS, DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES,

LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR

ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES. THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX AND OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS

WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING,

DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL

TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT

ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS. THE INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS

TO ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO

CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR TERMINATION OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES,

CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO

FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR

INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE WILL INCREASINGLY FACE

THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS

SYSTEMS. ANY SUCH FAILURE OR TERMINATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS AND MANAGE OUR

EXPOSURE TO RISK.

DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND

FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE

ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE

LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL,

COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN

SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE

DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT

AFFECT ONLY THE BUILDINGS OF GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES,

OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT ON THE CITIES WHERE

THOSE BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR

PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING NEW YORK, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG

AND TOKYO, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE

BUILDINGS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES

IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE

WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND

INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON

COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE

PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER

INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE

PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES

WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE

VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER

MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT.

IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD

JEOPARDIZE OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS

OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD

PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO

INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE

EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY

INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST

IMPORTANT ASSETS. AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND OUR CLIENT BASE, WE INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO OUR PROPRIETARY

ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CONFLICTS MAY ARISE BETWEEN OUR POSITION

AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR IN A MERGER TRANSACTION AND A PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENT WE HOLD IN ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION. IN

ADDITION, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS ARE AN INCREASINGLY

IMPORTANT PORTION OF OUR CLIENT BASE, AND ALSO COMPETE WITH US IN A

NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS

THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. HOWEVER,

APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND

DIFFICULT AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR

TO FAIL, TO DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

IN ADDITION, THE SEC AND OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JUNE 2005, THE

NASD FILED WITH THE SEC PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES TO BE CONTAINED IN FAIRNESS OPINIONS, AND WOULD MANDATE

SPECIFIC PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED BY MEMBER FIRMS IN CONNECTION

WITH ISSUING THESE OPINIONS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

OF INTEREST ARE APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY

OF, AND LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL

MAKE OUR CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH

SUCH A CONFLICT MAY OCCUR, AND WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION

IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE

FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

OR SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN

ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESS OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SEC HAS ADOPTED RULES REQUIRING THE

REGISTRATION OF CERTAIN HEDGE FUNDS ADVISERS UNDER THE INVESTMENT

ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, AND THE SEC OR OTHER REGULATORS MAY SEEK TO

FURTHER REGULATE HEDGE FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

THESE OR OTHER FUTURE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS RULES MAY HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR TRADING, PRIME BROKERAGE AND OTHER

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEDGE FUNDS, OR ON THE GROWTH OF OUR

PRIME BROKERAGE AND SECURITIES LENDING BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION,

UNDER THE EUROPEAN UNIONS TRANSPARENCY DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2004/109/EC),

WHICH IS DUE TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY MEMBER STATES BY

JANUARY 2007, ISSUERS OF SECURITIES ADMITTED TO LISTING ON

REGULATED MARKETS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION MAY, DEPENDING UPON THE

MANNER OF IMPLEMENTATION, BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPANDED ONGOING

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

ABILITY OR THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR NON-EUROPEAN UNION-BASED

CLIENTS TO MAINTAIN THE LISTING OF THESE SECURITIES OR TO CONDUCT

SECURITIES OFFERINGS IN EUROPE. FURTHERMORE, THE SECS REGULATION NMS,

WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN 2005 AND IS EXPECTED TO BECOME

EFFECTIVE IN 2006, INTRODUCES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE REGULATION

OF TRADING ON SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND MARKETPLACES. WHILE IT IS

TOO EARLY TO PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT REGULATION NMS WILL HAVE,

IT COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ON

OUR TRADING BUSINESSES AND ALTER THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH THESE BUSINESSES FUNCTION.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE OPERATING IN AN UNCERTAIN AND DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENALTIES

AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS LED

SOME OF OUR CLIENTS TO BE LESS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS

THAT MAY CARRY A RISK OF INCREASED SCRUTINY BY REGULATORS. IN

ADDITION, WHILE THE FIRM ALWAYS STRIVES TO FULLY COMPLY WITH ALL

LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THIS REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT

ENVIRONMENT HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO A NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN ENTERED INTO BY FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR FIRM, AND THAT WERE GENERALLY

BELIEVED TO BE PERMISSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS

LED US AND OUR COMPETITORS TO MODIFY TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND, IN

SOME CASES, TO LIMIT OR CEASE OUR EXECUTION OF SOME TYPES OF

TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN

OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND

PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH.

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESSES HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO NEW REQUIREMENTS AND LITIGATION.

AS DISCUSSED UNDER BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K,

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE BEEN AND

REMAIN THE SUBJECT OF REGULATORY SCRUTINY THAT HAS LED TO

RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS

AND INVESTMENT BANKING PERSONNEL AT SECURITIES FIRMS. GS&CO. HAS

AGREED TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO EQUITY

RESEARCH ANALYSTS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST PURSUANT TO WHICH

GS&CO. HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS.

CERTAIN OF THESE REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS HAVE IMPOSED

ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF COMPLEX, STRUCTURED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS REMAIN HIGH.

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES, CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE COMPLEX, STRUCTURED

FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST A

NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

TRANSACTIONS. IN SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, CLIENTS OF THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY ENGAGED IN ACCOUNTING, DISCLOSURE

OR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS, AND THE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY FACILITATED THESE IMPROPRIETIES BY ENTERING

INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH THE CLIENTS. WE SEEK TO CREATE INNOVATIVE

SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS NEEDS, AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO,

AND CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO, STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS.

WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO

ENSURE THAT THE STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS WE ENTER INTO ARE

APPROPRIATELY REVIEWED AND COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN OF THESE TRANSACTIONS

COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND LITIGATION IN

CONNECTION WITH, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS WILL MAKE OUR

CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS, AND WILL

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN THIS AREA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO MARKET TIMING, LATE TRADING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INVOLVING MUTUAL FUNDS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN

INDUSTRY-WIDE AND OTHER INVESTIGATIONS BY FEDERAL AND STATE

AUTHORITIES CONCERNING MARKET TIMING, LATE TRADING AND OTHER

ACTIVITIES INVOLVING MUTUAL FUNDS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS. FEDERAL

AND STATE AUTHORITIES HAVE MADE INFORMATIONAL REQUESTS REGARDING

TRADING PRACTICES BROADLY ACROSS ALL OF THE MAJOR FUND COMPANIES

AND BROKER-DEALERS. GOLDMAN SACHS HAS RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION AND HAS BEEN FULLY COOPERATING WITH THOSE AUTHORITIES.

WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE REASONABLE MEASURES TO

DETECT AND DETER DISRUPTIVE AND ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES AND

COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE CANNOT

PREDICT THE COURSE THAT THESE INQUIRIES AND AREAS OF FOCUS MAY TAKE

OR THE IMPACT THAT ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING MUTUAL

FUNDS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND CIVIL ACTIONS.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO BEEN CONDUCTING

INVESTIGATIONS INTO CERTAIN TRADING PRACTICES OF SPECIALIST FIRMS,

INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST UNIT. IN MARCH 2004, CERTAIN NYSE

SPECIALIST FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST UNIT, AGREED TO A GLOBAL

SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC AND NYSE TO RESOLVE CHARGES THAT THE FIRMS

VIOLATED CERTAIN FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND NYSE RULES IN

CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACTIVITIES AS NYSE SPECIALISTS DURING THE

YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2003. THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT INVOLVES, AMONG

OTHERS, RESTITUTION AND PENALTIES, A CENSURE, CEASE AND DESIST

ORDER AND CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS WITH RESPECT TO OUR SPECIALIST

UNITS SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES. THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT RESOLVE THE

RELATED CIVIL ACTIONS DISCUSSED UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

SPECIALIST MATTERS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM 10-K, OR POTENTIAL REGULATORY CHARGES AGAINST

INDIVIDUALS. AS A RESULT OF THIS GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND ANY RELATED

DEVELOPMENTS, OTHER INVESTIGATIONS OR ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS

GOVERNING SPECIALISTS, OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED AND THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPAIRED.

EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND PREVENT AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY

PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE

RISK THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS

POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE

PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESSES.

FINANCIAL SCANDALS IN RECENT YEARS

HAVE LED TO INSECURITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

CONTRIBUTED TO DECLINES IN CAPITAL MARKETS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE

SCANDALS, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE RULES OF THE SEC,

NYSE AND NASDAQ HAVE NECESSITATED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. THESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY APPLY

TO COMPANIES WITH SECURITIES LISTED ON U.S. SECURITIES

EXCHANGES, AND SOME PROVISIONS APPLY TO NON-U.S. ISSUERS WITH

SECURITIES TRADED ON U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGES. TO THE EXTENT

THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES, TO AVOID BECOMING SUBJECT TO THESE

REQUIREMENTS, DECIDE TO FORGO INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, OUR EQUITY

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY EXIT SOME OF OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SIMILARLY, THE IMPOSITION OF THOSE PROVISIONS

ON NON-U.S. ISSUERS HAS MADE THESE ISSUERS LESS LIKELY TO LIST

THEIR SECURITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OR UNDERTAKE MERGER OR

ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD RESULT IN THEIR SECURITIES

BEING LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE MEASURES MAY RESULT IN

LESS ACTIVITY BY NON-U.S. ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND, AS

A RESULT, THE U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PROVISIONS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY

ACT OF 2002 AND THE NYSE AND NASDAQ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RULES HAVE

IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE COSTS ON PUBLIC COMPANIES AND HAVE

INCREASED THE COST OF CONDUCTING MANY TYPES OF CAPITAL MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES OFFERINGS AND ACQUISITION AND

DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, COMPANIES THAT ARE OR ARE

PLANNING TO BE PUBLIC ARE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN

COMPLYING WITH THE SEC AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATING TO

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND COMPANIES THAT

DISCLOSE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN SUCH CONTROLS UNDER THE NEW

STANDARDS MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

THESE FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO ADOPTED OR PROPOSED ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE CHANGES, MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY 

AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE

EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. U.S. FEDERAL

LEGISLATION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES

PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK, MAY

ACCELERATE THIS CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASE COMPETITION.

THIS TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR COMPETITORS.

THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES

AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS.

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR

BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND

PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS

TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR

OWN SYSTEMS AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT

APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL

CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED USE

BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT

ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN

COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT

ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS.

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION WITH BUSINESSES

OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, FOR THE MOST HIGHLY

SKILLED INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN INTENSE. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT MAY CAUSE US TO MOVE

EMPLOYEES FROM ONE BUSINESS TO ANOTHER OR TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES; THIS MAY CAUSE TEMPORARY

DISRUPTIONS AS OUR EMPLOYEES ADAPT TO NEW ROLES AND MAY REDUCE OUR

ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS (INCLUDING LAWS

RELATING TO IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING) MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY

TO MOVE RESPONSIBILITIES OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO

ANOTHER. THIS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES OR POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FULLY INTEGRATE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES INTO OUR BUSINESSES AND SYSTEMS.

WE EXPECT TO GROW IN PART THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES. WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN JOINT VENTURES,

INCLUDING IN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA, AND MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL

JOINT VENTURES FROM TIME TO TIME. TO THE EXTENT WE MAKE

ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO COMBINATIONS OR JOINT VENTURES, WE FACE

NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COMBINING OR INTEGRATING THE

RELEVANT BUSINESSES AND SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE NEED TO COMBINE

ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND

TO INTEGRATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. IN

THE CASE OF JOINT VENTURES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES IN THAT WE MAY BE DEPENDENT UPON, AND SUBJECT TO

LIABILITY, LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE RELATING TO, SYSTEMS,

CONTROLS AND PERSONNEL THAT ARE NOT UNDER OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION,

CONFLICTS OR DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND OUR JOINT VENTURE

PARTNERS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE BENEFITS TO BE ACHIEVED BY THE

JOINT VENTURE.

OUR POWER GENERATION INTERESTS SUBJECT US TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.

WE OWN INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES. AS A RESULT OF THESE INTERESTS AND FUTURE

INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY MAKE IN THE POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY, WE

FACE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

WE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW ENTRANT TO

THE ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LESS

EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE IN OWNING AND MANAGING POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES THAN MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS AND WE MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL IN OWNING AND MANAGING OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.

IN PARTICULAR, IN THE FUTURE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES.

THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES MAY BE DISRUPTED. THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES INVOLVES MANY RISKS, INCLUDING THE BREAKDOWN

OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR

OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS

OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY. ALTHOUGH OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES

CONTAIN VARIOUS REDUNDANCIES AND BACKUP MECHANISMS, A BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE MAY PREVENT THE AFFECTED FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER

APPLICABLE POWER SALES AGREEMENTS OR OTHERWISE OPERATING AS PLANNED.

THE POWER COMPANIES IN WHICH WE OWN

INTERESTS ARE PARTIES TO NUMEROUS AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES,

INCLUDING LENDERS, SUPPLIERS OF RAW MATERIALS, SERVICE PROVIDERS

AND UTILITIES, WHICH IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ON THE POWER

COMPANIES. SOME OF THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE POWER

COMPANIES TO SATISFY, DEPENDING, IN SOME CASES, ON MARKET

CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2004 WE FACED

DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING AND RETAINING ADEQUATE COAL INVENTORIES

AT MANY POWER GENERATION FACILITIES DUE TO SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS ON

COAL AND A RATIONING OF SERVICES BY RAILROADS. ANY FAILURE BY THE

POWER COMPANY TO SATISFY OR OBTAIN WAIVERS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS

UNDER ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS COULD CAUSE THEM TO LOSE THE BENEFITS

PROVIDED BY THE AGREEMENTS, SUBJECT THEM TO LITIGATION, RESULT IN

REPUTATIONAL HARM OR IMPAIR THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN ADDITION, THE OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE POWER

COMPANIES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE OF ANY OF

THESE THIRD PARTIES TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE

POWER COMPANIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND

EVOLVING ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INTENSIFIED SCRUTINY OF THE

ENERGY MARKET BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE

PUBLIC HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING ENERGY COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE ENGAGED IN ELECTRIC

POWER GENERATION. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POWER

GENERATION, AND OUR OVERALL BUSINESSES AND REPUTATION MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT

OF OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR POWER

GENERATION ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS,

AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, NATURAL

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESOURCES,

SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO COMMIT

SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION

OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES, AND

APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES AT OUR POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CEASE OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS

OF ONE OR MORE OF THE POWER GENERATION FACILITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE

AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THE ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS

AND PROVISIONS OF THE PERMITS AND LICENSES MAY RESULT IN THE

ASSESSMENT OF SEVERE CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITIES AGAINST US AND

THE NEED TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR COMPLIANCE OR

REMEDIATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

RECENTLY ISSUED THE CLEAN AIR INTERSTATE RULE, WHICH IMPOSES

ADDITIONAL CONTROLS OVER POWER GENERATION FACILITY EMISSIONS AND

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OF EMISSIONS BY 2010 (FOR PHASE I)

AND 2015 (FOR PHASE II). WE ARE ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS

LEGISLATION, BUT IT MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ON OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. OTHER LEGISLATION,

RULES AND REQUIREMENTS MAY BE IMPOSED ON OUR POWER GENERATION

ACTIVITIES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ONE OR MORE STATES.

INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS WITH RESPECT

TO OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE

PROCEEDS FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY, IF ANY, MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO

COVER OUR LIABILITIES IN A PARTICULAR INCIDENT. AS A RESULT, OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL OR A HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEM AT ONE

OF OUR FACILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF

UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE MAY

NOT HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST THESE RISKS, AND, IN CASES IN WHICH WE

DO HAVE INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS MAY BE INADEQUATE TO

COVER OUR LOSSES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND

MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS,

CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE

GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN

MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE

SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND

EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. OUR INABILITY TO REMAIN

IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN MARKET COULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES

IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT

NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER

WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY, OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF

SUCH AN EMERGENCY, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS

IN EMERGING MARKETS AND OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND COULD

LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS)

THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE

WORLD. IN ADDITION, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING

HEALTH EMERGENCIES, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD

EXPOSE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY INVOLVED IN EMERGING MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND

WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS,

VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC

AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF

THEIR CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW

OR NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS

OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE

LOCATED AT 85 BROAD STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AND COMPRISE

APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF LEASED SPACE,

PURSUANT TO A LEASE AGREEMENT EXPIRING IN JUNE 2008 (WITH OPTIONS

TO RENEW FOR UP TO

20

ADDITIONAL

YEARS). WE ALSO OCCUPY OVER 680,000 RENTABLE

SQUARE FEET AT ONE NEW YORK PLAZA UNDER LEASE

AGREEMENTS EXPIRING PRIMARILY IN 2009 (WITH OPTIONS TO RENEW FOR UP

TO FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS), AND WE LEASE SPACE AT VARIOUS OTHER

LOCATIONS IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA. IN TOTAL, WE LEASE

APPROXIMATELY 4.0 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET IN THE NEW YORK

METROPOLITAN AREA.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, WE COMPLETED THE

CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW OFFICE BUILDING AT 30 HUDSON STREET IN JERSEY

CITY, NEW JERSEY. THIS BUILDING, WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION

GROSS SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE, WAS CONSTRUCTED TO

COMPLEMENT OUR OFFICES IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THE BUILDING IS BEING

OCCUPIED IN PHASES.

IN AUGUST 2005, WE LEASED FROM

BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY A PARCEL OF LAND IN LOWER MANHATTAN,

PURSUANT TO A GROUND LEASE. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO CONSTRUCT A 2.1 MILLION

GROSS-SQUARE-FOOT OFFICE BUILDING ON THE SITE THAT

WILL SERVE AS OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS. UNDER THE LEASE, BATTERY PARK

CITY AUTHORITY HOLDS TITLE TO ALL IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE

OFFICE BUILDING, SUBJECT TO GOLDMAN SACHS RIGHT OF EXCLUSIVE

POSSESSION AND USE FOR THE 64-YEAR DURATION OF THE LEASE.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GROUND LEASE,

WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE A LUMP-SUM GROUND RENT PAYMENT OF $161 MILLION

BY JUNE 2007 AND TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PERIODIC PAYMENTS

DURING THE TERM OF THE LEASE. WE ARE OBLIGATED UNDER THE GROUND

LEASE TO CONSTRUCT THE OFFICE BUILDING BY 2011 (SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIONS IN THE CASE OF FORCE MAJEURE) IN ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN

PRE-APPROVED DESIGN STANDARDS. CONSTRUCTION BEGAN ON THE BUILDING

IN NOVEMBER 2005, AND WE EXPECT INITIAL OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING

BY 2009. THE BUILDING IS PROJECTED TO COST BETWEEN $2.3 BILLION

AND $2.5 BILLION, INCLUDING ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, FITOUT

AND FURNISHINGS, FINANCING AND OTHER RELATED COSTS.

WE ARE RECEIVING A NUMBER OF BENEFITS

FROM THE CITY AND STATE OF NEW YORK BASED ON OUR AGREEMENT TO

CONSTRUCT OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THESE BENEFITS

ARE SUBJECT TO RECOUPMENT OR RECAPTURE IF WE DO NOT PROCEED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THE CITY AND STATE OF NEW YORK.

WE HAVE ADDITIONAL OFFICES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE IN THE AMERICAS. TOGETHER, THESE

OFFICES COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 2.1 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET

OF LEASED SPACE.

WE ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN EUROPE, ASIA

AND AFRICA. IN EUROPE, WE HAVE OFFICES THAT TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION

RENTABLE SQUARE FEET, WHICH INCLUDES OUR OFFICE SPACE

IN FRANKFURT, APPROXIMATELY 55,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF

WHICH WE EXPECT TO EXIT BY 2006. OUR EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS IS

LOCATED IN LONDON AT PETERBOROUGH COURT, PURSUANT TO A LEASE

EXPIRING IN 2026. IN TOTAL, WE LEASE APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION

RENTABLE SQUARE FEET IN LONDON THROUGH VARIOUS LEASES, RELATING TO

VARIOUS PROPERTIES.

IN ASIA, WE HAVE OFFICES THAT TOTAL

APPROXIMATELY 900,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET. OUR HEADQUARTERS IN

THIS REGION ARE IN TOKYO, AT THE ROPPONGI HILLS MORI TOWER, AND IN

HONG KONG, AT THE CHEUNG KONG CENTER. IN TOKYO, WE CURRENTLY LEASE

APPROXIMATELY 290,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THROUGH A LEASE THAT

WILL EXPIRE IN 2018. IN HONG KONG, WE CURRENTLY LEASE APPROXIMATELY

220,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET UNDER LEASE AGREEMENTS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN FISCAL 2012.

OUR OCCUPANCY EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH OFFICE SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT

REQUIREMENTS. THIS EXCESS SPACE, THE COST OF WHICH IS CHARGED TO

EARNINGS AS INCURRED, IS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BEING HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH OR TO

REPLACE CURRENTLY OCCUPIED SPACE THAT WE MAY EXIT IN THE FUTURE. WE

REGULARLY EVALUATE OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE SPACE CAPACITY IN

RELATION TO CURRENT AND PROJECTED STAFFING LEVELS. WE MAY INCUR

EXIT COSTS IN 2006 AND THEREAFTER TO THE EXTENT WE (I) REDUCE

OUR SPACE CAPACITY OR (II) COMMIT TO, OR OCCUPY, NEW PROPERTIES

IN THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, DISPOSE OF

EXISTING SPACE THAT HAD BEEN HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH. THESE EXIT

COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN

PERIOD.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF

JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THOSE

DESCRIBED BELOW) CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE

CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN THE

AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION, BUT MIGHT BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY

PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS

FOR SUCH PERIOD. GIVEN THE RANGE OF LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS

PRESENTLY UNDER WAY, OUR LITIGATION EXPENSES CAN BE EXPECTED TO

REMAIN HIGH.

IPO PROCESS MATTERS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. ARE AMONG THE NUMEROUS FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A VARIETY OF

LAWSUITS ALLEGING IMPROPRIETIES IN THE PROCESS BY WHICH THOSE

COMPANIES PARTICIPATED IN THE UNDERWRITING OF PUBLIC OFFERINGS IN

RECENT YEARS.

CERTAIN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS HAVE

BEEN BROUGHT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, BEGINNING ON NOVEMBER 3, 1998, BY

PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES IN PUBLIC OFFERINGS AS WELL AS CERTAIN

PURPORTED ISSUERS OF SUCH OFFERINGS, THAT ALLEGE THAT THE

DEFENDANTS HAVE CONSPIRED TO FIX AT 7% THE DISCOUNT THAT

UNDERWRITING SYNDICATES RECEIVE FROM ISSUERS OF SHARES IN CERTAIN

OFFERINGS IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS. ON MARCH 15,

1999, THE PURCHASER PLAINTIFFS FILED A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED

COMPLAINT SEEKING TREBLE DAMAGES AS WELL AS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE

DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT ON

APRIL 29, 1999. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2001, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT

COURT GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE THE DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE

CLAIMS ASSERTED BY THE PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES ON THE GROUND THAT

THEY LACKED ANTITRUST STANDING. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THOSE ACTIONS

APPEALED, AND BY A DECISION DATED DECEMBER 13, 2002, THE U.S. COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT VACATED THE DISMISSAL

ON THE GROUND THAT THE LOWER COURT HAD ENGAGED IN IMPROPER

FACT-FINDING ON THE MOTION AND REMANDED FOR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER

POTENTIAL BASES FOR DISMISSAL. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2001, THE

DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINTS FILED BY THE ISSUER

PLAINTIFFS ON STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS GROUNDS. ON SEPTEMBER 25,

2002, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT DENIED THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS

MOTION TO DISMISS. ON MARCH 26, 2003, DEFENDANTS MOVED TO

DISMISS THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY BOTH THE ISSUERS AND THE PURCHASERS

OF SECURITIES ON PREEMPTION GROUNDS, BUT THE MOTION WAS DENIED ON

JUNE 27, 2003. ON JUNE 24, 2003, DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY THE PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES ON

STANDING GROUNDS, AND ON FEBRUARY 24, 2004, THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTED THE MOTION TO DISMISS AS TO THE PURCHASERS DAMAGES CLAIMS.

PLAINTIFFS IN BOTH ACTIONS MOVED FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION ON

SEPTEMBER 16, 2004 AND FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON NOVEMBER 16,

2005.

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IS ONE OF

NUMEROUS FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS THAT HAVE BEEN NAMED AS

GOLDMAN SACHS DID NOT REPURCHASE SHARES OF

ITS COMMON STOCK AS PART OF THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

DURING A SELF-IMPOSED BLACK-OUT PERIOD FROM THE

LAST TWO WEEKS OF THE FISCAL QUARTER THROUGH THE DATE

NO SHARES WERE PURCHASED OTHER THAN THROUGH

OUR PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 25,

2005.

(3)

ON MARCH 21, 2000, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A REPURCHASE PROGRAM,

PURSUANT TO WHICH UP TO 15 MILLION SHARES OF OUR

COMMON STOCK MAY BE REPURCHASED. THIS REPURCHASE

PROGRAM WAS INCREASED BY AN AGGREGATE OF 160 MILLION SHARES BY RESOLUTIONS OF OUR BOARD OF

DIRECTORS ADOPTED ON JUNE 18, 2001, MARCH 18, 2002,

NOVEMBER 20, 2002,

JANUARY 30, 2004, JANUARY 25, 2005

AND SEPTEMBER 16, 2005. THE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO HELP MAINTAIN OUR TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS AND TO

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER

TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED

COMPENSATION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS BEEN

EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET

PURCHASES, AND IS INFLUENCED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

THE LEVEL OF OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, OUR

OVERALL CAPITAL POSITION, EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS

GRANTED AND EXERCISES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, THE

PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. THE TOTAL REMAINING

AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS

29,495,079 SHARES AS OF JANUARY 30, 2006. THE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO SET EXPIRATION OR

TERMINATION DATE.

IN THIS DISCUSSION, WE HAVE INCLUDED

STATEMENTS THAT MAY CONSTITUTE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN

THE MEANING OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE

NOT HISTORICAL FACTS BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ONLY OUR BELIEFS

REGARDING FUTURE EVENTS, MANY OF WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE STATEMENTS

RELATE TO OUR FUTURE PLANS AND OBJECTIVES, AMONG OTHER THINGS. BY

IDENTIFYING THESE STATEMENTS FOR YOU IN THIS MANNER, WE ARE

ALERTING YOU TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER,

POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THE RESULTS INDICATED IN THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, THAT

COULD CAUSE OUR RESULTS TO DIFFER, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THOSE

INDICATED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW

UNDER  CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AS

WELL AS RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE ANNUAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

WERE $11.21 FOR 2005, A 26% INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2004. RETURN ON

AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS 27.6%

(1)

AND RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS 21.8%.

OUR RESULTS IN 2005 REFLECTED STRONG GROWTH IN NET REVENUES FROM

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

SECURITIES SERVICES AS WELL AS HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT

BANKING. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC), AS ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES PERFORMED

WELL. DURING 2005, FICC OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, TIGHT, BUT

VOLATILE, CREDIT SPREADS, HIGHER ENERGY PRICES AND A FLATTER YIELD

CURVE. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES ALSO IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS

THE BUSINESS. EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES, IMPROVED CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY

AND CONTINUED LOW LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY. NET REVENUES IN OUR

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING A GAIN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG) AS

WELL AS GAINS FROM REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. THE STRONG

NET REVENUE GROWTH IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER

CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING NET REVENUES WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING AND IMPROVED RESULTS IN FINANCIAL

ADVISORY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE

CORPORATE ACTIVITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUES IN

EQUITY UNDERWRITING. OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BACKLOG AT THE END OF

2005 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN AT THE END OF 2004.

(2)

OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR 2005

REFLECTED GENERALLY FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND STRONG

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY LEVELS. WE CONTINUED TO SEE FAVORABLE

TRADING AND INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES,

PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL YEAR.

CONSEQUENTLY, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2005 WE INCREASED OUR

MARKET RISK, PARTICULARLY IN EQUITIES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS,

TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES. NET REVENUES IN OUR EQUITIES

AND FICC BUSINESSES SURPASSED PREVIOUS PEAK LEVELS. OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING NET REVENUES REFLECTED OUR BEST PERFORMANCE IN FOUR YEARS

AS CORPORATE ACTIVITY CONTINUED TO RECOVER, PARTICULARLY IN

ANNOUNCED AND COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING, ALTHOUGH COMPETITIVE PRESSURES REMAINED. WE ALSO

CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON MANAGING OUR CAPITAL BASE, WITH THE GOAL OF

OPTIMIZING OUR RETURNS WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, GROWING OUR

BUSINESSES. DURING 2005, WE REPURCHASED 63.7 MILLION SHARES OF

OUR STOCK AT A COST OF $7.11 BILLION. WITH RESPECT TO THE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS CONTINUED TO BE

UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY, WITH THE VOLUME AND AMOUNT OF CLAIMS

AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER RELATED COSTS REMAINING

SIGNIFICANT. GIVEN THE RANGE OF LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS

PRESENTLY UNDER WAY, OUR LITIGATION EXPENSES CAN BE EXPECTED TO

REMAIN HIGH.

THOUGH OUR OPERATING RESULTS WERE

STRONG IN 2005, OUR BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE

PREDICTABLE EARNINGS. OUR RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD CAN BE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE

TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES, SEE  CERTAIN

RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BELOW AS WELL AS

RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IS COMPUTED BY

DIVIDING NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY AVERAGE MONTHLY

TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. SEE  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CALCULATION

OF RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BACKLOG REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF OUR FUTURE NET

REVENUES FROM INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE

REVENUE REALIZATION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES

AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE

AROUND THE WORLD. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY LOW INFLATION, LOW OR DECLINING INTEREST RATES,

AND STRONG EQUITY MARKETS. OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE, THESE FACTORS

PROVIDE A POSITIVE CLIMATE FOR OUR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES,

FOR MANY OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES AND FOR WEALTH CREATION, WHICH

CONTRIBUTES TO GROWTH IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH

SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES,

CONTINUED TO RISE AND THE YIELD CURVE CONTINUED TO FLATTEN,

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAINED GENERALLY FAVORABLE DURING 2005, AS

GLOBAL INTEREST RATES REMAINED AT HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS, CORE

INFLATION WAS BROADLY CONTAINED, GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES GENERALLY

ROSE AND CORPORATE ACTIVITY CONTINUED TO IMPROVE. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF HOW MARKET CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE

" CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BELOW AS

WELL AS RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IN 2005 IS SET FORTH BELOW.

GLOBAL.

AFTER STRONG GROWTH IN 2004,

THE GLOBAL ECONOMY REMAINED SOLID IN 2005, DESPITE A BRIEF PERIOD

OF WEAKNESS DURING OUR FISCAL SECOND QUARTER. WORLDWIDE REAL GROSS

DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR, ALTHOUGH LOWER THAN

THE PRIOR YEAR, WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF THE PAST 20 YEARS.

ENERGY PRICES ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE FIRST NINE

MONTHS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, PEAKING AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR FOURTH

QUARTER, BUT THE SHARP INCREASE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GLOBAL GROWTH. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. ECONOMY

PERFORMED WELL AND THE JAPANESE ECONOMY CONTINUED TO GROW

AT A MODERATE PACE, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE CALENDAR

YEAR. THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CONTINUED TO RAISE RATES IN

2005, INCREASING ITS FEDERAL FUNDS RATE TARGET BY A TOTAL OF 200 BASIS

POINTS DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. DESPITE THE INCREASE IN

U.S. SHORT-TERM RATES, FIXED INCOME MARKETS GENERALLY PERFORMED

WELL, AS LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS REMAINED GENERALLY LOW AND CORPORATE

CREDIT SPREADS REMAINED GENERALLY TIGHT. IN THE CURRENCY MARKETS,

THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE MAJOR CURRENCIES,

ALTHOUGH IT WEAKENED AGAINST A NUMBER OF EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES

SUCH AS THE BRAZILIAN REAL, MEXICAN PESO, CHINESE YUAN AND KOREAN

WON. GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS GENERALLY ROSE DURING THE YEAR, WITH

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN MANY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. CORPORATE

ACTIVITY CONTINUED TO IMPROVE DURING THE YEAR. ALTHOUGH EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED VOLUMES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2004, DEBT

UNDERWRITING VOLUMES IMPROVED AND INDUSTRY-WIDE ANNOUNCED AND

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.

UNITED STATES.

THE U.S. ECONOMY

GREW AT A STRONG PACE DURING THE YEAR. REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

ROSE BY APPROXIMATELY 3.5% IN THE 2005 CALENDAR YEAR, DRIVEN

PRINCIPALLY BY CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE HOUSING MARKET AND

CONSUMER SPENDING. DESPITE HURRICANE-RELATED DISRUPTIONS, CONSUMER

SPENDING REACHED ITS HIGHEST RATE OF GROWTH DURING THE THIRD

CALENDAR QUARTER. AFTER SLOWING MODESTLY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2005, THE RATE OF INFLATION INCREASED, PARTICULARLY IN THE THIRD

QUARTER, AS ENERGY PRICES ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY. HOWEVER, MEASURES OF

CORE INFLATION REMAINED BROADLY CONTAINED. IN RESPONSE TO THE

IMPROVING ENVIRONMENT AND RISING INFLATION, THE U.S. FEDERAL

RESERVE RAISED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS RATE TARGET BY 25 BASIS POINTS

IN EACH OF ITS MEETINGS, BRINGING THE RATE TO 4.00% BY THE END OF

OUR FISCAL YEAR. DESPITE THE SHARP RISE IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST

RATES, THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTE YIELD ENDED THE YEAR ONLY

19 BASIS POINTS HIGHER. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. DOLLAR GENERALLY

STRENGTHENED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, FINANCIAL CONDITIONS REMAINED

GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL

AVERAGE, S&P 500 INDEX AND NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX INCREASED BY 4%,

7% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

EUROPE.

THE PACE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH

IN EUROPE REMAINED SLOW AS REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN THE

EUROZONE ECONOMIES GREW BY APPROXIMATELY 1.5% IN THE 2005 CALENDAR

YEAR. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE EUROZONE ECONOMIES SOFTENED IN THE

FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR AS BUSINESS SENTIMENT DETERIORATED AND

ENERGY PRICES ROSE. HOWEVER, CONDITIONS IMPROVED MODESTLY LATER IN

THE YEAR AS CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE

WEAKENING OF THE EURO SUPPORTED HIGHER GROWTH IN EXPORTS AND

INVESTMENT SPENDING. THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK LEFT INTEREST RATES

UNCHANGED THROUGH OUR FISCAL YEAR. IN THE U.K., REAL GROSS DOMESTIC

PRODUCT GROWTH APPEARED TO SLOW

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHARPLY, DECLINING TO APPROXIMATELY

1.8% IN THE 2005 CALENDAR YEAR, REFLECTING SOFTER GROWTH IN

CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENT SPENDING. THE BANK OF ENGLAND REDUCED

INTEREST RATES BY 25 BASIS POINTS AND LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS IN

BOTH THE EUROZONE AND THE U.K. ENDED THE YEAR LOWER. DESPITE THE

MODEST ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE FTSE 100 INDEX INCREASED BY 16% AND

CONTINENTAL EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

ASIA.

JAPANS ECONOMY GREW AT ITS

STRONGEST PACE SINCE 2000, WITH REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWING

BY OVER 2% FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR YEAR. THE RECOVERY

IN DOMESTIC DEMAND AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT DROVE MUCH OF THE

IMPROVEMENT, WHILE EXPORTS IMPROVED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

CALENDAR YEAR. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL TO 4.4% IN 2005 FROM 4.7%

IN 2004. THE BANK OF JAPAN CONTINUED TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL

LIQUIDITY TO THE MARKET AND CONTINUED TO HOLD SHORT-TERM INTEREST

RATES AT ZERO PERCENT THROUGH THE YEAR AND LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS

ENDED THE YEAR SLIGHTLY LOWER. WITH SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES

RISING IN THE U.S., THE YEN WEAKENED AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

REMAINED GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE NIKKEI 225

INDEX INCREASED 36% DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

ELSEWHERE IN ASIA, CHINAS REAL GROSS

DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH REMAINED ROBUST, WITH GROWTH PARTICULARLY

RELIANT ON HIGHER NET EXPORTS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY CHINAS LARGE

CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS. CHINAS MODEST CURRENCY REVALUATION IN

JULY DID NOT RESULT IN FURTHER SIGNIFICANT EXCHANGE RATE

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION. GROWTH IN INDIA REMAINED VERY STRONG,

WHICH, TOGETHER WITH CHINA, SUPPORTED GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE REGION.

EQUITY MARKETS ACROSS THE REGION GENERALLY ROSE, WITH MARKETS IN

SOUTH KOREA AND INDIA POSTING SIGNIFICANT GAINS DURING OUR FISCAL

YEAR.

CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE

SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET,

LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE RISKS,

SEE  RISK MANAGEMENT BELOW. A SUMMARY OF THE MORE IMPORTANT

FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS FOLLOWS BELOW. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS, SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MARKET RISK.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY AND THESE

CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY. UNFAVORABLE OR

UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED,

AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND

PROFITABILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH

CHANGES ARE RAPID, MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTING POSITIONS. MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY AND EQUITY POSITIONS AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE

OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE INCURRED

SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF MARKET TURBULENCE. CONVERSELY, CERTAIN OF

OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE

OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM

OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE

TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE CONTINUED, EVEN AS THE VOLUME AND

NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS HAVE INCREASED. IN ADDITION, THE TREND IN

THE UNDERWRITING BUSINESS TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK RUNNERS AND CO-MANAGERS HANDLING

TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE BOOK RUNNER, MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS ALSO TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS.

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF

BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND

IN THE INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND

OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE BLOCKS OF SECURITIES ARE INCREASINGLY

BEING SOLD IN BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A MARKETED BASIS, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK

THAT GOLDMAN SACHS MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE PURCHASED SECURITIES AT FAVORABLE

PRICES AND MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AS A RESULT. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF

CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO

LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH

TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CLIENTS AND AS A SPECIALIST OR

MARKET MAKER MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM

COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND OTHER INDUSTRY

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE INCREASING USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING,

COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE

ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY

PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF

SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN THE

CONTEXT OF BLOCK TRADES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW.



WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION

TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION

CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING

OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

LIQUIDITY RISK.

LIQUIDITY IS

ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO

CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL

PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE

SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO

OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER

OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR

TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE

PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE

CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY

BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION

OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GOLDMAN SACHS OF A REDUCTION IN OUR

CREDIT RATINGS, SEE  CAPITAL AND FUNDING  CREDIT

RATINGS BELOW.

CREDIT RISK.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE

RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER

ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY

DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF

LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. WE ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT

BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, A DETERIORATION

IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR

OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR

OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR

CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS,

AS HAS THE BREADTH OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT

EXPOSURES. THE SCOPE OF OUR LENDING BUSINESSES HAS ALSO BEEN

EXPANDING AND INCLUDES LOANS TO SMALL AND MID-SIZE BUSINESSES,

WHICH ARE NOT TRADITIONAL GOLDMAN SACHS CLIENTS. AS A CLEARING

MEMBER FIRM, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENT POSITIONS AND WE COULD BE HELD

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. IN

ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE

TO EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY

COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH

WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS

THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE

FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR

FORESEE. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE

INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR

DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

SHORTCOMINGS OR

FAILURES IN OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS, OR EXTERNAL

EVENTS COULD LEAD TO IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL LOSS,

DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY

INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR BUSINESSES

ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A

LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN

MANY CURRENCIES. THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC

GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. DESPITE THE

CONTINGENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE

INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN

WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING

ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED

BY GOLDMAN SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS

AROUND THE WORLD. SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A SIGNIFICANT

REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN

SACHS, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A

DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS

IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES

AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW

WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY EXPOSURES, SEE

 USE OF ESTIMATES BELOW.

FAIR VALUE

THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE OUR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WITH RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, IS FUNDAMENTAL

TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICY. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT

WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION

BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE

SEPARATE OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO THREE CATEGORIES  CASH

FAIR VALUES OF OUR CASH TRADING

INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS, BROKER OR DEALER PRICE QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. THE

TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED IN THIS MANNER INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND AGENCY SECURITIES, OTHER SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS,

LIQUID MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BONDS, LISTED

EQUITIES, MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL

OBLIGATIONS, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS

TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH

INSTRUMENTS MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN HIGH-YIELD DEBT, CORPORATE BANK

LOANS, MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND DISTRESSED DEBT. WE VALUE THESE

INSTRUMENTS INITIALLY AT COST AND GENERALLY DO NOT ADJUST

VALUATIONS UNLESS THERE IS SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE

IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT OR VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS

(SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS

OR CHANGES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING COMPANIES).

WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE, WE USE

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR

ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS.

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS WE OWN (LONG

POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND INSTRUMENTS WE HAVE SOLD

BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES.

IF LIQUIDATING A POSITION IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT ITS PREVAILING

MARKET PRICE, OUR VALUATION IS ADJUSTED GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET

EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED POLICIES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH

AS FOR HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED

TO DETERMINE THIS ADJUSTMENT.

FAIR VALUES OF OUR EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC

DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING VALUATION MODELS. WE USE A VARIETY OF

VALUATION MODELS INCLUDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED

CASH FLOWS AND OPTION-PRICING MODELS. THE VALUATION MODELS THAT WE

USE TO DERIVE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES REQUIRE INPUTS

INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT

CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES AND CORRELATIONS

OF SUCH INPUTS. THE SELECTION OF A MODEL TO VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE

DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF, AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT

IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF PRICING

INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. WE GENERALLY USE SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE VERIFY THE VALUES PRODUCED

BY OUR PRICING MODELS TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES

THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND

OPTIONS, MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT

BECAUSE MARKET PRICES ARE READILY AVAILABLE. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES

THAT TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS, MODEL SELECTION REQUIRES MORE

JUDGMENT BECAUSE SUCH INSTRUMENTS TEND TO BE MORE COMPLEX AND

PRICING INFORMATION IS LESS AVAILABLE IN THESE MARKETS. PRICE

TRANSPARENCY IS INHERENTLY MORE LIMITED FOR MORE COMPLEX STRUCTURES

BECAUSE THEY OFTEN COMBINE ONE OR MORE PRODUCT TYPES, REQUIRING

ADDITIONAL INPUTS SUCH AS CORRELATIONS AND VOLATILITIES. AS MARKETS

CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MORE PRICING INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE,

WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND REFINE THE MODELS THAT WE USE.

AT THE INCEPTION OF AN OTC DERIVATIVE

CONTRACT (DAY ONE), WE VALUE THE CONTRACT AT THE MODEL VALUE IF WE

CAN VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. WHEN APPROPRIATE,

VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS

LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS. THESE

ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED

POLICIES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR HIGHLY ILLIQUID

POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THESE

ADJUSTMENTS.

WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY ALL OF THE

SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND VERIFY THE

MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, WE VALUE THE CONTRACT AT THE

TRANSACTION PRICE AT INCEPTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, RECORD NO DAY ONE

GAIN OR LOSS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF)

ISSUE NO. 02-3, ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN

ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

FOLLOWING DAY ONE, WE ADJUST THE

INPUTS TO OUR VALUATION MODELS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT CHANGES IN

THESE INPUTS CAN BE VERIFIED BY SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR BROKER QUOTES, OR CAN BE

DERIVED FROM OTHER SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUCH AS EMPIRICAL MARKET

DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD

PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR JAPANESE YEN-DENOMINATED

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG

INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVALUATION. WE

HEDGE OUR ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON

OUR INVESTMENT IN SMFG BY BORROWING JAPANESE YEN. FOREIGN

EXCHANGE REVALUATION ON THE INVESTMENT AND THE RELATED

BORROWING ARE GENERALLY EQUAL AND OFFSETTING. FOR

EXAMPLE, IF THE JAPANESE YEN APPRECIATES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR,

THE U.S. DOLLAR CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

SMFG INVESTMENT WILL INCREASE AND THE U.S. DOLLAR

CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED BORROWING WILL ALSO

INCREASE BY AN AMOUNT THAT IS GENERALLY EQUAL AND

OFFSETTING.

(3)

EXCLUDES AN ECONOMIC HEDGE ON THE UNRESTRICTED

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG. AS OF NOVEMBER 25,

2005, THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS HEDGE WAS $1.51 BILLION

AND IS REFLECTED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD,

BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE OR

SELL THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT IN SMFG,

SEE BELOW.

OUR PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY

THEIR NATURE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH

INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY CARRIED AT COST AS AN APPROXIMATION OF

FAIR VALUE. ADJUSTMENTS TO CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE IF THERE ARE

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE. DOWNWARD

ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS, IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN REACHING THAT

DETERMINATION, WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO, THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANIES OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO BUDGETS OR PROJECTIONS, TRENDS

WITHIN SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS, UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODELS, EXPECTED

EXIT TIMING AND STRATEGY, AND ANY SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS CONVERSION FEATURES AND

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.

OUR PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS,

WHICH TEND TO BE LARGE, CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS THAT RESULT FROM

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, ARE

VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES DISCOUNTED BASED ON PREDETERMINED

WRITTEN POLICIES FOR NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY.

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DERIVED

FROM A MODEL THAT INCORPORATES SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE AND CREDIT

SPREADS, THE IMPACT OF NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY, AND THE

DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE. THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENT IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO MOVEMENTS IN THE

SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE. AS A RESULT OF TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND

THE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE, THE

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT

AND CHANGES IN SMFGS COMMON

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STOCK PRICE IS NONLINEAR. DURING OUR

FISCAL YEAR, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT (EXCLUDING THE

ECONOMIC HEDGE ON THE UNRESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

UNDERLYING ONE-THIRD OF OUR INVESTMENT) INCREASED 85% (EXPRESSED IN

JAPANESE YEN), PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE SMFG COMMON

STOCK PRICE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE IMPACT OF PASSAGE OF TIME

IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON

STOCK.

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS GENERALLY NONTRANSFERABLE, BUT IS FREELY

CONVERTIBLE INTO SMFG COMMON STOCK. RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO

HEDGE OR SELL ONE-THIRD OF THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING OUR

INVESTMENT IN SMFG LAPSED IN FEBRUARY 2005. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005,

WE WERE FULLY HEDGED WITH RESPECT TO THESE UNRESTRICTED

SHARES. UNDER OUR INITIAL AGREEMENT WITH SMFG, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR

ABILITY TO HEDGE OR SELL THE REMAINING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT IN SMFG LAPSE IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON

FEBRUARY 7, 2006 AND FEBRUARY 7, 2007. IN CONNECTION

WITH A PUBLIC OFFERING BY SMFG OF ITS COMMON STOCK, WE HAVE

SEPARATELY AGREED WITH SMFG THAT THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE TO

LAPSE ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006 WILL INSTEAD LAPSE ON MARCH 9, 2006.

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2006, THE CONVERSION PRICE OF

OUR SMFG PREFERRED STOCK INTO SHARES OF SMFG COMMON STOCK IS

¥320,900. THIS PRICE IS SUBJECT TO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IF THE PRICE

OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF CONVERSION IS LESS THAN THE

CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT TO A FLOOR OF ¥105,800).

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

A CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE, INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING

AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY VALUED AND THAT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS ARE RELIABLE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN

VALUING INSTRUMENTS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

WE EMPLOY AN OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT

INCLUDES APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT,

INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

OVERSIGHT OF CONTROL AND VALUATION POLICIES AND FOR REPORTING THE

RESULTS OF THESE POLICIES TO OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE SEEK TO

MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL FUNCTIONS

ARE PERFORMED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS. WE EMPLOY PROCEDURES FOR

THE APPROVAL OF NEW TRANSACTION TYPES AND MARKETS, PRICE

VERIFICATION, REVIEW OF DAILY PROFIT AND LOSS, AND REVIEW OF

VALUATION MODELS BY PERSONNEL WITH APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE

OF RELEVANT PRODUCTS AND MARKETS. THESE PROCEDURES ARE PERFORMED BY

PERSONNEL INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS. FOR TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS WITH LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY, WE

EMPLOY, WHERE POSSIBLE, PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE COMPARISONS WITH

SIMILAR OBSERVABLE POSITIONS, ANALYSIS OF ACTUAL TO PROJECTED CASH

FLOWS, COMPARISONS WITH SUBSEQUENT SALES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH

SENIOR BUSINESS LEADERS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE

THE RISKS INHERENT IN OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING

BUSINESSES, SEE

 RISK MANAGEMENT BELOW.

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS,

PRINCIPALLY SLK LLC (SLK) IN FISCAL 2000, THE AYCO COMPANY,

L.P. (AYCO) IN FISCAL 2003, COGENTRIX ENERGY, INC. (COGENTRIX) IN

FISCAL 2004 AND NATIONAL ENERGY & GAS TRANSMISSION, INC. (NEGT) IN

FISCAL 2005, WE HAVE ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN

EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL.

WE TEST THE GOODWILL IN

EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BY

COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WITH

ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. WE DERIVE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF

OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE-EARNINGS MULTIPLES.

WE DERIVE THE NET BOOK VALUE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS BY

ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT

THE ASSETS OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT. OUR LAST ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT

TEST WAS PERFORMED DURING OUR FISCAL 2005 FOURTH QUARTER AND NO

IMPAIRMENT WAS IDENTIFIED.

A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN

GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE

MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND/OR IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

INCLUDING (I) CHANGES IN MARKET STRUCTURE THAT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, (II) AN ADVERSE ACTION OR

ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR OR (III) A DEFAULT EVENT UNDER A

POWER CONTRACT OR PHYSICAL DAMAGE OR OTHER ADVERSE EVENTS IMPACTING

THE UNDERLYING POWER GENERATION FACILITIES.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN

ESTIMATES. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES IS ALSO

IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY

ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL

LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

AND TAX AUDITS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN

BE ESTIMATED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING

FOR CONTINGENCIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING

THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION

AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS

AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER CONSIDERING,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE OR PROCEEDING, OUR

EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN SIMILAR CASES OR

PROCEEDINGS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF LEGAL COUNSEL. GIVEN THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF OUR LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH

NET REVENUES

2005 VERSUS 2004.

OUR NET REVENUES

WERE $24.78 BILLION IN 2005, AN INCREASE OF 21% COMPARED WITH

2004, REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

AND ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES AS WELL AS HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES

IN FICC, AS ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES PERFORMED WELL. DURING 2005, FICC

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, TIGHT, BUT VOLATILE, CREDIT SPREADS,

HIGHER ENERGY PRICES AND A FLATTER YIELD CURVE. NET REVENUES IN

EQUITIES ALSO IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE BUSINESS. EQUITIES

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY

PRICES, IMPROVED CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED LOW LEVELS

OF MARKET VOLATILITY. NET REVENUES IN OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

BUSINESS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A GAIN

ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AS

WELL AS GAINS FROM REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. THE STRONG

NET REVENUE GROWTH IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER

CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING NET REVENUES WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING AND IMPROVED RESULTS IN FINANCIAL

ADVISORY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE

CORPORATE ACTIVITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUES IN

EQUITY UNDERWRITING.

2004 VERSUS 2003.

OUR NET REVENUES

WERE $20.55 BILLION IN 2004, AN INCREASE OF 28% COMPARED WITH

2003, REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES, AND

INVESTMENT BANKING. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN FICC, AS

ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES AND REGIONS PERFORMED WELL IN A GENERALLY

FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. NET REVENUES IN OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

BUSINESS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, DUE TO AN UNREALIZED GAIN ON

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG, AS WELL

AS GAINS FROM OTHER CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION,

EQUITIES NET REVENUES IMPROVED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS EARLY IN

2004. EQUITIES OPERATED IN A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT AFTER OUR

FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2004, AS VOLATILITY LEVELS CONTINUED TO

DECLINE AND MARKETS GENERALLY LACKED DIRECTION BEFORE MOVING HIGHER

IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

SECURITIES SERVICES GENERATED STRONG REVENUE GROWTH, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCREASED INCENTIVE FEES

AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES SERVICES.

IN INVESTMENT BANKING, NET REVENUES ALSO INCREASED, HIGHLIGHTED BY

STRONG GROWTH IN BOTH OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND EQUITY

UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE CORPORATE ACTIVITY.

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES INCLUDES ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD STRICTLY FOR

CAPITAL APPRECIATION, HAVE A DEFINED EXIT STRATEGY AND

ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT HOLD REAL ESTATE

ASSETS SUCH AS GOLF COURSES AND HOTELS IN ASIA, BUT

EXCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT PRIMARILY HOLD

FINANCIAL ASSETS. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MEANINGFUL TO

REVIEW NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES EXCLUDING EXPENSES

RELATED TO THESE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES IN ORDER TO

EVALUATE TRENDS IN NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. REVENUES RELATED TO

SUCH ENTITIES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

2005 VERSUS 2004.

OPERATING EXPENSES

WERE $16.51 BILLION FOR 2005, 19% ABOVE 2004. COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $11.69 BILLION INCREASED 21% COMPARED WITH

2004, RESULTING FROM HIGHER DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, REFLECTING

HIGHER NET REVENUES, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. THE RATIO

OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2005 WAS 47.2%

COMPARED WITH 46.7%

(2)

FOR 2004. EMPLOYMENT LEVELS

INCREASED 8% COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 2004.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF $4.82 BILLION

FOR 2005 INCREASED 14% COMPARED WITH 2004. EXCLUDING

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES, NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE 8% HIGHER THAN

2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND EXCHANGE

FEES, REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN FICC AND EQUITIES,

INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES, REFLECTING HIGHER LEGAL AND CONSULTING

FEES, AND HIGHER OTHER EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED

LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND HIGHER CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN 2005

INCLUDED $37 MILLION OF NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDED IN OTHER EXPENSES) AND $36 MILLION

OF REAL ESTATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELOCATION OF

OFFICE SPACE (INCLUDED IN OCCUPANCY). NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN

2004 INCLUDED $103 MILLION OF NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, $62 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR JOINT VENTURE IN CHINA (INCLUDED IN MARKET

DEVELOPMENT) AND $41 MILLION OF REAL ESTATE EXIT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR OFFICE SPACE (INCLUDED IN

OCCUPANCY AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION).

(2)

FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2004, INCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION OF EMPLOYEE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2004 VERSUS 2003.

OPERATING EXPENSES

WERE $13.87 BILLION FOR 2004, 20% ABOVE 2003. COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $9.65 BILLION INCREASED 28% COMPARED WITH

2003, DUE TO HIGHER DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, REFLECTING HIGHER

NET REVENUES, AND INCREASED EMPLOYMENT LEVELS. THE RATIO OF

EMPLOYMENT LEVELS

INCREASED 6% COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 2003.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF $4.22 BILLION

EXPENSES INCLUDED NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS OF $103 MILLION FOR 2004 COMPARED WITH $159 MILLION

FOR 2003. EXCLUDING THESE PROVISIONS, OTHER EXPENSES

INCREASED $258 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF

CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, INCREASED LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND

HIGHER CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND EXCHANGE

FEES INCREASED, REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN CERTAIN OF

OUR BUSINESSES, AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE HIGHER,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING $62 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR JOINT VENTURE IN CHINA, AS WELL AS HIGHER

LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE

HIGHER, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES. THESE

INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED AMORTIZATION OF

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (2003 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$188 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN RESPECT OF OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS)

AS WELL AS LOWER OCCUPANCY AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

EXPENSES. TOTAL EXIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL

OFFICE SPACE (INCLUDED IN OCCUPANCY AND DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION) WERE $41 MILLION FOR 2004 COMPARED WITH $153 MILLION

FOR 2003.

PROVISION FOR TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

2005 WAS 32.0% COMPARED WITH 31.8% FOR 2004. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT

OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS IN 2005, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

2005 WOULD HAVE BEEN 33.3%.

(2)

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

FOR 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER BENEFIT

FROM TAX CREDITS IN 2005. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2004

WAS 31.8%, DOWN FROM 32.4% FOR 2003. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE

INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2004 AS COMPARED WITH 2003 REFLECTED LOWER

STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND THE EFFECT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE CAN

VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

GEOGRAPHIC AND BUSINESS MIX OF OUR EARNINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR TAX

CREDITS AND THE EFFECT OF TAX AUDITS. CERTAIN OF THESE AND OTHER

FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR HISTORY OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN INTO

ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR NET DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES.

(1)

FOR THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003, INCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION OF EMPLOYEE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND

ACQUISITION AWARDS OF $61 MILLION AND $122 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES WAS

47.0% AND 46.9%, RESPECTIVELY.

(2)

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE PROVISION FOR TAXES,

ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, BY PRE-TAX EARNINGS. THE IMPACT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS DECREASED THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE BY 1.3% FOR 2005. WE BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

AUDIT SETTLEMENTS PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL BASIS FOR PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES.

EXPENSE RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR EQUITY AWARDS. IN ADDITION, OTHER

EXPENSES INCREASED PRINCIPALLY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE PUBLIC COMMON STOCK OFFERINGS

AND INDUSTRY-WIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. THE INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING NET REVENUES PRIMARILY REFLECTS HIGHER LEVELS OF

ACTIVITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER SECTORS. OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2004 WAS HIGHER THAN AT THE END OF

2003.

(1)

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $2.97 BILLION

FOR 2004 INCREASED 19% COMPARED WITH 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OCCUPANCY EXPENSES,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER EXIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN

OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE, AND REDUCED AMORTIZATION OF IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS 2003 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN RESPECT

OF CERTAIN DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

EXPENSES WERE ALSO LOWER. PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $401 MILLION IN

2004 INCREASED 94% COMPARED WITH 2003.

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPONENTS.



FICC.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN AND TRADE INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS,

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND LOANS, CURRENCIES, AND COMMODITIES, STRUCTURE AND

ENTER INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY

TRADING AND INVESTING.



EQUITIES.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN, TRADE AND ACT AS A SPECIALIST FOR EQUITIES AND

EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS, STRUCTURE AND ENTER INTO EQUITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND

ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY TRADING. WE ALSO EXECUTE AND CLEAR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON

MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM OUR CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE

MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS

DERIVED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WHEN THE RETURN ON A FUNDS INVESTMENTS

EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS (MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES), AS WELL AS GAINS OR

LOSSES RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS

MARKED-TO-MARKET DAILY AND, THEREFORE, ITS VALUE AND OUR NET

REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS. IN

ADDITION, NET REVENUES DERIVED FROM OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN

PRIVATELY HELD CONCERNS AND IN REAL ESTATE MAY FLUCTUATE

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE REVALUATION OR SALE OF THESE

INVESTMENTS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE

TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE

OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

GIVEN PERIOD.

NET REVENUES FROM PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE MANAGEMENT FEES GENERATED FROM OUR

MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS. THESE MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN THE

NET REVENUES OF THE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

SEGMENT.

NET REVENUES IN

INCREASED 23% COMPARED WITH 2004. NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $8.48 BILLION

INCREASED 16% COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS (WHICH

INCLUDES DISTRESSED INVESTING) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, INTEREST

RATE PRODUCTS AND CURRENCIES. NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES AND

MORTGAGES WERE STRONG, BUT ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH

2004. DURING 2005, FICC OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, TIGHT, BUT

VOLATILE, CREDIT SPREADS, HIGHER ENERGY PRICES AND A FLATTER YIELD

CURVE. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $5.65 BILLION INCREASED 21%

COMPARED WITH 2004, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN

OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE AND PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESSES. THE

INCREASE IN OUR CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESSES REFLECTED IMPROVED

RESULTS IN DERIVATIVES AND SHARES, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA,

AS WELL AS IN CONVERTIBLES. IN ADDITION, RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL

STRATEGIES REFLECTED STRENGTH ACROSS ALL REGIONS. DURING 2005,

EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY GENERALLY

HIGHER EQUITY PRICES, IMPROVED CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND

CONTINUED LOW LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

RECORDED NET REVENUES OF $2.23 BILLION, DUE TO A $1.48 BILLION

GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED

STOCK OF SMFG AND $753 MILLION IN GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM

OTHER CORPORATE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $10.14 BILLION

FOR 2005 INCREASED 22% COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING HIGHER

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT AND,

TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. EXCLUDING

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES, THE INCREASE IN NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND EXCHANGE

FEES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN FICC AND

EQUITIES, AND HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES, DUE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND

CONSULTING FEES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $6.22 BILLION IN 2005

INCREASED 23% COMPARED WITH 2004.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2004 VERSUS 2003.

NET REVENUES IN

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS OF $13.33 BILLION FOR 2004

INCREASED 28% COMPARED WITH 2003. NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $7.32 BILLION

INCREASED 31% COMPARED WITH 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS AND

COMMODITIES, AS WELL AS IMPROVED PERFORMANCES IN CURRENCIES AND

MORTGAGES. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS WERE

STRONG, BUT WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2003. DURING 2004, FICC

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, RISING ENERGY PRICES, NARROW CORPORATE

CREDIT SPREADS AND LOW, ALTHOUGH RISING, INTEREST RATES. THE YIELD

CURVE REMAINED STEEP IN 2004, BUT FLATTENED IN THE SECOND HALF OF

THE YEAR. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $4.67 BILLION INCREASED

9% COMPARED WITH 2003, REFLECTING HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR

CUSTOMER FRANCHISE BUSINESS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY IN

SHARES AND DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES WERE HIGHER IN

OUR PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESS. DURING 2004, EQUITIES OPERATED

IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY EARLY IN THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY HIGHER

EQUITY PRICES. HOWEVER, VOLATILITY LEVELS CONTINUED TO DECLINE

DURING 2004. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET REVENUES OF $1.33 BILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN UNREALIZED GAIN RELATED TO OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG OF $771 MILLION,

AS WELL AS GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM OTHER CORPORATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $8.29 BILLION

FOR 2004 INCREASED 19% COMPARED WITH 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT.

OTHER EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION

OF CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS AND INCREASED LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND EXCHANGE FEES WERE

HIGHER, REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES, PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

CONSULTING AND LEGAL FEES, AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

INCREASED, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AMORTIZATION OF

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS 2003 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

IN RESPECT OF OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, OCCUPANCY

EXPENSES DECREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER EXIT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE, AND

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WERE LOWER. PRE-TAX EARNINGS

OF $5.04 BILLION IN 2004 INCREASED 44% COMPARED WITH 2003.

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES

SERVICES SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO COMPONENTS.



ASSET MANAGEMENT.

ASSET MANAGEMENT PROVIDES INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND FINANCIAL

PLANNING SERVICES AND OFFERS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ACROSS ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES TO A

DIVERSE GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE AND PRIMARILY GENERATES

REVENUES IN THE FORM OF MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES.



SECURITIES SERVICES.

SECURITIES SERVICES PROVIDES PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES,

FINANCING SERVICES AND SECURITIES LENDING SERVICES TO MUTUAL FUNDS, PENSION FUNDS,

HEDGE FUNDS, FOUNDATIONS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE, AND GENERATES

REVENUES PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS OR FEES.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY

GENERATE FEES AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSET VALUE. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT

INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS RETURN OR WHEN THE

RETURN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT EXCEEDS SPECIFIED BENCHMARK

RETURNS OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGETS. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED

WHEN THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDS AND THEY ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO

ADJUSTMENT. WE HAVE NUMEROUS INCENTIVE FEE ARRANGEMENTS, MANY OF

WHICH HAVE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PERIODS THAT END ON DECEMBER 31

AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT THEREAFTER. FOR THAT REASON,

INCENTIVE FEES ARE SEASONALLY WEIGHTED EACH YEAR TO OUR FIRST

FISCAL QUARTER. DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF NET REVENUES IN OUR FIRST

FISCAL QUARTER OF 2006, THESE INCENTIVE FEES MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THAT QUARTER.

2005 INCREASED 23% COMPARED WITH 2004. ASSET MANAGEMENT NET

REVENUES OF $2.96 BILLION INCREASED 16% COMPARED WITH 2004,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MANAGEMENT FEES, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT. DURING 2005, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT INCREASED

18% TO $532 BILLION, REFLECTING NET ASSET INFLOWS OF $63 BILLION

ACROSS ALL ASSET CLASSES AS WELL AS MARKET APPRECIATION OF

$17 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN EQUITY ASSETS. SECURITIES SERVICES

NET REVENUES OF $1.79 BILLION FOR 2005 INCREASED 38% COMPARED

WITH 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GLOBAL

CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES LENDING AND MARGIN LENDING.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $3.07 BILLION

FOR 2005 INCREASED 26% COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT.

OTHER EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE HIGHER,

PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASED CONSULTING AND LEGAL FEES. PRE-TAX

EARNINGS OF $1.68 BILLION INCREASED 18% COMPARED WITH 2004.

2004 VERSUS 2003.

NET REVENUES IN

2004 INCREASED 35% COMPARED WITH 2003. ASSET MANAGEMENT NET

REVENUES OF $2.55 BILLION INCREASED 38% COMPARED WITH 2003,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES AND A FULL YEAR CONTRIBUTION FROM AYCO.

DURING 2004, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT INCREASED 21% TO $452 BILLION,

REFLECTING NET ASSET INFLOWS OF $52 BILLION ACROSS ALL

ASSET CLASSES, AS WELL AS MARKET APPRECIATION OF $27 BILLION,

PRIMARILY IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME ASSETS. SECURITIES SERVICES

NET REVENUES OF $1.30 BILLION INCREASED 29% COMPARED WITH 2003,

SECURITIES LENDING AND MARGIN LENDING.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $2.43 BILLION

FOR 2004 INCREASED 29% COMPARED WITH 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. IN

ADDITION, OTHER EXPENSES INCREASED, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO HIGHER

LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING INCREASED ASSET MANAGEMENT

DISTRIBUTION COSTS. PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE ALSO HIGHER, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING INCREASED LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES. THESE INCREASES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND

OCCUPANCY EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER EXIT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE. PRE-TAX

EARNINGS OF $1.42 BILLION INCREASED 47% COMPARED WITH 2003.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE

MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL

AND OTHER INTERESTS IN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIZATION VEHICLES; HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT,

INTERESTS IN LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND PREFERRED AND

COMMON STOCK IN OTHER NONCONSOLIDATED VEHICLES; ENTERING INTO

INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY, COMMODITY AND CREDIT

DERIVATIVES; ENTERING INTO OPERATING LEASES; AND PROVIDING

GUARANTEES, INDEMNIFICATIONS, LOAN COMMITMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR

A VARIETY OF BUSINESS PURPOSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

SECURITIZATION OF COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY

AND AUTO LOANS, GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS. OTHER REASONS FOR ENTERING INTO THESE

ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE UNDERWRITING CLIENT SECURITIZATION

TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKING

INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL

ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS; PROVIDING INVESTORS WITH CREDIT-LINKED AND

ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES; AND RECEIVING OR PROVIDING LETTERS OF

CREDIT TO SATISFY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE

CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) AND

QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES) ARE CRITICAL TO THE

FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE

MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MARKETS, SINCE

THEY PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY TO FINANCIAL ASSETS BY OFFERING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS CREATED THROUGH

THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. OUR FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN, AND

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH, SUCH NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE WE EXERT SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE OVER AN ENTITY AND APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

CAPITAL AND FUNDING

CAPITAL

THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WE HOLD IS

PRINCIPALLY DETERMINED BY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, RATING

AGENCY GUIDELINES, SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUR OVERALL

RISK PROFILE, WHICH IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION

OF OUR TRADING AND INVESTING POSITIONS. GOLDMAN SACHS TOTAL

CAPITAL (TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS)

INCREASED 21% TO $128.01 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 COMPARED

WITH $105.78 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004. SEE  RISK

MANAGEMENT  LIQUIDITY RISK  CASH FLOWS BELOW FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW WE DEPLOYED CAPITAL RAISED AS PART OF OUR

FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THE INCREASE IN TOTAL CAPITAL

RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS TO

$100.01 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 FROM $80.70 BILLION AS

OF NOVEMBER 2004. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 WAS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS. WE

SWAP A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR

OBLIGATIONS WITH SHORT-TERM FLOATING INTEREST RATES IN

ORDER TO MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS. SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, OUR

RATIO OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS TO TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY HAS

BEEN INCREASING. THE GROWTH IN OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS HAS BEEN

DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY (I) OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE A PORTION OF OUR

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WITH LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND PRE-FUND

NEAR-TERM REFINANCING REQUIREMENTS, IN LIGHT OF THE FAVORABLE DEBT

FINANCING ENVIRONMENT, AND (II) THE NEED TO INCREASE TOTAL

CAPITAL IN RESPONSE TO GROWTH IN OUR TRADING AND INVESTING

BUSINESSES.

EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK HAS A

REPRESENTED BY

1,000 DEPOSITARY SHARES AND IS REDEEMABLE AT OUR

OPTION AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25,000 PLUS DECLARED AND

UNPAID DIVIDENDS. OUR ABILITY TO DECLARE OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON, OR

PURCHASE, REDEEM OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE, OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO PAY OR SET ASIDE

FULL DIVIDENDS ON OUR PREFERRED STOCK FOR THE LATEST COMPLETED

DIVIDEND PERIOD. ALL PREFERRED STOCK ALSO HAS A PREFERENCE OVER OUR

COMMON STOCK UPON LIQUIDATION.

OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS

INTENDED TO HELP MAINTAIN OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT

APPROPRIATE LEVELS AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE

COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION.

THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS BEEN EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR

OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES AND IS INFLUENCED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

THE LEVEL OF OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, OUR OVERALL CAPITAL

POSITION, EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED AND EXERCISES OF EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS, THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

DURING 2005, WE REPURCHASED 63.7 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $7.11 BILLION,

AND DURING 2004, WE REPURCHASED 18.7 MILLION SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $1.81 BILLION. THE AVERAGE

PRICE PAID PER SHARE FOR REPURCHASED SHARES WAS $111.57 AND $96.29

FOR THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF REPURCHASES IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

PRIMARILY REFLECTS OUR DECISION TO MANAGE THE GROWTH OF OUR COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN ADDITION, TO SATISFY MINIMUM STATUTORY

EMPLOYEE TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF

SHARES UNDERLYING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, WE CANCELLED 1.6 MILLION

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT A TOTAL COST OF $163 MILLION

IN 2005 AND WE CANCELLED 9.1 MILLION RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT

A TOTAL COST OF $870 MILLION IN 2004. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, WE

WERE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO 42.7 MILLION ADDITIONAL

SHARES OF STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, SEE MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS

A LARGE PORTION OF OUR SECURED

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ARE SIMILAR IN NATURE TO OUR OTHER

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING SOURCES SUCH AS SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE. THESE SECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

PROVIDE GOLDMAN SACHS WITH A MORE STABLE SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY THAN

UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AS THEY ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO

CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS DUE TO UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. OUR

UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS INCLUDE EXTENDIBLE DEBT IF THE

EARLIEST MATURITY OCCURS WITHIN ONE YEAR OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT

DATE. EXTENDIBLE DEBT IS DEBT THAT ALLOWS THE HOLDER THE RIGHT TO

EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE AT PREDETERMINED PERIODS DURING THE

CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENT. THESE BORROWINGS CAN BE, AND IN

THE PAST GENERALLY HAVE BEEN, EXTENDED. SEE  RISK MANAGEMENT 

CREDIT RATINGS

WE RELY UPON THE SHORT-TERM AND

LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING

IS INFLUENCED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT

WHEN WE ARE COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND WHEN WE SEEK TO ENGAGE

IN LONGER TERM TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES. WE BELIEVE

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT RATING

AGENCIES ASSESSMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT AND

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY OF

OUR EARNINGS, OUR CAPITAL BASE, OUR FRANCHISE, REPUTATION AND

MANAGEMENT, OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE EXTERNAL OPERATING

ENVIRONMENT. SEE  CERTAIN RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

THROUGH 2069. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC ESCALATION

PROVISIONS FOR INCREASES IN REAL ESTATE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES.

DURING OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF

2005, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A NEW WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK

CITY, WITH INITIAL OCCUPANCY SCHEDULED FOR 2009, AT AN EXPECTED

COST OF $2.3 BILLION TO $2.5 BILLION. GOLDMAN SACHS WILL

PARTIALLY FINANCE THE PROJECT WITH TAX-EXEMPT LIBERTY BONDS. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005, WE BORROWED APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF LIBERTY BONDS AND MAY BORROW UP TO AN ADDITIONAL

$250 MILLION THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL LIBERTY BONDS BEFORE 2010. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, WE HAD

OUTSTANDING CONSTRUCTION-RELATED COMMITMENTS OF $47 MILLION IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS PROJECT. INCLUDED IN OUR FUTURE MINIMUM RENTAL

PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE LEASE AGREEMENTS IS $309 MILLION

RELATED TO A 64-YEAR GROUND LEASE FOR THE LAND ON WHICH OUR WORLD

HEADQUARTERS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED, OF WHICH $161 MILLION IS A

LUMP-SUM PAYMENT DUE BY JUNE 2007. SEE NOTE 6 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING

OUR LEASES.

OUR OCCUPANCY EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH OFFICE SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT

REQUIREMENTS. THIS EXCESS SPACE, THE COST OF WHICH IS CHARGED TO

EARNINGS AS INCURRED, IS BEING HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH OR TO

REPLACE CURRENTLY OCCUPIED SPACE THAT WE MAY EXIT IN THE FUTURE. WE

REGULARLY EVALUATE OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE SPACE CAPACITY IN

RELATION TO CURRENT AND PROJECTED STAFFING LEVELS. WE MAY INCUR

EXIT COSTS IN 2006 AND THEREAFTER TO THE EXTENT WE (I) REDUCE

OUR SPACE CAPACITY OR (II) COMMIT TO, OR OCCUPY, NEW PROPERTIES

2004. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL LENDING

ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE WILLIAM STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM, AND

SUCH COMMITMENTS WERE GENERALLY EXTENDED IN CONNECTION WITH

CONTINGENT ACQUISITION FINANCING AND OTHER TYPES OF CORPORATE

LENDING. SINCE THESE COMMITMENTS MAY EXPIRE UNUSED, THE TOTAL

COMMITMENT AMOUNT DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THE ACTUAL FUTURE

CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK ON THESE

COMMITMENTS BY SYNDICATING ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF

COMMITMENTS TO OTHER INVESTORS. IN ADDITION, COMMITMENTS THAT ARE

EXTENDED FOR CONTINGENT ACQUISITION FINANCING ARE OFTEN SHORT-TERM

IN NATURE, AS BORROWERS OFTEN REPLACE THEM WITH OTHER FUNDING

SOURCES. WITH RESPECT TO THE WILLIAM STREET CREDIT EXTENSION

PROGRAM, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMMITMENTS EXTENDED ARE TO

INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BORROWERS. WITH RESPECT TO THESE

COMMITMENTS, WE HAVE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION PROVIDED TO US BY SMFG,

WHICH IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS WE REALIZE ON

APPROVED LOAN COMMITMENTS, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.00 BILLION.

IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN

CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR 70%

OF THE SECOND LOSS ON SUCH COMMITMENTS, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF

$1.13 BILLION. WE ALSO USE OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE

CERTAIN WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENTS NOT COVERED BY SMFG.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, WE HAD

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY

(CSE). AS SUCH, GOLDMAN SACHS IS SUBJECT TO GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION

AND EXAMINATION BY THE SEC AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, GOLDMAN

SACHS WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CSE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE EUROPEAN UNIONS EUROPEAN

FINANCIAL GROUPS DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 2002/87/EC) INTRODUCED

CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE WAY FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN EUROPE ARE REGULATED.

AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CONDUCTED IN

OTHERWISE UNREGULATED ENTITIES ARE NOW SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FORMS OF

MARKET RISK

THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF OUR TRADING AND INVESTING POSITIONS IS REFERRED TO

AS MARKET RISK. SUCH POSITIONS RESULT FROM MARKET-MAKING,

SPECIALIST, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING, AND UNDERWRITING

ACTIVITIES.

CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE

EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND

COMMODITY PRICES. A DESCRIPTION OF EACH MARKET RISK CATEGORY IS SET

FORTH BELOW.



INTEREST RATE RISKS PRIMARILY RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE

AND CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE, THE VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, MORTGAGE

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF

INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, EQUITY BASKETS AND EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD

PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD

PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL,

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THESE RISKS BY

DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES, CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING

HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY

HEDGE A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCKS BY TAKING AN OFFSETTING POSITION

IN A RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE

AN EXPOSURE MAY, HOWEVER, BE LIMITED BY ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE

LIQUIDITY OF THE SECURITY OR THE RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT AND IN

THE CORRELATION OF PRICE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND RELATED

HEDGE INSTRUMENT.

84

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION TO APPLYING BUSINESS

JUDGMENT, SENIOR MANAGEMENT USES A NUMBER OF QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO

MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. THESE TOOLS INCLUDE.



RISK LIMITS BASED ON A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE REFERRED TO AS VAR,

WHICH ARE UPDATED AND MONITORED ON A DAILY BASIS;



SCENARIO ANALYSES, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT MEASURE THE

POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON OUR NET REVENUES OF VARIOUS MARKET EVENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, A LARGE WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT MOVES IN SELECTED SOVEREIGN MARKETS; AND



INVENTORY POSITION LIMITS FOR SELECTED BUSINESS UNITS.

VAR

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF

GOLDMAN SACHS TRADING POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS

OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

FOR THE VAR NUMBERS REPORTED BELOW, A

ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL WERE USED. THIS

MEANS THAT THERE IS A 1 IN 20 CHANCE THAT DAILY TRADING NET

REVENUES WILL FALL BELOW THE EXPECTED DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES BY

AN AMOUNT AT LEAST AS LARGE AS THE REPORTED VAR. THUS, SHORTFALLS

FROM EXPECTED TRADING NET REVENUES ON A SINGLE TRADING DAY GREATER

THAN THE REPORTED VAR WOULD BE ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR, ON AVERAGE,

ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. SHORTFALLS ON A SINGLE DAY CAN EXCEED REPORTED

VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. SHORTFALLS CAN ALSO ACCUMULATE OVER A

LONGER TIME HORIZON SUCH AS A NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

THE VAR NUMBERS BELOW ARE SHOWN

SEPARATELY FOR INTEREST RATE, EQUITY, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS FOR OUR OVERALL TRADING POSITIONS. THE VAR

NUMBERS IN EACH RISK CATEGORY INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING PRODUCT

POSITIONS AND RELATED HEDGES THAT MAY INCLUDE POSITIONS IN OTHER

PRODUCT AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HEDGE OF A FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD

MAY INCLUDE AN INTEREST RATE FUTURES POSITION, AND THE HEDGE OF A

LONG CORPORATE BOND POSITION MAY INCLUDE A SHORT POSITION IN THE

RELATED EQUITY.

THE MODELING OF THE RISK

CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR TRADING POSITIONS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF

ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS. WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS ARE REASONABLE, THERE IS NO

STANDARD METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING VAR, AND DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS

AND/OR APPROXIMATIONS COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR

ESTIMATES.

WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE

OUR VAR AND, TO BETTER REFLECT CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WE

GENERALLY WEIGHT HISTORICAL DATA TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE

RECENT OBSERVATIONS. GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS

MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH

THERE ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION OF VAR IS THAT THE DISTRIBUTION

OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE

PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK. DIFFERENT VAR METHODOLOGIES AND

DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

VAR. MOREOVER, VAR CALCULATED FOR A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON DOES NOT

FULLY CAPTURE THE MARKET RISK OF POSITIONS THAT CANNOT BE

LIQUIDATED OR OFFSET WITH HEDGES WITHIN ONE DAY. CHANGES IN VAR

BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS ARE GENERALLY DUE TO CHANGES IN LEVELS OF

EXPOSURE, VOLATILITIES AND/OR CORRELATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES.

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICES,

OTHER DEBT PORTFOLIOS

THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

PORTFOLIOS IN OUR CREDIT PRODUCTS BUSINESS THAT CANNOT BE PROPERLY

MEASURED IN VAR (PRIMARILY DUE TO INADEQUATE HISTORICAL DATA ON THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS IN THE AGGREGATE) IS MEASURED BASED ON A

POTENTIAL 10% DECLINE IN THE ASSET VALUE OF SUCH PORTFOLIOS. THE

MARKET VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING POSITIONS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES

IN A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING DISCOUNT RATES AND THE PROJECTED

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, THE

POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A 10% DECLINE IN THE ASSET VALUE OF THESE

PORTFOLIOS WAS $669 MILLION COMPARED WITH $416 MILLION AS

OF NOVEMBER 2004. THE INCREASE IN 2005 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW

INVESTMENTS IN THE AMERICAS AND ASIA.

NONTRADING RISK

SMFG.

THE MARKET RISK OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG, NET OF THE

ECONOMIC HEDGE ON THE UNRESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

UNDERLYING A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT, IS MEASURED USING A

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS THAT ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN OUR

NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10% DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK

PRICE. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR INVESTMENT TO A

10% DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE WAS $262 MILLION

COMPARED WITH $236 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004. THE CHANGE IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE AND, TO

A LESSER EXTENT, THE IMPACT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME IN RESPECT OF

THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF HEDGING THE UNRESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK UNDERLYING OUR INVESTMENT. THIS SENSITIVITY SHOULD NOT BE

EXTRAPOLATED TO OTHER MOVEMENTS IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE, AS

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT AND THE

SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE IS NONLINEAR.

OTHER PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

THE

MARKET RISK FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN OUR NONTRADING PORTFOLIO,

INCLUDING OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS BUT EXCLUDING OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG, IS MEASURED

USING A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS THAT ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION

IN OUR NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10% DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS. THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN STOCK PRICE INDICES

AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IN OUR NONTRADING PORTFOLIO. DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS

COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RISK ESTIMATES. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005,

THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR NONTRADING PORTFOLIO (EXCLUDING

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG) TO A 10%

EQUITY MARKET DECLINE WAS $181 MILLION COMPARED WITH $118 MILLION

AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING NEW PRIVATE

INVESTMENTS.

CREDIT RISK

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS THAT

WE WOULD INCUR IF A COUNTERPARTY OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR

OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD FAILS TO PERFORM UNDER ITS CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TO US, OR UPON A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD. TO REDUCE

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE SEEK TO ENTER INTO NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH

COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER REDUCE

CREDIT RISK WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES BY (I) ENTERING INTO

AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM A COUNTERPARTY

OR TO TERMINATE OR RESET THE TERMS OF TRANSACTIONS AFTER SPECIFIED

TIME PERIODS OR UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CREDIT-RELATED EVENTS, (II) SEEKING

THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTYS

OBLIGATIONS, AND/OR (III) USING CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

STRUCTURES AND TECHNIQUES.

FOR MOST BUSINESSES, COUNTERPARTY

CREDIT LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE CREDIT DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS

INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING DEPARTMENTS, BASED ON

GUIDELINES SET BY THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE CREDIT POLICY

COMMITTEE. FOR MOST PRODUCTS, WE MEASURE AND LIMIT CREDIT EXPOSURES

BY REFERENCE TO BOTH CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. WE TYPICALLY

MEASURE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE BASED ON PROJECTED WORST-CASE MARKET

MOVEMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION WITHIN A 95% CONFIDENCE

INTERVAL. FOR COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS, WE ALSO EVALUATE

POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OVER A SHORTER COLLECTION PERIOD, AND GIVE

EFFECT TO THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL RECEIVED. WE FURTHER SEEK TO

MEASURE CREDIT EXPOSURE THROUGH THE USE OF SCENARIO ANALYSES,

STRESS TESTS AND OTHER QUANTITATIVE

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TOOLS. OUR GLOBAL CREDIT

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MONITOR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO

COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. THESE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRMWIDE RISK AND CREDIT POLICY

COMMITTEES, WITH INFORMATION REGARDING OVERALL CREDIT RISK BY

PRODUCT, INDUSTRY SECTOR, COUNTRY AND REGION.

AS OF BOTH NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER

2004, WE HELD U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS

THAT REPRESENTED 7% AND 5% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. IN

ADDITION, MOST OF OUR SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO

RESELL ARE COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL AGENCY

AND OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER

2004, WE DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY

THAT EXCEEDED 5% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE

BEEN INCREASING, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GROWTH OF OUR

LENDING AND OTC DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS BELOW.

DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS,

SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS, SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE

THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A

COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR AS A MEANS OF

RISK MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED

INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, WE ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO

HEDGE OUR NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS AND TO MANAGE

THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

AND CERTAIN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSOCIATED MARKET RISK CAN ONLY

BE UNDERSTOOD RELATIVE TO ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OR RISKS

BEING HEDGED, OR AS PART OF A BROADER TRADING STRATEGY.

ACCORDINGLY, THE MARKET RISK OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS IS MANAGED

TOGETHER WITH OUR NONDERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED NET OF CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO

CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY

BASIS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN

ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. FOR AN OTC DERIVATIVE, OUR CREDIT

EXPOSURE IS DIRECTLY WITH OUR COUNTERPARTY AND CONTINUES UNTIL THE

MATURITY OR TERMINATION OF SUCH CONTRACT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE

DISTRIBUTION, BY CREDIT RATING, OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO OTC DERIVATIVES AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, AFTER

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE EFFECT OF NETTING AGREEMENTS. THE

WHERE WE HAVE OBTAINED COLLATERAL FROM A

COUNTERPARTY UNDER A MASTER TRADING AGREEMENT THAT COVERS

MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE ALLOCATED THE

COLLATERAL RATABLY BASED ON EXPOSURE BEFORE GIVING EFFECT

TO SUCH COLLATERAL.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO

INVOLVE LEGAL RISKS INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED

OR APPROPRIATE FOR A COUNTERPARTY, THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN

PROPERLY EXECUTED OR THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE

ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE

RISKS BY OBTAINING ADVICE OF COUNSEL ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF

AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS ON THE AUTHORITY OF A COUNTERPARTY TO EFFECT

THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE THE RISK THAT WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY

OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING SECURITY OR

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO SATISFY ANY PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENT

OR THAT THE DERIVATIVE MAY HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT

COUNTERPARTY WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT.

LIQUIDITY RISK

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE

TO COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOST FAILURES OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO

INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RESULTING FROM ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

ACCORDINGLY, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO MAINTAIN

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS BOTH FIRM-SPECIFIC AND BROADER

INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO

BE ABLE TO FUND GOLDMAN SACHS AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO

CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER

OF POLICIES ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK.



EXCESS LIQUIDITY  MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE

OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING FINANCING OBLIGATIONS.



ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  ENSURE WE FUND OUR ASSETS WITH APPROPRIATE

FINANCING.



INTERCOMPANY FUNDING  MAINTAIN PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY AND MANAGE THE

DISTRIBUTION OF LIQUIDITY ACROSS THE GROUP STRUCTURE.



CRISIS PLANNING  ENSURE ALL FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS BASED ON

STRESS-SCENARIO PLANNING AND FEEDS INTO OUR LIQUIDITY CRISIS PLAN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCESS LIQUIDITY

MAINTENANCE OF A POOL OF HIGHLY

LIQUID SECURITIES.

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO

PRE-FUND WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR LIKELY CASH NEEDS DURING A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD SUCH EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF

UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT MAY BE SOLD OR PLEDGED

TO PROVIDE SAME-DAY LIQUIDITY. THIS GLOBAL CORE EXCESS LIQUIDITY

IS INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT

NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM

CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POOL OF EXCESS

LIQUIDITY PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS AND GIVES US

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING

ENVIRONMENT. OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING

PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS

SURVIVAL.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST

DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. GOLDMAN SACHS BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND ITS CASH

NEEDS ARE DRIVEN BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A

DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND

SOME TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE AND THE TERMS OR

AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO PRE-FUND LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN

A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND LARGER UNSECURED DEBT BALANCES

THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS

STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH

IT INCREASES OUR UNSECURED LIABILITIES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE

AVERAGE LOAN VALUE (THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF CASH THAT WOULD BE

ADVANCED BY COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST THESE SECURITIES) OF OUR GLOBAL

WHICH ARE FEDERAL RESERVE REPO-ELIGIBLE, AS WELL AS OVERNIGHT CASH

DEPOSITS. OUR NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED EXCESS IS COMPRISED

OF ONLY UNENCUMBERED FRENCH, GERMAN, UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPANESE

GOVERNMENT BONDS AND EURO, BRITISH POUND AND JAPANESE YEN OVERNIGHT

CASH DEPOSITS. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO THIS

NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES AND CASH THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT IT IS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND ALL

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE REMAINDER IS HELD IN OUR PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. OPERATING

ENTITIES, PRIMARILY TO BETTER MATCH THE CURRENCY AND

TIMING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE ENTITIES POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY

OBLIGATIONS.

91

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SIZE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS

DETERMINED BY AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL TOGETHER WITH A

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS

AND OF GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR LIQUIDITY MODEL IDENTIFIES AND ESTIMATES

CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS OVER A SHORT-TERM HORIZON IN A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.

UPCOMING CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS TAX AND OTHER LARGE PAYMENTS.

OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS.

IN

ADDITION TO OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AS A RESULT OF

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THESE ASSETS, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA, INCLUDE OTHER GOVERNMENT BONDS,

HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND MARGINABLE

EQUITIES. WE DO NOT INCLUDE THESE SECURITIES IN OUR GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS.

WE MAINTAIN GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND

OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS IN AN AMOUNT THAT, IF PLEDGED OR SOLD,

WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST 110% OF OUR

UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE (OR WHERE

HOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION TO REDEEM) WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THIS IMPLIES THAT WE COULD FUND OUR POSITIONS ON A SECURED BASIS

FOR ONE YEAR IN THE EVENT WE WERE UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW UNSECURED

DEBT OR LIQUIDATE ASSETS. WE ASSUME CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES THAT

ARE BASED ON STRESS-SCENARIO BORROWING CAPACITY AND WE REGULARLY

REVIEW THESE ASSUMPTIONS ASSET-BY-ASSET. THE ESTIMATED AGGREGATE

LOAN VALUE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND OUR OTHER UNENCUMBERED

ASSETS AVERAGED $125.36 BILLION IN 2005 AND $100.51 BILLION

IN 2004.

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

ASSET QUALITY AND BALANCE SHEET

COMPOSITION.

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS MARKED-TO-MARKET DAILY. WE

UTILIZE AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS

A DISINCENTIVE TO OUR BUSINESSES TO HOLD INVENTORY OVER LONGER

PERIODS OF TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE LIMITS PROVIDE A

COMPLEMENTARY MECHANISM FOR ENSURING APPROPRIATE BALANCE SHEET

LIQUIDITY IN ADDITION TO OUR STANDARD POSITION LIMITS. IN ADDITION,

WE PERIODICALLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR BALANCE

SHEET TO COMPLY WITH PERIOD END LIMITS SET BY MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE

OF THESE PERIODIC REDUCTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING

SEASONAL ACTIVITY, MARKET CONVENTIONS AND PERIODIC MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES THAT RESULT IN LARGER

POSITIONS DURING THE MIDDLE OF OUR REPORTING PERIODS, OUR BALANCE

SHEET FLUCTUATES BETWEEN FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATES AND IS LOWER AT

FISCAL PERIOD END THAN WOULD BE OBSERVED ON AN AVERAGE BASIS. OVER

THE LAST SIX QUARTERS, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND ADJUSTED ASSETS AT

QUARTER END HAVE BEEN, ON AVERAGE, 9% AND 11% LOWER, RESPECTIVELY,

THAN AMOUNTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OBSERVED, BASED ON A WEEKLY

AVERAGE, OVER THAT PERIOD. THESE DIFFERENCES, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT

RESULTED IN MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK OR

LIQUIDITY POSITION BECAUSE THEY ARE GENERALLY IN HIGHLY LIQUID

ASSETS THAT ARE TYPICALLY FINANCED ON A SECURED BASIS.

RESPECTIVELY.

A LARGE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS ARE

FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS THROUGH SECURED FUNDING MARKETS OR

NONRECOURSE FINANCING. WE FOCUS ON DEMONSTRATING A CONSISTENT

ABILITY TO FUND THESE ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS FOR EXTENDED

PERIODS OF TIME TO REDUCE REFINANCING RISK AND TO HELP ENSURE THAT

THESE ASSETS HAVE AN ESTABLISHED AMOUNT OF LOAN VALUE IN ORDER THAT

THEY CAN BE FUNDED IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS.

SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD.

APPROPRIATE FINANCING OF ASSET BASE.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THE MATURITY PROFILE OF OUR FUNDING BASE SUCH

THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS PRIOR TO OUR

LIABILITIES COMING DUE, EVEN IN TIMES OF PROLONGED OR SEVERE

LIQUIDITY STRESS. WE GENERALLY DO NOT RELY ON IMMEDIATE SALES OF

ASSETS (OTHER THAN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS) TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY IN

A DISTRESSED ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ORDERLY ASSET

SALES MAY BE PRUDENT AND NECESSARY IN A PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET

SALES, OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL CAPITAL

(LONG-TERM BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) TO FUND OUR

BALANCE SHEET FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN TOTAL

CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE OF THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM

FINANCING REQUIREMENTS.



THE PORTION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED THAT WE BELIEVE COULD NOT BE FUNDED ON

A SECURED BASIS IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, ASSUMING CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES;



GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND

EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS;



DERIVATIVE AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS;



ANTICIPATED DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS; AND



CAPITAL OR OTHER FORMS OF FINANCING IN OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS IN

EXCESS OF THEIR LONG-TERM FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. SEE  INTERCOMPANY FUNDING

OUR TOTAL CAPITAL OF $128.01 BILLION

AND $105.78 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, EXCEEDED THE AGGREGATE OF THESE

REQUIREMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE.

WE

STRUCTURE OUR LIABILITIES CONSERVATIVELY TO REDUCE REFINANCING RISK

AS WELL AS THE RISK THAT WE MAY REDEEM OR REPURCHASE CERTAIN OF OUR

BORROWINGS PRIOR TO THEIR CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY

REPURCHASE GOLDMAN SACHS COMMERCIAL PAPER THROUGH THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A MARKET MAKER. AS SUCH, WE EMPHASIZE THE USE

OF PROMISSORY NOTES (IN WHICH GOLDMAN SACHS DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET)

OVER COMMERCIAL PAPER IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE STABILITY OF OUR

SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FINANCING BASE. WE HAVE ALSO CREATED INTERNAL

GUIDELINES REGARDING THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT MATURING ON ANY

ONE DAY OR DURING ANY SINGLE WEEK OR YEAR AND HAVE AVERAGE MATURITY

TARGETS FOR OUR UNSECURED DEBT PROGRAMS.

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND

DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES GLOBALLY FOR BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED

FUNDING. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL GUIDELINES, INCLUDING THE

AMOUNT OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER THAT CAN BE OWNED AND LETTERS OF

CREDIT THAT CAN BE ISSUED BY ANY SINGLE INVESTOR OR GROUP OF

INVESTORS. WE BENEFIT FROM DISTRIBUTING OUR DEBT ISSUANCES THROUGH

OUR OWN SALES FORCE TO A LARGE, DIVERSE GLOBAL CREDITOR BASE AND WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE CRITICAL TO

OUR LIQUIDITY.

WE ACCESS FUNDING IN A VARIETY OF

MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE ISSUE DEBT

THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS, U.S. REGISTERED

AND 144A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAMS, OFFSHORE MEDIUM-TERM

NOTE OFFERINGS AND OTHER BOND OFFERINGS, U.S. AND NON-U.S. COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND PROMISSORY NOTE ISSUANCES, AND OTHER METHODS.

WE MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES

LENDING MARKETS AND ARRANGE FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT TO BE ISSUED ON

OUR BEHALF.

ADDITIONALLY, UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED

BY GROUP INC. DOES NOT CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT WOULD, BASED SOLELY

UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS,

EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR OUR STOCK PRICE, TRIGGER A REQUIREMENT FOR

AN EARLY PAYMENT, COLLATERAL SUPPORT, CHANGE IN TERMS, ACCELERATION

OF MATURITY OR THE CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

INTERCOMPANY FUNDING

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY OUR PARENT

COMPANY, GROUP INC. THE PARENT COMPANY THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY

FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET

THEIR ASSET FINANCING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE

PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE

NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE

BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING INCLUDE ENHANCED

CONTROL AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF

OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ARE

PREDICATED ON AN ASSUMPTION THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR,

FUNDS OR SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE FROM A SUBSIDIARY TO

ITS PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF

OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR LIMIT THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES

TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO

FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. AS SUCH, WE ASSUME THAT CAPITAL OR

OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT

AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION,

WE ASSUME THAT THE GLOBAL CORE EXCESS HELD IN OUR PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. OPERATING

ENTITIES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY

OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND THEREFORE IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO MEET THE

POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE ENTITIES.

WE ALSO MANAGE OUR INTERCOMPANY

EXPOSURE BY REQUIRING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO

HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE

AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES

THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL

GENERALLY MATURE IN ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY

BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

PLEDGE COLLATERAL AT LOAN VALUE TO THE PARENT COMPANY TO COVER

THEIR INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN SUBORDINATED DEBT) IN

ORDER TO MITIGATE PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY RISK.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH PARENT COMPANY EQUITY CAPITAL. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005, GROUP INC.S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES WAS

$25.26 BILLION COMPARED WITH ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF

$28.00 BILLION.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL

AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY, TO ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES; FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005, GROUP INC. HAD $17.04 BILLION OF SUCH EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., ITS

PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; $16.06 BILLION

INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL, A REGULATED U.K.

BROKER-DEALER; $2.41 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION &

CLEARING, L.P., A U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; AND

$1.98 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS (JAPAN) LTD., A

REGULATED BROKER-DEALER BASED IN TOKYO. GROUP INC. ALSO HAD $44.52 BILLION

OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS TO THESE ENTITIES AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INVESTED

IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICIES.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES IS GENERALLY

EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS

HEDGED. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY HEDGE THE NONTRADING EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THAT ARISES FROM TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE TRANSACTING ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

CRISIS PLANNING

IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR A

LIQUIDITY EVENT, OR A PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS, WE BASE OUR

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND OUR RESULTING FUNDING AND

LIQUIDITY POLICIES ON CONSERVATIVE STRESS-SCENARIO PLANNING.

IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A LIQUIDITY

CRISIS PLAN THAT SPECIFIES AN APPROACH FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING

TO A LIQUIDITY-THREATENING EVENT. THE PLAN PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK

TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELY IMPACT OF A LIQUIDITY EVENT ON GOLDMAN SACHS

BASED ON SOME OF THE RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE AND OUTLINES WHICH AND

TO WHAT EXTENT LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE

IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. IT ALSO LISTS THE

CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTIES TO BE

CONTACTED TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION.

CASH FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION,

OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED AND BEAR LITTLE

RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE

BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN

EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO

TRENDS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESS.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2005.

OUR CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $5.90 BILLION TO $10.26 BILLION

AT THE END OF 2005. WE RAISED $19.37 BILLION IN NET

CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY IN LONG-TERM DEBT, IN

LIGHT OF THE FAVORABLE DEBT FINANCING ENVIRONMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. WE USED NET CASH OF $13.48 BILLION

IN OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE

ON TRADING AND INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OURSELVES AND OUR

CLIENTS.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2004.

OUR CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $2.72 BILLION TO $4.37 BILLION

AT THE END OF 2004. WE RAISED $31.75 BILLION IN NET

CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY IN LONG-TERM DEBT, IN

LIGHT OF THE FAVORABLE DEBT FINANCING ENVIRONMENT. WE USED NET CASH

OF $34.47 BILLION IN OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE ON TRADING AND INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR

OURSELVES AND OUR CLIENTS, TO MEET ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS AT SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND

TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SUPPORT FOR OUR WILLIAM STREET LOAN

COMMITMENTS PROGRAM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2003.

OUR CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $2.27 BILLION TO $7.09 BILLION

AT THE END OF 2003. WE RAISED $20.58 BILLION IN NET

CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY IN LONG-TERM DEBT. WE

USED NET CASH OF $18.32 BILLION IN OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING

ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE ON OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF

INVESTMENTS THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO FUND IN PERIODS OF MARKET

STRESS. WE ALSO INCREASED OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS, PROVIDED FUNDING

SUPPORT FOR OUR WILLIAM STREET LOAN COMMITMENTS PROGRAM, INVESTED

IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AND FINANCED THE

ACQUISITION OF EAST COAST POWER L.L.C.

OPERATIONAL RISK

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO THE RISK

OF LOSS ARISING FROM SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN INTERNAL

PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS, AND FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OPERATIONAL

RISK CAN ARISE FROM MANY FACTORS RANGING FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING

ERRORS TO POTENTIALLY COSTLY INCIDENTS ARISING, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM

MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILURES. OPERATIONAL RISK MAY ALSO CAUSE

REPUTATIONAL HARM. THUS, EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY, MANAGE AND MITIGATE

OPERATIONAL RISK MUST BE EQUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE RISK OF

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AS WELL AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS.

WE MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH

THE APPLICATION OF LONG-STANDING, BUT CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING,

FIRMWIDE CONTROL STANDARDS: THE TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND

DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE; THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND COMMITMENT

OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND

MITIGATING KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS ACROSS THE FIRM; AND A FRAMEWORK

OF STRONG AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL DEPARTMENTS THAT MONITOR

OPERATIONAL RISK ON A DAILY BASIS. TOGETHER, THESE ELEMENTS FORM A

STRONG FIRMWIDE CONTROL CULTURE THAT SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION OF

OUR EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE EVENTS THAT CREATE OPERATIONAL RISK AND THE

DAMAGE THEY CAN CAUSE.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK DEPARTMENT, AN

INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING

AND IMPLEMENTING A STANDARDIZED FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE,

MONITOR AND MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK ACROSS THE FIRM. THIS

FRAMEWORK, WHICH EVOLVES WITH THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE, TAKES INTO ACCOUNT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS, BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

FACTORS, THE ONGOING ANALYSIS OF BUSINESS-SPECIFIC RISK METRICS AND

THE USE OF SCENARIO ANALYSIS. WHILE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS HAVE

DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTROL AND MITIGATION OF OPERATIONAL

RISK, THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FOR

IDENTIFYING AND MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS AT THE BUSINESS

UNIT AND FIRMWIDE LEVEL.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED A REVISION TO SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, SFAS NO. 123-R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. SFAS NO. 123-R

ESTABLISHES STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN

ENTITY EXCHANGES ITS EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. SFAS NO. 123-R

FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS

IN WHICH AN ENTITY OBTAINS EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

TRANSACTIONS. TWO KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SFAS NO. 123 AND

SFAS NO. 123-R RELATE TO ATTRIBUTION OF COMPENSATION COSTS

TO REPORTING PERIODS AND ACCOUNTING FOR AWARD FORFEITURES. SFAS NO. 123-R

GENERALLY REQUIRES THE IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF

EQUITY-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES.

HOWEVER, AWARDS GRANTED SUBJECT TO A SUBSTANTIVE NON-COMPETE

AGREEMENT ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED OVER THE NON-COMPETE PERIOD. SFAS NO. 123-R

ALSO REQUIRES EXPECTED FORFEITURES TO BE

INCLUDED IN DETERMINING STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW WE CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS

GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND FORFEITURES. WE WILL

ADOPT SFAS NO. 123-R IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006.

MANAGEMENT IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123-R

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

A NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT.

CERTAIN RIGHTS, WHICH REQUIRES GENERAL PARTNERS (OR MANAGING

MEMBERS IN THE CASE OF LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES) TO CONSOLIDATE

THEIR PARTNERSHIPS OR TO PROVIDE LIMITED PARTNERS WITH RIGHTS TO

REMOVE THE GENERAL PARTNER OR TO TERMINATE THE PARTNERSHIP. GOLDMAN

SACHS, AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OF NUMEROUS MERCHANT BANKING AND

OF EITF 04-5 (I) IMMEDIATELY FOR PARTNERSHIPS FORMED OR

MODIFIED AFTER JUNE 29, 2005 AND (II) IN THE FIRST QUARTER

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (THE

FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE

SUPERVISION OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL

FINANCIAL OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

AS OF THE END OF THE FIRMS 2005

FISCAL YEAR, MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS

ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 25, 2005 WAS

EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND

FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCES THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY

TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT

RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE

FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 25, 2005 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON PAGES 100

AND 101, WHICH EXPRESSES UNQUALIFIED OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 25, 2005.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC..

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS

OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.S 2005 AND 2004 CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 25, 2005 AND AN AUDIT OF ITS 2003

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS

OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

OUR OPINIONS ON THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.S 2005, 2004, AND 2003

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 25, 2005, BASED ON OUR

AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT

NOVEMBER 25, 2005 AND NOVEMBER 26, 2004, AND THE RESULTS OF

ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE FISCAL

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 25, 2005 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS

TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF

THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING ON PAGE 99, THAT THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF NOVEMBER 25, 2005 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS

FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 25, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

NOTE 1.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (GROUP

INC.), A DELAWARE CORPORATION, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE FIRM), IS A LEADING GLOBAL

INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM THAT

PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES WORLDWIDE TO A SUBSTANTIAL AND

DIVERSIFIED CLIENT BASE THAT INCLUDES CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES ARE DIVIDED

INTO THREE SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANKING.

THE FIRM PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF INVESTMENT BANKING

SERVICES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS

AND INDIVIDUALS.



TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM FACILITATES CLIENT TRANSACTIONS WITH

A DIVERSE GROUP OF CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND

INDIVIDUALS AND TAKES PROPRIETARY POSITIONS THROUGH MARKET MAKING IN, TRADING OF

AND INVESTING IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND

DERIVATIVES ON SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ENGAGES IN SPECIALIST AND

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES ON EQUITIES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES AND CLEARS CLIENT

TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. IN CONNECTION

WITH THE FIRMS MERCHANT BANKING AND OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM MAKES

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT THE FIRM RAISES AND MANAGES.



ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

THE FIRM PROVIDES INVESTMENT ADVISORY

AND FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES AND OFFERS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ACROSS ALL MAJOR

ASSET CLASSES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE, AND

PROVIDES PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES, FINANCING SERVICES AND SECURITIES LENDING

SERVICES TO MUTUAL FUNDS, PENSION FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, FOUNDATIONS AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE.

NOTE 2.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING

FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE PROVISION

FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND OTHER ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF GROUP INC. AND ALL OTHER

ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST.

ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN

ELIMINATED.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING

WHETHER THE ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, A VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITY (VIE) OR A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY (QSPE) UNDER

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.



VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE

TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE

ITS ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO

ABSORB LOSSES, THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE RESIDUAL RETURNS AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS

ABOUT THE ENTITYS ACTIVITIES. VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 51, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED. ARB NO. 51 STATES THAT THE USUAL

107

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CONDITION

FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY VOTING

INTEREST. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT

HAS A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST.



VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT LACK ONE OR MORE OF THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY. A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A

VIE IS PRESENT WHEN AN ENTERPRISE HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST, OR A COMBINATION OF

VARIABLE INTERESTS, THAT WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES,

RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. THE ENTERPRISE

WITH A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY,

CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 46-R, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES,

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES ALL VIES OF WHICH IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE BY FIRST PERFORMING A

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VIE THAT INCLUDES A REVIEW OF, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ITS CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL TERMS, WHICH INTERESTS CREATE OR ABSORB VARIABILITY, RELATED PARTY

RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DESIGN OF THE VIE. WHERE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE

FIRM PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING A VIES EXPECTED LOSSES

AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS TO ITS VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, THE FIRM UTILIZES THE TOP

DOWN METHOD. UNDER THAT METHOD, THE FIRM CALCULATES ITS SHARE OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES

AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS USING THE SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO IT,

BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR THE FIRMS POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE

VIE, UNDER VARIOUS PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED SCENARIOS.



QSPES.

QSPES ARE PASSIVE ENTITIES THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 140,

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES, SETS FORTH THE CRITERIA AN ENTITY MUST SATISFY TO

BE A QSPE. THESE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE TYPES OF ASSETS A QSPE MAY HOLD, LIMITS ON

ASSET SALES, THE USE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, AND THE LEVEL OF

DISCRETION A SERVICER MAY EXERCISE IN ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT RECEIVABLES. THESE

CRITERIA MAY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT COMPLEX MATTERS, INCLUDING

WHETHER A DERIVATIVE IS CONSIDERED PASSIVE AND THE DEGREE OF DISCRETION A SERVICER

MAY EXERCISE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 140 AND FIN NO. 46-R, THE

FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE QSPES.



EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT EXERTS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING

AND FINANCIAL POLICIES (GENERALLY DEFINED AS OWNING A VOTING INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%)

AND HAS AN INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OR IN-SUBSTANCE COMMON STOCK, THE FIRM

ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18, THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK.



OTHER.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY OR APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ALSO HAS

FORMED NUMEROUS NONCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS THAT ARE

TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE FIRM ACTS AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR

THESE FUNDS AND DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN ANY FUND. FOR

FUNDS ESTABLISHED ON OR BEFORE JUNE 29, 2005 IN WHICH THE FIRM HOLDS MORE

THAN A MINOR INTEREST AND FOR FUNDS ESTABLISHED OR MODIFIED AFTER JUNE 29, 2005,

THE FIRM HAS PROVIDED THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS WITH RIGHTS TO TERMINATE THE FUNDS

(SEE  RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS BELOW). THESE FUND INVESTMENTS ARE

INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

TOTAL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE ARE

REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ON

A TRADE-DATE BASIS AND CONSIST OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, WITH RELATED

UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS

THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT

TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR

LIQUIDATION SALE.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM

SEPARATES ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO THREE CATEGORIES 

CASH (I.E., NONDERIVATIVE) TRADING INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.



CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE

GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, BROKER OR DEALER

PRICE QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED IN THIS MANNER INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND AGENCY SECURITIES, OTHER SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, LIQUID

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BONDS, LISTED EQUITIES, MONEY MARKET

SECURITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN HIGH-YIELD DEBT, CORPORATE BANK LOANS,

MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND DISTRESSED DEBT. THE FIRM VALUES THESE INSTRUMENTS INITIALLY AT

COST AND GENERALLY DOES NOT ADJUST VALUATIONS UNLESS THERE IS SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT OR VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS (SUCH

AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR CHANGES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS

OF THE UNDERLYING COMPANIES). WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE, THE

FIRM USES VALUATION METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS.

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY THE FIRM (LONG POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND

INSTRUMENTS SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. IF

LIQUIDATING A POSITION IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT ITS PREVAILING MARKET PRICE, THE VALUATION IS

ADJUSTED GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED POLICIES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED TO

DETERMINE THIS ADJUSTMENT.



DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONSIST OF

EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES AND ARE REFLECTED NET OF CASH

THAT THE FIRM HAS PAID AND RECEIVED (FOR EXAMPLE, OPTION PREMIUMS OR CASH PAID OR

RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS). FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY

109

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP,

INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC

DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING VALUATION MODELS. THE FIRM USES A VARIETY OF VALUATION

MODELS INCLUDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS AND

OPTION-PRICING MODELS. THE VALUATION MODELS USED TO DERIVE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE

FIRMS OTC DERIVATIVES REQUIRE INPUTS INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES,

YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES AND

CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. THE SELECTION OF A MODEL TO VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE

DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF, AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE

INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. THE

FIRM GENERALLY USES SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE

FIRM VERIFIES THE VALUES PRODUCED BY ITS PRICING MODELS TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. FOR

OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND

OPTIONS, MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BECAUSE MARKET PRICES

ARE READILY AVAILABLE. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS, MODEL

SELECTION REQUIRES MORE JUDGMENT BECAUSE SUCH INSTRUMENTS TEND TO BE MORE COMPLEX

AND PRICING INFORMATION IS LESS AVAILABLE IN THESE MARKETS. PRICE

TRANSPARENCY IS INHERENTLY MORE LIMITED FOR MORE COMPLEX STRUCTURES

BECAUSE THEY OFTEN COMBINE ONE OR MORE PRODUCT TYPES, REQUIRING

ADDITIONAL INPUTS SUCH AS CORRELATIONS AND VOLATILITIES. AS MARKETS CONTINUE TO

DEVELOP AND MORE PRICING INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REVIEW

AND REFINE THE MODELS IT USES.

AT THE INCEPTION OF AN OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACT (DAY ONE), THE FIRM VALUES THE CONTRACT AT

THE MODEL VALUE IF THE FIRM CAN VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT

CONSIDERATIONS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED

POLICIES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THESE ADJUSTMENTS.

WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM VALUES THE CONTRACT AT THE TRANSACTION

PRICE AT INCEPTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, RECORDS NO DAY ONE GAIN OR LOSS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 02-3, ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

FOLLOWING DAY ONE, THE FIRM ADJUSTS THE INPUTS TO ITS VALUATION MODELS ONLY TO THE EXTENT

THAT CHANGES IN THESE INPUTS CAN BE VERIFIED BY SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY

PRICING SERVICES AND/OR BROKER QUOTES, OR CAN BE DERIVED FROM OTHER SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE

SUCH AS EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD PRODUCE A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

IN VALUING CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS,

THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO IS SEPARATED INTO INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES, INVESTMENTS

IN PUBLIC COMPANIES (EXCLUDING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED

STOCK OF SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG)) AND THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN

SMFG.

THE FIRMS PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY CARRIED AT COST AS AN APPROXIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE. ADJUSTMENTS TO CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE IF THERE ARE THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF

SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS CONVERSION FEATURES AND

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.

THE FIRMS PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE LARGE, CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS THAT

RESULT FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, ARE VALUED USING

QUOTED MARKET PRICES DISCOUNTED BASED ON PREDETERMINED WRITTEN POLICIES FOR

NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE,

WHICH IS DERIVED FROM A MODEL THAT INCORPORATES SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE AND CREDIT

SPREADS, THE IMPACT OF NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY, AND THE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON

THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE. THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SMFG IS GENERALLY NONTRANSFERABLE, BUT IS FREELY CONVERTIBLE INTO SMFG COMMON STOCK.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO HEDGE OR SELL ONE-THIRD OF THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING

ITS INVESTMENT IN SMFG LAPSED IN FEBRUARY 2005. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, THE FIRM WAS FULLY

HEDGED WITH RESPECT TO THESE UNRESTRICTED SHARES. UNDER THE FIRMS INITIAL AGREEMENT WITH

SMFG, RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO HEDGE OR SELL THE REMAINING SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK UNDERLYING ITS INVESTMENT IN SMFG LAPSE IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006

AND FEBRUARY 7, 2007. IN CONNECTION WITH A PUBLIC OFFERING BY SMFG OF ITS COMMON STOCK,

THE FIRM HAS SEPARATELY AGREED WITH SMFG THAT THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE TO LAPSE ON FEBRUARY 7,

2006 WILL INSTEAD LAPSE ON MARCH 9, 2006. EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2006, THE

CONVERSION PRICE OF THE FIRMS SMFG PREFERRED STOCK INTO SHARES OF SMFG COMMON STOCK IS

¥320,900. THIS PRICE IS SUBJECT TO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IF THE PRICE OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT

THE TIME OF CONVERSION IS LESS THAN THE CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT TO A FLOOR OF ¥105,800).

IN GENERAL, TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES UNDER SFAS NO. 140 WHEN

THE FIRM HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. FOR

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED

COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS AT

ACQUISITION DATE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL IS TESTED AT LEAST

ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS TRIGGERED IF THE

ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. SUCH LOSS IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH

CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CUSTOMER LISTS, ABOVE-MARKET POWER CONTRACTS

AND SPECIALIST RIGHTS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT

AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY

RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING

FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS, CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF

THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE

ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS FOR WHICH THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT IS

SHORTER THAN THE TERM OF THE LEASE ARE AMORTIZED UNDER THE

ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY METHOD IF PLACED IN SERVICE PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 1, 2001. ALL OTHER LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE

IMPROVEMENT OR THE TERM OF THE LEASE, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER. CERTAIN

COSTS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE

SOFTWARE.

EQUIPMENT ARE TESTED FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS

CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET

OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE SUM OF THE EXPECTED

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS

LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

THE FIRMS OPERATING LEASES INCLUDE

SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF CURRENT NEEDS. RENT EXPENSE RELATING TO

SPACE HELD FOR GROWTH IS INCLUDED IN OCCUPANCY IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM RECORDS A LIABILITY, BASED ON THE REMAINING

LEASE RENTALS REDUCED BY ANY POTENTIAL OR EXISTING SUBLEASE

RENTALS, FOR LEASES WHERE THE FIRM HAS CEASED USING THE SPACE AND

MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT DERIVE ANY FUTURE

ECONOMIC BENEFITS. COSTS TO TERMINATE A LEASE BEFORE THE END OF ITS

TERM ARE RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE UPON TERMINATION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN

NON-U.S. CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE

PREVAILING ON THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE

RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. GAINS OR LOSSES ON

TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A NON-U.S. OPERATION,

WHEN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR,

ARE INCLUDED, NET OF HEDGES AND TAXES, ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE FIRM SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS

NET INVESTMENT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

THROUGH THE USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS,

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD

EXCHANGE RATES; ACCORDINGLY, FORWARD POINTS ARE REFLECTED AS A

COMPONENT OF THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED ON

CHANGES IN SPOT RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR

LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS IN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE INCLUDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE RECOGNIZED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF THE FIRMS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

TO THE AMOUNT THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE REALIZED. THE

FIRMS TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF

OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION. TAX PROVISIONS ARE COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

RELATED TO INCOME TAXES ARE RECORDED WHEN THE CRITERIA FOR LOSS

RECOGNITION UNDER SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING

NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING. COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING INCLUDES COMMON STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS FOR

WHICH NO FUTURE SERVICE IS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION TO THE DELIVERY

OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. DILUTED EPS INCLUDES THE

DETERMINANTS OF BASIC EPS AND, IN ADDITION, REFLECTS THE DILUTIVE

EFFECT OF THE COMMON STOCK DELIVERABLE PURSUANT TO STOCK OPTIONS

AND TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS FOR WHICH FUTURE SERVICE IS REQUIRED

AS A CONDITION TO THE DELIVERY OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE FIRM DEFINES CASH EQUIVALENTS AS

HIGHLY LIQUID OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS HELD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED A

REVISION TO SFAS NO. 123, SFAS NO. 123-R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. SFAS NO. 123-R ESTABLISHES STANDARDS OF

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN ENTITY EXCHANGES ITS EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. SFAS NO. 123-R FOCUSES

PRIMARILY ON ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN ENTITY OBTAINS

EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS. TWO KEY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SFAS NO. 123 AND SFAS NO. 123-R

RELATE TO ATTRIBUTION OF COMPENSATION COSTS TO REPORTING PERIODS

AND ACCOUNTING FOR AWARD FORFEITURES. SFAS NO. 123-R GENERALLY

REQUIRES THE IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF EQUITY-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER, AWARDS GRANTED SUBJECT TO A

SUBSTANTIVE NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED OVER THE

NON-COMPETE PERIOD. SFAS NO. 123-R ALSO REQUIRES EXPECTED

FORFEITURES TO BE INCLUDED IN DETERMINING STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE (SEE  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ABOVE

FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW THE FIRM CURRENTLY ACCOUNTS FOR

EQUITY-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND

FORFEITURES). THE FIRM WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 123-R IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006. MANAGEMENT IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS MAY ARISE FROM

TRADING, UNDERWRITING AND SECURITIES BORROWING ACTIVITIES AND MAY

BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL FACTORS.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM HELD U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS THAT REPRESENTED 7% AND

5% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, MOST OF

THE FIRMS SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL AGENCY AND OTHER

SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004, THE

FIRM DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY THAT

EXCEEDED 5% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS.

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS,

SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS, SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS THAT DERIVE

THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A

COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES MAY INVOLVE FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR COMMODITIES, OR TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY OR

INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE

SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED RATES,

SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY

OBLIGATIONS, AND INDEXED DEBT INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT CONSIDERED

DERIVATIVES EVEN THOUGH THEIR VALUES OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED CASH

FLOWS ARE DERIVED FROM THE PRICE OF SOME OTHER SECURITY OR INDEX.

HOWEVER, CERTAIN COMMODITY-RELATED CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURE, AS THESE CONTRACTS MAY BE SETTLED IN

CASH OR ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, TO

FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR AS

A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. RISK EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED THROUGH

DIVERSIFICATION, BY CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND BY ESTABLISHING

HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM

MAY HEDGE A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCK BY TAKING AN OFFSETTING

POSITION IN A RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT. GAINS AND

LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES USED FOR TRADING PURPOSES ARE GENERALLY

INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, THE FIRM ENTERS

INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

(SEE NOTE 2 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING

THE FIRMS POLICY ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION) AND TO MANAGE

THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

AND CERTAIN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. TO MANAGE EXPOSURE ON ITS

BORROWINGS, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVES TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR-BASED

FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM APPLIES FAIR VALUE

HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE BENCHMARK

INTEREST RATE (I.E., LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR)) ON ITS

FIXED RATE LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. THE FIRM ALSO APPLIES CASH FLOW

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY AND AUTO LOANS, GOVERNMENT AND

CORPORATE BONDS AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE FIRM ACTS

AS UNDERWRITER OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THAT ARE SOLD TO

INVESTORS. THE FIRM DERECOGNIZES FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED IN

SECURITIZATIONS PROVIDED IT HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER SUCH

ASSETS. TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE PRIOR TO

SECURITIZATION. NET REVENUES RELATED TO THESE UNDERWRITING

ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF THE

UNDERLYING BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO INVESTORS.

THE FIRM MAY RETAIN INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS. RETAINED INTERESTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AT FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDED IN TOTAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED,

AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 2005

AND NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM SECURITIZED $92.00 BILLION AND

$62.93 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING

$65.18 BILLION AND $47.46 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN PRACTICE, SIMULTANEOUS CHANGES IN

ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO THE RETAINED INTERESTS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM ALSO HELD INTERESTS IN RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE QSPES PURCHASED IN CONNECTION WITH SECONDARY MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES. THESE PURCHASED INTERESTS APPROXIMATED $5 BILLION

AS OF BOTH NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF

ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM HAD DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES FROM QSPES, TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS TRANSFERRED ASSETS,

WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $108 MILLION AND $126 MILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RECEIVABLES

DEFERRABLE INTEREST JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

IN FEBRUARY 2004, GOLDMAN SACHS

CAPITAL I (THE TRUST), A WHOLLY OWNED DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST,

WAS FORMED BY THE FIRM FOR THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSES OF (I) ISSUING

$2.75 BILLION OF GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS AND $85 MILLION OF COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE

TRUST, (II) INVESTING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE TO PURCHASE

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM GROUP INC. AND (III) ENGAGING

IN ONLY THOSE OTHER ACTIVITIES NECESSARY OR INCIDENTAL TO

THESE PURPOSES. THE PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS WERE PURCHASED

BY THIRD PARTIES, AND, AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, THE FIRM HELD ALL OF

THE COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS.

THE TRUST IS A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE

SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM FOR LEGAL AND REGULATORY PURPOSES. HOWEVER,

FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, UNDER FIN NO. 46-R, THE TRUST IS

NOT A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM BECAUSE THE FIRMS

OWNERSHIP OF THE COMMON BENEFICIAL INTEREST IS NOT CONSIDERED AT

RISK, SINCE THE TRUSTS PRINCIPAL ASSET IS THE $2.84 BILLION OF

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM PAYS

INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY ON THESE DEBENTURES AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF

6.345% AND THE DEBENTURES MATURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2034. THE

COUPON RATE AND PAYMENT DATES APPLICABLE TO THE BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ARE THE SAME AS THE INTEREST RATE AND PAYMENT DATES

APPLICABLE TO THE DEBENTURES. SEE NOTE 6 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS GUARANTEE OF THE PREFERRED

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE TRUST.

THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT, FROM TIME TO

TIME, TO DEFER PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEBENTURES, AND, THEREFORE, CAUSE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON THE

TRUSTS PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO BE DEFERRED, IN EACH CASE

FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE SEMIANNUAL PERIODS, AND DURING ANY SUCH

EXTENSION PERIOD GROUP INC. WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR MAKE CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON

STOCK. THE TRUST IS NOT PERMITTED TO PAY ANY DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE

COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY THE FIRM UNLESS ALL DIVIDENDS

PAYABLE ON THE PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HAVE BEEN PAID IN

FULL.

ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY

BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH

PERIOD. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF

THE FIRMS LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY IN CASES

CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS AND NO FURTHER BENEFITS WILL BE ACCRUED

TO EXISTING PARTICIPANTS. EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS LOCAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

PLANS. THESE PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE BENEFITS BASED ON YEARS OF

CREDITED SERVICE AND A PERCENTAGE OF THE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS UNFUNDED POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE FOR ELIGIBLE

RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS COVERED UNDER THE U.S. BENEFITS

PROGRAM.

GENERALLY, THE FIRM DETERMINED THE

DISCOUNT RATES FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS BY REFERENCING INDICES

FOR LONG-TERM, HIGH-QUALITY BONDS AND ENSURING THAT THE DISCOUNT

RATE DOES NOT EXCEED THE YIELD REPORTED FOR THOSE INDICES AFTER

ADJUSTMENT FOR THE DURATION OF THE PLANS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH IN DETERMINING

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS IS BASED UPON

HISTORICAL FINANCIAL MARKET RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE EXISTED OVER

TIME WITH THE PRESUMPTION THAT THIS TREND WILL GENERALLY REMAIN

CONSTANT IN THE FUTURE.

FOR MEASUREMENT PURPOSES, AN ANNUAL

GROWTH RATE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS

OF 11.46% WAS ASSUMED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2006. THE

RATE WAS ASSUMED TO DECREASE RATABLY TO 5.00% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR

ENDING NOVEMBER 2015 AND REMAIN AT THAT LEVEL THEREAFTER.

THE ASSUMED COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS AN

EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS.

A 1% CHANGE IN THE ASSUMED HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE WOULD HAVE

THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

THE INVESTMENT APPROACH OF THE FIRMS

U.S. AND MAJOR NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS INVOLVES

EMPLOYING A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY TO CAPTURE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY OCCUR, WHILE MAINTAINING REASONABLE

PARAMETERS TO ENSURE THAT PRUDENCE AND CARE ARE EXERCISED IN THE

EXECUTION OF THE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS. THE PLANS EMPLOY A TOTAL

RETURN ON INVESTMENT APPROACH, WHEREBY A MIX, WHICH IS BROADLY

SIMILAR TO THE ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, OF

EQUITY SECURITIES, DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS, IS TARGETED TO

MAXIMIZE THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON ASSETS FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF RISK.

INVESTMENT RISK IS MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY

THE FIRMS RETIREMENT COMMITTEE THROUGH PERIODIC PORTFOLIO REVIEWS,

MEETINGS WITH INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ANNUAL LIABILITY MEASUREMENTS.

THE FIRM WILL CONTRIBUTE A MINIMUM OF

$13 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS AND $7 MILLION TO ITS

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IN FISCAL 2006.

$189 MILLION AND $199 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER

2005, NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM PREVIOUSLY MAINTAINED A

NONQUALIFIED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN FOR CERTAIN SENIOR EMPLOYEES

WHICH HELD SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. ALL SHARES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO

PARTICIPANTS AND THERE WERE NO REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PLAN AS OF

JANUARY 2005. PLAN EXPENSE WAS IMMATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED

NOVEMBER 2005, NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

THE FIRM SPONSORS A STOCK INCENTIVE

PLAN, THE GOLDMAN SACHS AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

(THE AMENDED SIP), WHICH PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF INCENTIVE STOCK

OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL

2003, THE AMENDED SIP WAS APPROVED BY THE FIRMS SHAREHOLDERS,

EFFECTIVE FOR GRANTS AFTER APRIL 1, 2003, AND NO FURTHER AWARDS

WERE OR WILL BE MADE UNDER THE ORIGINAL PLAN AFTER THAT DATE,

ALTHOUGH AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE ORIGINAL PLAN PRIOR TO THAT DATE

REMAIN OUTSTANDING.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE AMENDED SIP THROUGH FISCAL 2008

MAY NOT EXCEED 250 MILLION SHARES AND, IN EACH FISCAL YEAR

THEREAFTER, MAY NOT EXCEED 5% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

OF COMMON STOCK, DETERMINED AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY

PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR, INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE

FOR AWARDS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS BUT NOT COVERED BY AWARDS

GRANTED IN SUCH YEARS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004, 196.6 MILLION

AND 218.9 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE AMENDED SIP, AFTER TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT WERE ISSUED SUBSEQUENT

TO YEAR END, AS PART OF YEAR-END COMPENSATION.

OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM ADOPTED

NEW DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES FOR FISCAL

2005. IN GENERAL, UNDER THE PLANS, PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO DEFER

PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THEIR CASH YEAR-END COMPENSATION. DURING

THE DEFERRAL PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO NOMINALLY INVEST

THEIR DEFERRALS IN CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLANS.

GENERALLY, UNDER CURRENT TAX LAW, PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO

INCOME TAX ON AMOUNTS DEFERRED OR ON ANY NOTIONAL INVESTMENT

EARNINGS UNTIL THE RETURNS ARE DISTRIBUTED, AND THE FIRM IS NOT

ENTITLED TO A CORRESPONDING TAX DEDUCTION UNTIL THE AMOUNTS ARE

DISTRIBUTED. THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE

AMOUNTS DEFERRED UNDER THESE PLANS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, $134 MILLION

RELATED TO THESE PLANS WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES

AND ACCRUED EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM ADOPTED A

DISCOUNT STOCK PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH ELIGIBLE SENIOR EXECUTIVES MAY

ACQUIRE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2006 UNDER

THE FIRMS AMENDED SIP AT AN EFFECTIVE 25% DISCOUNT. THE 25%

DISCOUNT IS EFFECTED BY AN ADDITIONAL GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

PURCHASED BY QUALIFYING PARTICIPANTS. THE PURCHASED RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS ARE 100% VESTED WHEN GRANTED, BUT THE SHARES UNDERLYING

THEM ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED (OTHER THAN TO SATISFY

TAX OBLIGATIONS) BEFORE THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE.

THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT ARE GRANTED

IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE 25% DISCOUNT WILL GENERALLY VEST IN EQUAL

INSTALLMENTS ON THE SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES FOLLOWING THE

GRANT DATE AND WILL NOT BE TRANSFERABLE BEFORE THE THIRD

ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO

THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD.

THE TOTAL VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED IN FISCAL 2005 IN

ORDER TO EFFECT THE 25% DISCOUNT WAS $79 MILLION.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

THE FIRM ISSUED RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE AMENDED SIP, PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION

WITH YEAR-END COMPENSATION AND ACQUISITIONS. OF THE TOTAL

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OUTSTANDING AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER

2004, (I) 30.1 MILLION UNITS AND 24.9 MILLION UNITS,

RESPECTIVELY, REQUIRED FUTURE SERVICE AS A CONDITION TO THE

DELIVERY OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND (II) 25.0 MILLION

UNITS AND 13.0 MILLION UNITS, RESPECTIVELY, DID

NOT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE.

RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE

LOSSES OF CERTAIN FOREIGN ENTITIES AND STATE AND LOCAL

TAX CREDITS.

THE FIRM PERMANENTLY REINVESTS

ELIGIBLE EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND, ACCORDINGLY,

DOES NOT ACCRUE ANY U.S. INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD ARISE IF SUCH

EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, THIS POLICY

RESULTED IN AN UNRECOGNIZED NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $172 MILLION

ATTRIBUTABLE TO REINVESTED EARNINGS OF $2.4 BILLION.

ADDITIONALLY, DURING FISCAL 2005, THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS DECREASED BY $15 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE

TO THE UTILIZATION OF CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL TAX CREDITS. ACQUIRED

FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS OF $24 MILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005 AND $88 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 ARE SUBJECT

TO ANNUAL LIMITATIONS ON UTILIZATION AND WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN

2020. ACQUIRED STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS OF

$328 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND $436 MILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2004 ARE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL LIMITATIONS ON UTILIZATION.

ACQUIRED ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $7 MILLION

AS OF NOVEMBER 2005 AND $32 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004

ARE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL LIMITATIONS ON UTILIZATION, BUT CAN BE

CARRIED FORWARD INDEFINITELY.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, SUCH AS JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND STATES

IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS OPERATIONS, SUCH AS NEW

YORK. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE FIRMS 2003 AND 2004

FISCAL YEARS. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE IRS CONCLUDED ITS EXAMINATION

OF 1999 THROUGH 2002, AND NEW YORK STATE AND CITY SUBSTANTIALLY

CONCLUDED THEIR EXAMINATIONS COVERING PERIODS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR

2003. THE FIRM REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADDITIONAL

ASSESSMENTS BY EACH JURISDICTION TO WHICH THE FIRM PAYS TAXES

RESULTING FROM THE IMPACT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE EXAMINATIONS. TAX

RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES ARE

ADEQUATE IN RELATION TO THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS.

THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION BUT MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE

FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN

PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THAT PERIOD AND THE FIRMS

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THAT PERIOD.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

IN REPORTING TO MANAGEMENT, THE

FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS ARE CATEGORIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE

SEGMENTS: INVESTMENT BANKING, TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS,

AND ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS LINES HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR

ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING

AREAS: (I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, (II) THEIR

METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF CLIENTS THEY

SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THEY

OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS

A WHOLE  COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY  ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION EXPENSES WITHIN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AS WELL AS

PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS. CONSEQUENTLY, PRE-TAX

MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES REVENUES AND

EXPENSES AMONG THE THREE SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN

ALLOCATING CERTAIN REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN

SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE THIRD-PARTY

RATES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT HAVE

NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE ALLOCATION

PROCESS IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE

BUSINESS OF THE FIRM.

THE SEGMENT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN

THE TABLE BELOW IS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING

METHODOLOGIES.



REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN

DETERMINING PRE-TAX EARNINGS.



NET REVENUES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS OF INTEREST INCOME AND

INTEREST EXPENSE TO SPECIFIC SECURITIES, COMMODITIES AND OTHER POSITIONS IN RELATION

TO THE CASH GENERATED BY, OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF, SUCH UNDERLYING POSITIONS. NET

INTEREST IS INCLUDED WITHIN SEGMENT NET REVENUES AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IN

WHICH MANAGEMENT ASSESSES SEGMENT PERFORMANCE.



OVERHEAD EXPENSES NOT DIRECTLY ALLOCABLE TO SPECIFIC SEGMENTS ARE ALLOCATED

RATABLY BASED ON DIRECT SEGMENT EXPENSES.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (THE PARENT

COMPANY), A DELAWARE CORPORATION, SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM) AND NOTES THERETO (THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THESE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE PARENT

COMPANY ONLY. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18, THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK.

THESE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE

ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE

PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND OTHER

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

THESE ESTIMATES.

THE PARENT COMPANY HAS FORMED

NUMEROUS NONCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS THAT ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE

PARENT COMPANY, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, ACTS AS GENERAL PARTNER

FOR THESE FUNDS AND DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC

INTERESTS IN ANY FUND. FOR FUNDS ESTABLISHED ON OR BEFORE JUNE 29,

2005 IN WHICH THE PARENT COMPANY, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES,

HOLDS MORE THAN A MINOR INTEREST AND FOR FUNDS ESTABLISHED OR

MODIFIED AFTER JUNE 29, 2005, THE PARENT COMPANY HAS PROVIDED

THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS WITH RIGHTS TO TERMINATE THE FUNDS (SEE  RECENT

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS IN NOTE 2 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K). SUCH FUND INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED

IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN, ALL

REFERENCES TO NOVEMBER 2005, NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003 REFER

TO THE PARENT COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS ENDED, OR THE DATES, AS THE

CONTEXT REQUIRES, NOVEMBER 25, 2005, NOVEMBER 26, 2004 AND

NOVEMBER 28, 2003, RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE

BEEN MADE TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD,

BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN THE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ON A

TRADE-DATE BASIS AND CONSIST OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, WITH RELATED

UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE

EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER

THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE PARENT

COMPANY SEPARATES ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO TWO CATEGORIES 

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE PARENT COMPANYS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

CONSIST OF EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO

WITH AFFILIATES AND ARE REFLECTED NET OF CASH THAT THE PARENT COMPANY HAS PAID AND

RECEIVED. FAIR VALUES OF THE PARENT COMPANYS EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE

GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING

VALUATION MODELS. THE PARENT COMPANY USES A VARIETY OF VALUATION MODELS INCLUDING

THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS AND OPTION-PRICING MODELS.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

IN VALUING CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS,

THE PARENT COMPANYS PORTFOLIO IS SEPARATED INTO INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES,

INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC COMPANIES (EXCLUDING THE PARENT COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG)) AND THE

PARENT COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN SMFG.

THE PARENT COMPANYS PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO

PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY CARRIED AT COST AS AN APPROXIMATION OF

FAIR VALUE. ADJUSTMENTS TO CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE IF THERE ARE THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN REACHING THAT DETERMINATION, MANY FACTORS

ARE CONSIDERED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO BUDGETS OR PROJECTIONS, TRENDS

WITHIN SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS, UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODELS, EXPECTED EXIT TIMING AND

STRATEGY, AND ANY SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS

CONVERSION FEATURES AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.

THE PARENT COMPANYS PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE LARGE, CONCENTRATED

HOLDINGS THAT RESULT FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, ARE

VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES DISCOUNTED BASED ON PREDETERMINED WRITTEN POLICIES FOR

NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY.

THE PARENT COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM A MODEL THAT INCORPORATES SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE AND

CREDIT SPREADS, THE IMPACT OF NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY, AND THE DOWNSIDE

PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE. THE PARENT COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS GENERALLY NONTRANSFERABLE, BUT IS FREELY

CONVERTIBLE INTO SMFG COMMON STOCK. RESTRICTIONS ON THE PARENT COMPANYS ABILITY TO HEDGE

OR SELL ONE-THIRD OF THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING ITS INVESTMENT IN SMFG LAPSED IN FEBRUARY

2005. AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, THE PARENT COMPANY WAS FULLY HEDGED WITH RESPECT TO THESE

UNRESTRICTED SHARES. UNDER THE PARENT COMPANYS INITIAL AGREEMENT WITH SMFG, RESTRICTIONS

ON THE PARENT COMPANYS ABILITY TO HEDGE OR SELL THE REMAINING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

UNDERLYING ITS INVESTMENT IN SMFG LAPSE IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006 AND

FEBRUARY 7, 2007. IN CONNECTION WITH A PUBLIC OFFERING BY SMFG OF ITS COMMON STOCK,

THE PARENT COMPANY HAS SEPARATELY AGREED WITH SMFG THAT THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE TO

LAPSE ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006 WILL INSTEAD LAPSE ON MARCH 9,

2006. EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2006, THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS SMFG PREFERRED STOCK INTO SHARES OF

SMFG COMMON STOCK IS ¥320,900. THIS PRICE IS SUBJECT TO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IF THE PRICE

OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF CONVERSION IS LESS THAN THE CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT

TO A FLOOR OF ¥105,800).

MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES.

THE

PARENT COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES

(I.E., AN INCREASED SHARE OF A FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS) WHEN THE

RETURN ON THE FUNDS

F-6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

(PARENT COMPANY ONLY)

NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

INVESTMENTS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS.

OVERRIDES ARE BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH

MERCHANT BANKING FUND, AND FUTURE INVESTMENT UNDERPERFORMANCE MAY

REQUIRE AMOUNTS OF OVERRIDE PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE PARENT

COMPANY TO BE RETURNED TO THE FUNDS. ACCORDINGLY, OVERRIDES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS

ONLY WHEN ALL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. OVERRIDES

ARE INCLUDED IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED

COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS AT

ACQUISITION DATE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL IS TESTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR

IMPAIRMENT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS TRIGGERED IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK

VALUE. SUCH LOSS IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE.

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND

EQUIPMENT, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN

SERVICE PRIOR TO DECEMBER 1, 2001 ARE DEPRECIATED UNDER THE

ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY METHOD. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN

SERVICE ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2001 ARE DEPRECIATED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET. LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS FOR WHICH THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT IS

SHORTER THAN THE TERM OF THE LEASE ARE AMORTIZED UNDER THE

ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY METHOD IF PLACED IN SERVICE PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 1, 2001. ALL OTHER LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE

IMPROVEMENT OR THE TERM OF THE LEASE, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER.

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND

EQUIPMENT ARE TESTED FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS

CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET

OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE SUM OF THE EXPECTED

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS

LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN

NON-U.S. CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE

PREVAILING ON THE DATE OF THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT

AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. THE PARENT COMPANY

SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS NET INVESTMENT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES THROUGH THE USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT. FOR FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED

ON CHANGES IN FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES; ACCORDINGLY, FORWARD POINTS

ARE REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED ON

CHANGES IN SPOT RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR

LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS IN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE INCLUDED IN

THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE RECOGNIZED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF THE PARENT COMPANYS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE

REALIZED. THE PARENT COMPANYS TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES

AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. TAX PROVISIONS

ARE COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING

FOR INCOME TAXES. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO INCOME TAXES

ARE RECORDED WHEN THE CRITERIA FOR LOSS RECOGNITION UNDER SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, AS AMENDED, HAVE BEEN

MET.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE PARENT COMPANY DEFINES CASH

EQUIVALENTS AS HIGHLY LIQUID OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS HELD IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS

UNSECURED LIQUIDITY IS RAISED BY THE PARENT COMPANY. THE PARENT

COMPANY THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR FINANCING

AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY ADVANCES

ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. SUCH FUNDING IS INCLUDED IN LOANS TO

AFFILIATES AND SUBORDINATED LOANS TO AFFILIATES IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. INTERCOMPANY

EXPOSURE IS MANAGED BY REQUIRING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED

INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR SHORTER THAN THE

MATURITIES OF THE AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE PARENT COMPANY. THIS

POLICY ENSURES THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT

COMPANY WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS

THIRD-PARTY BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES PLEDGE COLLATERAL AT LOAN VALUE TO COVER THEIR

INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN SUBORDINATED DEBT) IN ORDER TO

MITIGATE PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY RISK. EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH EQUITY CAPITAL AND INCLUDED

IN INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PARENT COMPANY ENTERS INTO

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH AFFILIATES TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS AND TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE AND

CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. TO MANAGE EXPOSURE ON ITS BORROWINGS, THE

PARENT COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR-BASED

FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS. THE PARENT COMPANY APPLIES

FAIR-VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE

BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE (I.E., LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE

(LIBOR)) ON ITS FIXED RATE LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. DERIVATIVE

BALANCES WITH AFFILIATES, INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED,

AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET

PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, WERE $2.79 BILLION AND $464 MILLION,

AND $7.40 BILLION AND $139 MILLION, AS OF

NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

INTEREST INCOME IS LARGELY GENERATED

FROM LOANS MADE TO AFFILIATES.

THE PARENT COMPANY ALSO ALLOCATES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL RENTAL AND OTHER COSTS RELATING TO PROPERTIES

OCCUPIED BY CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. THE PARENT COMPANY

ADDITIONALLY ALLOCATES THE COST OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

PROGRAMS TO SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES RELATING TO COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ALSO INCLUDE THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS MATURING WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE

AND CERTAIN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS THAT ARE REDEEMABLE WITHIN ONE

CONTINGENCIES

THE PARENT COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN A

NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF ITS

BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN THE

AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PARENT

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE PARENT

COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING,

IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD. GIVEN THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE PARENT

COMPANYS LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY IN CASES

OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR

FINES ARE SOUGHT, THE PARENT COMPANY CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR

RANGES OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS WHERE THERE IS ONLY A

REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

GUARANTEES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 30, 2006, THE

PARENT COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO., ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY (OTHER

THAN NONRECOURSE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS). IN ADDITION, THE PARENT

COMPANY GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS

NEGOTIATED WITH THE COUNTERPARTY. THE PARENT COMPANY IS UNABLE TO

DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER ITS SUBSIDIARY

GUARANTEES; HOWEVER, BECAUSE THESE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS ARE ALSO

OBLIGATIONS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OR DISCLOSED IN NOTE 6

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8

OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, THE PARENT COMPANYS

LIABILITIES AS GUARANTOR ARE NOT SEPARATELY DISCLOSED HEREIN.

IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN ASSET

SALES AND SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, THE PARENT COMPANY MAY

GUARANTEE THE COLLECTION OF CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS. IN CONNECTION

WITH ITS MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, THE PARENT COMPANY MAY ISSUE

LOAN GUARANTEES TO SECURE FINANCING. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT

COMPANY PROVIDES LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER GUARANTEES, ON A

LIMITED BASIS, TO ENABLE CLIENTS TO ENHANCE THEIR CREDIT STANDING

AND COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARENT

COMPANYS ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUST, THE PARENT COMPANY

EFFECTIVELY PROVIDED FOR THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE OF

THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE TRUST HELD BY THIRD PARTIES. TIMELY

PAYMENT BY THE PARENT COMPANY OF INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE AND PERFORMANCE OF

ITS OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO COVER PAYMENTS DUE BY THE TRUST ON ITS BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS. AS A RESULT, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE

PARENT COMPANY WILL HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE TRUST

OTHER THAN THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

AND IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE TRUST.

WITH THEIR ACTING AS AN AGENT OF, OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO, THE

PARENT COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES. THE PARENT

COMPANY ALSO INDEMNIFIES SOME CLIENTS AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES

INCURRED IN THE EVENT SPECIFIED THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS,

INCLUDING SUB-CUSTODIANS AND THIRD-PARTY BROKERS, IMPROPERLY

EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS. THE PARENT COMPANY IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN

ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE GUARANTEES AND

INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY

THE PARENT COMPANY WILL HAVE TO MAKE MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE

ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE GUARANTEES AND

APPLICATION OF CERTAIN U.S. TAX LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH

ORDINARY-COURSE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS SECURITIES ISSUANCES,

TERMS AND ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

GENERALLY, THERE ARE NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN

THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND THE CONTINGENCIES TRIGGERING THE

OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR. THE PARENT

COMPANY IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT

UNDER THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE PARENT COMPANY WILL HAVE TO MAKE

ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO LIABILITIES

RELATED TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONDENSED
