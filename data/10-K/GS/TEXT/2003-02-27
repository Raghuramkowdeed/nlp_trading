CLIENT-FOCUSED INVESTMENT BANKERS WITH EXECUTION AND INDUSTRY

EXPERTISE. BECAUSE OUR BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL, WE HAVE ADAPTED

OUR ORGANIZATION TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR CLIENTS IN EACH

BELIEVE THAT WE PROVIDE SERVICES IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION FOR

THE BENEFIT OF OUR CLIENTS.

FINANCIAL ADVISORY

GOLDMAN SACHS IS A LEADING INVESTMENT BANK IN

WORLDWIDE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. OUR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

CAPABILITIES ARE EVIDENCED BY OUR SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF

ASSIGNMENTS IN LARGE, COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE

MULTIPLE SERVICES, INCLUDING ONE-STOP ACQUISITION

FINANCING AND CROSS-BORDER STRUCTURING EXPERTISE AS WELL AS

SERVICES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE FIRM, SUCH AS CURRENCY HEDGING.

UNDERWRITING

WE UNDERWRITE A WIDE RANGE OF SECURITIES AND

OTHER INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK,

CONVERTIBLE AND EXCHANGEABLE SECURITIES, INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT,

HIGH-YIELD DEBT, SOVEREIGN AND EMERGING MARKET DEBT, MUNICIPAL

DEBT, BANK LOANS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND REAL

ESTATE-RELATED SECURITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

AND THE SECURITIES OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS.

EQUITY UNDERWRITING.

EQUITY UNDERWRITING HAS BEEN A

LONG-TERM CORE STRENGTH OF GOLDMAN SACHS. AS WITH MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING

MANDATES FOR LARGE, COMPLEX EQUITY UNDERWRITINGS. WE BELIEVE OUR

LEADERSHIP IN WORLDWIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND WORLDWIDE

PUBLIC COMMON STOCK OFFERINGS REFLECTS OUR EXPERTISE IN COMPLEX

TRANSACTIONS, TRACK RECORD AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT A KEY FACTOR IN OUR EQUITY

UNDERWRITING SUCCESS IS THE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE

INVESTMENT BANKERS, SALES FORCE AND OTHERS AS COORDINATED BY OUR

EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS GROUP. WITH INSTITUTIONAL SALES

PROFESSIONALS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS LOCATED

IN EVERY MAJOR MARKET AROUND THE WORLD, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS

RELATIONSHIPS WITH A LARGE AND DIVERSE GROUP OF INVESTORS.

DEBT UNDERWRITING.

WE ENGAGE IN THE UNDERWRITING AND

ORIGINATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING.



INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT;



HIGH-YIELD DEBT AND BANK LOANS FOR

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE ISSUERS;



EMERGING MARKET DEBT, WHICH INCLUDES CORPORATE

AND SOVEREIGN ISSUES; AND



STRUCTURED SECURITIES, INCLUDING ASSET-BACKED AND

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

WE HAVE EMPLOYED A FOCUSED APPROACH IN DEBT

UNDERWRITING, EMPHASIZING HIGH VALUE-ADDED AREAS IN SERVICING

OUR CLIENTS.

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 38%

OF 2002 NET REVENUES. OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

BUSINESS FACILITATES CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS WITH A DIVERSE GROUP

OF CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND

INDIVIDUALS AND TAKES PROPRIETARY POSITIONS THROUGH MARKET

MAKING IN, AND TRADING OF, FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS,

CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND SWAPS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES. IN

ADDITION, WE ENGAGE IN FLOOR-BASED AND ELECTRONIC MARKET MAKING

AS A SPECIALIST ON U.S. EQUITIES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES. IN

ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS, OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESS IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A WIDE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE OUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO

TAKE RISK DISTINGUISHES US FROM MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.

5

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IS DIVIDED INTO

THREE CATEGORIES.



FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN AND TRADE INTEREST

RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES, STRUCTURE

AND ENTER INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND

MARKETS IN, ACT AS A SPECIALIST FOR, AND TRADE EQUITIES AND

EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS, STRUCTURE AND ENTER INTO EQUITY

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND ENGAGE IN PROPRIETARY TRADING; AND



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY

REPRESENTS NET REVENUES FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS.

FIXED

INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES

FICC IS A LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED OPERATION THROUGH

WHICH WE ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER-DRIVEN MARKET MAKING

AND PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES. FICCS PRINCIPAL

PRODUCT AREAS ARE.

 COMMODITIES AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES;



CREDIT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT-GRADE

CORPORATE SECURITIES, HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES, BANK LOANS,

MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND EMERGING MARKET

DEBT;



CURRENCIES AND CURRENCY DERIVATIVES;



INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE

DERIVATIVES AND GLOBAL GOVERNMENT SECURITIES;



MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS; AND



MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND LOANS.

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM OUR

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS IN THREE WAYS. FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY

LIQUID MARKETS, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR

MODEST SPREADS. SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG MARKET

RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL POSITION, WE ALSO UNDERTAKE

TRANSACTIONS IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WHERE SPREADS ARE GENERALLY

LARGER. FINALLY, WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM STRUCTURING AND

EXECUTING TRANSACTIONS THAT ADDRESS COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

IN ITS CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS, FICC STRIVES TO

DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY SERVICE BY OFFERING BROAD MARKET-MAKING,

RESEARCH AND MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON A GLOBAL BASIS

AND BY CREATING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX CLIENT PROBLEMS

BY DRAWING UPON OUR STRUCTURING AND TRADING EXPERTISE. IN

ADDITION, WE USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TAKE POSITIONS IN MARKETS TO

FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES, WE ASSUME A

VARIETY OF RISKS AND DEVOTE RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY, ANALYZE AND

BENEFIT FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE LEVERAGE OUR STRONG RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES AND CAPITALIZE ON OUR PROPRIETARY ANALYTICAL MODELS

TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE INFORMED TRADING JUDGMENTS. WE

SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED DISPARITIES IN THE VALUE OF

ASSETS IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND FROM MACROECONOMIC AND

COMPANY-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

A CORE ACTIVITY IN FICC IS MARKET MAKING IN A

BROAD ARRAY OF SECURITIES AND PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE A

PRIMARY DEALER IN MANY OF THE LARGEST GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS

AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM. WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE MAJOR FUTURES EXCHANGES,

AND ALSO HAVE INTERBANK DEALER STATUS IN THE CURRENCY MARKETS IN

NEW YORK, LONDON, TOKYO AND HONG KONG. OUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE

MARKETS IN A BROAD RANGE OF FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY

PRODUCTS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES IS CRUCIAL BOTH TO OUR CLIENT

RELATIONSHIPS AND TO SUPPORT OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY

PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY. OUR FICC RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES OF

GLOBAL ECONOMIC, CURRENCY AND FINANCIAL MARKET TRENDS, AS WELL

AS CREDIT ANALYSES OF CORPORATE AND SOVEREIGN FIXED INCOME

SECURITIES.

6

EQUITIES

GOLDMAN SACHS TRADES EQUITY SECURITIES AND

EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS (SUCH AS CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES,

OPTIONS, FUTURES AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS) ON A GLOBAL BASIS AS AN AGENT, A MARKET MAKER AND

ON A PROPRIETARY BASIS. AS AN AGENT AND MARKET MAKER WE

FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS, OFTEN BY COMMITTING CAPITAL,

TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS WITH LARGE BLOCKS OF STOCKS OR

OPTIONS. IN THE U.S., WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING SPECIALISTS ON

THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AND IN THE LISTED OPTIONS MARKET AND

WE ARE A DESIGNATED MARKET MAKER IN OVER 5,000 STOCKS TRADED ON

THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET. GOLDMAN SACHS IS A MEMBER OF MOST OF

THE WORLDS MAJOR STOCK, FUTURES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES,

INCLUDING THOSE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, CHICAGO, LONDON, PARIS,

FRANKFURT, TOKYO AND HONG KONG.

WE EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND

DERIVATIVES AS AGENTS FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS

THAT GENERATE COMMISSION REVENUES. COMMISSIONS EARNED ON THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES

SERVICES.

IN EQUITY TRADING, AS IN FICC, WE GENERATE NET

REVENUES FROM OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS IN THREE WAYS. FIRST,

BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG MARKET RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL

POSITION, WE UNDERTAKE LARGE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE BENEFIT

FROM SPREADS THAT ARE GENERALLY LARGER THAN IN HIGHER VOLUME

TRANSACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOLDMAN SACHS IS ACTIVE IN THE

EXECUTION OF LARGE BLOCK TRADES (TRADES OF 50,000 OR MORE

SHARES). SECOND, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID PRINCIPAL MARKETS, WE

UNDERTAKE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS.

FINALLY, WE ALSO BENEFIT FROM STRUCTURING COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS.

IN THE LISTED OPTIONS AND FUTURES MARKETS, WE

STRUCTURE, DISTRIBUTE AND EXECUTE OTC DERIVATIVES ON MARKET

INDICES, INDUSTRY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL COMPANY STOCKS TO

FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES.

WE DEVELOP QUANTITATIVE STRATEGIES AND RENDER ADVICE WITH

RESPECT TO PORTFOLIO HEDGING AND RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET

ALLOCATION TRANSACTIONS. WE ALSO CREATE SPECIALLY TAILORED

INSTRUMENTS TO ENABLE SOPHISTICATED INVESTORS TO UNDERTAKE

HEDGING STRATEGIES AND ESTABLISH OR LIQUIDATE INVESTMENT

POSITIONS. WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING PARTICIPANTS IN THE TRADING

AND DEVELOPMENT OF EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. WE ARE AN

ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE TRADING OF FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON MOST

OF THE MAJOR EXCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA.

OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING BUSINESSES UTILIZE A

VARIETY OF STRATEGIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND

EVENTS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND MARKETS. THESE INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHERS, RELATIVE VALUE TRADING (WHICH INVOLVES TRADING

STRATEGIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PERCEIVED DISCREPANCIES IN THE

RELATIVE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DEBT AND

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS), RISK ARBITRAGE (WHICH FOCUSES ON

EVENT-ORIENTED SPECIAL SITUATIONS SUCH AS CORPORATE

RESTRUCTURINGS, RECAPITALIZATIONS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND

LEGAL AND REGULATORY EVENTS) AND STATISTICAL ARBITRAGE (WHICH

INVOLVES TRADING STRATEGIES BASED ON ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL

PRICE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SECTORS OF THE EQUITIES MARKETS).

TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADING AND MARKET-MAKING

CAPABILITIES ARE KEY INGREDIENTS TO OUR SUCCESS. WHILE THESE

BUSINESSES HAVE GENERALLY EARNED ATTRACTIVE RETURNS, WE HAVE IN

THE PAST INCURRED SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES IN PERIODS OF

MARKET TURBULENCE, SUCH AS IN 1994 AND THE SECOND HALF OF 1998,

AND IN CONNECTION WITH SPECIFIC SIGNIFICANT POSITIONS.

OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO

BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING POSITIONS WITH OUR

EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, WE

ANALYZE NOT ONLY MARKET RISK BUT ALSO CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL

RISKS. RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDES INPUT FROM ALL LEVELS OF GOLDMAN

SACHS, FROM THE TRADING DESKS TO THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

7

ANALYSIS  RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE

2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE IN PART II, ITEMS 7 AND 7A OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

IN BOTH OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN AND PROPRIETARY

ACTIVITIES IN EQUITIES AND FICC, WE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL RISKS ON A GLOBAL BASIS ACROSS ALL

OUR PRODUCTS.

PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MERCHANT BANKING

ACTIVITIES, WE INVEST BY MAKING PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY

AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE RAISE AND MANAGE. AS OF NOVEMBER 2002,

WE MANAGED PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH TOTAL EQUITY CAPITAL

COMMITMENTS FROM OUR CLIENTS AND FROM GOLDMAN SACHS OF

$37.55 BILLION, INCLUDING FUNDED AMOUNTS; GOLDMAN SACHS

ALSO HAD OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS TO INVEST UP TO

$1.46 BILLION. THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS GENERATE CAPITAL

APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION AND, UPON DISPOSITION, REALIZED

GAINS OR LOSSES. SEE  ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

SECURITIES SERVICES  ASSET MANAGEMENT 

MERCHANT BANKING FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR MERCHANT BANKING

FUNDS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2002, THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS HELD DIRECTLY OR THROUGH OUR MERCHANT

BANKING FUNDS WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.78 BILLION, WHICH

CONSISTED OF CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS WITH AN AGGREGATE

CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.04 BILLION AND REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENTS WITH AN AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $744 MILLION.

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES

SECURITIES SERVICES SEGMENT, WHICH REPRESENTED 42% OF 2002 NET

REVENUES, ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

DIVERSE CLIENT BASE OF INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS;



SECURITIES SERVICES.

SECURITIES SERVICES INCLUDES PRIME

BROKERAGE, FINANCING SERVICES AND SECURITIES LENDING, AND OUR

MATCHED BOOK BUSINESSES, ALL OF WHICH GENERATE REVENUES

PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS OR FEES; AND



COMMISSIONS.

COMMISSIONS INCLUDES FEES FROM

EXECUTING AND CLEARING CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK,

OPTIONS AND FUTURES MARKETS WORLDWIDE. COMMISSIONS ALSO INCLUDES

REVENUES FROM THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS

DERIVED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WHEN THE RETURN ON A

FUNDS INVESTMENTS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS

(TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS AN OVERRIDE). FOR A

DISCUSSION REGARDING OUR INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS

FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS, SEE  ASSET

MANAGEMENT  MERCHANT BANKING BELOW.

IN JANUARY 2002, WE BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT A NEW

FEE-BASED PRICING STRUCTURE IN OUR NASDAQ TRADING BUSINESS.

PREVIOUSLY WE DID NOT CHARGE EXPLICIT FEES IN THIS BUSINESS BUT

RATHER EARNED MARKET-MAKING REVENUES BASED GENERALLY ON THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BID AND ASK PRICES. THESE MARKET-MAKING NET

REVENUES ARE REPORTED IN OUR EQUITIES TRADING RESULTS. AS A

RESULT OF THE CHANGE TO THE FEE-BASED PRICING STRUCTURE, A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR NASDAQ NET REVENUES IS REPORTED IN

COMMISSIONS.

ASSET

MANAGEMENT

WE OFFER A BROAD ARRAY OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

AND ADVICE ACROSS ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES: GLOBAL EQUITY, FIXED

INCOME (INCLUDING MONEY MARKETS), CURRENCY AND ALTERNATIVE

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS (

I.E.

, INVESTMENT VEHICLES WITH

NON-TRADITIONAL INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND/OR STRATEGIES).

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY GENERATE FEES

BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR VALUE AND INCLUDE OUR MUTUAL

FUNDS, SEPARATE ACCOUNTS MANAGED FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND

INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS, OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS AND OTHER

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS. WE ALSO EARN TRADING COMMISSIONS

ON ASSETS IN BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OF HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS,

ALTHOUGH THE TREND IN

MERCHANT BANKING.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED A

SUCCESSFUL RECORD IN THE CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE MERCHANT

BANKING BUSINESS, SPONSORING PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH

$37.55 BILLION OF COMMITTED CAPITAL AS OF

NOVEMBER 2002, OF WHICH $24.95 BILLION HAS BEEN

FUNDED. WE HAVE PROVIDED A PORTION OF THOSE AMOUNTS. SEE

 TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS 

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ABOVE. OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING

PENSION PLANS, ENDOWMENTS, CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS, HAVE PROVIDED THE REMAINDER.

OUR STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO OUR MERCHANT BANKING

FUNDS GENERALLY IS TO INVEST OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO BUILD A

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS THAT IS DIVERSIFIED BY INDUSTRY,

PRODUCT TYPE, GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND

TYPE. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUE, ON A GLOBAL BASIS,

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES IN PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, LEVERAGED BUYOUTS AND ACQUISITIONS. AS

OF NOVEMBER 2002, OUR CORPORATE MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS HAD TOTAL

COMMITTED CAPITAL OF $25.42 BILLION. OTHER FUNDS, WITH

TOTAL COMMITTED CAPITAL OF $12.12 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER

2002, INVEST IN REAL ESTATE OPERATING COMPANIES, DEBT AND EQUITY

INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, AND OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED

INVESTMENTS.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE THREE

REVENUE STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS

GENERALLY A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL,

INVESTED CAPITAL, TOTAL GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE.

THESE ANNUAL MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET

MANAGEMENT REVENUES. SECOND, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTOR IN THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

THE FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING

FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON

REALIZATION. THESE ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS NET REVENUES. FINALLY, AFTER THE FUND HAS

ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE RECEIVE AN

INCREASED SHARE OF THE FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS THAT IS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS

INVESTMENTS. REVENUES FROM THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE

FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS ARE INCLUDED IN COMMISSIONS.

SECURITIES

SERVICES

SECURITIES SERVICES ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PRIME

BROKERAGE, FINANCING SERVICES AND SECURITIES LENDING. WE PROVIDE

THESE SERVICES TO A DIVERSIFIED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER

BASE,

10

INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, PENSION FUNDS, HEDGE

FUNDS, FOUNDATIONS, ENDOWMENTS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

SECURITIES SERVICES ALSO INCLUDES OUR MATCHED BOOK BUSINESSES.

WE OFFER PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS,

ALLOWING THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO TRADE WITH MOST BROKERS WHILE

MAINTAINING A SINGLE SOURCE FOR FINANCING AND CONSOLIDATED

PORTFOLIO REPORTS. OUR PRIME BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES PROVIDE

CLEARING AND CUSTODY IN 50 MARKETS (WITH REVENUES FROM CLEARING

AND CUSTODY INCLUDED IN COMMISSIONS), CONSOLIDATED

MULTI-CURRENCY ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING AND OFFSHORE FUND

ADMINISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE FINANCING TO OUR

CLIENTS FOR THEIR SECURITIES TRADING ACTIVITIES THROUGH MARGIN

AND SECURITIES LOANS THAT ARE COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES, CASH

OR OTHER ACCEPTABLE COLLATERAL HELD IN THE CLIENTS ACCOUNT.

SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE

THE BORROWING AND LENDING OF EQUITY SECURITIES TO COVER CUSTOMER

AND GOLDMAN SACHS SHORT SALES AND OTHERWISE TO MAKE

DELIVERIES INTO THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, WE ARE AN ACTIVE

PARTICIPANT IN THE BROKER-TO-BROKER SECURITIES LENDING BUSINESS

AND THE THIRD-PARTY AGENCY LENDING BUSINESS.

COMMISSIONS

GOLDMAN SACHS GENERATES FEES FROM EXECUTING AND

CLEARING CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES

MARKETS WORLDWIDE. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, COMMISSIONS ALSO INCLUDES

THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS DERIVED FROM OUR

MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS.

GLOBAL INVESTMENT RESEARCH

OUR GLOBAL INVESTMENT RESEARCH DIVISION PROVIDES

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ON INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES,

MACROECONOMICS, CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY

ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

GLOBAL INVESTMENT RESEARCH EMPLOYS A TEAM

APPROACH THAT AS OF NOVEMBER 2002 PROVIDED RESEARCH COVERAGE OF

APPROXIMATELY 1,850 COMPANIES WORLDWIDE, OVER 50 ECONOMIES AND

25 STOCK MARKETS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY FOUR GROUPS.



THE EQUITY ANALYST GROUP, WHICH CONSISTS OF FOUR

REGIONAL DEPARTMENTS, PROVIDES FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS, FORECASTS

AND INVESTMENT OPINIONS FOR COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES WORLDWIDE.

EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS ARE ORGANIZED REGIONALLY BY INDUSTRY

TEAM, WHICH ALLOWS FOR EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE

SHARING AMONG ANALYSTS ON IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THEMES;



THE ECONOMIC RESEARCH GROUP, WHICH CONSISTS OF

FOUR REGIONAL DEPARTMENTS, FORMULATES MACROECONOMIC FORECASTS

FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES BASED

ON THE GLOBALLY COORDINATED VIEWS OF ITS REGIONAL ECONOMISTS;



THE PORTFOLIO STRATEGY GROUP, WHICH CONSISTS OF

FOUR REGIONAL DEPARTMENTS, FORMULATES EQUITY MARKET FORECASTS

AND PROVIDES OPINIONS ON BOTH ASSET AND INDUSTRY SECTOR

ALLOCATION; AND



TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY

GOLDMAN SACHS IS COMMITTED TO THE ONGOING

DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT THE

ORGANIZATION. OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES CAN BE BROADLY

CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR EFFORTS.



ENHANCING CLIENT SERVICE THROUGH INCREASED

CONNECTIVITY AND THE PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED, TAILORED SERVICES;



IMPROVING OUR TRADING, EXECUTION AND CLEARING

CAPABILITIES;



RISK MANAGEMENT; AND



OVERALL EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY AND CONTROL.

WE HAVE TAILORED OUR SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS BY

PROVIDING THEM WITH ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR GLOBAL ELECTRONIC

TRADING AND INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES TO OUR CLIENTS

VIA THE INTERNET AND OTHER FORMS OF ELECTRONIC CONNECTIVITY.

THESE CAPABILITIES COVER MANY OF OUR FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY,

COMMODITY, EQUITY AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE

HAVE ALSO USED THE INTERNET TO IMPROVE THE EASE AND QUALITY OF

COMMUNICATION WITH OUR INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS.

INTERNET TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE HAVE

CHANGED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE WAYS THAT SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE TRADED, DISTRIBUTED AND SETTLED.

THIS CREATES BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR OUR

BUSINESSES. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE HAVE DEVELOPED SOFTWARE THAT ENABLES US TO

MONITOR AND ANALYZE OUR MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS. THIS RISK

MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE NOT ONLY ANALYZES MARKET RISK ON FIRMWIDE,

DIVISIONAL AND TRADING DESK LEVELS, BUT ALSO BREAKS DOWN OUR

RISK INTO ITS UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, PERMITTING MANAGEMENT TO

EVALUATE EXPOSURES ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC INTEREST RATE,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE, EQUITY PRICE OR COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES.

TO ASSIST FURTHER IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES,

DATA FROM MANY SOURCES ARE AGGREGATED DAILY INTO CREDIT

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT GIVE SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND PROFESSIONALS

IN THE CREDIT AND CONTROLLERS DEPARTMENTS THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE

TIMELY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT EXPOSURES WORLDWIDE,

INCLUDING NETTING INFORMATION, AND THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE

COMPLEX RISK SITUATIONS EFFECTIVELY. OUR SOFTWARE ACCESSES THIS

DATA, ALLOWS FOR QUICK ANALYSIS AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL

TRADES, AND INTERACTS WITH OTHER GOLDMAN SACHS SYSTEMS.

TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN

IMPROVING THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF MANY AREAS OF GOLDMAN SACHS.

BY AUTOMATING MANY TRADING PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONAL AND

ACCOUNTING PROCESSES, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED OUR

EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ONE OF THE STRENGTHS AND

PRINCIPAL REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE

QUALITY AND DEDICATION OF ITS PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF

BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT

THAT FOSTERS PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY AND

COOPERATION AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL

EMPLOYEES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN

IMPORTANT PART. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR

AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT

PART OF INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE

REVIEW PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS,

CO-WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW

PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2002, WE HAD 19,739

EMPLOYEES, WHICH EXCLUDES EMPLOYEES OF GOLDMAN SACHS

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARIES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COSTS

OF THESE PROPERTY

12

MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES ARE REIMBURSED TO GOLDMAN

SACHS BY THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS TO WHICH THESE

SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND

ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND

WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER BROKERS

AND DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES,

INVESTMENT ADVISORS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMERCIAL BANKS

AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS

GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT OR NICHE BASIS.

OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION,

REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING

AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON OUR

ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR

EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, DUE IN PART TO U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION

THAT HAS EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS

AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK. IN PARTICULAR, A NUMBER OF

LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER

BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE ESTABLISHED OR

ACQUIRED BROKER-DEALERS OR HAVE MERGED WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER A

WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND INSURANCE

TO BROKERAGE, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING SERVICES,

WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY ALSO HAVE THE

ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES PRODUCTS

WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH COULD RESULT

IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR BUSINESSES. MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED,

AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE, PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE

BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS

THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR

RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO

REQUIRE SUCH COMMITMENTS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING ASSIGNMENTS.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC

REACH OF SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED

THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO

COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER

AND BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL

PRESENCE AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN

SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, EQUITY AND

DEBT UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS TRADING SPREADS, HAVE

BEEN UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE ABILITY TO

EXECUTE TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH

OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, MAY INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON

TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD

ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE. MOREOVER, THE

INTRODUCTION OF DECIMALIZATION HAS LED TO A REDUCTION IN THE

REVENUES OF OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESS AND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

A NEW FEE-BASED PRICING STRUCTURE IN OUR NASDAQ TRADING

BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER  ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY

EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE

FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING PRICES.

THE TRADING OF FUTURES ON SINGLE STOCKS COMMENCED

IN NOVEMBER 2002. IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL WHAT THE EXACT

IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF SINGLE STOCK FUTURES CONTRACTS

WILL BE ON THE BUSINESSES OF GOLDMAN SACHS. WHILE COMMISSIONS

AND CLEARING FEES MAY INCREASE, OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS,

IN PARTICULAR, OUR OTC DERIVATIVE BUSINESS, MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

REGULATION

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE SECURITIES

AND COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS INDUSTRIES, IS SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE. AS A

MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY, REGULATORY BODIES IN THE UNITED STATES

AND THE REST OF THE WORLD ARE CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING THE

INTEGRITY OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL MARKETS AND WITH

PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF CUSTOMERS PARTICIPATING IN THOSE

MARKETS. THEY ARE NOT, HOWEVER, CHARGED WITH PROTECTING THE

INTERESTS OF GOLDMAN SACHS SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS.

BROKER-DEALERS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATIONS THAT COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS,

INCLUDING SALES METHODS, TRADE PRACTICES, USE AND SAFEKEEPING OF

CUSTOMERS FUNDS AND SECURITIES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

RECORD-KEEPING, THE FINANCING OF CUSTOMERS PURCHASES, AND

THE CONDUCT OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATION, CHANGES IN RULES PROMULGATED BY SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS, OR CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT

OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES, EITHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR

ELSEWHERE, MAY DIRECTLY AFFECT THE OPERATION AND PROFITABILITY

OF GOLDMAN SACHS.

REGULATION

IN THE UNITED STATES

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SEC IS THE FEDERAL

AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS. OUR PRINCIPAL BROKER-DEALER IN THE UNITED

STATES IS GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., WHICH IS REGISTERED AS

A BROKER-DEALER AND AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH THE SEC AND AS

A BROKER-DEALER IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA. SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE NYSE AND

THE NASD, ADOPT RULES THAT APPLY TO, AND EXAMINE, BROKER-DEALERS

SUCH AS GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IN ADDITION, STATE

SECURITIES AND OTHER REGULATORS ALSO HAVE REGULATORY OR

OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY

VARIOUS NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY BODIES AND

SELF-REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES WHERE WE

HAVE OFFICES. SPEAR, LEEDS & KELLOGG, L.P. AND CERTAIN

OF ITS AFFILIATES ARE REGISTERED U.S. BROKER-DEALERS AND

ARE REGULATED BY THE SEC, THE NYSE AND THE NASD. GOLDMAN SACHS

FINANCIAL MARKETS, L.P. IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN OTC

DERIVATIVES DEALER AND CONDUCTS CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES

BUSINESSES PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED BY OTHER AFFILIATES.

THE COMMODITY FUTURES AND COMMODITY OPTIONS

INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER THE

COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED. THE COMMODITY FUTURES

TRADING COMMISSION IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY CHARGED WITH THE

ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS

THEREUNDER. SEVERAL OF GOLDMAN SACHS SUBSIDIARIES,

INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. AND SPEAR,

LEEDS & KELLOGG, L.P., ARE REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AND

ACT AS FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS, COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS OR

COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE COMMODITY

EXCHANGE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. THE RULES AND

REGULATIONS OF VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS

THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE, OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES AND THE

NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION, ALSO GOVERN THE COMMODITY FUTURES

AND COMMODITY OPTIONS BUSINESSES OF THESE ENTITIES.

AS A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND MEMBER OF

VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, GOLDMAN, SACHS &

CO. IS SUBJECT TO THE SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE,

RULE 15C3-1. THIS RULE SPECIFIES THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF NET

CAPITAL A BROKER-DEALER MUST MAINTAIN AND ALSO REQUIRES THAT A

SIGNIFICANT PART OF ITS ASSETS BE KEPT IN RELATIVELY LIQUID

FORM. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE NET

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE CFTC AND VARIOUS SECURITIES AND

COMMODITY EXCHANGES. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

THE SEC AND VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS

IMPOSE RULES THAT REQUIRE NOTIFICATION WHEN NET CAPITAL FALLS

BELOW CERTAIN PREDEFINED CRITERIA, LIMIT THE RATIO OF

SUBORDINATED DEBT TO EQUITY IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL

COMPOSITION OF A BROKER-DEALER AND CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF A

BROKER-DEALER TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES. ADDITIONALLY, THE SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL

RULE IMPOSES CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF

PROHIBITING A

14

BROKER-DEALER FROM DISTRIBUTING OR WITHDRAWING

CAPITAL AND REQUIRING PRIOR NOTICE TO THE SEC FOR CERTAIN

WITHDRAWALS OF CAPITAL.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED THE GOLDMAN SACHS

TRUST COMPANY, N.A., A NATIONAL BANK LIMITED TO FIDUCIARY

ACTIVITIES, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PERSONAL TRUST AND ESTATE

ADMINISTRATION AND RELATED SERVICES TO ITS HIGH-NET-WORTH

CLIENTS ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS. GSTC MAINTAINS COLLECTIVE

INVESTMENT FUNDS FOR ELIGIBLE PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN

CLIENTS. AS A NATIONAL BANK, GSTC IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY

THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND IS A MEMBER

BANK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. GSTC WILL NOT ACCEPT

DEPOSITS OR MAKE LOANS AND, AS A RESULT, IT IS NOT CONSIDERED TO

BE A BANK FOR PURPOSES OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT. IT ALSO

DOES NOT CARRY FDIC INSURANCE AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001, ENACTED IN RESPONSE

TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, CONTAINS

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND

MANDATES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS NEW REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR VERIFYING CLIENT

IDENTIFICATION AT ACCOUNT OPENING, AND OBLIGATIONS TO MONITOR

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES. THROUGH

THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS, THE ACT SEEKS TO PROMOTE COOPERATION

AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REGULATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

ENTITIES IN IDENTIFYING PARTIES THAT MAY BE INVOLVED IN

TERRORISM OR MONEY LAUNDERING. ANTI-MONEY-LAUNDERING LAWS

OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. CONTAIN SOME SIMILAR PROVISIONS. THE

INCREASED OBLIGATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

GOLDMAN SACHS, TO IDENTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS, WATCH FOR AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND SHARE

INFORMATION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REQUIRES THE

IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNAL PRACTICES, PROCEDURES

AND CONTROLS WHICH WILL INCREASE OUR COSTS AND MAY SUBJECT US TO

LIABILITY.

REGULATION

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES

GOLDMAN SACHS IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE

INTERNATIONAL FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES MARKETS. MANY OF OUR

AFFILIATES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THESE MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO

COMPREHENSIVE REGULATIONS THAT INCLUDE SOME FORM OF CAPITAL

ADEQUACY RULES AND OTHER CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES. GOLDMAN

SACHS PROVIDES INVESTMENT SERVICES IN AND FROM THE UNITED

KINGDOM UNDER THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AUTHORITY. VARIOUS GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES OPERATING IN EUROPE

ARE ALSO REGULATED BY, AMONG OTHERS, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (BAFIN), THE BUNDESBANK AND OTHER

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN GERMANY, FRENCH AND SWISS BANKING

AUTHORITIES, THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND OTHER SECURITIES,

DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES EXCHANGES OF WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS.

THE INVESTMENT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FSA

AND OTHER EUROPEAN REGULATORS ARE REGULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES REQUIRING, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS, CUSTOMER

PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS RULES. THESE

STANDARDS, REQUIREMENTS AND RULES ARE SIMILARLY IMPLEMENTED,

UNDER THE SAME DIRECTIVES, THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ARE

BROADLY COMPARABLE IN SCOPE AND PURPOSE TO THE REGULATORY

CAPITAL AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED UNDER THE

SEC AND CFTC RULES. EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES ALSO PERMIT LOCAL

REGULATION IN EACH JURISDICTION, INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH

DIRECTIVES AND THESE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN CERTAIN

COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES TO GOLDMAN SACHS.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY, THE

TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE, THE OSAKA SECURITIES EXCHANGE, THE TOKYO

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL FUTURES EXCHANGE AND THE JAPAN

SECURITIES DEALERS ASSOCIATION IN JAPAN, THE SECURITIES AND

FUTURES COMMISSION IN HONG KONG, AND THE MONETARY AUTHORITY OF

SINGAPORE, AMONG OTHERS, REGULATE VARIOUS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN

ASIA AND ALSO HAVE CAPITAL STANDARDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS

COMPARABLE TO THE RULES OF THE SEC.

THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES DIRECTIVE,

ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION ON NOVEMBER 20, 2002,

PROPOSES CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE WAY IN WHICH FINANCIAL

CONGLOMERATES AND

15

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS ARE

REGULATED. THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE REGULATION OF OUR

EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES, AND POTENTIALLY OF OUR BUSINESS GLOBALLY,

AND GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNREGULATED MAY

BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATION. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR

REGULATORS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES.

REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE IN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS

STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE EMPOWERED

TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN

CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS, OR THE

SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR ITS DIRECTORS,

OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. OCCASIONALLY, OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN

SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE

BEEN IMPOSED FOR INFRACTIONS OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO

OUR ACTIVITIES, NONE OF WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON US OR OUR BUSINESSES.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF

U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS COULD LIMIT THOSE OPERATIONS

OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT REQUIRE THE INTENSIVE USE OF CAPITAL,

SUCH AS UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES, SPECIALIST

ACTIVITIES AND THE FINANCING OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNT BALANCES, AND

ALSO COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW CAPITAL FROM OUR

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH IN TURN COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

REPAY DEBT OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK.

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY A NUMBER OF SECURITIES EXCHANGES. THE

RULES OF THESE EXCHANGES GENERALLY REQUIRE OUR SPECIALISTS TO

MAINTAIN ORDERLY MARKETS IN THE SECURITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE

SPECIALISTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS, IN TURN, MAY REQUIRE US TO

COMMIT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO OUR SPECIALIST

BUSINESSES.

THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS OF INVESTMENT BANKS ARE

THE SUBJECT OF INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY. IN 2002, THE SEC,

THE NYSE AND THE NASD ADOPTED NUMEROUS RULES AFFECTING RESEARCH

ANALYSTS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING

DEPARTMENTS AT MEMBER SECURITIES FIRMS, AS WELL AS OTHER

COMPANIES. ALSO, ACTING IN PART PURSUANT TO A MANDATE CONTAINED

IN THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, THE SEC, THE NYSE AND THE

NASD PROPOSED ADDITIONAL HEIGHTENED RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERACTION BETWEEN RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING

DEPARTMENTS AT MEMBER SECURITIES FIRMS. VARIOUS NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALSO CHANGED OR PROPOSED TO CHANGE THEIR

REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL

MAJOR SECURITIES FIRMS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.,

HAVE RECENTLY REACHED AGREEMENTS IN PRINCIPLE WITH CERTAIN

FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE PRACTICES OF

THEIR RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS. AS PART OF THIS GLOBAL SETTLEMENT,

RESTRICTIONS WILL BE IMPOSED ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN RESEARCH

AND INVESTMENT BANKING DEPARTMENTS AND THESE SECURITIES FIRMS

WILL BE REQUIRED TO FUND THE PROVISION OF INDEPENDENT RESEARCH

TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENTS IN

PRINCIPLE, THE FIRM ALSO EXPECTS TO BE JOINING THE OTHER LEADING

SECURITIES FIRMS WHO ARE PART OF THE PROPOSED GLOBAL SETTLEMENT

IN AN INITIATIVE THAT GENERALLY WILL PROHIBIT THE ALLOCATION OF

SHARES IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS TO EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS

OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. WE DO NOT KNOW THE PRACTICAL EFFECT THAT

SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR MEASURES WOULD HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, IF

ADOPTED.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS

MARKET

CONDITIONS

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE

AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A

VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT: THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SECURITIES

UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS HAVE

DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY; THE EQUITIES MARKETS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ELSEWHERE HAVE BEEN VOLATILE AND ARE AT LEVELS

SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THEIR RECORD HIGHS; INVESTORS HAVE EXHIBITED

CONCERNS OVER THE INTEGRITY OF THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS AS A

RESULT OF RECENT,

16

HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED FINANCIAL SCANDALS; AND THE

ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT OF MANY CLIENTS HAS BEEN DIVERTED FROM

CAPITAL-RAISING TRANSACTIONS AND ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

IN PART AS A RESULT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REGULATIONS, SUCH AS

THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, AND RELATED UNCERTAINTY IN

CAPITAL MARKETS. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW LONG THIS ENVIRONMENT WILL

LAST, BUT SO LONG AS IT DOES, OUR BUSINESSES WILL BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

THESE TYPES OF ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE

ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY WAYS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST

AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS, INCLUDING OUR

INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND

EQUITY POSITIONS AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, OR MAY

REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO SOME NEW TRANSACTIONS.



A CONTINUATION OF THE INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN

THE VOLUME OF EQUITY UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

IS LIKELY TO HAVE A CONTINUING ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES

AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES

CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ARE

DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECREASE

IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR

UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



DECLINES IN THE VOLUME AND NUMBER OF INVESTMENT

BANKING TRANSACTIONS MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE PRICE COMPETITION.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITIES MARKETS

ALSO TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS,

WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS.

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR

MARKET CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET

MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR

COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AND THEREFORE IN THE FEES WE RECEIVE.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK IN THE PAST HAS INCREASED

THE LOSSES THAT WE HAVE INCURRED IN OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING,

MARKET-MAKING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING AND

LENDING BUSINESSES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR

OUR CUSTOMERS AND AS A SPECIALIST MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD

REDUCE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE

RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING

SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES

AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. FINALLY, FURTHER WEAKNESS

IN GLOBAL EQUITIES MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR TRADING

BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

RISK MANAGEMENT, LIQUIDITY AND

CREDIT

IF ANY OF THE VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS AND

STRATEGIES WE UTILIZE TO HEDGE OR OTHERWISE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE

TO VARIOUS TYPES OF RISK ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY INCUR LOSSES.

OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY

NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING OUR RISK EXPOSURE IN ALL

MARKET ENVIRONMENTS OR AGAINST ALL TYPES OF RISK.

LIQUIDITY (

I.E.

, READY ACCESS TO FUNDS) IS

ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY

AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE LONG-TERM OR SHORT-TERM DEBT MARKETS,

AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING

MARKETS, OR AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS. THIS SITUATION MAY

ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL,

SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET

17

DISRUPTION, PERCEPTIONS ABOUT OUR

CREDITWORTHINESS, OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD

PARTIES OR US. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE

IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL

SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR

LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN

BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED

FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER SUCH PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD

BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR

REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR

TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO

SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND

OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS

OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A HOLDING

COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, IT DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS

AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING

DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO., ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION

OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING

DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES

THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM

THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE SUCH

EXPOSURE. AS A CLEARING MEMBER FIRM, WE FINANCE OUR CUSTOMER

POSITIONS AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR

MISCONDUCT OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED,

DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND CREDIT AND PRICE

MORE AGGRESSIVELY THE CREDIT RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR,

CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS

FROM US IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING ASSIGNMENTS.

ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES

AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT

TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT

BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY

PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN

TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

OPERATIONS

AND INFRASTRUCTURE

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR

ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES, AND THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. IF ANY OF OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING OR

OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS DO NOT OPERATE PROPERLY OR ARE

DISABLED, WE COULD SUFFER AN IMPAIRMENT TO OUR LIQUIDITY,

FINANCIAL LOSS, A DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO

CLIENTS, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THESE

SYSTEMS MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR

CONTROL, INCLUDING A DISRUPTION OF ELECTRICAL OR COMMUNICATIONS

SERVICES OR OUR INABILITY TO OCCUPY ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUILDINGS. THE INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE AN

INCREASING VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO CONSTRAIN OUR

ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR

TERMINATION OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING

HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE

OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. ANY SUCH FAILURE OR TERMINATION

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS AND

MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK.

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR

BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. THIS

18

MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL,

COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN

SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE

DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT

AFFECT ONLY THE BUILDINGS OF GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD

PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT ON THE

CITIES WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR

EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING NEW YORK, LONDON,

FRANKFURT, HONG KONG AND TOKYO, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH

OTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE

LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO

COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO

SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER AND WE MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND

ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

LEGAL

AND REGULATORY

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A SIGNIFICANT

REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECT OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM

TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR

BUSINESS PROSPECTS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR

BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES

CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AGAINST FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES ARE

INCREASING. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY

CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN. IN

ADDITION, EMPLOYMENT RELATED CLAIMS TYPICALLY INCREASE IN

PERIODS WHEN WE HAVE REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED

OR PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING

LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

AS DISCUSSED UNDER REGULATION ABOVE,

THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS OF INVESTMENT BANKS ARE THE SUBJECT OF

INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY WHICH HAVE LED TO INCREASED

RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND

INVESTMENT BANKING DEPARTMENTS AT SECURITIES FIRMS. VARIOUS

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALSO CHANGED OR PROPOSED CHANGING

THEIR REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH MATTERS. IN

ADDITION, SEVERAL MAJOR SECURITIES FIRMS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN

SACHS, HAVE RECENTLY REACHED AGREEMENTS IN PRINCIPLE WITH

CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE

PRACTICES OF THEIR RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS

AND RESTRICTIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, AT LEAST

IN THE SHORT TERM.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED

CASES INVOLVING FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK

THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE

TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE

TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN

ALL CASES.

REGULATORY

IMPACT ON CAPITAL MARKETS

RECENT FINANCIAL SCANDALS HAVE LED TO INSECURITY

AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND CONTRIBUTED TO

DECLINES IN CAPITAL MARKETS DURING 2002. IN RESPONSE TO THESE

SCANDALS, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE RULES AND RULE

PROPOSALS (IF ADOPTED) OF THE SEC, THE NYSE AND NASDAQ

NECESSITATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. THESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY APPLY TO COMPANIES

WITH SECURITIES LISTED ON U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGES, AND SOME

PROVISIONS APPLY TO NON-U.S. ISSUERS WITH SECURITIES TRADED ON

U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGES. TO THE EXTENT THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES,

IN ORDER TO AVOID BECOMING SUBJECT TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS,

DECIDE TO FORGO INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, OUR EQUITY

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR ABILITY

TO SUCCESSFULLY EXIT SOME OF OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SIMILARLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

IMPOSITION OF THOSE

19

PROVISIONS ON NON-U.S. ISSUERS MAY MAKE THESE

ISSUERS LESS LIKELY TO LIST THEIR SECURITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES OR UNDERTAKE MERGER OR ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS THAT

WOULD RESULT IN THEIR SECURITIES BEING LISTED IN THE UNITED

STATES. IF THESE MEASURES RESULT IN LESS ACTIVITY BY NON-U.S.

ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE PROVISIONS OF SARBANES-OXLEY AND THE NYSE AND

NASDAQ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS, COUPLED WITH EXISTING

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, HAVE DIVERTED MANY COMPANIES

ATTENTION AWAY FROM CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

SECURITIES OFFERINGS AND ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION

TRANSACTIONS. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW LONG THIS UNCERTAINTY AND

DIVERSION WILL LAST, BUT SO LONG AS IT DOES, IT WILL HAVE A

NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION,

PROPOSED ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES, INCLUDING THOSE

RELATING TO OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ENTITIES, MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND OTHER REVENUES RELATING TO

STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS.

COMPETITION

AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND

ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND

WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE

MAY EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. IN

RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE

ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK,

MAY ACCELERATE THIS CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASE

COMPETITION. THIS TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF

OUR COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION

OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT

ASSETS. AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR

CLIENT BASE, WE INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST. WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE

DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT AND OUR

REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO

DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS

STRATEGY. THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC TRADING, AND

THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESS

AND PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND

OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW BEING CONDUCTED THROUGH THE

INTERNET AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE, NON-TRADITIONAL TRADING SYSTEMS,

AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS

WILL CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE

TRADING SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES. A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC

TRADING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMMISSION AND TRADING

REVENUES, INCLUDING OUR MARKET-MAKING REVENUES, REDUCE OUR

PARTICIPATION IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND ASSOCIATED ACCESS TO

MARKET INFORMATION AND LEAD TO THE CREATION OF NEW AND STRONGER

COMPETITORS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS MAY ALSO REQUIRE US TO MAKE

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY OR TRADING SYSTEMS.

RECRUITING

AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE

TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS. COMPETITION

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS

INTENSE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION WITH BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR THE MOST HIGHLY SKILLED

INDIVIDUALS HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE AS THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS

LOWERED AVERAGE COMPENSATION WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY SIGNIFICANTLY. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE

20

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR

EXISTING EMPLOYEES. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT MAY

CAUSE US TO MOVE EMPLOYEES FROM ONE BUSINESS TO ANOTHER OR TO

REDUCE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES; THIS MAY

CAUSE TEMPORARY DISRUPTIONS AS OUR EMPLOYEES ADAPT TO NEW ROLES

AND MAY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.

ACQUISITIONS

WE EXPECT THE GROWTH OF OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO

COME PRINCIPALLY THROUGH INTERNAL EXPANSION AND ALSO THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO

COMBINATIONS, SUCH AS OUR COMBINATION WITH SPEAR, LEEDS &

KELLOGG IN OCTOBER 2000, WE FACE NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES COMBINING THE BUSINESSES AND SYSTEMS, INCLUDING

THE NEED TO COMBINE ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND

MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND TO INTEGRATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET

THESE OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS CHALLENGES.

INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND

SUPPORTING OUR OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE

INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING RISKS OF

POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN MANY

COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES

AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING,

AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. OUR INABILITY TO

REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN

MARKET COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON

OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION

GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE

STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, VARIOUS EMERGING

MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR

NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS

OF THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES

AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

SHARES

AVAILABLE FOR SALE

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK ARE HELD BY OUR FORMER LIMITED PARTNERS. WHILE A

SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS

ON TRANSFER, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND/OR THE

SHAREHOLDERS COMMITTEE UNDER OUR SHAREHOLDERS

AGREEMENT HAVE IN THE PAST WAIVED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE FROM

TIME TO TIME WAIVE, THESE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. FUTURE SALES OF

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF COMMON STOCK, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH

SALES MAY OCCUR, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PREVAILING MARKET

PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

WE HAVE INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AND FROM TIME TO TIME OUR

MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE, STATEMENTS THAT MAY CONSTITUTE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE

SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION

REFORM ACT OF 1995. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT

HISTORICAL FACTS BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ONLY OUR BELIEF REGARDING

FUTURE EVENTS, MANY OF WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE INHERENTLY

UNCERTAIN AND OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. THESE STATEMENTS INCLUDE

STATEMENTS OTHER THAN HISTORICAL INFORMATION OR STATEMENTS OF

CURRENT CONDITION AND MAY RELATE TO OUR FUTURE PLANS AND

OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AND MAY ALSO INCLUDE

OUR BELIEF REGARDING THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS LEGAL

21

PROCEEDINGS, AS SET FORTH UNDER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AS WELL AS STATEMENTS ABOUT THE

OBJECTIVES AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR LIQUIDITY POLICIES, AND

STATEMENTS ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG,

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THE ANTICIPATED

RESULTS INDICATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IMPORTANT

FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN

THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THOSE

DISCUSSED BELOW AND UNDER  CERTAIN FACTORS THAT

MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN THE CASE OF STATEMENTS ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG, SUCH STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

RISK THAT THE TERMS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS MAY BE MODIFIED OR

THAT THEY MAY NOT BE COMPLETED AT ALL; THEREFORE, THE NET

REVENUES THAT WE EXPECT TO EARN FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS MAY

DIFFER, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THOSE CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN A MODIFICATION OF THE

TERMS OF A TRANSACTION OR A TRANSACTION NOT BEING COMPLETED

INCLUDE, IN THE CASE OF UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES, VOLATILITY

IN THE SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY OR AN ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT

WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUER OF THE SECURITIES AND, IN THE CASE OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE SECURITIES

MARKETS, AN ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT WITH RESPECT TO A PARTY TO THE

TRANSACTION OR A FAILURE TO OBTAIN A REQUIRED REGULATORY

APPROVAL.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT 85

BROAD STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AND COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY

969,000 SQUARE FEET OF LEASED SPACE, PURSUANT TO A LEASE

AGREEMENT EXPIRING IN JUNE 2008 (WITH OPTIONS TO RENEW FOR

UP TO 20 ADDITIONAL YEARS). WE ALSO OCCUPY OVER 680,000 SQUARE

FEET AT ONE NEW YORK PLAZA UNDER LEASE AGREEMENTS EXPIRING

PRIMARILY IN SEPTEMBER 2004 (WITH OPTIONS TO RENEW FOR UP

TO TEN ADDITIONAL YEARS), AND WE LEASE SPACE AT VARIOUS OTHER

LOCATIONS IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA. IN TOTAL, WE LEASE

OVER 5.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN

AREA. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL OFFICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ELSEWHERE IN THE AMERICAS. TOGETHER, THESE OFFICES COMPRISE

APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF LEASED SPACE.

WE OWN APPROXIMATELY FOUR ACRES OF LAND IN JERSEY

CITY, NEW JERSEY, A PORTION OF WHICH WE ARE USING FOR THE

CONSTRUCTION OF AN OFFICE BUILDING. THIS PROJECT IS BEING

DEVELOPED TO COMPLEMENT OUR OFFICES IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THE

INITIAL PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE

APPROXIMATELY 1.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE, WITH

OCCUPANCY PLANNED IN PHASES BEGINNING IN 2004.

WE ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA AND

AUSTRALIA. IN EUROPE, WE HAVE OFFICES THAT TOTAL APPROXIMATELY

1.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET. OUR EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS IS

LOCATED IN LONDON AT PETERBOROUGH COURT, PURSUANT TO A LEASE

WHICH EXPIRES IN 2016. IN TOTAL, WE LEASE APPROXIMATELY

1.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET IN LONDON THROUGH VARIOUS LEASES,

RELATING TO VARIOUS PROPERTIES.

IN ASIA AND AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE OFFICES THAT TOTAL

APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET. OUR HEADQUARTERS IN

THIS REGION ARE IN TOKYO, AT THE ARK MORI BUILDING, AND IN HONG

KONG, AT THE CHEUNG KONG CENTER. IN TOKYO, WE CURRENTLY LEASE

APPROXIMATELY 400,000 SQUARE FEET UNDER RENEWABLE LEASES WITH

CURRENT TERMS EXTENDING, IN SOME CASES, TO JUNE 2005. IN

HONG KONG, WE CURRENTLY LEASE APPROXIMATELY 300,000 SQUARE FEET

UNDER LEASE AGREEMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH EXPIRE IN FISCAL

2012.

OUR OCCUPANCY EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH OFFICE SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE LEVELS OF CURRENT BUSINESS

ACTIVITY ON OUR PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN HEADCOUNT. THIS

EXCESS SPACE IS BEING HELD FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE GROWTH. WE

CONTINUALLY REVIEW OUR SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY, FROM TIME TO

TIME, REDUCE CAPACITY THROUGH THE USE OF SUBLEASE CONTRACTS OR

EARLY TERMINATION AGREEMENTS. WE MAY INCUR COSTS IN CONNECTION

WITH SUCH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE. WHERE WE HAVE

UNOCCUPIED

22

SPACE THAT WE MAY OCCUPY IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL

CONTINUE TO CHARGE THE UNDERLYING OPERATING COSTS TO EARNINGS AS

INCURRED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL,

REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THOSE

DESCRIBED BELOW) CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH

THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN

THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MIGHT BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING

RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE

OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD.

IPO

PROCESS MATTERS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND GOLDMAN, SACHS

& CO. ARE AMONG THE NUMEROUS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES

THAT HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A VARIETY OF LAWSUITS

ALLEGING IMPROPRIETIES IN THE PROCESS BY WHICH THOSE COMPANIES

PARTICIPATED IN THE UNDERWRITING OF PUBLIC OFFERINGS IN RECENT

YEARS.

CERTAIN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

BY PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES IN PUBLIC OFFERINGS, WHO CLAIM THAT

THE DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN CONSPIRACIES IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL

ANTITRUST LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE OFFERINGS. THE

PLAINTIFFS IN EACH INSTANCE SEEK TREBLE DAMAGES AS WELL AS

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. ONE OF THE ACTIONS, WHICH WAS COMMENCED ON

AUGUST 21, 1998, ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS HAVE CONSPIRED

TO DISCOURAGE OR RESTRICT THE RESALE OF SECURITIES FOR A PERIOD

AFTER THE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING BY IMPOSING PENALTY

BIDS. DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT IN

NOVEMBER 1998. THE PLAINTIFFS AMENDED THEIR COMPLAINT IN

FEBRUARY 1999, MODIFYING THEIR CLAIMS IN VARIOUS WAYS,

INCLUDING LIMITING THE PROPOSED CLASS TO RETAIL PURCHASERS OF

PUBLIC OFFERINGS. THE DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED

COMPLAINT ON MAY 7, 1999, THE MOTION WAS GRANTED BY A

DECISION DATED DECEMBER 7, 2000, AND THE PLAINTIFFS

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THAT DECISION WAS DENIED BY AN

ORDER DATED JANUARY 22, 2001. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, AND BY A

DECISION DATED DECEMBER 20, 2002, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF THEIR COMPLAINT.

SEVERAL OTHER ACTIONS WERE COMMENCED, BEGINNING

ON NOVEMBER 3, 1998 BY PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES IN PUBLIC

OFFERINGS AS WELL AS CERTAIN PURPORTED ISSUERS OF SUCH

OFFERINGS, THAT ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS, MANY OF WHOM ARE

ALSO NAMED IN THE OTHER ACTION DISCUSSED ABOVE, HAVE CONSPIRED

TO FIX AT 7% THE DISCOUNT THAT UNDERWRITING SYNDICATES RECEIVE

FROM ISSUERS OF SHARES IN CERTAIN OFFERINGS. ON MARCH 15,

1999, THE PURCHASER PLAINTIFFS FILED A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED

COMPLAINT. THE DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED

AMENDED COMPLAINT ON APRIL 29, 1999. ON FEBRUARY 14,

2001, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE THE

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY THE

PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES ON THE GROUND THAT THEY LACKED

ANTITRUST STANDING. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THOSE ACTIONS APPEALED,

AND BY A DECISION DATED DECEMBER 13, 2002, THE U.S. COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT VACATED THE DISMISSAL ON THE

GROUND THAT THE LOWER COURT HAD ENGAGED IN IMPROPER FACT-FINDING

ON THE MOTION AND REMANDED FOR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER POTENTIAL

BASES FOR DISMISSAL. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2001, THE DEFENDANTS

MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINTS FILED BY THE ISSUER PLAINTIFFS

ON STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS GROUNDS. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2002,

THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT DENIED THE UNDERWRITER

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS.

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IS ONE OF NUMEROUS

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS THAT HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS FILED BEGINNING ON MARCH 9, 2001 IN

THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK BY

PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES IN PUBLIC OFFERINGS, WHO CLAIM THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN A CONSPIRACY TO TIE

ALLOCATIONS IN CERTAIN OFFERINGS TO HIGHER CUSTOMER BROKERAGE

COMMISSION RATES AS WELL AS PURCHASE ORDERS IN THE AFTERMARKET,

IN VIOLATION

23

OF FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS. THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A

CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 2, 2002. THE

DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT

ON MAY 24, 2002. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. HAS ALSO,

TOGETHER WITH OTHER UNDERWRITERS IN CERTAIN OFFERINGS AS WELL AS

THE ISSUERS AND CERTAIN OF THEIR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, BEEN

NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF RELATED LAWSUITS ALLEGING,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE PROSPECTUSES FOR THE OFFERINGS

VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE THE

EXISTENCE OF THE ALLEGED TYING ARRANGEMENTS. ON

JULY 1, 2002, THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS

THOSE COMPLAINTS. BY AN OPINION AND ORDER DATED

FEBRUARY 19, 2003, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT DENIED THE

MOTION TO DISMISS IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS RELATING TO THE

UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS.

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. HAS BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN SEVERAL ACTIONS ALLEGING THAT THE FIRM

INTENTIONALLY UNDERPRICED PUBLIC OFFERINGS FOR CERTAIN ISSUERS.

EACH OF THE ACTIONS SEEKS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CONSEQUENTIAL

DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE ALLEGED LOWER AMOUNT OF OFFERING

PROCEEDS. TWO OF THE LAWSUITS ARE PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER

DERIVATIVE ACTIONS COMMENCED ON MAY 3, 2002 IN CALIFORNIA

SUPERIOR COURT FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SAN MATEO COUNTY WHICH

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. HAS REMOVED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON AUGUST 5, 2002,

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. MOVED FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS IN

THOSE ACTIONS, THE MOTIONS WERE GRANTED BY DECISIONS DATED

OCTOBER 31, 2002 AND NOVEMBER 6, 2002, AND PLAINTIFFS

IN BOTH CASES HAVE APPEALED. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. HAS ALSO

BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A SIMILAR UNDERPRICING ACTION

BROUGHT IN NEW YORK SUPREME COURT, NEW YORK COUNTY ON

MAY 15, 2002 BY AN OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED

CREDITORS ON BEHALF OF AN ISSUER WHICH IS IN BANKRUPTCY. ON

AUGUST 1, 2002, GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. MOVED TO

DISMISS THAT COMPLAINT.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED

AS A DEFENDANT IN A PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION

COMMENCED IN DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY ON OCTOBER 23, 2002

ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF EBAY, INC. (WHO

ARE ALSO DEFENDANTS), AIDED AND ABETTED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC., BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND USURPED

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES BY RECEIVING ALLOCATIONS OF INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS AS CUSTOMERS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT ON DECEMBER 23,

2002.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. HAS, TOGETHER WITH

OTHER UNDERWRITERS IN CERTAIN OFFERINGS, RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FOR

DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND

THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL

SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO THE

PUBLIC OFFERING PROCESS. IN PARTICULAR, THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF

CERTAIN ALLOCATION PRACTICES EMPLOYED BY GOLDMAN, SACHS &

CO. GOLDMAN SACHS IS COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS.

OPTIONS ANTITRUST LITIGATION

HULL TRADING CO. L.L.C. AND SPEAR, LEEDS &

KELLOGG, L.P., AFFILIATES OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., ARE

AMONG THE NUMEROUS MARKET MAKERS IN LISTED EQUITY OPTIONS WHICH

HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS, TOGETHER WITH FIVE NATIONAL

SECURITIES EXCHANGES, IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION BROUGHT IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ON

BEHALF OF PERSONS WHO PURCHASED OR SOLD LISTED EQUITY OPTIONS.

THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, FILED ON

OCTOBER 4, 1999 (WHICH CONSOLIDATED CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY

PENDING ACTIONS AND ADDED HULL TRADING CO. L.L.C. AND OTHER

MARKET MAKERS AS DEFENDANTS), GENERALLY ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN A CONSPIRACY TO PRECLUDE THE MULTIPLE

LISTING OF CERTAIN EQUITY OPTIONS ON THE EXCHANGES AND SEEKS

TREBLE DAMAGES UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS AS WELL AS INJUNCTIVE

RELIEF. CERTAIN OF THE PARTIES, INCLUDING HULL TRADING CO.

L.L.C. AND SPEAR, LEEDS & KELLOGG, L.P., HAVE ENTERED INTO A

STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT, SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL, PURSUANT

TO WHICH HULL TRADING CO. L.L.C. WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY AN

AGGREGATE OF $2.48 MILLION AND SPEAR, LEEDS & KELLOGG, L.P.

AN AGGREGATE OF $19.59 MILLION. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2001, THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE MOTION OF CERTAIN

NON-SETTLING DEFENDANTS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. BY A DECISION

DATED APRIL 24, 2001, THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT IN

LIGHT OF THAT ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT, THE COURT

24

LACKED JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, AND BY A DECISION DATED

JANUARY 9, 2003, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE GRANT OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT, BUT HELD THAT

THE DECISION DID NOT DIVEST THE LOWER COURT OF JURISDICTION TO

ENTERTAIN THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER

PROCEEDINGS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

(PARENT COMPANY ONLY)

NOTE 1.     SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONDENSED UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (THE PARENT COMPANY) SHOULD BE

READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM) AND

NOTES THERETO, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS

FORM 10-K.

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

THESE CONDENSED UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING INVESTMENT VALUATIONS, THE OUTCOME OF PENDING

LITIGATION AND OTHER MATTERS THAT AFFECT THE CONDENSED

UNCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.

THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON JUDGMENT AND

AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE

PRIOR YEARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM WITH THE

CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, INCLUDING PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, WITH RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

RECOGNIZED IN THE CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. FAIR VALUE

IS BASED GENERALLY ON LISTED MARKET PRICES OR BROKER OR DEALER

PRICE QUOTATIONS. IF PRICES ARE NOT READILY DETERMINABLE OR IF

LIQUIDATING THE POSITION IS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO AFFECT MARKET

PRICES, FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON EITHER INTERNAL VALUATION MODELS

OR MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE REALIZED

UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, ASSUMING AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION

OVER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME. THE FIRMS VALUATION

MODELS CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER INPUTS, CONTRACTUAL AND MARKET

PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDITS, VOLATILITY FACTORS, PREPAYMENT

RATES AND/OR CORRELATION OF THE UNDERLYING POSITIONS. DOWNWARD

ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT REALIZABLE

VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

AFFILIATE FINANCINGS

MOST OF THE CONSOLIDATED UNSECURED LIQUIDITY OF

THE FIRM IS RAISED BY THE PARENT COMPANY. THE PARENT COMPANY

THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES, AS REPRESENTED BY RECEIVABLES FROM

AFFILIATES AND SUBORDINATED LOAN RECEIVABLES FROM

AFFILIATES ON THE CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION. INTERCOMPANY EXPOSURE IS MANAGED BY GENERALLY

REQUIRING INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR

SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE

PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES

OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN

ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

PLEDGE COLLATERAL TO COVER THEIR INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS. EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH EQUITY

CAPITAL.

THE PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEES CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

INTEREST INCOME IS LARGELY GENERATED FROM LOANS

MADE TO AFFILIATES.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES,

WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF TAX BENEFITS OR EXPENSES ON

THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER ASSETS AND

OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ARE DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION AND

$900 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2002 AND NOVEMBER 2001,

RESPECTIVELY.
