DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE RAISE AND MANAGE.

TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS, TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS. WE

BELIEVE OUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO TAKE RISK TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS DISTINGUISHES US FROM MANY OF OUR

COMPETITORS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO

THREE COMPONENTS: FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES;

EQUITIES; AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC) AND EQUITIES ARE

LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED OPERATIONS THROUGH WHICH WE ENGAGE IN A

VARIETY OF CLIENT-DRIVEN AND PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING

ACTIVITIES.

IN OUR CLIENT-DRIVEN BUSINESSES, FICC AND EQUITIES STRIVE TO

DELIVER

HIGH-QUALITY

SERVICE BY OFFERING BROAD

MARKET-MAKING

AND MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. IN

ADDITION, WE USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TAKE POSITIONS IN MARKETS, BY

COMMITTING CAPITAL AND TAKING RISK, TO FACILITATE CLIENT

TRANSACTIONS AND TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. OUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE

MARKETS, COMMIT CAPITAL AND TAKE RISK IN A BROAD RANGE OF FIXED

INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRODUCTS AND THEIR

DERIVATIVES IS CRUCIAL TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND TO

SUPPORT OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET

LIQUIDITY.

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM OUR CLIENT-DRIVEN

BUSINESSES IN THREE WAYS.



FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL

POSITION, WE UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WHERE

SPREADS AND FEES ARE GENERALLY LARGER.



FINALLY, WE STRUCTURE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS THAT ADDRESS

COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

OUR FICC AND EQUITIES BUSINESSES OPERATE IN CLOSE COORDINATION

TO PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH SERVICES AND CROSS-MARKET KNOWLEDGE AND

EXPERTISE.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES IN BOTH FICC AND EQUITIES, WE

ASSUME A VARIETY OF RISKS AND DEVOTE RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY,

ANALYZE AND BENEFIT FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE CAPITALIZE ON OUR

ANALYTICAL MODELS TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE INFORMED

TRADING JUDGMENTS, AND WE SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED

DISPARITIES IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND

FROM MACROECONOMIC AND ISSUER-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR MERCHANT

BANKING FUNDS INCLUDE FUNDS THAT INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE THREE PRIMARY REVENUE

STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS GENERALLY A

PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL, INVESTED CAPITAL,

TOTAL GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE. THESE ANNUAL

MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT NET

REVENUES. SECOND, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTOR IN

SOME OF THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON

REALIZATION. THIRD, AFTER A FUND HAS ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN

FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE RECEIVE AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE

FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS THAT IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME

AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS. THE SECOND AND THIRD

OF THESE REVENUE STREAMS ARE INCLUDED IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY ARE HIGH PRIORITIES

FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN

DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY

IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE FIRMS CRITICAL

FACILITIES AND TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA). BECAUSE WE ARE

A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM WILL BE

SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE KEY ELEMENTS

OF THE PROGRAM ARE CRISIS MANAGEMENT, PEOPLE RECOVERY

FACILITIES, BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, AND

PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY, WE

HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES,

POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION ASSETS OF THE

FIRM AND OUR CLIENTS. SAFEGUARDS ARE APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION

RESOURCES.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON

FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION

OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE

STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS

PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG OUR

EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE AND HIGH STANDARDS OF BUSINESS ETHICS.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A

CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART.

ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT VARIOUS

LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW

PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND

EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A

360-DEGREE

REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, WE HAD 30,067 EMPLOYEES, EXCLUDING

4,671 EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD

FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES ARE ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD STRICTLY FOR

CAPITAL APPRECIATION, HAVE A DEFINED EXIT STRATEGY AND ARE

ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR

PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER ENTITIES THAT

PROVIDE INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

SERVICES, AS WELL AS THOSE ENTITIES THAT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN

SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, DERIVATIVES, REAL ESTATE, LOANS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS. THESE ENTITIES INCLUDE BROKERS AND

DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT

OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR AS THE

CREDIT CRISIS CAUSED NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS

AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. MANY COMMERCIAL BANKS AND OTHER

BROAD-BASED

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE HAD THE ABILITY FOR SOME TIME TO

OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND

INSURANCE TO BROKERAGE, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING

SERVICES, WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY

ALSO HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND

SECURITIES PRODUCTS WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE,

WHICH HAS RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

AND TRADING BUSINESSES AND COULD RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN

OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE,

PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO

BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY

NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS AGREEMENTS TO PARTICIPATE

IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR OTHER LOAN FACILITIES)

FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT

BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

WE PROVIDE THESE COMMITMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH GS BANK USA AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES AND

GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. WITH RESPECT TO MOST OF THE

WILLIAM STREET COMMITMENTS, SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP,

INC. (SMFG) PROVIDES US WITH CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION THAT IS

GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS WE REALIZE ON

APPROVED LOAN COMMITMENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF

CERTAIN CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL PROVIDE

PROTECTION FOR 70% OF ADDITIONAL LOSSES ON SUCH COMMITMENTS, UP

TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.13 BILLION, OF WHICH $375 MILLION

FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES AND

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION PROVIDED BY

SMFG. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF OUR COMMITMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH

INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS DO NOT MEET THE

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES AND DO NOT

BENEFIT FROM THE SMFG LOSS PROTECTION. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

ISSUED THROUGH GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR OUR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND

BETTER CAPITALIZED AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE

AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR

BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE

IN THE PRICING OF BLOCK TRADES. ALSO, EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS TRADING SPREADS, HAVE BEEN

UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE

TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH

ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON

TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD

ELECTRONIC AND OTHER

LOW-TOUCH,

LOW-COMMISSION

TRADING WILL CONTINUE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE

FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING PRICES.

ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT GENERALLY RESTRICTS US FROM ENGAGING IN BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THE BUSINESS OF BANKING AND CERTAIN

CLOSELY RELATED ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THE BHC ACT ALSO GRANTS A

NEW BANK HOLDING COMPANY, SUCH AS GROUP INC., TWO YEARS FROM THE

DATE THE ENTITY BECOMES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH

THE RESTRICTIONS ON ITS ACTIVITIES IMPOSED BY THE BHC ACT WITH

RESPECT TO ANY ACTIVITIES THAT IT WAS ENGAGED IN WHEN IT BECAME

A BANK HOLDING COMPANY. WE EXPECT THAT THIS

GRANDFATHER RIGHT WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO

IMPERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES IF THE COMPANY WAS

ENGAGED IN ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 AND IF THE ASSETS HELD PURSUANT TO

THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT EQUAL 5% OR MORE OF THE CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

WE INTEND TO APPLY TO ELECT TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY UNDER THE GLB ACT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. OUR ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS IS

DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR

U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES CONTINUING TO

QUALIFY AS WELL CAPITALIZED AS DESCRIBED UNDER

 PROMPT

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OR CURRENTLY

PROPOSED BUSINESS WOULD BE IMPERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES FOR US AS A

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, GROUP INC. IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN

PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD APPROVAL BEFORE DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY ACQUIRING MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SHARES

OF ANY UNAFFILIATED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. IN ADDITION, AS A

BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE MAY GENERALLY ENGAGE IN BANKING AND

OWNING

NON-U.S. BANKS,

IF THOSE ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS DO NOT EXCEED CERTAIN LIMITS

AND, IN SOME CASES, IF WE HAVE OBTAINED THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED

BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES. OUR BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA, ARE SUBJECT TO

SIMILAR CAPITAL GUIDELINES. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND THE REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA) THAT IS APPLICABLE

TO GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL GUIDELINES

THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

CERTAIN

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY REPORTING PRACTICES.

GOLDMAN SACHS AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES CAPITAL AMOUNTS, AS WELL AS GS BANK

USAS PCA CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE

JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS

AND OTHER FACTORS. WE ANTICIPATE REPORTING CAPITAL RATIOS AS

FOLLOWS.



BEFORE WE BECAME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE WERE SUBJECT TO

CAPITAL GUIDELINES BY THE SEC AS A CSE THAT WERE GENERALLY

CONSISTENT WITH THOSE SET OUT IN THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE

INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL

STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION

(BASEL II). WE CURRENTLY COMPUTE AND REPORT OUR FIRMWIDE CAPITAL

RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL II REQUIREMENTS AS

APPLICABLE TO US WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE FOR THE PURPOSE

OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR CAPITAL. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE

TO REPORT TO INVESTORS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OUR BASEL II CAPITAL

RATIOS AS APPLICABLE TO US WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE.



THE REGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES ARE BASED ON THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL I), WITH BASEL II TO BE

PHASED IN OVER TIME. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD TO PUT IN PLACE THE APPROPRIATE REPORTING AND

COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS AND METHODOLOGIES TO ALLOW REPORTING OF

THE BASEL I CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF THE END OF MARCH 2009.



IN ADDITION, WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL II

FRAMEWORK AS APPLICABLE TO US AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (AS

OPPOSED TO AS A CSE). U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE

INCORPORATED THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS GROUP INC., TRANSITION TO BASEL

II OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS IT APPLIED TO US WHEN WE WERE

REGULATED AS A CSE, WE EVALUATE OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL AND

TOTAL ALLOWABLE CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS (RWAS). RWAS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE LEVEL OF MARKET

RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, USING METHODOLOGIES GENERALLY CONSISTENT

WITH THOSE SET OUT IN BASEL II. OUR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

OF THE TREASURYS (U.S. TREASURY) TARP CAPITAL

PURCHASE PROGRAM AND OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO

TRUSTS, LESS DEDUCTIONS FOR GOODWILL, DISALLOWED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND OTHER ITEMS. OUR TOTAL ALLOWABLE CAPITAL CONSISTS OF

OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL AND OUR QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT,

LESS CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

CALCULATION OF OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL, TOTAL ALLOWABLE CAPITAL

AND RWAS UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS IT APPLIED TO US

AS A CSE IS SET FORTH IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  EQUITY CAPITAL  CONSOLIDATED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND IN NOTE 17 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE IN PART II,

ITEMS 7 AND 8 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, OUR TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL

ALLOWABLE CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS) WAS 18.9% AND OUR

TIER 1 RATIO (TIER 1 CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS)

WAS 15.6%, IN EACH CASE CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK

AS IT APPLIED TO US WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE.

AS NOTED ABOVE, WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL

II FRAMEWORK AS APPLICABLE TO US AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (AS

OPPOSED TO AS A CSE). DURING A PARALLEL PERIOD, WE ANTICIPATE

THAT GROUP INC.S CAPITAL CALCULATIONS COMPUTED UNDER BOTH

THE BASEL I RULES AND THE BASEL II RULES WILL BE REPORTED TO THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FOR EXAMINATION AND COMPLIANCE FOR AT

LEAST FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY PERIODS. ONCE THE PARALLEL

PERIOD AND SUBSEQUENT THREE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD ARE

SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, GROUP INC. WILL UTILIZE THE BASEL II

FRAMEWORK AS ITS MEANS OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT,

MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING AND WILL DISCONTINUE USE OF BASEL I.

INTERNATIONALLY, THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK WAS IMPLEMENTED IN

SEVERAL COUNTRIES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 AND IN 2008,

WHILE OTHERS WILL BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION IN 2009. THE BASEL II

RULES THEREFORE ALSO APPLY TO CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS IN

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO HAS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIO GUIDELINES. WE WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THESE GUIDELINES BEFORE

BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE

CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE OUR

METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THIS RATIO. THE TIER 1 LEVERAGE

RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL (AS APPLICABLE TO US AS

A BANK HOLDING COMPANY) DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS

(WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR DISALLOWED GOODWILL AND CERTAIN

INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3%

FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE HIGHEST

SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR

THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

MUST HAVE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE

THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION,

RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, OUR

ESTIMATED TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 6.1%. THIS RATIO

REPRESENTS A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE AND MAY BE REVISED IN

SUBSEQUENT FILINGS AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE CALCULATION.

GS&CO. WILL CONTINUE TO CALCULATE ITS REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK

STANDARDS OF APPENDIX E OF

RULE 15C3-1

UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH BASEL II.

PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS

FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS BY OUR BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. THE

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A STATE-CHARTERED BANK

THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, SUCH AS GS BANK

USA OR OUR NATIONAL BANK TRUST COMPANY SUBSIDIARY, IS LIMITED TO

THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT

EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST.

UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF

THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR

YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED

WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS

THE BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF ITS CHARTERING AUTHORITY. UNDER

THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS

OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. NEW YORK LAW

IMPOSES SIMILAR LIMITATIONS ON NEW YORK STATE-

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHARTERED BANKS. AS A RESULT OF THESE RESTRICTIONS, GS BANK USA

WAS NOT ABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS TO GROUP INC. WITHOUT

REGULATORY APPROVAL AS OF NOVEMBER 2008.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE

BANKING REGULATORS HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE

IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A

DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT

OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

IT IS ALSO THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THAT A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY GENERALLY ONLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK OUT

OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE PAST

YEAR AND ONLY IF THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS RETENTION

APPEARS CONSISTENT WITH THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL

NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE

CURRENT FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD HAS INDICATED THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD CAREFULLY

REVIEW THEIR DIVIDEND POLICY AND HAS DISCOURAGED DIVIDEND

PAY-OUT RATIOS THAT ARE AT THE 100% LEVEL UNLESS BOTH ASSET

QUALITY AND CAPITAL ARE VERY STRONG. A BANK HOLDING COMPANY ALSO

SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN A DIVIDEND LEVEL THAT PLACES UNDUE PRESSURE

ON THE CAPITAL OF BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, OR

THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO

SERVE AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR SUCH BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. SEE

 U.S. TREASURYS

TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF

ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON GROUP INC.S ABILITY TO PAY

DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF GROUP INC.S NONBANK

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING OUR

BROKER-DEALER

AND OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

SOURCE OF

STRENGTH

UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, GROUP INC. IS EXPECTED TO

ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO GS BANK USA AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL

AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS SUBSIDIARY. THE REQUIRED

SUPPORT MAY BE NEEDED AT TIMES WHEN, ABSENT THAT FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD POLICY, WE MAY NOT FIND OURSELVES ABLE TO PROVIDE IT.

CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY

BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO

CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE

EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY

COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK

REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE

ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF

PAYMENT.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE BHC ACT PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION

OF BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, THE

BHC ACT PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING

PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO

SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD

INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

CROSS-GUARANTEE

PROVISIONS

EACH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED (AS

DEFINED IN THE BHC ACT) BY THE SAME BANK HOLDING COMPANY CAN BE

HELD LIABLE TO THE U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION (FDIC) FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED, OR REASONABLY EXPECTED

TO BE INCURRED, BY THE FDIC DUE TO THE DEFAULT OF ANY OTHER

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY THAT HOLDING

COMPANY AND FOR ANY ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE FDIC TO ANY OF

THOSE BANKS THAT IS IN DANGER OF DEFAULT. SUCH A

CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS

OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST THAT

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. AT THIS TIME, WE CONTROL ONLY ONE

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR THIS PURPOSE, NAMELY GS BANK

USA. HOWEVER, IF, IN THE FUTURE, WE WERE TO CONTROL OTHER

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH CROSS-GUARANTEE WOULD

APPLY TO ALL SUCH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

FDIC TEMPORARY

LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM

GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA HAVE CHOSEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

FDICS TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP), WHICH

APPLIES TO, AMONG OTHERS, ALL U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

INSURED BY THE FDIC AND ALL U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES,

UNLESS THEY HAVE OPTED OUT OF THE TLGP OR THE FDIC HAS

TERMINATED THEIR PARTICIPATION. UNDER THE TLGP, THE FDIC

GUARANTEES CERTAIN SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT OF GROUP INC. AND GS

BANK USA, AS WELL AS NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNT

DEPOSITS AT GS BANK USA, AND IN RETURN FOR THESE GUARANTEES THE

FDIC IS PAID A FEE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT OR THE

AMOUNT AND MATURITY OF THE DEBT. UNDER THE DEBT GUARANTEE

COMPONENT OF THE TLGP, THE FDIC WILL PAY THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL

AND INTEREST ON AN FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT INSTRUMENT UPON THE

UNCURED FAILURE OF THE PARTICIPATING ENTITY TO MAKE A TIMELY

PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF

THE INSTRUMENT. UNDER THE TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GUARANTEE

COMPONENT OF THE TLGP, ALL NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION

ACCOUNTS MAINTAINED AT GS BANK USA ARE INSURED IN FULL BY THE

FDIC UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2009, REGARDLESS OF THE

STANDARD MAXIMUM DEPOSIT INSURANCE AMOUNT. SEE

GS BANK

USA

OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, GS BANK USA, A NEW

YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

SYSTEM AND THE FDIC, IS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

AND THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS) ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES. GS BANK USA WAS FORMED IN NOVEMBER 2008 THROUGH

THE MERGER OF OUR EXISTING UTAH INDUSTRIAL BANK (NAMED GS BANK

USA) INTO OUR NEW YORK LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY, WITH THE

SURVIVING COMPANY TAKING THE NAME GS BANK USA. CONCURRENTLY WITH

THIS MERGER, WE CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES WITH AN AGGREGATE OF

$117.16 BILLION OF ASSETS INTO GS BANK USA (WHICH BROUGHT

TOTAL ASSETS IN GS BANK USA TO $145.06 BILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008). AS A RESULT, A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE NOW

CONDUCTED PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY THROUGH GS BANK USA, INCLUDING.

BANK LOAN TRADING AND ORIGINATION; INTEREST RATE, CREDIT,

CURRENCY AND OTHER DERIVATIVES; LEVERAGED FINANCE; COMMERCIAL

AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATION, TRADING AND SERVICING;

STRUCTURED FINANCE; AND AGENCY LENDING, CUSTODY AND HEDGE FUND

ADMINISTRATION SERVICES. THE BUSINESSES CONDUCTED THROUGH GS

BANK USA ARE NOW SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD, THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AND THE FDIC.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEPOSIT

INSURANCE

GS BANK USA ACCEPTS DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS HAVE THE

BENEFIT OF FDIC INSURANCE UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE

FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, WHICH DEPEND ON THE RISK

CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION AND THE AMOUNT OF INSURED DEPOSITS

THAT IT HOLDS. THE FDIC MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ASSESSMENT

RATE SCHEDULE ON A

SEMI-ANNUAL

BASIS. WE ARE ALSO PARTICIPANTS IN THE TLGP AS DISCUSSED ABOVE

UNDER

 FDIC

TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM.

PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT

ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA), AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES THE FEDERAL

BANKING AGENCIES TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN

RESPECT OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET SPECIFIED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FDICIA ESTABLISHES FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES

FOR FDIC-INSURED BANKS: WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY

CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED

AND CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

DEEMED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED, THE HIGHEST CATEGORY,

IF IT HAS A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10% OR GREATER, A TIER 1

CAPITAL RATIO OF 6% OR GREATER AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO

OF 5% OR GREATER AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY ORDER OR WRITTEN

DIRECTIVE BY ANY SUCH REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO MEET AND MAINTAIN

A SPECIFIC CAPITAL LEVEL FOR ANY CAPITAL MEASURE. IN CONNECTION

WITH THE NOVEMBER 2008 ASSET TRANSFER DESCRIBED BELOW, GS BANK

USA AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO MINIMUM CAPITAL

RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THESE WELL CAPITALIZED LEVELS.

ACCORDINGLY, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, GS BANK USA IS EXPECTED TO

MAINTAIN A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8%, A TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 11% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO

OF AT LEAST 6%. WE CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES WITH AN AGGREGATE OF

$117.16 BILLION IN ASSETS INTO GS BANK USA IN NOVEMBER 2008

(WHICH BROUGHT TOTAL ASSETS IN GS BANK USA TO

$145.06 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008). AS A RESULT, WE ARE

CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE OUR

METHODOLOGY FOR THE BASEL I CALCULATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER

2008, UNDER BASEL I, GS BANK USAS ESTIMATED

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 8.9% AND ESTIMATED TOTAL CAPITAL

RATIO WAS 11.6%. IN ADDITION, GS BANK USAS ESTIMATED

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 9.1%. AN INSTITUTION MAY BE

DOWNGRADED TO, OR DEEMED TO BE IN, A CAPITAL CATEGORY THAT IS

LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IF IT IS

DETERMINED TO BE IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IF IT

RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING WITH RESPECT TO

CERTAIN MATTERS.

FDICIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON

OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, AS THE CAPITAL

CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION DECLINES. FAILURE TO MEET THE CAPITAL

GUIDELINES COULD ALSO SUBJECT A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO

CAPITAL RAISING REQUIREMENTS. ULTIMATELY, CRITICALLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPOINTMENT OF

A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.

THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH

AS GROUP INC. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED

TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED

UPON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES

RELATING TO AN UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARY, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED

SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE

FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS

ON THAT GUARANTEE. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF THE BANKRUPTCY

OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, THE GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY

OVER THE PARENTS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS.

INSOLVENCY OF

AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUCH AS GS BANK USA, UPON ITS

INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER.



TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS;

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS



TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR



TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS

DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMANCE OR

REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE

ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF DEPOSIT

LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A

PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST SUCH AN

INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE

INSTITUTION, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION

OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION BY ANY RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR

NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF GS

BANK USA, THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM,

AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE

DEPOSITORS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

TRANSACTIONS

WITH AFFILIATES

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND GROUP INC. AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD. THESE REGULATIONS LIMIT THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF

TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS TO AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM GS

BANK USA) THAT MAY TAKE PLACE AND GENERALLY REQUIRE THOSE

TRANSACTIONS TO BE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE REGULATIONS

GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IN NOVEMBER 2008, GROUP INC. TRANSFERRED

ASSETS AND OPERATIONS TO GS BANK USA AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

 GS

BANK USA. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRANSFER, GROUP INC.

ENTERED INTO A GUARANTEE AGREEMENT WITH GS BANK USA WHEREBY

GROUP INC. AGREED TO (I) PURCHASE FROM GS BANK USA CERTAIN

TRANSFERRED ASSETS (OTHER THAN DERIVATIVES AND MORTGAGE

SERVICING RIGHTS) OR REIMBURSE GS BANK USA FOR CERTAIN LOSSES

RELATING TO THOSE ASSETS; (II) REIMBURSE GS BANK USA FOR

CREDIT-RELATED

LOSSES FROM ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO GS BANK USA; AND

(III) PROTECT GS BANK USA OR REIMBURSE IT FOR CERTAIN

LOSSES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVES AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

TRANSFERRED TO GS BANK USA. GROUP INC. ALSO AGREED TO PLEDGE TO

GS BANK USA COLLATERAL WITH AN AGGREGATE VALUE AT ANY TIME NOT

LESS THAN 5% OF THE FACE AMOUNT OF COMMITTED BUT UNFUNDED CREDIT

LINES PLUS THE ORIGINAL TRANSFER VALUE OF THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME

OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY. IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, THESE

CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND NEGATIVELY.

SINCE MID-2007, AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008,

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS

GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT

DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A

SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. THIS WAS INITIALLY TRIGGERED BY

DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, BUT SPREAD TO ALL

MORTGAGE AND REAL ESTATE ASSET CLASSES, TO LEVERAGED BANK LOANS

AND TO NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES, INCLUDING EQUITIES. THE GLOBAL

MARKETS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED

VOLATILITY AND

SHORT-SELLING

AND AN OVERALL LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, INITIALLY IN

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT MORE RECENTLY IN COMPANIES IN A

NUMBER OF OTHER INDUSTRIES AND IN THE BROADER MARKETS. THE

DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES HAS CAUSED INCREASES IN MARGIN CALLS FOR

INVESTORS, REQUIREMENTS THAT DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTIES POST

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AND REDEMPTIONS BY MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUND

INVESTORS, ALL OF WHICH HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

ASSET VALUES AND OUTFLOWS OF CLIENT FUNDS ACROSS THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED REDEMPTIONS AND

UNAVAILABILITY OF CREDIT HAVE REQUIRED HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHERS TO

RAPIDLY REDUCE LEVERAGE, WHICH HAS INCREASED VOLATILITY AND

FURTHER CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES.

MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE ALSO LED TO THE FAILURE OR MERGER OF A

NUMBER OF PROMINENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION FAILURES OR NEAR-FAILURES HAVE RESULTED IN FURTHER

LOSSES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DEFAULTS ON SECURITIES ISSUED BY THEM

AND DEFAULTS UNDER BILATERAL DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CONTRACTS

ENTERED INTO WITH SUCH ENTITIES AS COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHERMORE,

DECLINING ASSET VALUES, DEFAULTS ON MORTGAGES AND CONSUMER

LOANS, AND THE LACK OF MARKET AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AS WELL

AS OTHER FACTORS, HAVE ALL COMBINED TO INCREASE CREDIT DEFAULT

SWAP SPREADS, TO CAUSE RATING AGENCIES TO LOWER CREDIT RATINGS,

AND TO OTHERWISE INCREASE THE COST AND DECREASE THE AVAILABILITY

OF LIQUIDITY, DESPITE VERY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN CENTRAL BANK

BORROWING RATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. BANKS AND OTHER

LENDERS HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND HAVE BECOME

RELUCTANT TO LEND, EVEN ON A SECURED BASIS, DUE TO THE INCREASED

RISK OF DEFAULT AND THE IMPACT OF DECLINING ASSET VALUES ON THE

VALUE OF COLLATERAL. THE MARKETS FOR SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS

BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER

ASSETS HAVE FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CLOSED.

IN 2008, GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO INCREASE

LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, BUT ASSET VALUES

HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE AND ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY CONTINUES TO

BE VERY LIMITED.

WE HAVE LONG PROPRIETARY POSITIONS IN A NUMBER OF

OUR BUSINESSES. THESE POSITIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE,

AND THE DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF ASSETS HAVE HAD A DIRECT AND

LARGE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2008. REVENUES

FROM OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES WERE

ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF ASSETS

MANAGED FOR OUR CLIENTS.

THE ONGOING LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS INCREASED OUR COST OF FUNDING AND

LIMITED OUR ACCESS TO SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF

LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED BORROWINGS.

WHILE THE NUMEROUS STEPS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND

CENTRAL BANKS HAVE HELPED REDUCE THESE FUNDING COSTS SOMEWHAT

AND INCREASE OUR ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL AND NEW SOURCES OF

LIQUIDITY, INCREASES IN FUNDING COSTS AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY HAVE

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR EARNINGS AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2008,

WE WERE UNABLE TO RAISE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED DEBT IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF

THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC UNDER THE

TLGP. WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE OUTSTANDING APPROXIMATELY

$35 BILLION OF DEBT UNDER THE TLGP THAT IS ISSUED PRIOR TO

JUNE 30, 2009. IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN WE WILL REGAIN

ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS ON CUSTOMARY TERMS OR WHETHER ANY SIMILAR

PROGRAM WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE TLGPS SCHEDULED

JUNE 2009 EXPIRATION. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS

TO

SHORT-TERM

FUNDING AND TO A NUMBER OF SOURCES OF SECURED FUNDING, BOTH IN

THE PRIVATE MARKETS AND THROUGH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL

BANK SPONSORED INITIATIVES. IN DECEMBER 2008, MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE DOWNGRADED OUR

LONG-TERM

DEBT CREDIT RATING AND STANDARD & POORS

DOWNGRADED BOTH OUR

LONG-TERM

AND

SHORT-TERM

DEBT CREDIT RATINGS, IN EACH CASE WITH AN OUTLOOK OF

NEGATIVE.

WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL 2008. OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS (OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT POSITIONS

MAINTAINED TO ENSURE

SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY) AND OUR CAPITAL RATIOS ARE AT LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER THAN IN THE PAST. NEVERTHELESS, OUR CREDIT SPREADS HAVE

WIDENED AND THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR NEW FUNDING HAS

DECREASED. RECENTLY, WE HAVE RELIED TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT FOR

OUR

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING ON EMERGENCY FUNDING PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED BY

GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKS. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR FOR HOW

LONG THESE FACILITIES WILL BE EXTENDED AND WHAT IMPACT

TERMINATION OF THESE FACILITIES COULD HAVE ON OUR ABILITY TO

ACCESS FUNDING. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

FURTHERMORE, THE INCREASED RISKINESS OF ASSETS DUE TO INCREASES

IN THE VOLATILITY OF ASSET PRICES, COUPLED WITH MARKET CONCERNS

ABOUT THE LEVELS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION LEVERAGE RATIOS, AS

WELL AS FEWER ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, HAVE CAUSED US

TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE SIZE OF OUR BALANCE SHEET AND TO

INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS. BOTH OF THESE STEPS

MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY, UNTIL REVERSED.

CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PROFITABILITY AND SOLVENCY

AS A RESULT OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS, TOGETHER WITH THE FORCED MERGER OR FAILURE OF A

NUMBER OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANKS, HAVE AT TIMES

CAUSED A NUMBER OF OUR CLIENTS TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS

THAT THEY DO WITH US, EITHER BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE

SAFETY OF THEIR ASSETS HELD BY US OR SIMPLY ARISING FROM A

DESIRE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR RISK OR FOR OTHER REASONS. SOME

CLIENTS HAVE WITHDRAWN SOME OF THE FUNDS HELD AT OUR FIRM OR

TRANSFERRED THEM FROM DEPOSITS WITH GS BANK USA TO OTHER TYPES

OF ASSETS (IN MANY CASES LEAVING THOSE ASSETS IN THEIR BROKERAGE

ACCOUNTS HELD WITH US). SOME COUNTERPARTIES HAVE AT TIMES

REFUSED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

LONG-TERM

TRANSACTIONS WITH US OR HAVE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

THESE INSTANCES WERE MORE PREVALENT DURING PERIODS WHEN THE LACK

OF CONFIDENCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WAS MOST WIDESPREAD AND

HAVE BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FREQUENT IN RECENT MONTHS IN THE

WAKE OF GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANK ACTIONS, GREATER

UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENT ACCOUNT PROTECTIONS AND HIGHER LIMITS OF

FDIC INSURANCE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ACQUIRED SOME NEW CLIENTS

AS A RESULT OF THE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED BY OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE RAISED $20.75 BILLION

IN EQUITY, COMPRISED OF A $5.75 BILLION PUBLIC COMMON STOCK

OFFERING, A $5 BILLION PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANT ISSUANCE

TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES AND A

$10 BILLION PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANT ISSUANCE UNDER THE

U.S. TREASURYS TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. WHILE THIS

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL PROVIDES FURTHER FUNDING TO OUR BUSINESS AND

WE BELIEVE HAS IMPROVED INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION, IT HAS INCREASED OUR EQUITY AND THE NUMBER

OF ACTUAL AND DILUTED OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS

WELL AS OUR PREFERRED DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WILL REDUCE

OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE AND THE RETURN ON OUR EQUITY UNLESS OUR

EARNINGS INCREASE SUFFICIENTLY.

IN ADDITION, AS OF THE END OF 2008, THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE

AND JAPAN ARE ALL IN A RECESSION. BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS A

WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS IS GREATLY REDUCED AND

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MANY COMPANIES ARE IN SERIOUS DIFFICULTY

DUE TO THE LACK OF CONSUMER SPENDING AND

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. WHILE LOWER INTEREST RATES, INCREASED

VOLATILITY AND SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN TRADING VOLUMES HAVE

POSITIVELY IMPACTED EARNINGS IN A NUMBER OF OUR TRADING

BUSINESSES, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC AND MARKET ACTIVITIES AND A

LACK OF CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE HAVE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED MANY OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING, MERCHANT BANKING, ASSET MANAGEMENT, CREDIT

PRODUCTS, MORTGAGE, LEVERAGED LENDING AND EQUITY PRINCIPAL

STRATEGIES BUSINESSES. IN PARTICULAR, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

BUSINESS HAS BEEN AFFECTED DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS BY THE

DECREASE IN EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITINGS AND THE DECLINE IN

BOTH ANNOUNCED AND COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID

AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND STRONG

BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH,

BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE;

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF

CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES,

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC

COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL

INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR

PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

OVERALL, DURING FISCAL 2008, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN

EXTREMELY ADVERSE FOR MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE IN THE NEAR TERM.

UNTIL THEY DO, WE EXPECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING

ASSET VALUES.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES,

OUR MORTGAGES, LEVERAGED LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS BUSINESSES IN

OUR FICC SEGMENT, AND OUR EQUITY PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESS,

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS,

DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY) AND

MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO

FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN TRADING POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS,

AS WELL AS CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES. BECAUSE NEARLY

ALL OF THESE INVESTING AND TRADING POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND

IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY

HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND

PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY

TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY

NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY

REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE

ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING

MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR

EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY INCREASE

OUR

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND

INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS.

IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE

RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING

SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE

DECLINING AND IN VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN TRADING

LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE

ASSET-BASED

MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME

CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN

TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE

COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. WHEN

THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL DECLINES, THE PARTY

POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION

WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF

ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF

FUNDING TRADING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF TRADING

POSITIONS IS DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL

THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF

WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID

MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD

TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE

LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK

TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING

ADEQUATE COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO

CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO

BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO

SO. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING

COMMERCIAL PAPER, PROMISSORY NOTES AND

LONG-TERM

DEBT, OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO

FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR LESS LIQUID ASSETS, ON

A SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAKE IT HARDER AND

MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR

AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF

FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING

AND TAKING PRINCIPAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON

ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE

THEIR TRANSACTIONS. THE LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT AND THE

INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME

AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION

TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE

TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

DUE SOLELY TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR

ISSUE.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE

LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED

VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS,

ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY VAR AND MAY EXPOSE US TO

INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

THESE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING

THE SIZE OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS AND INVESTING BUSINESSES CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY, EVEN THOUGH SPREADS ARE WIDENING AND WE MAY EARN

MORE ON EACH TRADE. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING,

BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY (AS HAS BEEN THE

CASE RECENTLY), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS AT ALL OR

IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH

CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK

OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION,

INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF OUR RISK WEIGHTED

ASSETS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCREASES OUR

FUNDING COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG

INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET

CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO

CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN

PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE

TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS

WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES

IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES

BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING

VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN

DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING VOLUMES

OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO

TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR

THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES,

PRINCIPALLY IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT

CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM IN

PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTING

BUSINESSES MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF

OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO

EITHER GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (AGAINST

THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR OF OUR COMPETITORS) BY FUNDS OR

ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR

SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS.

THIS COULD AFFECT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT

WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE

EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED

NOTES OR DERIVATIVES.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO CERTAIN OF OUR

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN DIFFICULT MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND, AT

OUR DISCRETION, WE MAY DECIDE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE FOR

REPUTATIONAL OR BUSINESS REASONS, INCLUDING THROUGH EQUITY

INVESTMENTS OR CASH INFUSIONS.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND

STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK

AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND

LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW

PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY

A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK

MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT

ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES.

THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED

DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING

HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES

REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK

THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008, PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY

PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT

DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES

LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND HAVE

CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE

EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR

TRADING MODELS WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR

TO OURS. IN THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR

NO MARKET EXISTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAKE

INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES IN

SECURITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN

ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE

OUR POSITIONS AND THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN OUR

MERCHANT BANKING, ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE

FUNDS, AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF

OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL

OR OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL

THE RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL

REPORT ON

OUR LIQUIDITY,

PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS

OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR

INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY

THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO

WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND

THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY

AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS

FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR

POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED

IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS

AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER

MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE

INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS,

WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME MATURITY

THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS

FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS,

MARKET-DRIVEN,

AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE

MOVEMENTS. CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS

OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE

INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS IS RELATIVELY NEW,

ALTHOUGH VERY LARGE, AND IT HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE

AND CURRENTLY LACKS A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

GROUP INC. IS

A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS

FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS

ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR

BROKER-DEALER,

BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT

RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO

BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO

GROUP INC. RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD

IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON

ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN

A DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR

REORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE

SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS

OF GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT ASSETS TO GS

BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. THESE GUARANTEES

MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS TO

ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS AND COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME

WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OWN

OBLIGATIONS. SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN

PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR

BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS

BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS

OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN

INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAVE THE BREADTH AND

SIZE OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. WE ARE

EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN

CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD

PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY

SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS.

DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO

THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF

MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENT

POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR

MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION

OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO

THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING

BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE CLIENT-DRIVEN

BUSINESS. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE

OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR

COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT

DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR

ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART

OF OUR CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE

OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE

POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY

OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES

ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER, AND A FAILURE OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT

BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS

MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR

THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES,

INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT FUNCTION AS WE HAVE

ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT

INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL

BANKS, AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT

CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY.

THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR AS A

RESULT OF NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS

AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE

EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS,

REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, HAVE

CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING

PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND

OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE.

WE FACE

ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US

TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND

EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. THESE BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL

CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED

COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED

CREDIT-RELATED,

SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN

WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND

NON-STANDARDIZED,

WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING THE POSITION

DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO

THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE

DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR

OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS

DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS

WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS

INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH

THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES ON

A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, WE

ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE

EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE THE

CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE

PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING

CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE

UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY

TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND

SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS. ANY REGULATORY EFFORT TO CREATE

AN EXCHANGE OR TRADING PLATFORM FOR CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, OR A MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED

DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT

OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF

OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.

A FAILURE IN

OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES,

RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS

AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS

AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO

CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS

WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND

OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR

OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY

CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER

OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR

BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION

VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE

TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO

FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING

HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE

OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH

OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS. IN RECENT

YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING

AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR

EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE

USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND

COST-EFFECTIVE

ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET

PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF

OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE

INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS. FURTHERMORE, THE

INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH

CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES INCREASES THE RISK

THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION MAY CAUSE AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS,

SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR

CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET,

TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES

WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR THE BUILDINGS

OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER

IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE

BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR

PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA,

LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG, TOKYO AND BANGALORE, WORK IN CLOSE

PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY,

GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR

EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, DEPENDING ON

THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT

IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES COULD VERY

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE

LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY

OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS,

OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER,

AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY

PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE

AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR

MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED

THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE

INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE

VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED

AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE

PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP

SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE

UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR

CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER

THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD

PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE

PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN

LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY

AND DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE INCREASINGLY MUST ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A

PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS

CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF

ANOTHER CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC

INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN

THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY

WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

OUR REGULATORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCRUTINIZE OUR ACTIVITIES FOR

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THROUGH DETAILED

EXAMINATIONS OF SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS. OUR STATUS AS A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND

INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH

RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT

ARE OR COULD BE SEEN AS AFFILIATES OF OURS.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE

DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR

REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE

DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MIGHT ARISE MAY BE

AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY AND DEAL

APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL

OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES

AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE

REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT

OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED,

PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR

SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

IN RECENT YEARS, FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE

BEEN OPERATING IN A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. THE

INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF

REGULATORS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENALTIES

AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN

REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT

OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR

THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. RECENT

MARKET DISRUPTIONS HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN

THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL REGULATION. REGULATORY CHANGES COULD LEAD

TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, COULD IMPACT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT

WE HOLD OR THE SCOPE OR PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, COULD REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES AND COULD EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING

COMPLIANCE COSTS) AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL HARM,

AND, TO THE EXTENT THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY CONTROL THE

ACTIVITIES OF FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS, MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO DISTINGUISH OURSELVES FROM COMPETITORS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR BUSINESSES

ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN

PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE OPERATION OF OUR

LENDING AND OTHER BUSINESSES THROUGH GS BANK USA SUBJECT US TO

ADDITIONAL REGULATION AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ACTIVITIES, AS

DESCRIBED IN BUSINESS  REGULATION 

BANKING REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K,

AS WELL AS SOME REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AS WE APPLY BANKING

REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES. THE

APPLICATION OF THESE REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES MAY PRESENT US

AND OUR REGULATORS WITH NEW OR NOVEL ISSUES.

OUR FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AT A

NUMBER OF LEVELS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I,

ITEM 1 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS BASED ON BASEL I AS OPPOSED TO THE REQUIREMENTS

BASED ON BASEL II THAT APPLIED TO US AS A CSE. COMPLYING WITH

THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY REQUIRE US TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR RAISE

CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS

OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

IN ADDITION, FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CAN

INITIATE CERTAIN MANDATORY AND POSSIBLY ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY

ACTIONS BY REGULATORS THAT, IF UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A DIRECT

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR AGREEMENTS

WITH THE U.S. TREASURY AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. IMPOSE

RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS ON US THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

INCREASE DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED

STOCK AND ACCESS THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS.

IN OCTOBER 2008, WE ISSUED PREFERRED STOCK AND A WARRANT TO

PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK TO THE U.S. TREASURY AS PART OF

ITS TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. PRIOR TO

OCTOBER 28, 2011, UNLESS WE HAVE REDEEMED ALL OF THE

PREFERRED STOCK OR THE U.S. TREASURY HAS TRANSFERRED ALL OF

THE PREFERRED STOCK TO A THIRD PARTY, THE CONSENT OF THE

U.S. TREASURY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR US TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS,

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASE OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OR REPURCHASE OUR COMMON

STOCK OR OTHER PREFERRED STOCK (WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS,

INCLUDING THE REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO OFFSET SHARE

DILUTION FROM

EQUITY-BASED

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AWARDS). WE HAVE ALSO GRANTED REGISTRATION

RIGHTS AND OFFERING FACILITATION RIGHTS TO THE

U.S. TREASURY AND TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. PURSUANT TO

WHICH WE HAVE AGREED TO

LOCK-UP

PERIODS DURING WHICH WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO ISSUE EQUITY

SECURITIES.

SUBSTANTIAL

LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US

COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US

SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY

HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

PART I, ITEM 3 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS

AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN. IN ADDITION,

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS TYPICALLY INCREASE IN PERIODS WHEN WE

HAVE REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR

PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO

PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL

CASES.

THE GROWTH OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE

COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE

INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF

LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO

TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE

DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF

THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

NYSES ADOPTION AND CONTINUED REFINEMENT OF ITS HYBRID

MARKET FOR TRADING SECURITIES MAY INCREASE PRESSURE ON OUR

EQUITIES BUSINESS AS CLIENTS EXECUTE MORE OF THEIR NYSE-RELATED

TRADES ELECTRONICALLY. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES

INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO

CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES

GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR

INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS

ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS

OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY

TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR

BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES

AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. COMPETITION

FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES

OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES

HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN

EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FISCAL 2008, WE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COMPENSATION LEVELS. IN

ADDITION, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

DECLINED VERY SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE YEAR. A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF OUR ANNUAL BONUS COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR SENIOR

EMPLOYEES HAS IN RECENT YEARS BEEN PAID IN THE FORM OF

EQUITY-BASED

AWARDS. IN ADDITION, WE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ACROSS

NEARLY ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF THE

YEAR. THE COMBINATION OF THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR POWER

GENERATION INTERESTS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES.

THE POWER GENERATION FACILITIES THAT WE OWN AND THOSE THAT WE

OPERATE, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER POWER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, ARE

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE

MANAGEMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND

SAFETY.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS (INCLUDING BEING REQUIRED TO

CEASE OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES) IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION AND

WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS,

INCLUDING HAVING TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL

EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES,

AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES AT OUR

POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES ARE

ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR

OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS,

PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY,

TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION, THESE FACILITIES COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FAILURE OF ANY OF OUR THIRD PARTY

SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS

NECESSARY FOR OPERATION AT REASONABLE PRICES. MARKET CONDITIONS

OR OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE A FAILURE TO SATISFY OR OBTAIN

WAIVERS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING LENDERS

AND UTILITIES, WHICH IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR

SUBSIDIARIES THAT OWN SUCH FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT

HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISKS THAT SUCH FACILITIES FACE OR

THE INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT THE AFFECTED

FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER APPLICABLE POWER SALES

AGREEMENTS, MAY IMPAIR THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

IN CONDUCTING

OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT

IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES

AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE

UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET.

ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE

EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR

REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK

THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO

NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS,

AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT,

CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE

GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE

CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND

INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR

NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING

THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY

(OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY),

TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC

AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL

DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR

OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES, AND COULD EXPOSE OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

AGREEMENTS EXPIRING PRIMARILY IN 2010 (WITH OPTIONS TO RENEW FOR

UP TO FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS), AND WE LEASE SPACE AT VARIOUS

OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA. IN TOTAL, WE

LEASE APPROXIMATELY 3.7 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET IN THE

NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA.

IN AUGUST 2005, WE LEASED FROM BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY

A PARCEL OF LAND IN LOWER MANHATTAN, PURSUANT TO A GROUND LEASE.

WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING A 2.1 MILLION GROSS SQUARE

FOOT OFFICE BUILDING ON THE SITE THAT WILL SERVE AS OUR

HEADQUARTERS. UNDER THE LEASE, BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY HOLDS

TITLE TO ALL IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE OFFICE BUILDING,

SUBJECT TO GOLDMAN SACHS RIGHT OF EXCLUSIVE POSSESSION AND

USE UNTIL JUNE 2069, THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LEASE.

RENT PAYMENT IN JUNE 2007 OF $161 MILLION, WHICH WAS

PAID INTO ESCROW, TO BE RELEASED TO THE BATTERY PARK CITY

AUTHORITY PENDING PERFORMANCE OF SPECIFIED STATE AND CITY

OBLIGATIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PERIODIC

PAYMENTS DURING THE TERM OF THE LEASE. WE ARE OBLIGATED UNDER

THE GROUND LEASE TO CONSTRUCT THE OFFICE BUILDING BY 2011

(SUBJECT TO EXTENSIONS IN THE CASE OF FORCE MAJEURE) IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN

PRE-APPROVED

DESIGN STANDARDS. CONSTRUCTION BEGAN ON THE BUILDING IN

NOVEMBER 2005, AND WE EXPECT CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION AND

INITIAL OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING DURING 2009. THE BUILDING IS

PROJECTED TO COST BETWEEN $2.1 BILLION AND

$2.3 BILLION, INCLUDING ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, FITOUT

AND FURNISHINGS, FINANCING AND OTHER RELATED COSTS.

WE ARE RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FROM THE CITY AND STATE OF

NEW YORK BASED ON OUR AGREEMENT TO CONSTRUCT OUR HEADQUARTERS IN

LOWER MANHATTAN. THESE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO RECOUPMENT OR

RECAPTURE IF WE DO NOT SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE

AGREEMENTS WITH THE CITY AND STATE OF NEW YORK.

WE HAVE OFFICES AT 30 HUDSON STREET IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY,

OUR OCCUPANCY EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OFFICE

SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. THIS EXCESS

SPACE, THE COST OF WHICH IS CHARGED TO EARNINGS AS INCURRED, IS

BEING HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH OR TO REPLACE CURRENTLY OCCUPIED

SPACE THAT WE MAY EXIT IN THE FUTURE. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE OUR

CURRENT AND FUTURE SPACE CAPACITY IN RELATION TO CURRENT AND

PROJECTED STAFFING LEVELS. IN 2008, WE INCURRED EXIT COSTS OF

$80 MILLION RELATED TO OUR OFFICE SPACE. WE MAY INCUR EXIT

COSTS IN THE FUTURE TO THE EXTENT WE (I) REDUCE OUR SPACE

CAPACITY OR (II) COMMIT TO, OR OCCUPY, NEW PROPERTIES IN

THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, DISPOSE OF

EXISTING SPACE THAT HAD BEEN HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH. THESE

EXIT COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

GIVEN PERIOD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 1999 AND 2000. THE COMPLAINTS GENERALLY ASSERT THAT THE

UNDERWRITERS, TOGETHER WITH EACH ISSUERS DIRECTORS,

OFFICERS AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS, ENTERED INTO PURPORTED

AGREEMENTS TO TIE ALLOCATIONS IN THE OFFERINGS TO INCREASED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXECUTIVE

OVERVIEW

OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $4.47 FOR 2008,

COMPARED WITH $24.73 FOR 2007. RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

(1)

WAS

5.5% AND RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS

4.9% FOR 2008. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, BOOK VALUE PER COMMON

SHARE WAS $98.68, AN INCREASE OF 9.1% COMPARED WITH THE END OF

2007, AND OUR TIER 1 RATIO

(2)

WAS

15.6%. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE RAISED

$20.75 BILLION IN EQUITY, COMPRISED OF A $5.75 BILLION

PUBLIC COMMON STOCK SALE, A $5 BILLION PREFERRED STOCK AND

WARRANT ISSUANCE TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. AND CERTAIN

AFFILIATES AND A $10 BILLION PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANT

ISSUANCE UNDER THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS

(U.S. TREASURY) TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. TOTAL ASSETS

WERE $885 BILLION AT THE END OF THE YEAR, A DECREASE OF 21%

COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2007. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008, THE FIRM BECAME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATED BY THE

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD).

OUR RESULTS FOR 2008 REFLECTED A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ASSET PRICE

DECLINES, HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY AND REDUCED LEVELS OF

LIQUIDITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION,

CREDIT MARKETS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATION BETWEEN

PRICES FOR CASH INSTRUMENTS AND THE RELATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

AND BETWEEN CREDIT INDICES AND UNDERLYING SINGLE NAMES. NET

REVENUES IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY

LOWER COMPARED WITH 2007, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC), PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS AND EQUITIES. THE DECREASE IN FICC PRIMARILY

REFLECTED LOSSES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDED A LOSS OF

APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES) RELATED TO

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES AND LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS,

INCLUDING CORPORATE DEBT AND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EQUITIES.

RESULTS IN MORTGAGES INCLUDED NET LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.7 BILLION ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES

AND APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

AND SECURITIES. INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND

COMMODITIES EACH PRODUCED PARTICULARLY STRONG RESULTS AND NET

REVENUES WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING 2008, ALTHOUGH

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY SOLID, FICC OPERATED IN A

CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

BROAD-BASED

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, WIDER MORTGAGE AND CORPORATE CREDIT

SPREADS, REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR. THE DECLINE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED

NET LOSSES OF $2.53 BILLION FROM CORPORATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS AND $949 MILLION FROM REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS A $446 MILLION LOSS FROM OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL

BANK OF CHINA LIMITED (ICBC). IN EQUITIES, THE DECREASE COMPARED

WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG NET REVENUES IN 2007 REFLECTED LOSSES

IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES

IN OUR CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES. COMMISSIONS WERE

PARTICULARLY STRONG AND WERE HIGHER THAN 2007. DURING 2008,

EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES,

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING AND VERY HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

(1)

RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (ROTE) IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET

EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY AVERAGE MONTHLY

TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. SEE

 RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW BELOW FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CALCULATION OF ROTE.

BEFORE WE BECAME A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY, WE WERE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL GUIDELINES AS A CONSOLIDATED

SUPERVISED ENTITY (CSE) THAT WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH

THOSE SET OUT IN THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL

CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED

BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL II). WE

CURRENTLY COMPUTE AND REPORT OUR CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RATIOS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL II REQUIREMENTS, AS APPLICABLE TO US

WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING

THE ADEQUACY OF OUR CAPITAL. UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS IT

APPLIED TO US WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE, OUR TIER 1

RATIO EQUALS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY TOTAL

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS (RWAS). WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD TO PUT IN PLACE THE APPROPRIATE REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE

MECHANISMS AND METHODOLOGIES TO ALLOW REPORTING OF THE

BASEL I CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF THE END OF MARCH 2009. SEE

 EQUITY

CAPITAL BELOW FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR TIER 1

RATIO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING ALSO DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY

COMPARED WITH 2007, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES

IN BOTH FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING. IN FINANCIAL

ADVISORY, THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG NET

REVENUES IN 2007 REFLECTED A DECLINE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN UNDERWRITING

PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN DEBT

UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN LEVERAGED FINANCE

AND

MORTGAGE-RELATED

ACTIVITY, REFLECTING DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. NET REVENUES

IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2007,

REFLECTING A DECREASE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED

OFFERINGS. OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG AT THE END

OF 2008 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IT WAS AT THE END OF 2007.

(3)

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2007. SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUES

WERE HIGHER, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION

OF SECURITIES LENDING CUSTOMER BALANCES, AS WELL AS HIGHER TOTAL

AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES. ASSET MANAGEMENT NET REVENUES

INCREASED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT DECREASED $89 BILLION TO

$779 BILLION, DUE TO $123 BILLION OF MARKET

DEPRECIATION, PRIMARILY IN EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$34 BILLION OF NET INFLOWS.

GIVEN THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR, THE

CHALLENGING LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING ENVIRONMENT DURING 2008, WE

FOCUSED ON REDUCING CONCENTRATED RISK POSITIONS, INCLUDING OUR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2008,

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWED AS THE U.S. ENTERED A

RECESSION. DESPITE THE WEAKNESS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER MAJOR

ECONOMIES, GROWTH IN MOST EMERGING MARKETS REMAINED SOLID, WHICH

CONTRIBUTED TO A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN COMMODITY PRICES AS WELL

AS INCREASED INFLATION. HOWEVER, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008,

THE DOWNTURN IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAME

BROAD-BASED,

WHICH COINCIDED WITH SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS AND SHARPLY REDUCED

LIQUIDITY ACROSS GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF HOW MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE

 CERTAIN

RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES BELOW AS WELL

AS RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF OUR

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2008 IS SET

FORTH BELOW.

GLOBAL.

GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WEAKENED

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE COURSE OF 2008, PARTICULARLY IN THE MAJOR

ECONOMIES. ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS ALSO GENERALLY

DECLINED IN 2008, BUT REMAINED HIGH RELATIVE TO THE MAJOR

ECONOMIES. FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED HIGH

LEVELS OF VOLATILITY,

BROAD-BASED

DECLINES IN ASSET PRICES AND REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY,

PARTICULARLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. IN

ADDITION, MORTGAGE AND CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED AND

CREDIT MARKETS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATION BETWEEN

PRICES FOR CASH INSTRUMENTS AND THE RELATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

AND BETWEEN CREDIT INDICES AND UNDERLYING SINGLE NAMES. THE

U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE LOWERED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS TARGET RATE

OVER THE COURSE OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WHILE CENTRAL BANKS IN THE

EUROZONE, UNITED KINGDOM, JAPAN AND CHINA ALSO LOWERED INTEREST

RATES TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR. OIL PRICES EXHIBITED

SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR, RISING TO OVER

$140 PER BARREL IN JULY BEFORE DECLINING TO UNDER $60 PER BARREL

BY THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. IN CURRENCY MARKETS, THE

U.S. DOLLAR INITIALLY WEAKENED AGAINST MOST MAJOR

CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY AGAINST THE EURO, BUT SUBSEQUENTLY

RECOVERED AS THE PACE OF DECLINE IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH BEGAN

TO ACCELERATE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. INVESTMENT BANKING

ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY SUBDUED DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR,

REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

ANNOUNCED AND COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED

OFFERINGS COMPARED WITH 2007.

UNITED STATES.

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

GROWTH IN THE U.S. ECONOMY SLOWED TO AN ESTIMATED 1.2% IN

CALENDAR YEAR 2008, DOWN FROM 2.0% IN 2007. THE ECONOMY ENTERED

A RECESSION NEAR THE BEGINNING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WITH THE

DOWNTURN INTENSIFYING IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER. MUCH OF THE

SLOWDOWN WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO WEAKNESS IN CREDIT MARKETS BROUGHT

ON BY THE CONTRACTION IN THE HOUSING MARKET AND THE ASSOCIATED

INCREASE IN MORTGAGE DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS. GROWTH IN

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION SLOWED FROM 2007 LEVELS, REFLECTING

REDUCED GROWTH IN DOMESTIC DEMAND AND EXPORTS. BOTH BUSINESS AND

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DECLINED OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. GROWTH

IN CONSUMER EXPENDITURE WAS SUPPORTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE

YEAR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS STIMULUS PACKAGE BUT

DECLINED THEREAFTER, AS THE HOUSING MARKET CONTINUED TO WEAKEN

AND THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE RATE OF

INFLATION INCREASED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, AS

ENERGY AND FOOD PRICES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT DECLINED

SHARPLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR. MEASURES OF CORE INFLATION,

WHICH REMAINED ELEVATED IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, ALSO

DECLINED TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR AS THE LABOR MARKET

CONTINUED TO WEAKEN AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION DECREASED. THE

U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE REDUCED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS TARGET RATE

BY A TOTAL OF 350 BASIS POINTS TO 1.00% DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR,

ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2003. U.S. REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE

ALSO TAKEN ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ADDRESS REDUCED LEVELS OF

LIQUIDITY IN CREDIT MARKETS AND THE U.S. TREASURY TOOK

MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. THE YIELD ON THE

10-YEAR

U.S. TREASURY NOTE DECLINED BY 104 BASIS POINTS TO 2.93%

DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE, THE

S&P 500 INDEX AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX ENDED OUR

FISCAL YEAR LOWER BY 34%, 39% AND 42%, RESPECTIVELY.

EUROPE.

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH IN

THE EUROZONE ECONOMIES SLOWED TO AN ESTIMATED 0.8% IN CALENDAR

YEAR 2008, DOWN FROM 2.6% IN 2007. GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL

PRODUCTION, FIXED INVESTMENT AND CONSUMER EXPENDITURE WEAKENED

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, SURVEYS OF BUSINESS AND

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DECLINED. ALTHOUGH THE LABOR MARKET REMAINED

SOLID IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

YEAR, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BEGAN TO INCREASE IN THE SECOND HALF

OF THE YEAR. THE RATE OF INFLATION INCREASED DURING THE FIRST

THREE QUARTERS OF THE YEAR. IN RESPONSE TO INFLATIONARY

PRESSURES, THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) RAISED INTEREST RATES

IN JULY, INCREASING ITS MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS RATE BY 25

BASIS POINTS TO 4.25%. HOWEVER, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF OUR

FISCAL YEAR, THE ECB LOWERED ITS MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS

RATE BY A TOTAL OF 100 BASIS POINTS TO 3.25%, AS FINANCIAL

MARKETS AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GROWTH WEAKENED CONSIDERABLY AND

INFLATIONARY PRESSURES APPEARED TO DECLINE. IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH FELL TO AN ESTIMATED

0.9% FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2008, DOWN FROM 3.0% IN 2007. THE DECLINE

IN GROWTH ACCELERATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS CREDIT

MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATED AND THE SLOWDOWN IN THE U.K.

HOUSING MARKET INTENSIFIED. THE RATE OF INFLATION INCREASED

DURING THE YEAR, ALTHOUGH INFLATIONARY PRESSURES APPEARED TO

MODERATE IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER. THE BANK OF ENGLAND LOWERED ITS

OFFICIAL BANK RATE OVER THE COURSE OF OUR FISCAL YEAR BY A TOTAL

OF 275 BASIS POINTS TO 3.00%.

LONG-TERM

GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS IN BOTH THE EUROZONE AND THE U.K. ENDED

OUR FISCAL YEAR LOWER. THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND DEPRECIATED BY

13% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY, AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING

OUR FISCAL YEAR. MAJOR EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS ENDED OUR FISCAL

YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.

ASIA.

IN JAPAN, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

DECREASED BY AN ESTIMATED 0.2% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2008 COMPARED

WITH AN INCREASE OF 2.4% IN 2007. MEASURES OF INVESTMENT

ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSING SECTOR AND GROWTH IN CONSUMPTION

DECLINED DURING THE YEAR. EXPORT GROWTH REMAINED SOLID IN THE

FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR BUT DETERIORATED NOTABLY TOWARDS YEAR-END

AS THE ENVIRONMENT OUTSIDE OF JAPAN WORSENED. THE RATE OF

INFLATION INCREASED FROM THE NEAR-ZERO LEVELS SEEN IN RECENT

YEARS, BUT REMAINED MODERATE. THE BANK OF JAPAN LOWERED ITS

TARGET OVERNIGHT CALL RATE BY 20 BASIS POINTS IN OCTOBER,

BRINGING IT TO 0.30%, WHILE THE YIELD ON

10-YEAR

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS DECLINED BY 23 BASIS POINTS DURING OUR

FISCAL YEAR. THE YEN APPRECIATED BY 14% AGAINST THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE NIKKEI 225 ENDED OUR FISCAL YEAR DOWN 46%.

IN CHINA, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH DECLINED TO AN

ESTIMATED 9.0% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2008 FROM 13.0% IN 2007. EXPORT

GROWTH AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECELERATED RAPIDLY TOWARD THE

END OF THE YEAR, WHILE CONSUMER SPENDING SOFTENED BUT REMAINED

SOLID. RISING FOOD PRICES CONTRIBUTED TO A HIGHER RATE OF

INFLATION IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR BUT INFLATION FELL

SHARPLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THE PEOPLES BANK

OF CHINA RAISED ITS

ONE-YEAR

BENCHMARK LENDING RATE BY 18 BASIS POINTS TO 7.47% AT THE

BEGINNING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, BUT REDUCED THE LENDING RATE BY

189 BASIS POINTS DURING OUR FOURTH QUARTER AND TOOK ADDITIONAL

MEASURES TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE

CHINESE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO ALLOW THE STEADY APPRECIATION OF

ITS CURRENCY AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR IN THE FIRST HALF OF

THE YEAR, AFTER WHICH THE EXCHANGE RATE REMAINED BROADLY

UNCHANGED. REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH IN INDIA SLOWED TO

AN ESTIMATED 6.7% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2008 FROM 9.0% IN 2007. WHILE

EXPORT GROWTH REMAINED SOLID FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, GROWTH IN

CONSUMER EXPENDITURE AND FIXED INVESTMENT DECLINED. THE RATE OF

WHOLESALE INFLATION INCREASED SHARPLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE

YEAR AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED. THE INDIAN RUPEE, ALONG

WITH OTHER CURRENCIES IN THE REGION, GENERALLY DEPRECIATED

AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED

SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES ACROSS THE REGION, WITH THE SHANGHAI

COMPOSITE INDEX DOWN 62%, AND MARKETS IN HONG KONG, INDIA AND

SOUTH KOREA ALSO ENDING THE YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.

OTHER MARKETS.

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

GROWTH IN BRAZIL DECLINED TO AN ESTIMATED 5.4% IN CALENDAR YEAR

2008 FROM 5.7% IN 2007. FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, GROWTH WAS

SUPPORTED BY STRONG CAPITAL INFLOWS, HIGH DEMAND FOR COMMODITY

EXPORTS, AND STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND. TOWARDS THE END OF THE

YEAR, HOWEVER, THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK DETERIORATED, AS THE

BRAZILIAN CURRENCY DEPRECIATED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND

COMMODITY PRICES FELL. IN RUSSIA, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

GROWTH DECLINED TO AN ESTIMATED 6.2% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2008 FROM

8.1% IN 2007. GROWTH WAS SUPPORTED BY STRONG HOUSEHOLD

CONSUMPTION AND INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY IN

THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. HOWEVER, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE

PACE OF GROWTH DECLINED SHARPLY, AS CAPITAL OUTFLOWS INTENSIFIED

AND THE RUSSIAN CURRENCY DEPRECIATED AGAINST THE

U.S. DOLLAR. BRAZILIAN AND RUSSIAN EQUITY PRICES ENDED OUR

FISCAL YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.

CERTAIN RISK

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW

MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE RISKS, SEE

 RISK

MANAGEMENT BELOW. A SUMMARY OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS

THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES FOLLOWS BELOW. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE RISK FACTORS IN

PART I, ITEM 1A OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MARKET RISK.

OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. OVERALL, DURING FISCAL 2008, THE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY ADVERSE FOR MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS

WILL IMPROVE IN THE NEAR TERM.

A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH,

TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW

INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS.

UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN BE

CAUSED BY: DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR

INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY

OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN

INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT

RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF

HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY; CORPORATE,

POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN

CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A

COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS. OUR BUSINESSES AND

PROFITABILITY HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BECOME ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE

FOLLOWING.



MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES,

OUR MORTGAGES, LEVERAGED LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS BUSINESSES IN

OUR FICC SEGMENT, AND OUR EQUITY PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESS,

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS,

DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY) AND

MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO

FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN TRADING POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS,

AS WELL AS CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES. BECAUSE NEARLY

ALL OF THESE INVESTING AND TRADING POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND

IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY

HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND

PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY

TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY

NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY

REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE

ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING

MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR

EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY INCREASE

OUR

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND

INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS.



OUR COST OF OBTAINING

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR

CREDITWORTHINESS. WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND

UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE FUND OURSELVES ON

AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER, PROMISSORY NOTES

AND

LONG-TERM

DEBT, OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO

FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR LESS LIQUID ASSETS, ON

A SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAKE IT HARDER AND

MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR

AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US

TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF

FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING

AND TAKING PRINCIPAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET MAKING.



OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO

CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN

ADDITION, OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN

RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO

FINANCE THEIR TRANSACTIONS. THE LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT AND THE

INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME

AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION

TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE TRANSACTIONS.

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED

VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS,

ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY VAR AND MAY EXPOSE US TO

INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

THESE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING

THE SIZE OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS AND INVESTING BUSINESSES CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY.



WE RECEIVE

ASSET-BASED

MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME

CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN

TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS. MARKET

UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL

AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER

THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR THEIR

BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS

OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED

NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO

THE EXTENT THAT CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY

INVEST THEM IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO

THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING

BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

BUSINESS.



CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PROFITABILITY AND SOLVENCY

AS A RESULT OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS, TOGETHER WITH THE FORCED MERGER OR FAILURE OF A

NUMBER OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE AT TIMES

CAUSED A NUMBER OF OUR CLIENTS TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS

THAT THEY DO WITH US, EITHER BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE

SAFETY OF THEIR ASSETS HELD BY US OR SIMPLY ARISING FROM A

DESIRE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR RISK OR FOR OTHER REASONS. SOME

CLIENTS HAVE WITHDRAWN SOME OF THE FUNDS HELD AT OUR FIRM OR

TRANSFERRED THEM FROM DEPOSITS WITH GS BANK USA TO OTHER TYPES

OF ASSETS (IN MANY CASES LEAVING THOSE ASSETS IN THEIR BROKERAGE

ACCOUNTS HELD WITH US). SOME COUNTERPARTIES HAVE AT TIMES

REFUSED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

LONG-TERM

TRANSACTIONS WITH US OR HAVE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

THESE INSTANCES WERE MORE PREVALENT DURING PERIODS WHEN THE LACK

OF CONFIDENCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WAS MOST WIDESPREAD AND

HAVE BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FREQUENT IN RECENT MONTHS.

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIQUIDITY RISK.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR

BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR

INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY

THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE ONGOING LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS INCREASED OUR COST OF FUNDING AND

LIMITED OUR ACCESS TO SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF

LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED BORROWINGS. IN

PARTICULAR, IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2008, WE WERE UNABLE TO RAISE

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED DEBT IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF

THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) UNDER THE FDICS TEMPORARY

LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP). IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN WE WILL

REGAIN ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS ON

CUSTOMARY TERMS OR WHETHER ANY SIMILAR PROGRAM WILL BE AVAILABLE

AFTER THE TLGPS SCHEDULED JUNE 2009 EXPIRATION.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO

WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND

THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY

AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS

FROM THESE ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR

POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED

IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS

AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER

MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE

INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS,

WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF DOWNGRADES TO OUR RATINGS THAT OCCURRED IN

DECEMBER 2008 AND OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GOLDMAN SACHS

OF A FURTHER REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE

 LIQUIDITY

AND FUNDING RISK  CREDIT RATINGS BELOW.

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.), GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA (GS

BANK USA) AND GOLDMAN SACHS BANK (EUROPE) PLC (GS BANK EUROPE),

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT

ASSETS TO GS BANK USA TO SUPPORT ITS OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA.

THESE GUARANTEES MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL

FUNDS OR ASSETS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR

COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY

TO FUND ITS OWN OBLIGATIONS.

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT RISK.

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, AS HAVE THE BREADTH AND SIZE OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE

HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD

PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT

PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT

MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN

INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS,

LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT US. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR

RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL

CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD

RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FOR COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. DEFAULT

RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE

VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF

MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENT

POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR

MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE,

PARTICULARLY AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US

TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO

EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY

COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY

DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY

BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO

CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY

STANDARDS. DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE

IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR

BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY

INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS,

INTERNET, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD

PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED,

OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS. FURTHERMORE, THE

INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH

CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES INCREASES THE RISK

THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION MAY CAUSE AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS.

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND, AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS AND A MINIMUM TIER 1

LEVERAGE RATIO ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A DIFFICULT REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT. RECENT MARKET DISRUPTIONS HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS

PROPOSALS FOR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. THESE REGULATIONS COULD LIMIT OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, INCREASE COMPLIANCE COSTS AND, TO THE EXTENT THE

REGULATIONS STRICTLY CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRMS, MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DISTINGUISH

OURSELVES FROM COMPETITORS. SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A

SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM

TO US, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS

PROSPECTS. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BASED ON BASEL I AS OPPOSED TO THE

REQUIREMENTS BASED ON BASEL II THAT APPLIED TO US AS A CSE.

COMPLYING WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY REQUIRE US TO LIQUIDATE

ASSETS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR

FUNDING COSTS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS

AND CREDITORS. IN ADDITION, FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS CAN INITIATE CERTAIN MANDATORY AND POSSIBLY

ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS BY REGULATORS THAT, IF

UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A DIRECT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND

THE OPERATION OF OUR LENDING AND OTHER BUSINESSES THROUGH GS

BANK USA SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION AND LIMITATIONS ON

OUR ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN REGULATION 

BANKING REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K,

AS WELL AS SOME REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AS WE APPLY BANKING

REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES. THE

APPLICATION OF THESE REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES MAY PRESENT US

AND OUR REGULATORS WITH NEW OR NOVEL ISSUES. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN

HIGH. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND

CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN. IN ADDITION,

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS TYPICALLY INCREASE IN PERIODS WHEN WE

HAVE REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY EXPOSURES, SEE

RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND IS

OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO

SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE

(THE EXIT PRICE). FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, BOTH THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) AND THE STAFF OF THE SEC RE-EMPHASIZED

THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN FINANCIAL

REPORTING. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF

POSITION NO. FAS 157-3,

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE

MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE. THIS STATEMENT

CLARIFIES THAT DETERMINING FAIR VALUE IN AN INACTIVE OR

DISLOCATED MARKET DEPENDS ON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. THIS STATEMENT

SPECIFIES THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO USE INPUTS BASED ON

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS, OR FOR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ADJUSTMENTS TO OBSERVABLE INPUTS TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE WHEN

MARKETS ARE NOT ACTIVE AND RELEVANT OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE NOT

AVAILABLE. OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT POLICIES ARE CONSISTENT

WITH THE GUIDANCE IN

FSP NO. FAS 157-3.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES ARE

REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AT FAIR VALUE, PURSUANT PRINCIPALLY TO.

THEREFORE, WITHIN OUR

(I.E., DEBT SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES),

AND ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR OTHER CASH INSTRUMENTS

(SPECIFICALLY LOANS, LOAN COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY

AND RESTRICTED PUBLIC EQUITY SECURITIES) WHICH WE HISTORICALLY

HAD CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS WERE IN

ADDITION TO PREVIOUS ELECTIONS MADE FOR CERTAIN CORPORATE LOANS,

LOAN COMMITMENTS AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT ISSUED BY GS BANK

USA. THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS FROM THESE INITIAL

ELECTIONS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE ALREADY RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE OR

TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION PRIOR TO GROUP

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH INSTRUMENTS.

CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS, PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND

PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.



CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS.

OUR CASH TRADING

INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES,

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH

REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF

INSTRUMENTS VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE

MARKETS INCLUDE MOST U.S. GOVERNMENT AND SOVEREIGN

OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVE LISTED EQUITIES AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET

SECURITIES.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS THAT TRADE IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE, BUT ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING

SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY INCLUDE

MOST GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES,

INVESTMENT-GRADE

CORPORATE BONDS, CERTAIN MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, CERTAIN BANK LOANS

AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL

AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET SECURITIES

AND LOAN COMMITMENTS.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND

THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUND INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN

BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS (INCLUDING CERTAIN MEZZANINE

FINANCING, LEVERAGED LOANS ARISING FROM CAPITAL MARKET

TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER CORPORATE BANK DEBT), LESS LIQUID

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING

LESS LIQUID

HIGH-YIELD

CORPORATE BONDS, DISTRESSED DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED

DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS) BACKED BY CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS), LESS

LIQUID MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND SECURITIES (BACKED BY EITHER

COMMERCIAL OR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE), AND ACQUIRED PORTFOLIOS

OF DISTRESSED LOANS. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING

MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED

SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION

PRICE. THIS VALUATION IS ADJUSTED ONLY WHEN CHANGES TO INPUTS

AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS

TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED OR PENDING

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OR

COMPARABLE ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING,

RECAPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS OR ARE

SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT ILLIQUIDITY

AND/OR

NON-TRANSFERABILITY.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET

EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.



PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OUR PUBLIC

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS HELD WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT TEND

TO BE LARGE, CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS RESULTING FROM INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, AND ARE VALUED BASED

ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT TRADED IN

ACTIVE MARKETS OR ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS,

VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ILLIQUIDITY

AND/OR

NON-TRANSFERABILITY.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET

EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT IS OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC. OUR INVESTMENT IN

ICBC IS VALUED USING THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE ADJUSTED FOR

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. THE ORDINARY SHARES ACQUIRED FROM ICBC

ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

PROHIBIT ANY SALE, DISPOSITION OR OTHER TRANSFER UNTIL

APRIL 28, 2009. FROM APRIL 28, 2009 TO

OCTOBER 20, 2009, WE MAY TRANSFER UP TO 50% OF THE

AGGREGATE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC THAT WE OWNED AS OF

OCTOBER 20, 2006. WE MAY TRANSFER THE REMAINING SHARES

AFTER OCTOBER 20, 2009. A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST IS

HELD BY INVESTMENT FUNDS MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS.

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF

SMFG. THIS INVESTMENT IS VALUED USING A MODEL THAT IS

PRINCIPALLY BASED ON SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE. DURING OUR

SECOND QUARTER OF 2008, WE CONVERTED

ONE-THIRD

OF

OUR SMFG PREFERRED STOCK INVESTMENT INTO SMFG COMMON STOCK, AND

DELIVERED THE COMMON STOCK TO CLOSE OUT

ONE-THIRD

OF

OUR HEDGE POSITION. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, WE REMAINED HEDGED

ON THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT IN SMFG.



PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OUR PRIVATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS HELD WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT

INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY, DEBT AND REAL ESTATE,

PRIMARILY HELD THROUGH INVESTMENT FUNDS. BY THEIR NATURE, THESE

INVESTMENTS HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. WE VALUE SUCH

INSTRUMENTS INITIALLY AT TRANSACTION PRICE AND ADJUST VALUATIONS

WHEN EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. SUCH

EVIDENCE INCLUDES TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED

OR PENDING THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT

OR COMPARABLE ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING,

RECAPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CAN

BE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

OR

OVER-THE-COUNTER

(OTC). WE GENERALLY VALUE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES USING MODELS WHICH CALIBRATE TO

MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS AND ELIMINATE TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CLOSING

PRICE OF THE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES AND THEIR UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS.

OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

MARKET EVIDENCE WHENEVER POSSIBLE, INCLUDING

MARKET-BASED

INPUTS TO MODELS, MODEL CALIBRATION TO

MARKET-CLEARING

TRANSACTIONS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

WHERE MODELS ARE USED, THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO

VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF,

AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. WE GENERALLY

USE SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. VALUATION

MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS,

MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF

VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS.

FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS

GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL INPUTS CAN GENERALLY

BE VERIFIED AND MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WITH

LIMITED PRICING INFORMATION, AND THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

FOR THESE DERIVATIVES IS INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT. WHERE WE DO

NOT HAVE CORROBORATING MARKET EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT

MODEL INPUTS AND CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF

FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE

SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL

VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION PRICE. SUBSEQUENT TO

INITIAL RECOGNITION, WE ONLY UPDATE VALUATION INPUTS WHEN

CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THIRD-PARTY

PRICING SERVICES

AND/OR

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL VALUE TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL

COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SEE

 DERIVATIVES BELOW FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON OUR OTC DERIVATIVES.

WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED FOR VARIOUS FACTORS

SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET

EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

A CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE,

INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, IS

FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

APPROPRIATELY VALUED AT

MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS (EXIT PRICE) AND THAT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE

RELIABLE AND CONSISTENTLY DETERMINED.

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE EMPLOY AN OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES APPROPRIATE

SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INDEPENDENT OF THE

TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

OVERSIGHT OF CONTROL AND VALUATION POLICIES AND FOR REPORTING

THE RESULTS OF THESE POLICIES TO OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE SEEK TO

MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL

FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED APPROPRIATELY. WE EMPLOY PROCEDURES FOR

THE APPROVAL OF NEW TRANSACTION TYPES AND MARKETS, PRICE

VERIFICATION, REVIEW OF DAILY PROFIT AND LOSS, AND REVIEW OF

VALUATION MODELS BY PERSONNEL WITH APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL

KNOWLEDGE OF RELEVANT PRODUCTS AND MARKETS. THESE PROCEDURES ARE

PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING AND INVESTING

FUNCTIONS. FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE PRICES OR VALUATIONS

THAT REQUIRE INPUTS ARE LESS OBSERVABLE, WE EMPLOY, WHERE

POSSIBLE, PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE COMPARISONS WITH SIMILAR

OBSERVABLE POSITIONS, ANALYSIS OF ACTUAL TO PROJECTED CASH

FLOWS, COMPARISONS WITH SUBSEQUENT SALES, REVIEWS OF VALUATIONS

USED FOR COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH

SENIOR BUSINESS LEADERS. SEE

 MARKET

RISK AND

 CREDIT

RISK BELOW FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE THE

RISKS INHERENT IN OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING BUSINESSES.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY 

LEVEL 3.

SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES

A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION

TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE OBJECTIVE OF A FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT IS TO DETERMINE THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE

RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE (THE EXIT PRICE). THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE

HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS

FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS)

AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3

MEASUREMENTS). ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR

ENTIRETY BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT

TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

INSTRUMENTS THAT TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR

NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. WE DETERMINE WHICH INSTRUMENTS ARE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR PRICE

VERIFICATION PROCESS. THIS PROCESS IS PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL

INDEPENDENT OF OUR TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS WHO

CORROBORATE VALUATIONS TO EXTERNAL MARKET DATA

(E.G., QUOTED MARKET PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS,

THIRD-PARTY

PRICING VENDORS, RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY AND COMPARATIVE

ANALYSES TO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS). WHEN BROKER OR DEALER

QUOTATIONS OR THIRD-PARTY PRICING VENDORS ARE USED FOR VALUATION

OR PRICE VERIFICATION, GREATER PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO EXECUTABLE

QUOTES. AS PART OF OUR PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS, VALUATIONS

BASED ON QUOTES ARE CORROBORATED BY COMPARISON BOTH TO OTHER

QUOTES AND TO RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY IN THE SAME OR SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS. THE NUMBER OF QUOTES OBTAINED VARIES BY INSTRUMENT

AND DEPENDS ON THE LIQUIDITY OF THE PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT. SEE

NOTES 2 AND 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING SFAS NO. 157.

RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008 (CHARACTERIZED BY DISLOCATIONS BETWEEN ASSET CLASSES,

ELEVATED LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, AND REDUCED PRICE TRANSPARENCY),

HAVE INCREASED THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT REQUIRED TO

VALUE CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. IN PARTICULAR, MANAGEMENTS

JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE

RISK-ADJUSTED

DISCOUNT RATE FOR CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS WITH LITTLE OR NO

PRICE TRANSPARENCY AS A RESULT OF DECREASED VOLUMES AND LOWER

LEVELS OF TRADING ACTIVITY. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, OUR VALUATION IS

ADJUSTED TO APPROXIMATE RATES WHICH MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD

LIKELY CONSIDER APPROPRIATE FOR RELEVANT CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY

RISKS.

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES FOR LEVEL 3

ASSETS.

INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT

TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL

ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. AS TIME PASSES, TRANSACTION PRICE

BECOMES LESS RELIABLE AS AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AND

ACCORDINGLY, WE USE OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE,

WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

REGARDLESS OF THE METHODOLOGY, VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE.

SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN CONTROL FUNCTIONS, INDEPENDENT OF THE

TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, REVIEWS ALL SIGNIFICANT

UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES, INCLUDING THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE

CHANGE IN VALUE. VALUATIONS ARE FURTHER CORROBORATED BY VALUES

REALIZED UPON

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALES OF OUR LEVEL 3 ASSETS. AN OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGIES

USED TO VALUE OUR LEVEL 3 ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE

TRANSACTION DATE IS AS FOLLOWS.



PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUND

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY HELD AT

COST FOR THE FIRST YEAR. RECENT

THIRD-PARTY

INVESTMENTS OR PENDING TRANSACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE

BEST EVIDENCE FOR ANY CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE. IN THE ABSENCE OF

SUCH EVIDENCE, VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON THIRD-PARTY INDEPENDENT

APPRAISALS, TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW TECHNIQUES, VALUATION MULTIPLES AND PUBLIC COMPARABLES.

SUCH EVIDENCE INCLUDES PENDING REORGANIZATIONS

(E.G., MERGER PROPOSALS, TENDER OFFERS OR DEBT

RESTRUCTURINGS); AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL METRICS

(E.G., OPERATING RESULTS AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS

PROJECTIONS, INDUSTRY MULTIPLES, CREDIT RATINGS AND BALANCE

SHEET RATIOS).



BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND

OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

VALUATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES, FOR WHICH THE KEY INPUTS ARE

THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, MARKET

YIELDS FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS AND RECOVERY ASSUMPTIONS. INPUTS ARE

GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES, WHICH

INCORPORATE COMPARISONS BOTH TO CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT

REFERENCE THE SAME UNDERLYING CREDIT RISK AND TO OTHER DEBT

INSTRUMENTS FOR THE SAME ISSUER FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE PRICES OR

BROKER QUOTES ARE AVAILABLE.



LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY SPECIFIC ASSETS AND ARE GENERALLY TRANCHED

INTO VARYING LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS, VALUATION TECHNIQUES VARY BY INSTRUMENT.

METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES ACROSS DIFFERENT

TRANCHES, COMPARISONS TO TRANSACTIONS IN BOTH THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL AND INSTRUMENTS WITH THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE

SAME UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, MARKET INDICES (SUCH AS THE CMBX

(1)

), AND

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, AS WELL AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES.



LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE.

VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON BOTH PROPRIETARY AND INDUSTRY RECOGNIZED

MODELS (INCLUDING INTEX AND BLOOMBERG), DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

TECHNIQUES AND HYPOTHETICAL SECURITIZATION ANALYSES. IN THE

RECENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE

VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RATES OF DELINQUENCY, DEFAULT

AND LOSS EXPECTATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN IN PART BY HOUSING

PRICES. INPUTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES,

WHICH INCORPORATE COMPARISONS TO INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR

COLLATERAL AND RISK PROFILES, INCLUDING RELEVANT INDICES SUCH AS

THE ABX

(1).



LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES, FOR WHICH THE KEY INPUTS ARE

THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND MARKET

YIELDS FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS. INPUTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON

RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES WHICH INCORPORATE COMPARISONS TO RECENT

AUCTION DATA FOR OTHER SIMILAR LOAN PORTFOLIOS.



DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

VALUATION MODELS ARE

CALIBRATED TO INITIAL TRANSACTION PRICE. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN

VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION

MODELS (E.G., INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILITIES,

ETC.). INPUTS ARE CHANGED ONLY WHEN CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.

VALUATIONS OF LESS LIQUID OTC DERIVATIVES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON

LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE

MARKET, AS WELL AS UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, SUCH AS CORRELATIONS AND

VOLATILITIES.

TOTAL LEVEL 3 ASSETS WERE $66.19 BILLION AND

$69.15 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN LEVEL 3

ASSETS FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2008 PRIMARILY REFLECTED

(I) UNREALIZED LOSSES ON LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS, AND PRIVATE

EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUND INVESTMENTS, AND (II) SALES AND

PAYDOWNS ON BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS AND LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TRANSFERS TO

LEVEL 3 OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DUE TO REDUCED PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR

VALUE.

IN ADDITION TO TRADING ASSETS, AT

FAIR VALUE AND TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR

VALUE, WE HAVE ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR OTHER

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE UNDER

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR ELECTING THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION ARE TO REFLECT ECONOMIC EVENTS IN EARNINGS ON A

TIMELY BASIS, TO MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING

DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES AND TO ADDRESS SIMPLIFICATION

AND

COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AT

FAIR VALUE INCLUDE.

ACCOUNTING TO NEW INVESTMENTS THAT ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR

CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHERE WE

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH FLOWS OR

OPERATIONS OF THE INVESTEE, OR WHERE

COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT.

GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRINCIPALLY SLK LLC (SLK) IN

2000, THE AYCO COMPANY, L.P. (AYCO) IN 2003 AND OUR VARIABLE

ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN 2006, WE HAVE ACQUIRED

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL IS THE

COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET

ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL.

WE TEST THE GOODWILL IN EACH OF OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE COMPONENTS ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR

THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. WE

DERIVE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON

VALUATION TECHNIQUES WE BELIEVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE

FOR EACH SEGMENT (OBSERVABLE AVERAGE PRICE-TO-EARNINGS MULTIPLES

OF OUR COMPETITORS IN THESE BUSINESSES AND PRICE-TO-BOOK

MULTIPLES). WE DERIVE THE NET BOOK VALUE OF OUR OPERATING

SEGMENTS BY ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT.

OUR LAST ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS PERFORMED DURING OUR 2008

FOURTH QUARTER AND NO IMPAIRMENT WAS IDENTIFIED. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF OUR GOODWILL IS IN OUR EQUITIES COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT AND IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

AND SECURITIES SERVICES SEGMENT. OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

SECURITIES SERVICES SEGMENT GENERATED RECORD NET REVENUES IN

2008 AND OUR EQUITIES COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS SEGMENT HAD ITS SECOND BEST YEAR FOLLOWING ITS

RECORD NET REVENUES IN 2007.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2008, PARTICULARLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY

WERE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES

IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK

OF LIQUIDITY. OUR STOCK PRICE, CONSISTENT WITH STOCK PRICES IN

THE BROADER FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR, DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY

DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION FELL BELOW RECORDED BOOK VALUE,

PRINCIPALLY DURING THE LAST FIVE WEEKS OF THE QUARTER. WITH

RESPECT TO THE TESTING OF OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE

BELIEVE THAT IT IS REASONABLE TO CONSIDER MARKET CAPITALIZATION

AS AN INDICATOR OF FAIR VALUE OVER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME.

IF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS PERSIST AND IF THERE

IS A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED,

WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN THE FUTURE.

A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE

TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE

EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE

VALUE OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION,

CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING (I) CHANGES IN

MARKET STRUCTURE THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SPECIALIST

BUSINESSES (SEE DISCUSSION BELOW), (II) AN ADVERSE ACTION

OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR, OR (III) ADVERSE ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE ON THE CONTRACTS IN OUR VARIABLE ANNUITY AND LIFE

INSURANCE BUSINESS.

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE SEC APPROVED THE NYSES PROPOSAL

TO CREATE A NEW MARKET MODEL AND REDEFINE THE ROLE OF NYSE DMMS.

THIS NEW RULE SET FURTHER ALIGNS THE NYSES MODEL WITH

INVESTOR REQUIREMENTS FOR SPEED AND EFFICIENCY OF EXECUTION AND

ESTABLISHES SPECIALISTS AS DMMS. WHILE DMMS STILL HAVE AN

OBLIGATION TO COMMIT CAPITAL, THEY ARE NOW ABLE TO TRADE ON

PARITY WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS. IN ADDITION, IN

NOVEMBER 2008 THE NYSE INTRODUCED A RESERVE ORDER TYPE THAT

ALLOWS FOR ANONYMOUS TRADE EXECUTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO ALLOW

THE NYSE TO RECAPTURE LIQUIDITY AND MARKET SHARE FROM OTHER

VENUES IN WHICH ANONYMOUS RESERVE ORDERS HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR

SOME TIME. THE NEW RULE SET AND THE LAUNCH OF THE RESERVE ORDER

TYPE, IN COMBINATION WITH TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS TO INCREASE

EXECUTION SPEED, ARE EXPECTED TO BOLSTER THE NYSES

COMPETITIVE POSITION.

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2007, WE TESTED OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS. UNDER SFAS NO. 144, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS

IS RECOGNIZED IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS

EXCEEDS THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE BUSINESS

OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIFE OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS.

PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS, AND ACCORDINGLY WE DID NOT RECORD AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS. IN PROJECTING THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF

THE BUSINESS, WE MADE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF THE RULE AND MARKET STRUCTURE

CHANGES DESCRIBED ABOVE. SPECIFICALLY, WE ASSUMED THAT.



TOTAL EQUITY TRADING VOLUMES IN NYSE-LISTED COMPANIES WILL

CONTINUE TO GROW AT A RATE CONSISTENT WITH RECENT HISTORICAL

TRENDS;



THE NYSE WILL BE ABLE TO RECAPTURE APPROXIMATELY

ONE-HALF

OF

THE MARKET SHARE THAT IT LOST IN 2007; AND



WE WILL INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE OF THE NYSE DMM BUSINESS AND,

AS A DMM, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH SHARE TRADED.

WE ALSO ASSUMED THAT THE RULE CHANGES WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN

OUR FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 (AS NOTED ABOVE, SUCH RULE

CHANGES WERE APPROVED IN OCTOBER 2008) AND THAT

PROJECTED CASH FLOW INCREASES RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THE RULE SET WOULD BEGIN IN 2009, CONSISTENT WITH THE

ASSUMPTIONS ABOVE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN NO EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATING THAT NYSE DMM RIGHTS

INTANGIBLE ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS, RULE OR STRUCTURE CHANGES

DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL RESULT IN SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO AVOID

IMPAIRMENT OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL

CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SPECIALIST BUSINESS

UNDER THE NEW MARKET MODEL. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, THE

CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS WAS $462 MILLION. TO

THE EXTENT THAT THERE WERE TO BE AN IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE, IT

COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT WRITEDOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THESE DMM RIGHTS.

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN

ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO

IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT

MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX

AUDITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT

OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH

LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE ESTIMATED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE

OUT OF TAX AUDITS TO THE EXTENT THAT UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

FAIL TO MEET THE RECOGNITION STANDARD OF FIN 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109. SEE

NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON FIN 48.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND

OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT.

OUR TOTAL ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A

CASE-BY-CASE

BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER

CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE OR

PROCEEDING, OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN

SIMILAR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF

LEGAL COUNSEL. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE

OUTCOME OF OUR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY

IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE

DAMAGES OR FINES ARE SOUGHT, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES

OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS WHERE THERE IS ONLY A

REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED. SEE

REVENUES

2008 VERSUS 2007.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$22.22 BILLION IN 2008, A DECREASE OF 52% COMPARED WITH

2007, REFLECTING A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT,

INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ASSET PRICE DECLINES, HIGH LEVELS OF

VOLATILITY AND REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, CREDIT MARKETS EXPERIENCED

SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATION BETWEEN PRICES FOR CASH INSTRUMENTS AND

THE RELATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND BETWEEN CREDIT INDICES AND

UNDERLYING SINGLE NAMES. NET REVENUES IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2007,

REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN FICC, PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

AND EQUITIES. THE DECREASE IN FICC PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOSSES IN

CREDIT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$3.1 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES) RELATED TO

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES AND LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS,

INCLUDING CORPORATE DEBT AND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EQUITIES.

RESULTS IN MORTGAGES INCLUDED NET LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.7 BILLION ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES

AND APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

AND SECURITIES. INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND

COMMODITIES EACH PRODUCED PARTICULARLY STRONG RESULTS AND NET

REVENUES WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING 2008, ALTHOUGH

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY SOLID, FICC OPERATED IN A

CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

BROAD-BASED

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, WIDER MORTGAGE AND CORPORATE CREDIT

SPREADS, REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR. THE DECLINE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED

NET LOSSES OF $2.53 BILLION FROM CORPORATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS AND $949 MILLION FROM REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS A $446 MILLION LOSS FROM OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC. IN EQUITIES, THE

DECREASE COMPARED WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG NET REVENUES IN 2007

REFLECTED LOSSES IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES.

COMMISSIONS WERE PARTICULARLY STRONG AND WERE HIGHER THAN 2007.

DURING 2008, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES,

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING AND VERY HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING ALSO DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY

COMPARED WITH 2007, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES

IN BOTH FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING. IN FINANCIAL

ADVISORY, THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG NET

REVENUES IN 2007 REFLECTED A DECLINE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN UNDERWRITING

PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN DEBT

UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN LEVERAGED FINANCE

AND

MORTGAGE-RELATED

ACTIVITY, REFLECTING DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. NET REVENUES

IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2007,

REFLECTING A DECREASE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED

OFFERINGS.

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2007. SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUES

WERE HIGHER, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION

OF SECURITIES LENDING CUSTOMER BALANCES, AS WELL AS HIGHER TOTAL

AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES. ASSET MANAGEMENT NET REVENUES

INCREASED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT DECREASED $89 BILLION TO

$779 BILLION, DUE TO $123 BILLION OF MARKET

DEPRECIATION, PRIMARILY IN EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$34 BILLION OF NET INFLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2007 VERSUS 2006.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$45.99 BILLION IN 2007, AN INCREASE OF 22% COMPARED WITH

2006, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING, AND HIGHER NET

REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES. THE

INCREASE IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES, FICC AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. NET

REVENUES IN EQUITIES INCREASED 33% COMPARED WITH 2006,

REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN BOTH OUR CLIENT

FRANCHISE BUSINESSES AND PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES. DURING 2007,

EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES AND

HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF

OF THE YEAR. THE INCREASE IN FICC REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES WERE HIGHER DESPITE A

SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET THROUGHOUT THE

YEAR, WHILE NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS WERE STRONG, BUT

SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2006. CREDIT PRODUCTS INCLUDED

SUBSTANTIAL GAINS FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A GAIN OF

APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF

HORIZON WIND ENERGY L.L.C., AS WELL AS A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES) RELATED TO

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. DURING 2007, FICC OPERATED IN AN

ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CLIENT-DRIVEN

ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, DURING THE

YEAR, THE MORTGAGE MARKET EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION

AND, IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS

WERE CHARACTERIZED BY WIDER SPREADS AND REDUCED LEVELS OF

LIQUIDITY. THE INCREASE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED

STRONG RESULTS IN BOTH CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE INVESTING.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING REFLECTED A 64% INCREASE IN

FINANCIAL ADVISORY NET REVENUES AND A STRONG PERFORMANCE IN OUR

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY

PRIMARILY REFLECTED GROWTH IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING

REFLECTED HIGHER NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, AS LEVERAGED

FINANCE ACTIVITY WAS STRONG DURING THE FIRST HALF OF OUR FISCAL

YEAR, WHILE NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE STRONG BUT

ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2006.

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES ALSO

INCREASED. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES SERVICES PRIMARILY

REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN GLOBAL CUSTOMER BALANCES. THE

INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

INCENTIVE FEES. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

INCREASED $192 BILLION, OR 28%, TO $868 BILLION,

INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $161 BILLION.

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES ARE ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD STRICTLY FOR

CAPITAL APPRECIATION, HAVE A DEFINED EXIT STRATEGY AND ARE

ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR

PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT HOLD REAL ESTATE ASSETS, SUCH AS

HOTELS, BUT EXCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT PRIMARILY HOLD

FINANCIAL ASSETS. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MEANINGFUL TO REVIEW

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES EXCLUDING EXPENSES RELATED TO THESE CONSOLIDATED

CURRENT PRESENTATION.

2008 VERSUS 2007.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE

$19.89 BILLION FOR 2008, 30% LOWER THAN 2007. COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS EXPENSES (INCLUDING SALARIES, BONUSES, AMORTIZATION

OF PRIOR YEAR EQUITY AWARDS AND OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL

TAXES AND BENEFITS) OF $10.93 BILLION DECREASED 46%

COMPARED WITH 2007, REFLECTING LOWER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION DUE TO LOWER NET REVENUES. FOR 2008, OUR RATIO OF

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS (EXCLUDING SEVERANCE COSTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008) TO NET REVENUES WAS 48.0%. OUR RATIO OF COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES WAS 43.9% FOR 2007. EMPLOYMENT

LEVELS DECREASED 1% COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 2007, REFLECTING

AN 8% DECREASE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER.

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES OF $8.95 BILLION FOR 2008 INCREASED 9% COMPARED

WITH 2007. EXCLUDING CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES,

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES INCREASED 5% COMPARED WITH 2007. THE MAJORITY OF THIS

INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING,

EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING HIGHER

ACTIVITY LEVELS IN EQUITIES AND FICC. THE INCREASE IN

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF IMPAIRMENT ON CERTAIN

REAL ESTATE ASSETS DURING 2008.

2007 VERSUS 2006.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE

$28.38 BILLION FOR 2007, 23% HIGHER THAN 2006. COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $20.19 BILLION INCREASED 23%

COMPARED WITH 2006, REFLECTING INCREASED DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION AND GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS. THE RATIO OF

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2007 WAS 43.9%

COMPARED WITH 43.7% FOR 2006. EMPLOYMENT LEVELS INCREASED 15%

COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 2006.

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES OF $8.19 BILLION FOR 2007 INCREASED 23% COMPARED

WITH 2006, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION.

ONE-HALF

OF

THIS INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE

AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION

VOLUMES IN EQUITIES. PROFESSIONAL FEES, OTHER EXPENSES AND

COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED, PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. OCCUPANCY AND

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES IN 2007 INCLUDED EXIT

COSTS OF $128 MILLION RELATED TO OUR OFFICE SPACE.

PROVISION FOR

TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1% FOR 2008,

DOWN FROM 34.1% FOR 2007. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME

TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PERMANENT BENEFITS

AS A PERCENTAGE OF LOWER EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHIC

EARNINGS MIX. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 34.1% FOR 2007,

DOWN FROM 34.5% FOR 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE

GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD

DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GEOGRAPHIC AND BUSINESS

MIX OF OUR EARNINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR

PRE-TAX

EARNINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR TAX CREDITS AND THE EFFECT OF TAX

AUDITS. CERTAIN OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR

HISTORY OF

PRE-TAX

EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING OUR ABILITY TO

REALIZE OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE

COMMODITIES EACH PRODUCED PARTICULARLY STRONG RESULTS AND NET

REVENUES WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING 2008, ALTHOUGH

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY SOLID, FICC OPERATED IN A

CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

BROAD-BASED

DURING 2008, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES,

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING AND VERY HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED A NET LOSS OF $3.86 BILLION

$2.53 BILLION FROM CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND

$949 MILLION FROM REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, AS

WELL AS A $446 MILLION LOSS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN

THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $11.81 BILLION FOR 2008 DECREASED 34%

COMPARED WITH 2007, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM LOWER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES. EXCLUDING CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD

FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, THE MAJORITY OF THIS INCREASE WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND

DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING HIGHER ACTIVITY LEVELS

IN EQUITIES AND FICC. THE INCREASE IN NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES

RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES

PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF IMPAIRMENT ON CERTAIN REAL

ESTATE ASSETS DURING 2008.

NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $16.17 BILLION FOR 2007 INCREASED

13% COMPARED WITH 2006, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET

NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES WERE HIGHER DESPITE A SIGNIFICANT

DETERIORATION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET THROUGHOUT 2007, WHILE NET

REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS WERE STRONG, BUT SLIGHTLY LOWER

COMPARED WITH 2006. CREDIT PRODUCTS INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL GAINS

FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY

$900 MILLION RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF HORIZON WIND

ENERGY L.L.C., AS WELL AS A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES) RELATED TO

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES WERE

ALSO STRONG BUT LOWER COMPARED WITH 2006. DURING 2007, FICC

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.

HOWEVER, DURING 2007, THE MORTGAGE MARKET EXPERIENCED

SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION AND, IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR,

THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY WIDER SPREADS

AND REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $11.30 BILLION FOR 2007

INCREASED 33% COMPARED WITH 2006, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN BOTH OUR CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES AND

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES. THE CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES BENEFITED

FROM SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMMISSION VOLUMES. DURING 2007,

EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, GENERALLY HIGHER EQUITY PRICES AND

HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF

OF THE YEAR.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET REVENUES OF

$3.76 BILLION FOR 2007, REFLECTING GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM

CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. RESULTS IN

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDED A $495 MILLION GAIN RELATED

TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC AND A

$129 MILLION LOSS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $18.00 BILLION FOR 2007 INCREASED 20%

COMPARED WITH 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM HIGHER DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION AND GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS.

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF

BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION. THE

MAJORITY OF THIS INCREASE WAS IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE

AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER

TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN EQUITIES. PROFESSIONAL FEES ALSO

INCREASED, REFLECTING INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE MANY

DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL AND

OTHER INTERESTS IN

MORTGAGE-BACKED

AND OTHER

ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIZATION VEHICLES; HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT,

INTERESTS IN LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND PREFERRED AND

COMMON STOCK IN OTHER NONCONSOLIDATED VEHICLES; ENTERING INTO

INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY, COMMODITY AND CREDIT

DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING TOTAL RETURN SWAPS; ENTERING INTO

OPERATING LEASES; AND PROVIDING GUARANTEES, INDEMNIFICATIONS,

LOAN COMMITMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS

PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE SECURITIZATION OF COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY AND AUTO LOANS, GOVERNMENT

AND CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. OTHER

REASONS FOR ENTERING INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE

UNDERWRITING CLIENT SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING

SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKING INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND

NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS;

PROVIDING INVESTORS WITH

CREDIT-LINKED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES)

AND QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITIES (QSPES). SUCH VEHICLES ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING

OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE

MORTGAGE-BACKED

AND OTHER

ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES MARKETS, SINCE THEY OFFER INVESTORS ACCESS TO

SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS CREATED THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION

PROCESS. OUR FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN, AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

WITH, SUCH NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE, IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

WE DID NOT HAVE

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM (ASF)

ISSUED THE STREAMLINED FORECLOSURE AND LOSS AVOIDANCE

FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE

LOANS (ASF FRAMEWORK). THE ASF FRAMEWORK PROVIDES GUIDANCE

FOR SERVICERS TO STREAMLINE BORROWER EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND

TO FACILITATE THE USE OF FORECLOSURE AND LOSS PREVENTION

MEASURES FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES THAT

MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA. FOR CERTAIN ELIGIBLE LOANS AS DEFINED IN

THE ASF FRAMEWORK, SERVICERS MAY PRESUME DEFAULT IS REASONABLY

FORESEEABLE AND APPLY A

FAST-TRACK

LOAN MODIFICATION PLAN, UNDER WHICH THE LOAN INTEREST RATE WILL

BE KEPT AT THE INTRODUCTORY RATE FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE UPCOMING RESET DATE. MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATIONS

OF THESE ELIGIBLE LOANS WILL NOT AFFECT OUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

FOR QSPES THAT HOLD THE SUBPRIME LOANS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUITY

CAPITAL

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE PRINCIPALLY

DETERMINED BY OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

BUT MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES,

SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT,

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ASSESSMENTS OF POTENTIAL

FUTURE LOSSES DUE TO EXTREME AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS

AND MARKET ENVIRONMENTS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, OUR TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $64.37 BILLION (CONSISTING OF

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $47.90 BILLION AND

PREFERRED STOCK OF $16.47 BILLION) COMPARED WITH TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $42.80 BILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007 (CONSISTING OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY OF $39.70 BILLION AND PREFERRED STOCK OF

$3.10 BILLION). IN ADDITION TO TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY, WE CONSIDER THE $5.00 BILLION OF JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS (SEE DISCUSSION BELOW) TO BE

PART OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL, AS IT QUALIFIES AS CAPITAL FOR

REGULATORY AND CERTAIN RATING AGENCY PURPOSES.

CONSOLIDATED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED

BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES. OUR BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA, ARE SUBJECT TO

SIMILAR CAPITAL GUIDELINES. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND THE REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA) THAT IS APPLICABLE

TO GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL GUIDELINES

THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

CERTAIN

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY REPORTING PRACTICES.

GOLDMAN SACHS AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES CAPITAL AMOUNTS, AS WELL AS GS BANK

USAS PCA CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE

JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS

AND OTHER FACTORS. WE ANTICIPATE REPORTING CAPITAL RATIOS AS

FOLLOWS.



BEFORE WE BECAME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE WERE SUBJECT TO

CAPITAL GUIDELINES BY THE SEC AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED

ENTITY (CSE) THAT WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE SET OUT

IN THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF

CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL II). WE CURRENTLY

COMPUTE AND REPORT OUR FIRMWIDE CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE BASEL II REQUIREMENTS AS APPLICABLE TO US WHEN WE WERE

REGULATED AS A CSE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF

OUR CAPITAL. UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS IT APPLIED TO US

WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE, WE EVALUATE OUR TIER 1

CAPITAL AND TOTAL ALLOWABLE CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS. AS

OF NOVEMBER 2008, OUR TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL ALLOWABLE

CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS) WAS 18.9% AND OUR TIER 1

RATIO (TIER 1 CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS) WAS 15.6%,

IN EACH CASE CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS IT

APPLIED TO US WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE. SEE

 CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RATIOS BELOW FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO REPORT TO

INVESTORS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OUR BASEL II CAPITAL RATIOS

AS APPLICABLE TO US WHEN WE WERE REGULATED AS A CSE.



THE REGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES ARE BASED ON THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL I), WITH BASEL II TO BE

PHASED IN OVER TIME. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD TO PUT IN PLACE THE APPROPRIATE REPORTING AND

COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS AND METHODOLOGIES TO ALLOW REPORTING OF

THE BASEL I CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF THE END OF MARCH 2009.



IN ADDITION, WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL II

FRAMEWORK AS APPLICABLE TO US AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (AS

OPPOSED TO AS A CSE). U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE

INCORPORATED THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS GROUP INC., TRANSITION TO BASEL

II OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO HAS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIO GUIDELINES. WE WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THESE GUIDELINES BEFORE

BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE

CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE OUR

METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THIS RATIO.

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL

(AS APPLICABLE TO US AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY) DIVIDED BY

ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR

DISALLOWED GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

HAVE RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM

LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE

AND GROWTH PLANS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, OUR ESTIMATED

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 6.1%. THIS RATIO REPRESENTS A

PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE AND MAY BE REVISED IN SUBSEQUENT FILINGS AS

WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE

THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE CALCULATION.

OUR RWAS ARE DRIVEN BY THE AMOUNT OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK

AND OPERATIONAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN

A MANNER GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH METHODOLOGIES SET OUT IN

BASEL II. THE METHODOLOGIES USED TO COMPUTE RWAS FOR EACH OF

MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK ARE CLOSELY

ALIGNED WITH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. SEE

 MARKET

RISK AND  CREDIT RISK BELOW FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE RISKS IN OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTING BUSINESSES. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE METHODOLOGIES USED

TO CALCULATE RWAS ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS FOR MARKET RISK

FOR POSITIONS CAPTURED IN VAR, RWAS ARE CALCULATED USING VAR AND

OTHER

MODEL-BASED

MEASURES, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS FOR INCREMENTAL DEFAULT RISK

AND OTHER EVENT RISKS. VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF

TRADING POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED

TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. MARKET RISK RWAS

ARE CALCULATED CONSISTENT WITH THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS SET OUT

IN THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK (BASED ON VAR CALIBRATED TO A 99%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL, OVER A

10-DAY

HOLDING PERIOD, MULTIPLIED BY A FACTOR). ADDITIONAL RWAS ARE

CALCULATED WITH RESPECT TO INCREMENTAL DEFAULT RISK AND OTHER

EVENT RISKS, IN A MANNER GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTERNAL

RISK MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGIES.

FOR POSITIONS NOT INCLUDED IN VAR BECAUSE VAR IS NOT THE MOST

APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF RISK, WE CALCULATE RWAS BASED ON

ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING SENSITIVITY ANALYSES.

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS FOR CREDIT RISK

RWAS FOR CREDIT RISK ARE CALCULATED FOR ON- AND

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT CAPTURED IN OUR MARKET

RISK RWAS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OTC DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH BOTH

MARKET RISK AND CREDIT RISK RWAS ARE CALCULATED. THE

CALCULATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ADVANCED INTERNAL RATINGS

BASED (AIRB) APPROACH AND THE INTERNAL MODELS METHOD

(IMM) OF BASEL II, AND WERE BASED ON EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT

(EAD), WHICH IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE OWED TO

US AT THE TIME OF A DEFAULT, MULTIPLIED BY EACH

COUNTERPARTYS RISK WEIGHT.

UNDER THE BASEL II AIRB APPROACH, A COUNTERPARTYS RISK

WEIGHT IS GENERALLY DERIVED FROM A COMBINATION OF THE

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT (PD), THE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (LGD) AND

THE MATURITY OF THE TRADE OR PORTFOLIO OF TRADES, WHERE.



PD IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABILITY THAT AN OBLIGOR WILL

DEFAULT OVER A

ONE-YEAR

HORIZON. PD IS DERIVED FROM THE USE OF INTERNALLY DETERMINED

EQUIVALENTS OF PUBLIC RATING AGENCY RATINGS.



LGD IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE ECONOMIC LOSS RATE IF A DEFAULT OCCURS

DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CONDITIONS. LGD IS DETERMINED BASED ON

INDUSTRY DATA.

FOR OTC DERIVATIVES AND FUNDING TRADES (SUCH AS REPURCHASE AND

REVERSE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS), WE USE THE BASEL II IMM

APPROACH, WHICH ALLOWS EAD TO BE CALCULATED USING

MODEL-BASED

MEASURES TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, CONSISTENT WITH MODELS

AND METHODOLOGIES THAT WE USE FOR INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES. FOR COMMITMENTS, EAD IS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF

THE OUTSTANDING NOTIONAL BALANCE. FOR OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES,

EAD IS GENERALLY THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE EXPOSURE.

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK

RWAS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK ARE CALCULATED USING A

RISK-BASED

METHODOLOGY CONSISTENT WITH THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE

CRITERIA FOR THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACH (AMA), AS DEFINED

IN BASEL II. THE METHODOLOGY INCORPORATES INTERNAL LOSS EVENTS,

RELEVANT EXTERNAL LOSS EVENTS, RESULTS OF SCENARIO ANALYSES AND

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND

INTERNAL CONTROLS. WE ESTIMATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTH

EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES, SEEKING TO CAPTURE THE MAJOR

DRIVERS OF OPERATIONAL RISK OVER A

ONE-YEAR

TIME HORIZON, AT A 99.9% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. OPERATIONAL RISK

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED AMONG OUR BUSINESSES AND IS REGULARLY

REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND KEY RISK AND OVERSIGHT

COMMITTEES.

RATING AGENCY

GUIDELINES

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE

OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., WHICH DIRECTLY ISSUES OR GUARANTEES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SENIOR UNSECURED

OBLIGATIONS. THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE

AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING OUR CREDIT

RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS OWN DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL

AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING CAPITAL

SUBSIDIARY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION AND

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE

U.S. AND/OR

ELSEWHERE. GS&CO. AND GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION &

CLEARING, L.P. ARE REGISTERED

U.S. BROKER-DEALERS

AND FUTURES COMMISSIONS MERCHANTS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY THE SEC, THE

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE CHICAGO BOARD OF

TRADE, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, INC. (FINRA)

AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION.

OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, GS BANK USA, A NEW YORK

STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

AND THE FDIC, IS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE

NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS) ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. GS BANK

USA WAS FORMED IN NOVEMBER 2008 THROUGH THE MERGER OF OUR

EXISTING UTAH INDUSTRIAL BANK (NAMED GS BANK USA) INTO OUR NEW

YORK LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY, WITH THE SURVIVING COMPANY

TAKING THE NAME GS BANK USA. AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, GS BANK

USAS PREDECESSOR WAS A WHOLLY OWNED INDUSTRIAL BANK

REGULATED BY THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WAS

A MEMBER OF THE FDIC AND WAS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. WE COMPUTE THE CAPITAL RATIOS FOR GS BANK USA IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL I FRAMEWORK FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING

THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL. IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A

WELL CAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UNDER THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES, GS BANK USA MUST MAINTAIN A

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO

OF AT LEAST 10%, AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST

5%. IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOVEMBER 2008 ASSET TRANSFER

DESCRIBED BELOW, GS BANK USA AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD TO MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THESE

WELL CAPITALIZED LEVELS. ACCORDINGLY, FOR A PERIOD

OF TIME, GS BANK USA IS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A TIER 1

CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST

11% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%. IN

NOVEMBER 2008, WE CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES WITH AN

AGGREGATE OF $117.16 BILLION OF ASSETS INTO GS BANK

USA (WHICH BROUGHT TOTAL ASSETS IN GS BANK USA TO

$145.06 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008). AS A RESULT, WE ARE

CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE OUR

METHODOLOGY FOR THE BASEL I CALCULATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER

2008, UNDER BASEL I, GS BANK USAS ESTIMATED

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 8.9% AND ESTIMATED TOTAL CAPITAL

RATIO WAS 11.6%. IN ADDITION, GS BANK USAS ESTIMATED

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 9.1%.

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF

GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, AS NOTED ABOVE, WE

CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES, WITH AN AGGREGATE OF

$117.16 BILLION OF ASSETS, INTO GS BANK USA AND GROUP INC.

AGREED TO GUARANTEE CERTAIN LOSSES, INCLUDING

CREDIT-RELATED

LOSSES, RELATING TO ASSETS HELD BY THE CONTRIBUTED ENTITIES. IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE, GROUP INC. ALSO AGREED TO PLEDGE

TO GS BANK USA CERTAIN COLLATERAL, INCLUDING INTERESTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS.

GS BANK EUROPE, OUR REGULATED IRISH BANK, IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE IRISH FINANCIAL SERVICES

REGULATORY AUTHORITY. SEVERAL OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF GOLDMAN

SACHS ARE REGULATED BY SECURITIES, INVESTMENT ADVISORY, BANKING,

INSURANCE, AND OTHER REGULATORS AND AUTHORITIES AROUND THE

WORLD. GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI), OUR REGULATED U.K.

BROKER-DEALER,

IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA). GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO.,

LTD., OUR REGULATED JAPANESE

BROKER-DEALER,

IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY

JAPANS FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008

AND NOVEMBER 2007, THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE IN COMPLIANCE

WITH THEIR LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION MAY HOLD

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF WHICH IS MANAGED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AND

NON-U.S. DENOMINATED

REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS PERMITTED, AND ISSUANCES OF

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO

TRUSTS AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE SHEET

ASSETS

AND/OR

LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE AT BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED AND

BUSINESS UNIT LEVELS. WE ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF OUR

BUSINESS UNITS BASED UPON OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND

MANAGE THE LEVELS OF USAGE BASED UPON THE BALANCE SHEET AND RISK

LIMITS ESTABLISHED.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS IN CONNECTION WITH

NORMAL AUTOMATIC PREFERRED ENHANCED CAPITAL

SECURITIES.

IN 2007, WE ISSUED $1.75 BILLION

OF FIXED RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT TO GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL

II AND $500 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEBT TO GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL III, DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUSTS

THAT, IN TURN, ISSUED $2.25 BILLION OF GUARANTEED PERPETUAL

AUTOMATIC PREFERRED ENHANCED CAPITAL SECURITIES (APEX) TO THIRD

PARTIES AND A DE MINIMIS AMOUNT OF COMMON SECURITIES TO GOLDMAN

SACHS. THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT IS INCLUDED IN

UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE APEX ISSUANCE, WE ENTERED INTO

STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL II AND III

UNDER WHICH WE WILL BE OBLIGATED TO SELL AND THESE ENTITIES WILL

BE OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE $2.25 BILLION OF PERPETUAL

NON-CUMULATIVE

PREFERRED STOCK THAT WE WILL ISSUE IN THE FUTURE. GOLDMAN SACHS

CAPITAL II AND III ARE REQUIRED TO REMARKET THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT IN ORDER TO FUND THEIR PURCHASE OF THE

PREFERRED STOCK, BUT IN THE EVENT THAT A REMARKETING IS

UNSUCCESSFUL, THEY WILL RELINQUISH THE SUBORDINATED DEBT TO US

IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PREFERRED STOCK. BECAUSE OF CERTAIN

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT (AND THE

ASSOCIATED APEX), INCLUDING ITS

LONG-TERM

NATURE, THE FUTURE ISSUANCE OF PERPETUAL

NON-CUMULATIVE

PREFERRED STOCK UNDER THE STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS, OUR ABILITY

THE DEBT IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, IT QUALIFIES AS TIER 1

EQUITY CAPITAL.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO A TRUST IN CONNECTION WITH

TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES.

WE ISSUED

$2.84 BILLION OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES IN 2004 TO

GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL I, A DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST THAT, IN

TURN, ISSUED $2.75 BILLION OF GUARANTEED PREFERRED

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO THIRD PARTIES AND $85 MILLION OF

COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO GOLDMAN SACHS. THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ARE INCLUDED IN UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION. BECAUSE OF CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT (AND THE ASSOCIATED TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES), INCLUDING ITS

LONG-TERM

NATURE, OUR ABILITY TO DEFER COUPON INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN

CONSECUTIVE

SEMI-ANNUAL

PERIODS AND THE SUBORDINATED NATURE OF THE DEBT IN OUR CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, IT QUALIFIES AS TIER 1 AND TOTAL ALLOWABLE

SUBORDINATED DEBT.

IN ADDITION TO JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS, WE HAD OTHER SUBORDINATED

DEBT OUTSTANDING OF $14.17 BILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008. ALTHOUGH NOT PART OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SUBORDINATED DEBT QUALIFIES AS

MARKET

RISK

THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR TRADING AND

INVESTING POSITIONS IS REFERRED TO AS MARKET RISK. SUCH

POSITIONS RESULT FROM

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, UNDERWRITING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTING

ACTIVITIES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS AND CHANGES ARE RECORDED IN NET REVENUES.

CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATES,

EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. A

DESCRIPTION OF EACH MARKET RISK CATEGORY IS SET FORTH BELOW.



INTEREST RATE RISKS PRIMARILY RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES

IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE, THE

VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND

CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES

AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, EQUITY BASKETS AND

EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS

ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND

PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

106

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THESE RISKS BY DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES,

CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING ECONOMIC HEDGES IN

RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY SEEK TO

HEDGE A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCKS BY TAKING AN OFFSETTING

POSITION IN A RELATED

EQUITY-INDEX

FUTURES CONTRACT. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AN EXPOSURE MAY,

HOWEVER, BE LIMITED BY ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE LIQUIDITY OF THE

SECURITY OR THE RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT AND IN THE CORRELATION

OF PRICE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND RELATED HEDGE

INSTRUMENT.

IN ADDITION TO APPLYING BUSINESS JUDGMENT, SENIOR MANAGEMENT

USES A NUMBER OF QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

MARKET RISK FOR TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE AND

TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE TOOLS

INCLUDE.



RISK LIMITS BASED ON A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE

REFERRED TO AS VAR;



SCENARIO ANALYSES, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT

MEASURE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON OUR TRADING NET REVENUES OF

VARIOUS MARKET EVENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A LARGE

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT MOVES IN SELECTED EMERGING MARKETS; AND



INVENTORY POSITION LIMITS FOR SELECTED BUSINESS UNITS.

VAR

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF TRADING POSITIONS DUE TO

ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A

SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

FOR THE VAR NUMBERS REPORTED BELOW, A

ONE-DAY

TIME

HORIZON AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL WERE USED. THIS MEANS THAT

THERE IS A 1 IN 20 CHANCE THAT DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES WILL

FALL BELOW THE EXPECTED DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES BY AN AMOUNT

AT LEAST AS LARGE AS THE REPORTED VAR. THUS, SHORTFALLS FROM

EXPECTED TRADING NET REVENUES ON A SINGLE TRADING DAY GREATER

THAN THE REPORTED VAR WOULD BE ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR, ON AVERAGE,

ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. SHORTFALLS ON A SINGLE DAY CAN EXCEED

REPORTED VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. SHORTFALLS CAN ALSO OCCUR

MORE FREQUENTLY OR ACCUMULATE OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON SUCH AS

A NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

THE MODELING OF THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR TRADING

POSITIONS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS.

WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS ARE

REASONABLE, THERE IS NO STANDARD METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING VAR,

AND DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS

AND/OR

APPROXIMATIONS COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR ESTIMATES.

WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OUR VAR AND, TO BETTER

REFLECT CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WE GENERALLY WEIGHT

HISTORICAL DATA TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT

OBSERVATIONS. GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST

EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE

ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION OF VAR IS THAT THE

DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT

PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK. DIFFERENT

VAR METHODOLOGIES AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS COULD PRODUCE A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR. MOREOVER, VAR CALCULATED FOR A

ONE-DAY

TIME

HORIZON DOES NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE MARKET RISK OF POSITIONS THAT

CANNOT BE LIQUIDATED OR OFFSET WITH HEDGES WITHIN ONE DAY.

OUR AVERAGE DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $180 MILLION IN 2008

FROM $138 MILLION IN 2007, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASES IN

THE INTEREST RATE, COMMODITY PRICE AND CURRENCY RATE CATEGORIES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE EQUITY PRICE CATEGORY. THE

INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF

VOLATILITY AND WIDER SPREADS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY POSITION

REDUCTIONS, AND THE INCREASES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND CURRENCY

RATES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY. THE

DECREASE IN EQUITY PRICES WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO POSITION

REDUCTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY.

OUR AVERAGE DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $138 MILLION IN 2007

FROM $101 MILLION IN 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPOSURE AND VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES

AND EQUITY PRICES.

VAR EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN

OUR DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $244 MILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 FROM $134 MILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE INTEREST

RATE CATEGORY AND A REDUCTION IN THE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT

ACROSS RISK CATEGORIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE

EQUITY PRICE CATEGORY. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WAS

PRINCIPALLY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY AND WIDER

RISK MEASURES

CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS AND INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

(E.G., DUE TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

AND/OR

ILLIQUIDITY). THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC, EXCLUDING INTERESTS HELD BY INVESTMENT

FUNDS MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS, IS MEASURED BY ESTIMATING THE

POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10%

DECLINE IN THE ICBC ORDINARY SHARE PRICE. THE MARKET RISK

RELATED TO THE REMAINING POSITIONS IS MEASURED BY ESTIMATING THE

POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10%

DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES FOR EQUITY AND DEBT POSITIONS IN OUR

TRADING PORTFOLIO AND EQUITY, DEBT (PRIMARILY MEZZANINE

INSTRUMENTS) AND REAL ESTATE POSITIONS IN OUR

NON-TRADING

PORTFOLIO ARE MEASURED BY THE IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN THE ASSET

VALUES (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LEVERAGE IN THE UNDERLYING

INVESTMENTS FOR REAL ESTATE POSITIONS IN OUR

PORTFOLIO) OF SUCH POSITIONS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

POSITIONS MAY BE IMPACTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS TRANSACTIONS IN

CREDIT

RISK

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS THAT WE WOULD INCUR IF A

COUNTERPARTY OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE

HOLD FAILS TO PERFORM UNDER ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO US,

OR UPON A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTC

DERIVATIVES, WE HOLD. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY

ARISES THROUGH OUR TRADING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE SEEK TO ENTER INTO NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION,

WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES BY (I) ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE

US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM A COUNTERPARTY ON AN UPFRONT OR

CONTINGENT BASIS, (II) SEEKING

THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS,

AND/OR

(III) TRANSFERRING OUR CREDIT RISK TO THIRD PARTIES USING

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

AND/OR

OTHER

STRUCTURES AND TECHNIQUES.

TO MEASURE AND MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE USE A VARIETY OF

TOOLS, INCLUDING CREDIT LIMITS REFERENCED TO BOTH CURRENT

EXPOSURE AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE IS AN

ESTIMATE OF EXPOSURE, WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THAT

COULD BE OUTSTANDING OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION BASED ON

MARKET MOVEMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESS, FOR POSITIONS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN CREDIT

SPREADS, WE USE VAR AND OTHER SENSITIVITY MEASURES. TO

SUPPLEMENT OUR PRIMARY CREDIT EXPOSURE MEASURES, WE ALSO USE

SCENARIO ANALYSES, SUCH AS CREDIT SPREAD WIDENING SCENARIOS,

STRESS TESTS AND OTHER QUANTITATIVE TOOLS.

OUR GLOBAL CREDIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MONITOR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO

COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. THESE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRMWIDE RISK AND CREDIT POLICY

COMMITTEES, WITH INFORMATION REGARDING CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT,

INDUSTRY SECTOR, COUNTRY AND REGION.

WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND

COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS AND

INVESTMENT FUNDS, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION

WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS, WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT

RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER OR ISSUER.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, WE HELD

$53.98 BILLION (6% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND $45.75 BILLION

(4% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AT

FAIR VALUE AND CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR

REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 2007, WE HELD $21.13 BILLION (2% OF TOTAL

ASSETS) AND $31.65 BILLION (3% OF TOTAL ASSETS),

RESPECTIVELY, OF OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS, PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTING OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF JAPAN AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN ADDITION, AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 2007, $126.27 BILLION AND

$144.92 BILLION OF OUR SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED (INCLUDING THOSE IN

CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, $65.37 BILLION

AND $41.26 BILLION OF OUR SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

COLLATERALIZED BY OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, WE DID NOT HAVE

CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY THAT EXCEEDED 2% OF

OUR TOTAL ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE

AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES WITH RESPECT TO OTC

DERIVATIVES HAS BEEN INCREASING, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

THE GROWTH OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET EVOLUTION

TOWARD LONGER-DATED TRANSACTIONS. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS BELOW.

DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED

INTO TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY

POSITIONS OR AS A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, WE

ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON

OUR NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

AND TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON OUR

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND WE BELIEVE

THAT THE ASSOCIATED MARKET RISK CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD RELATIVE

TO ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OR RISKS BEING HEDGED, OR AS

PART OF A BROADER TRADING STRATEGY. ACCORDINGLY, THE MARKET RISK

OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS IS MANAGED TOGETHER WITH OUR

NONDERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IS REFLECTED NET OF

CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND

IS REPORTED ON A

NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY

BASIS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN

WE BELIEVE A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE

NETTING AGREEMENT. FOR AN OTC DERIVATIVE, OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE IS

DIRECTLY WITH OUR COUNTERPARTY AND CONTINUES UNTIL THE MATURITY

OR TERMINATION OF SUCH CONTRACT.

THE RISK THAT THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATE FOR A

ADVICE OF COUNSEL ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS

ON THE AUTHORITY OF A COUNTERPARTY TO EFFECT THE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

(E.G., CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS) INVOLVE THE RISK THAT

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY OR OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO SATISFY ANY

PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENT.

116

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING RISK

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO COMPANIES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOST FAILURES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT

LIQUIDITY RESULTING FROM ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY,

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING POLICIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS BOTH GOLDMAN SACHS-SPECIFIC AND BROADER

INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS

TO BE ABLE TO FUND GOLDMAN SACHS AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE

BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE

CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES ACCORDING TO THE

FOLLOWING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.



EXCESS LIQUIDITY  WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS

LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS IN A

STRESSED ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FINANCING OBLIGATIONS.



ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT  WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN SECURED AND UNSECURED

FUNDING SOURCES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY

LONG-TERM

IN

ORDER TO WITHSTAND A PROLONGED OR SEVERE LIQUIDITY-STRESSED

ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON ASSET SALES.



CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE  WE SEEK TO ACCESS

FUNDING ACROSS A DIVERSE RANGE OF MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES, EMPHASIZE LESS

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

SOURCES OF FUNDING AND CONSERVATIVELY MANAGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF

FUNDING ACROSS OUR ENTITY STRUCTURE.



CRISIS PLANNING  WE BASE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING

MANAGEMENT ON

STRESS-SCENARIO

PLANNING AND MAINTAIN A CRISIS PLAN DETAILING OUR RESPONSE TO A

LIQUIDITY-THREATENING EVENT.

EXCESS

LIQUIDITY

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO

PRE-FUND

WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR LIKELY CASH NEEDS DURING A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD SUCH EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF

UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT MAY BE SOLD OR

PLEDGED TO PROVIDE

SAME-DAY

LIQUIDITY. THIS GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS INTENDED TO

ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL

OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POOL OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY PROVIDES

US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST

CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS SURVIVAL.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL

OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. GOLDMAN

SACHS BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND ITS CASH NEEDS ARE

DRIVEN BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE

DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS,

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED

FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE, AND THE TERMS OR

AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO

PRE-FUND

LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD

MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER UNSECURED DEBT

BALANCES THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY

LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR

UNSECURED LIABILITIES AND OUR FUNDING COSTS.

117

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SIZE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL

LIQUIDITY MODEL TOGETHER WITH A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE

CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OF GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR

LIQUIDITY MODEL IDENTIFIES AND ESTIMATES CASH AND COLLATERAL

OUTFLOWS OVER A

SHORT-TERM

HORIZON IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.



UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT AND LETTERS OF CREDIT;



POTENTIAL BUYBACKS OF A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING NEGOTIABLE

UNSECURED DEBT AND POTENTIAL WITHDRAWALS OF CLIENT DEPOSITS;



ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE TERMS OR AVAILABILITY OF SECURED FUNDING;



DERIVATIVES AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, INCLUDING

THOSE DUE TO MARKET MOVES;



POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRIME BROKERAGE

BUSINESS;



ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL THAT COULD BE CALLED IN THE EVENT OF A

TWO-NOTCH

DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS;



DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS NOT SUPPORTED BY WILLIAM

STREET FUNDING

CORPORATION

;

AND



UPCOMING CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS TAX AND OTHER LARGE PAYMENTS.

U.S. AGENCY

MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE ELIGIBLE AS COLLATERAL IN FEDERAL

RESERVE OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS OVERNIGHT CASH

DEPOSITS. OUR

NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

EXCESS IS COMPRISED OF ONLY UNENCUMBERED FRENCH, GERMAN, UNITED

KINGDOM AND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS AND OVERNIGHT CASH

DEPOSITS IN HIGHLY LIQUID CURRENCIES. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO THIS NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES

AND CASH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A

DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT BELIEVE OTHER POTENTIAL

SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY, SUCH AS LOWER-QUALITY UNENCUMBERED

SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, ARE AS RELIABLE IN A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

WE MAINTAIN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO ENABLE US TO MEET CURRENT

AND POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY,

GROUP INC., AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE AMOUNT OF OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS DRIVEN BY OUR ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL CASH

AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS AND THE CURRENCY

AND TIMING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS MODEL. IN

ADDITION, WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS HELD IN A

REGULATED ENTITY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR

OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND THEREFORE MAY ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO MEET

THE POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT ENTITY.

(1)

THE

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS EXCLUDES LIQUID ASSETS OF $4.40 BILLION

HELD SEPARATELY BY WILLIAM STREET FUNDING CORPORATION. SEE

 CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS ABOVE FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF THE WILLIAM STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM.

(2)

BEGINNING

IN 2008, OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AS PRESENTED INCLUDES THE GLOBAL

CORE EXCESS OF GS BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE. THE 2007 AMOUNTS

INCLUDE $3.48 BILLION OF GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AT GS BANK USA.

118

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION TO OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AS A RESULT OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THESE ASSETS, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE U.

S., EUROPE AND ASIA, INCLUDE OTHER GOVERNMENT BONDS,

HIGH-GRADE

MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND MARGINABLE

EQUITIES. WE DO NOT INCLUDE THESE SECURITIES IN OUR GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS.

WE MAINTAIN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS

IN AN AMOUNT THAT, IF PLEDGED OR SOLD, WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDS

NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST 110% OF OUR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS

THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE (OR WHERE HOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION

TO REDEEM) WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ASSUME

CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES THAT ARE BASED ON

STRESS-SCENARIO

BORROWING CAPACITY AND WE REGULARLY REVIEW THESE ASSUMPTIONS

ASSET CLASS BY ASSET CLASS. THE ESTIMATED AGGREGATE LOAN VALUE

OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS, AS WELL AS OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS,

AND OUR OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AVERAGED $163.41 BILLION

AND $156.74 BILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS

MARKED-TO-MARKET

DAILY. WE UTILIZE AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO OUR BUSINESSES TO HOLD

INVENTORY OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

LIMITS PROVIDE A COMPLEMENTARY MECHANISM FOR ENSURING

APPROPRIATE BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY IN ADDITION TO OUR STANDARD

POSITION LIMITS. ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES DUE TO

CLIENT ACTIVITY, MARKET CONVENTIONS AND PERIODIC MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND

ADJUSTED ASSETS AT FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATES ARE TYPICALLY NOT

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR REPORTING

PERIODS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THE MATURITY PROFILE OF OUR SECURED AND

UNSECURED FUNDING BASE SUCH THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE

OUR ASSETS PRIOR TO OUR LIABILITIES COMING DUE, EVEN IN TIMES OF

PROLONGED OR SEVERE LIQUIDITY STRESS. WE DO NOT RELY ON

IMMEDIATE SALES OF ASSETS (OTHER THAN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS) TO

MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY IN A DISTRESSED ENVIRONMENT, ALTHOUGH WE

RECOGNIZE ORDERLY ASSET SALES MAY BE PRUDENT OR NECESSARY IN A

SEVERE OR PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES, OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE

THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL CAPITAL (UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) TO FUND OUR

BALANCE SHEET FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE TARGET AMOUNT OF OUR

TOTAL CAPITAL IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, WHICH

INCORPORATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING

LONG-TERM

FINANCING REQUIREMENTS.



THE PORTION OF TRADING ASSETS THAT WE BELIEVE COULD NOT BE

FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, ASSUMING

CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES;



GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS;



DERIVATIVE AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS;



ANTICIPATED DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS; AND



CAPITAL OR OTHER FORMS OF FINANCING IN OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF THEIR

LONG-TERM

FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. SEE

 CONSERVATIVE

LIABILITY STRUCTURE BELOW FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW

WE FUND OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO FUND ON A

SFAS NO. 140. WE DISTRIBUTED TO INVESTORS THE

SECURITIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES AND

THEREFORE DID NOT BEAR ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO THE UNDERLYING

MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS.

A LARGE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS ARE FUNDED THROUGH SECURED

FUNDING MARKETS OR NONRECOURSE FINANCING. WE FOCUS ON FUNDING

THESE ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS WITH LONG CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES

TO REDUCE REFINANCING RISK IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS.

CONSERVATIVE

LIABILITY STRUCTURE

WE SEEK TO STRUCTURE OUR LIABILITIES CONSERVATIVELY TO REDUCE

REFINANCING RISK AND THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDEEM

OR REPURCHASE CERTAIN OF OUR BORROWINGS PRIOR TO THEIR

CONTRACTUAL MATURITY.

WE FUND A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR INVENTORY ON A SECURED

BASIS, WHICH WE BELIEVE PROVIDES GOLDMAN SACHS WITH A MORE

STABLE SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY THAN UNSECURED FINANCING, AS IT IS

LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT DUE TO THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE TERMS OR AVAILABILITY

OF SECURED FUNDING, PARTICULARLY OVERNIGHT FUNDING, CAN

DETERIORATE RAPIDLY IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT. TO HELP MITIGATE

THIS RISK, WE RAISE THE MAJORITY OF OUR FUNDING FOR DURATIONS

LONGER THAN OVERNIGHT. WE SEEK LONGER TERMS FOR SECURED FUNDING

COLLATERALIZED BY LOWER-QUALITY ASSETS, AS WE BELIEVE THESE

FUNDING TRANSACTIONS MAY POSE GREATER REFINANCING RISK. THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF OUR SECURED FUNDING, EXCLUDING FUNDING

COLLATERALIZED BY HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES, SUCH AS U.S.,

FRENCH, GERMAN, UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS,

AND U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES, EXCEEDED 100 DAYS AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008.

OUR LIQUIDITY ALSO DEPENDS TO AN IMPORTANT DEGREE ON THE

STABILITY OF OUR

SHORT-TERM

UNSECURED FINANCING BASE. ACCORDINGLY, WE PREFER THE USE OF

PROMISSORY NOTES (IN WHICH GOLDMAN SACHS DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET)

OVER COMMERCIAL PAPER, WHICH WE MAY REPURCHASE PRIOR TO MATURITY

THROUGH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A MARKET MAKER. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, OUR UNSECURED

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION OF UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR OBLIGATIONS WITH

SHORT-TERM

FLOATING INTEREST RATES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

WE ISSUE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT WITHOUT

PROVISIONS THAT WOULD, BASED SOLELY UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN

OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR

STOCK PRICE, TRIGGER A REQUIREMENT FOR AN EARLY PAYMENT,

COLLATERAL SUPPORT, CHANGE IN TERMS, ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OR

THE CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

LENDERS, PENSION FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND

INDIVIDUALS. WE ACCESS FUNDING IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS IN THE

AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL

GUIDELINES ON CREDITOR CONCENTRATION, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND PROMISSORY NOTES THAT CAN BE OWNED AND

LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT CAN BE ISSUED BY ANY SINGLE CREDITOR OR

GROUP OF CREDITORS.

IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2008, WE WERE UNABLE TO RAISE SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS, OTHER

THAN AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY THE

FDIC UNDER THE TLGP. IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN WE WILL REGAIN ACCESS TO

THE PUBLIC LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS ON CUSTOMARY TERMS

OR WHETHER ANY SIMILAR PROGRAM WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE

TLGPS SCHEDULED JUNE 2009 EXPIRATION. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE

TO HAVE ACCESS TO SHORT-TERM FUNDING AND TO A NUMBER OF SOURCES

OF SECURED FUNDING, BOTH IN THE PRIVATE MARKETS AND THROUGH

VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANK SPONSORED INITIATIVES.

OVER THE PAST YEAR, A NUMBER OF U.S. REGULATORY AGENCIES

HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ENHANCE THE LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AVAILABLE TO

FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES SUCH AS GROUP INC., GS&CO.,

GSI AND GS BANK USA. SOME OF THESE STEPS INCLUDE.



THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK ESTABLISHED THE PRIMARY

DEALER CREDIT FACILITY IN MARCH 2008 TO PROVIDE OVERNIGHT

FUNDING TO PRIMARY DEALERS IN EXCHANGE FOR A SPECIFIED RANGE OF

COLLATERAL. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL WAS

EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL COLLATERAL ELIGIBLE IN TRI-PARTY

REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE MAJOR CLEARING BANKS, AND THE

FACILITY WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO GSI. THIS FACILITY IS SCHEDULED

TO EXPIRE ON APRIL 30, 2009.



THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INTRODUCED A NEW TERM SECURITIES

LENDING FACILITY (TSLF) IN MARCH 2008, WHICH EXTENDED THE

TERM FOR WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WILL LEND TREASURY

SECURITIES TO PRIMARY DEALERS FROM OVERNIGHT TO 28 DAYS

AND, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, EXPANDED THE TYPES OF ASSETS THAT

CAN BE USED AS COLLATERAL UNDER THE TSLF TO INCLUDE ALL

INVESTMENT-GRADE

DEBT SECURITIES (RATHER THAN JUST TREASURY, AGENCY AND CERTAIN

AAA-RATED ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES). THIS FACILITY IS SCHEDULED

TO EXPIRE ON APRIL 30, 2009.



IN OCTOBER 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ESTABLISHED THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY (CPFF) TO SERVE AS A FUNDING

BACKSTOP TO FACILITATE THE ISSUANCE OF TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER BY

ELIGIBLE ISSUERS. THROUGH THE CPFF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF

NEW YORK WILL FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF UNSECURED AND

ASSET-BACKED

HIGHLY RATED,

U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED,

THREE-MONTH

COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM ELIGIBLE ISSUERS THROUGH ITS PRIMARY

DEALERS. THE FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON

IS APPROXIMATELY $11 BILLION, OF WHICH A DE MINIMIS AMOUNT

WAS UTILIZED AS OF JANUARY 22, 2009.

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FOR A DISCUSSION OF FACTORS THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO

ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP

INC. THE PARENT COMPANY THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET

FINANCING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT

COMPANY PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY

CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF

THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING INCLUDE ENHANCED CONTROL AND

GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IS ALSO RAISED AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL

THROUGH SECURED FUNDING AND DEPOSITS.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ARE PREDICATED ON AN

ASSUMPTION THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR, FUNDS OR

SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE FROM A SUBSIDIARY TO ITS

PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR LIMIT THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD

IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. AS SUCH, WE ASSUME THAT

CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES UNTIL THE MATURITY OF SUCH FINANCING. IN ADDITION,

WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE GLOBAL CORE EXCESS HELD IN OUR REGULATED

ENTITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES AND THEREFORE MAY ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO MEET THE

POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE ENTITIES.

WE ALSO MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY RISK BY REQUIRING SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR

SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE

PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES

OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN

ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS

THIRD-PARTY

BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

MAINTAIN UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TO COVER THEIR UNSECURED

INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN SUBORDINATED DEBT) IN ORDER

TO MITIGATE PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY RISK.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES; FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF NOVEMBER 2008,

GROUP INC. HAD $26.01 BILLION OF SUCH EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GS&CO., ITS PRINCIPAL

U.S. REGISTERED

BROKER-DEALER;

$22.06 BILLION INVESTED IN GSI, A REGULATED U.K.

BROKER-DEALER;

$2.48 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS

EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P., A U.S. REGISTERED

BROKER-DEALER;

$3.79 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD., A

REGULATED JAPANESE

BROKER-DEALER;

AND $17.32 BILLION INVESTED IN GS BANK USA, A REGULATED NEW

YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK. GROUP INC. ALSO HAD

$62.81 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS TO THESE ENTITIES AS

OF NOVEMBER 2008, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL

INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRISIS

PLANNING

IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR A LIQUIDITY EVENT, OR A PERIOD OF

MARKET STRESS, WE BASE OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

AND OUR RESULTING FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY POLICIES ON CONSERVATIVE

STRESS-SCENARIO

ASSUMPTIONS. OUR PLANNING INCORPORATES SEVERAL

MARKET-BASED

AND OPERATIONAL STRESS SCENARIOS. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY CONDUCT

LIQUIDITY CRISIS DRILLS TO TEST OUR LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND

BACKUP FUNDING PROCEDURES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS PLAN THAT SPECIFIES

AN APPROACH FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A

LIQUIDITY-THREATENING EVENT. THE PLAN PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK TO

ESTIMATE THE LIKELY IMPACT OF A LIQUIDITY EVENT ON GOLDMAN SACHS

BASED ON SOME OF THE RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE AND OUTLINES WHICH

AND TO WHAT EXTENT LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE

IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT.

CREDIT

RATINGS

WE RELY UPON THE

SHORT-TERM

AND

LONG-TERM

DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

DAY-TO-DAY

OPERATIONS. THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING IS

INFLUENCED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT

WHEN WE ARE COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND WHEN WE SEEK TO

ENGAGE IN LONGER-TERM TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES.

WE BELIEVE OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT

RATING AGENCIES ASSESSMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET,

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THE LEVEL AND

VARIABILITY OF OUR EARNINGS, OUR CAPITAL BASE, OUR FRANCHISE,

REPUTATION AND MANAGEMENT, OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE

CASH

FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX

AND INTERRELATED AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS

AND NET ASSETS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN EVALUATING OUR

LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY,

HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESS.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2008.

OUR CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $5.46 BILLION TO

$15.74 BILLION AT THE END OF 2008. WE RAISED

$9.80 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM OPERATING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FROM COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK ISSUANCES

OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES.

OPERATIONAL

RISK

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR

SYSTEMS, OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN ARISE

FROM MANY FACTORS RANGING FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS TO

POTENTIALLY COSTLY INCIDENTS RELATED TO, FOR EXAMPLE, MAJOR

SYSTEMS FAILURES. OPERATIONAL RISK MAY ALSO CAUSE REPUTATIONAL

HARM. THUS, EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY, MANAGE AND MITIGATE OPERATIONAL

RISK MUST BE EQUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE RISK OF REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AS WELL AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS.

WE MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF

LONG-STANDING,

BUT CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING, FIRMWIDE CONTROL STANDARDS WHICH ARE

SUPPORTED BY THE TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

PEOPLE; THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND COMMITMENT OF SENIOR

MANAGEMENT IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING

KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS ACROSS GOLDMAN SACHS; AND A FRAMEWORK OF

STRONG AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL DEPARTMENTS THAT MONITOR

OPERATIONAL RISK ON A DAILY BASIS. TOGETHER, THESE ELEMENTS FORM

A STRONG FIRMWIDE CONTROL CULTURE THAT SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION

OF OUR EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT & ANALYSIS, A RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS,

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A FORMALIZED

FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, AND REPORT OPERATIONAL

RISKS TO SUPPORT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT ACROSS GOLDMAN SACHS.

THIS FRAMEWORK, WHICH EVOLVES WITH THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR

BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE, INCORPORATES ANALYSIS OF

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS, BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL FACTORS, AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS.

THE FRAMEWORK ALSO PROVIDES REGULAR REPORTING OF OUR OPERATIONAL

RISK EXPOSURES TO OUR BOARD, RISK COMMITTEES AND SENIOR

MANAGEMENT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONAL RISK SEE

ENTIRE TARGET COMPANY HAD BEEN ACQUIRED. WE WILL APPLY THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 141(R) TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 26, 2008. ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 141(R) WILL NOT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, BUT MAY HAVE AN

EFFECT ON ACCOUNTING FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

SFAS NO. 160.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AN

AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51. SFAS NO. 160

REQUIRES THAT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

HELD BY PARTIES OTHER THAN THE PARENT (NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS)

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND PRESENTED AS EQUITY, RATHER THAN AS A

LIABILITY OR MEZZANINE EQUITY. SFAS NO. 160 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2008, BUT THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT EXPECT

ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENT TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

FASB STAFF POSITION

NO. FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE

FASB ISSUED

FSP NO. FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8, DISCLOSURES BY PUBLIC ENTITIES

(ENTERPRISES) ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INTERESTS

IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

FSP NO. FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8 REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INTERESTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES. THE FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS

ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SINCE THE FSP REQUIRES

ONLY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES CONCERNING TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND INTERESTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ADOPTION OF

THE FSP WILL NOT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE SUPERVISION

OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.

AS OF THE END OF THE FIRMS 2008 FISCAL YEAR, MANAGEMENT

CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS

ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

NOVEMBER 28, 2008 WAS EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT,

IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS

AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE

FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

NOVEMBER 28, 2008 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON

PAGE 130, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 28, 2008.

129

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC..

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT NOVEMBER 28, 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 30, 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS

AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE FISCAL YEARS IN THE

PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 28, 2008 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 28, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING APPEARING ON PAGE 129. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED

ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2007 THE COMPANY ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND

SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (GROUP INC.), A DELAWARE

CORPORATION, IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND, TOGETHER WITH ITS



INVESTMENT BANKING.

THE FIRM PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE

OF INVESTMENT BANKING SERVICES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF

CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTMENT FUNDS,

GOVERNMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS.



TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM

FACILITATES CLIENT TRANSACTIONS WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF

CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTMENT FUNDS,

GOVERNMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS AND TAKES PROPRIETARY POSITIONS

THROUGH MARKET MAKING IN, TRADING OF AND INVESTING IN FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND

DERIVATIVES ON THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ENGAGES IN

MARKET-MAKING AND SPECIALIST ACTIVITIES ON EQUITIES AND OPTIONS

EXCHANGES, AND THE FIRM CLEARS CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR

STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. IN CONNECTION

WITH THE FIRMS MERCHANT BANKING AND OTHER INVESTING

NOTE 2.

SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

GROUP INC. AND ALL OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS

A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) OR A

QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITY (QSPE) UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.



VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES

ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT

RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS

ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE

THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES, THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE RESIDUAL

RETURNS AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE ENTITYS

ACTIVITIES. VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 51,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED. THE

USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN

ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. ACCORDINGLY,

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS A

MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST.



VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT

LACK ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST

ENTITY. A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE IS PRESENT

WHEN AN ENTERPRISE HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST, OR A COMBINATION OF

VARIABLE INTERESTS, THAT WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE

VIES EXPECTED LOSSES, RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VIES

EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. THE

136

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

ENTERPRISE WITH A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, KNOWN AS THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION

(FIN) 46-R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, THE

FIRM CONSOLIDATES VIES FOR WHICH IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A

VIE BY FIRST PERFORMING A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VIES

EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS. THIS ANALYSIS

INCLUDES A REVIEW OF, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE VIES

CAPITAL STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL TERMS, WHICH INTERESTS CREATE OR

ABSORB VARIABILITY, RELATED PARTY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DESIGN

OF THE VIE. WHERE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE

FIRM PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. FOR PURPOSES OF

ALLOCATING A VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL

RETURNS TO ITS VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, THE FIRM UTILIZES THE

TOP DOWN METHOD. UNDER THAT METHOD, THE FIRM

CALCULATES ITS SHARE OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND

EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS USING THE SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS THAT

WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO IT, BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

AND/OR

THE

FIRMS POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE VIE, UNDER

VARIOUS PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED SCENARIOS. THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS

INITIAL EVALUATION OF AN ENTITY AS A VIE AND ITS INITIAL

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE FIRM IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF

A VIE UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN RECONSIDERATION EVENTS AS

DEFINED IN

FIN 46-R.



QSPES.

QSPES ARE PASSIVE ENTITIES THAT ARE COMMONLY

USED IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 140,

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES, SETS FORTH THE

CRITERIA AN ENTITY MUST SATISFY TO BE A QSPE. THESE CRITERIA

INCLUDE THE TYPES OF ASSETS A QSPE MAY HOLD, LIMITS ON ASSET

SALES, THE USE OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, AND THE

LEVEL OF DISCRETION A SERVICER MAY EXERCISE IN ATTEMPTING TO

COLLECT RECEIVABLES. THESE CRITERIA MAY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT COMPLEX MATTERS, SUCH AS WHETHER A

DERIVATIVE IS CONSIDERED PASSIVE AND THE LEVEL OF DISCRETION A

SERVICER MAY EXERCISE, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, DETERMINING WHEN

DEFAULT IS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 140 AND

FIN 46-R,

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE QSPES.



EQUITY-METHOD

INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT EXERTS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE

OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES

(GENERALLY DEFINED AS OWNING A VOTING INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%)

AND HAS AN INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OR

IN-SUBSTANCE

COMMON STOCK, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT EITHER IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION (APB)

NO. 18, THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES. IN GENERAL,

THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 159 AT FAIR VALUE. IN CERTAIN CASES,

THE FIRM MAY APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO NEW

INVESTMENTS THAT ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR CLOSELY RELATED TO

THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHERE THE FIRM

HAS A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH FLOWS OR

OPERATIONS OF THE INVESTEE, OR WHERE

COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT. SEE

 REVENUE

LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

FIRMS APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 159.



OTHER.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY OR

APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ALSO HAS FORMED NUMEROUS

NONCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH

THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS THAT ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.

THE FIRM ACTS AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR THESE FUNDS AND GENERALLY

DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THESE

FUNDS. THE FIRM HAS GENERALLY PROVIDED THE

THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS WITH RIGHTS TO TERMINATE THE FUNDS OR TO REMOVE THE

FIRM AS THE GENERAL PARTNER. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE THESE FUNDS. THESE FUND INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN

TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT

REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL

LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND OTHER ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN

UPON BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE

FIRM COULD NO LONGER APPLY SPECIALIZED

BROKER-DEALER

INDUSTRY ACCOUNTING TO THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT REGULATED AS

BROKER-DEALERS.

THEREFORE, WITHIN THE FIRMS

NON-BROKER-DEALER

SUBSIDIARIES, THE FIRM DESIGNATED AS HELD FOR TRADING THOSE

INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 115 (I.E.,

DEBT SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES), AND ELECTED

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR OTHER CASH INSTRUMENTS (SPECIFICALLY

LOANS, LOAN COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY AND

RESTRICTED PUBLIC EQUITY SECURITIES) WHICH THE FIRM HISTORICALLY

HAD CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS WERE IN

ADDITION TO PREVIOUS ELECTIONS MADE FOR CERTAIN CORPORATE LOANS,

LOAN COMMITMENTS AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT ISSUED BY GOLDMAN

SACHS BANK USA (GS BANK USA). THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS

FROM THESE INITIAL ELECTIONS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE INSTRUMENTS

WERE ALREADY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS, AT

FAIR VALUE OR TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR

VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION PRIOR TO GROUP INC. BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR

IN ADDITION TO TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR

VALUE AND TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR VALUE,

THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OTHER

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE UNDER

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR ELECTING THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION ARE TO REFLECT ECONOMIC EVENTS IN EARNINGS ON A

TIMELY BASIS, TO MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING

DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES AND TO ADDRESS SIMPLIFICATION

AND

COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AT

IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED AFTER THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 159 WHERE THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO

SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE

(THE EXIT PRICE). FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2007.

SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY THAT

PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE

FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS

OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST

PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). THE

THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY UNDER

SFAS NO. 157 ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

BASIS OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT

LEVEL 1

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2

QUOTED PRICES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE OR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE

OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY;

LEVEL 3

PRICES OR VALUATIONS THAT REQUIRE INPUTS THAT ARE BOTH

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND UNOBSERVABLE.

139

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BASED ON

THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME BOTH IN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND

RELATIVE TO THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION FOR THE INSTRUMENT. THE

FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS BASED ON BOTH

THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS WITH

TRADING ACTIVITY.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, BOTH THE FASB AND THE STAFF

OF THE SEC RE-EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUND FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT IN FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE

FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION

NO. FAS 157-3,

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE

MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE. THIS STATEMENT

CLARIFIES THAT DETERMINING FAIR VALUE IN AN INACTIVE OR

DISLOCATED MARKET DEPENDS ON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. THIS STATEMENT

SPECIFIES THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO USE INPUTS BASED ON

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS, OR FOR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ADJUSTMENTS TO OBSERVABLE INPUTS TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE WHEN

MARKETS ARE NOT ACTIVE AND RELEVANT OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE NOT

AVAILABLE. THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT POLICIES ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE IN

FSP NO. FAS 157-3.

CREDIT RISK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF FAIR VALUE. CASH

PRODUCTS (E.G., BONDS AND LOANS) AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

(PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT FUTURE PROJECTED CASH

FLOWS) TRADE IN THE MARKET AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT CREDIT

CONSIDERATIONS. THE FIRM CALCULATES THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE

ASSETS BY DISCOUNTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT A RATE WHICH

INCORPORATES COUNTERPARTY CREDIT SPREADS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES BY DISCOUNTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT A

RATE WHICH INCORPORATES THE FIRMS OWN CREDIT SPREADS. IN

DOING SO, CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT MITIGANTS,

NAMELY COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS WHICH REDUCE EXPOSURES BASED ON

TRIGGERS AND CONTRACTUAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM MANAGES

ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK AS IT DOES OTHER MARKET RISKS AND

WILL PRICE, ECONOMICALLY HEDGE, FACILITATE AND INTERMEDIATE

TRADES WHICH INVOLVE CREDIT RISK. THE FIRM RECORDS LIQUIDITY

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING

CONCENTRATED RISK POSITIONS, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO THE

FIRMS OWN CREDIT SPREADS.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM SEPARATES ITS TRADING

ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE AND ITS TRADING LIABILITIES,

AT FAIR VALUE INTO TWO CATEGORIES: CASH INSTRUMENTS AND

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.



CASH INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRMS CASH INSTRUMENTS

ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BECAUSE THEY ARE VALUED USING QUOTED

MARKET PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDE MOST U.S. GOVERNMENT AND SOVEREIGN

OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVE LISTED EQUITIES AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET

SECURITIES. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 157, THE FIRM DOES NOT ADJUST THE QUOTED

PRICE FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS, EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE FIRM

HOLDS A LARGE POSITION AND A SALE COULD REASONABLY IMPACT THE

QUOTED PRICE.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS THAT TRADE IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE, BUT ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING

SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY INCLUDE

MOST GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES,

INVESTMENT-GRADE

CORPORATE BONDS, CERTAIN MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, CERTAIN BANK LOANS

AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL

AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET SECURITIES

AND LOAN COMMITMENTS. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BECAUSE THEY TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND

THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUND INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN

BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS (INCLUDING

140

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CERTAIN MEZZANINE FINANCING, LEVERAGED LOANS ARISING FROM

CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER CORPORATE BANK DEBT), LESS

LIQUID CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS

(INCLUDING LESS LIQUID

HIGH-YIELD

CORPORATE BONDS, DISTRESSED DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED

DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS) BACKED BY CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS), LESS

LIQUID MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND SECURITIES (BACKED BY EITHER

COMMERCIAL OR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE), AND ACQUIRED PORTFOLIOS

OF DISTRESSED LOANS. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING

MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED

SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION

PRICE. THIS VALUATION IS ADJUSTED ONLY WHEN CHANGES TO INPUTS

AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS

TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED OR PENDING

THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OR COMPARABLE

ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN

THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL

RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS OR ARE

SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT ILLIQUIDITY

AND/OR

NON-TRANSFERABILITY.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET

EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008 (CHARACTERIZED BY DISLOCATIONS BETWEEN ASSET CLASSES,

ELEVATED LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, AND REDUCED PRICE TRANSPARENCY),

HAVE INCREASED THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT REQUIRED TO

VALUE CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. IN PARTICULAR, MANAGEMENTS

JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE

RISK-ADJUSTED

DISCOUNT RATE FOR CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS WITH LITTLE OR NO

PRICE TRANSPARENCY AS A RESULT OF DECREASED VOLUMES AND LOWER

LEVELS OF TRADING ACTIVITY. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE FIRMS

VALUATION IS ADJUSTED TO APPROXIMATE RATES WHICH MARKET

PARTICIPANTS WOULD LIKELY CONSIDER APPROPRIATE FOR RELEVANT

CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISKS.



DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CAN BE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

OR

OVER-THE-COUNTER

(OTC).

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES TYPICALLY FALL WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2

OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY ARE DEEMED

TO BE ACTIVELY TRADED OR NOT. THE FIRM GENERALLY VALUES

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES USING MODELS WHICH CALIBRATE TO

MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS AND ELIMINATE TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CLOSING

PRICE OF THE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES AND THEIR UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS. IN SUCH CASES,

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY.

OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

MARKET EVIDENCE WHENEVER POSSIBLE, INCLUDING

MARKET-BASED

INPUTS TO MODELS, MODEL CALIBRATION TO

MARKET-CLEARING

TRANSACTIONS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

WHERE MODELS ARE USED, THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO

VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF,

AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. THE FIRM

GENERALLY USES SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, INCLUDING

CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES,

MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF

SUCH INPUTS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS,

SUCH AS GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL INPUTS CAN

GENERALLY BE VERIFIED AND MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE

SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. OTC DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHEN ALL OF THE

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS CAN BE CORROBORATED TO MARKET EVIDENCE.

CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WITH

LIMITED PRICING INFORMATION, AND THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

FOR THESE DERIVATIVES IS INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT. SUCH

INSTRUMENTS

ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

WHERE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE CORROBORATING MARKET EVIDENCE TO

SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS AND CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING

MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED

SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION

PRICE. THE VALUATIONS OF THESE LESS LIQUID OTC DERIVATIVES ARE

TYPICALLY BASED ON LEVEL 1

AND/OR

LEVEL 2 INPUTS THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE MARKET, AS WELL

AS UNOBSERVABLE LEVEL 3 INPUTS. SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL

RECOGNITION, THE FIRM UPDATES THE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2

INPUTS TO REFLECT OBSERVABLE MARKET CHANGES, WITH RESULTING

GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED WITHIN LEVEL 3. LEVEL 3

INPUTS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS

SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THIRD-PARTY

PRICING SERVICES

AND/OR

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL VALUE TO

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION

MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE.

WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED FOR VARIOUS FACTORS

SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET

EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND PRESENTED AS EQUITY, RATHER THAN AS A

LIABILITY OR MEZZANINE EQUITY. SFAS NO. 160 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2008, BUT THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE FIRM DOES

NOT EXPECT ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENT TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

FASB STAFF POSITION

NO. FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB

ISSUED

FSP NO. FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8, DISCLOSURES BY PUBLIC ENTITIES

(ENTERPRISES) ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INTERESTS

IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

FSP NO. FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8 REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INTERESTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES. THE FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS

ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SINCE THE FSP REQUIRES

ONLY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES CONCERNING TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND INTERESTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ADOPTION OF

THE FSP WILL NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

EITF ISSUE

NO. 07-5.

IN

JUNE 2008, THE EITF REACHED CONSENSUS ON ISSUE

NO. 07-5,

DETERMINING WHETHER AN INSTRUMENT (OR EMBEDDED FEATURE) IS

INDEXED TO AN ENTITYS OWN STOCK. EITF ISSUE

NO. 07-5

PROVIDES GUIDANCE ABOUT WHETHER AN INSTRUMENT (SUCH AS THE

FIRMS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK WARRANTS) SHOULD BE

CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY AND NOT MARKED TO MARKET FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES. EITF ISSUE

NO. 07-5

IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE FIRM REALIZES GAINS OR LOSSES RELATING

TO CHANGES IN CREDIT RISK ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THROUGH

CHANGES IN CREDIT MITIGANTS OR THE SALE OR UNWIND OF THE

CONTRACTS. THE NET GAIN/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF

CHANGES IN CREDIT EXPOSURE AND CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVE

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE NET GAINS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE FIRMS OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON

UNSECURED BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS

LOANS AND LOAN

COMMITMENTS

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, THE AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF LOANS AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES FOR WHICH THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED EXCEEDED THE RELATED FAIR VALUE BY

$50.21 BILLION, INCLUDING A DIFFERENCE OF

$37.46 BILLION RELATED TO LOANS WITH AN AGGREGATE FAIR

VALUE OF $3.77 BILLION THAT WERE ON NONACCRUAL STATUS

(INCLUDING LOANS MORE THAN 90 DAYS PAST DUE). THE AGGREGATE

CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL EXCEEDS THE RELATED FAIR VALUE PRIMARILY

BECAUSE THE FIRM REGULARLY PURCHASES LOANS, SUCH AS DISTRESSED

LOANS, AT VALUES SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL

AMOUNTS.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF UNFUNDED LENDING

COMMITMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS A

LIABILITY OF $3.52 BILLION AND THE RELATED TOTAL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE LENDING COMMITMENTS WAS

$39.49 BILLION.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2007, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS

LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS WERE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPECIALIZED INDUSTRY ACCOUNTING FOR

BROKER-DEALERS, AND NOT PURSUANT TO THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. AS A

RESULT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE AND

RELATED CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF LOANS AND LONG-TERM

RECEIVABLES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS NOT

MATERIAL AS OF NOVEMBER 2007. SEE NOTE 2 FOR FURTHER

CREDIT

CONCENTRATIONS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS MAY ARISE FROM TRADING, INVESTING,

UNDERWRITING AND SECURITIES BORROWING ACTIVITIES AND MAY BE

IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL FACTORS.

THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK BY ACTIVELY MONITORING

EXPOSURES AND OBTAINING COLLATERAL AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. WHILE

THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES EXPOSE IT TO MANY DIFFERENT

INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES A

HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS,

RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO

THIS INDUSTRY. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM MAY

ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A

PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER OR ISSUER.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, THE FIRM HELD

$53.98 BILLION (6% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND $45.75 BILLION

(4% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AT

FAIR VALUE AND CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR

REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 2007, THE FIRM HELD $21.13 BILLION (2% OF

TOTAL ASSETS) AND $31.65 BILLION (3% OF TOTAL ASSETS),

RESPECTIVELY, OF OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS, PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTING OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF JAPAN AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN ADDITION, AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 2007, $126.27 BILLION AND

$144.92 BILLION OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES PURCHASED

UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED (INCLUDING

THOSE IN CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND

OTHER PURPOSES), RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLATERALIZED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, $65.37 BILLION

AND $41.26 BILLION OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES PURCHASED

UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLATERALIZED BY OTHER SOVEREIGN

OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007,

THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY

THAT EXCEEDED 2% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS.

DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES MAY INVOLVE FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR COMMODITIES, OR TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY OR

INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE

SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED

RATES, SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS

MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY OBLIGATIONS, AND

INDEXED DEBT INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES EVEN

THOUGH THEIR VALUES OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED CASH FLOWS ARE

DERIVED FROM THE PRICE OF SOME OTHER SECURITY OR INDEX. HOWEVER,

CERTAIN COMMODITY-RELATED CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURE, AS THESE CONTRACTS MAY BE

SETTLED IN CASH OR THE ASSETS TO BE DELIVERED UNDER THE CONTRACT

ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS AND AS A

MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. RISK EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED THROUGH

DIVERSIFICATION, BY CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND BY ENTERING

INTO OFFSETTING POSITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAY MANAGE THE

RISK RELATED TO A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCK BY ENTERING INTO AN

OFFSETTING POSITION IN A RELATED

EQUITY-INDEX

FUTURES CONTRACT.

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS NO. 133

TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FIRM USES THESE DERIVATIVES

TO MANAGE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURES,

INCLUDING THE FIRMS NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM DESIGNATES CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS HEDGE CHANGES

IN THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST

THE FIRM APPLIES A

LONG-HAUL

METHOD TO ALL OF ITS HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS TO PERFORM

AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE

RELATIONSHIPS IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR

OFFSETTING CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE

FIRM UTILIZES A

DOLLAR-OFFSET

METHOD, WHICH COMPARES THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGING INSTRUMENT TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEM, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME, TO

PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS.

THE FIRMS PROSPECTIVE

DOLLAR-OFFSET

ASSESSMENT UTILIZES SCENARIO ANALYSES TO TEST HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS VIA SIMULATIONS OF NUMEROUS PARALLEL AND SLOPE

SHIFTS OF THE RELEVANT YIELD CURVE. PARALLEL SHIFTS CHANGE THE

INTEREST RATE OF ALL MATURITIES BY IDENTICAL AMOUNTS. SLOPE

SHIFTS CHANGE THE CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE. FOR BOTH THE

PROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, IN RESPONSE TO EACH OF THE SIMULATED

YIELD CURVE SHIFTS, AND THE RETROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, A HEDGING

RELATIONSHIP IS DEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM CHANGE INVERSELY WITHIN A

RANGE OF 80% TO 125%.

FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED

IS REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AND IS

SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER ITS REMAINING

LIFE. GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS FOR ALL

HEDGES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.

THESE GAINS OR LOSSES AND THE COMPONENT OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS (E.G., THE EFFECT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME ON

FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE FIRMS BORROWINGS) WERE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS

ENDED NOVEMBER 2008, NOVEMBER 2007 AND

NOVEMBER 2006. GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES USED FOR

TRADING PURPOSES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IS

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO THE OFFSETTING

BENEFIT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE HELD TO MITIGATE

RISKS INHERENT IN THESE RETAINED INTERESTS. CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE BASED ON AN ADVERSE VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY

CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN

ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS NOT USUALLY LINEAR.

IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION

IS CALCULATED INDEPENDENTLY OF CHANGES IN ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION.

IN PRACTICE, SIMULTANEOUS CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT MAGNIFY

OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES DISCLOSED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO THE RETAINED INTERESTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM

ALSO HELD INTERESTS IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE QSPES PURCHASED IN

CONNECTION WITH SECONDARY

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES. THESE PURCHASED INTERESTS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$4 BILLION AND $6 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, THE FIRM HELD

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $147 MILLION

AND $93 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SERVICING ASSETS

REPRESENT THE FIRMS RIGHT TO RECEIVE A FUTURE STREAM OF

CASH FLOWS, SUCH AS SERVICING FEES, IN EXCESS OF THE FIRMS

OBLIGATION TO SERVICE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. THE FAIR VALUE OF

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS WILL FLUCTUATE IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES

IN CERTAIN ECONOMIC VARIABLES, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES AND LOAN

PREPAYMENT RATES. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MORTGAGE

SERVICING RIGHTS BY USING VALUATION MODELS THAT INCORPORATE

THESE VARIABLES IN QUANTIFYING ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS RELATED TO

SERVICING ACTIVITIES. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ARE INCLUDED IN

TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

WITH THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED

ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH

PROCEEDINGS, IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY BE

MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH

PERIOD. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME

OF THE FIRMS LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR FINES ARE SOUGHT, THE FIRM CANNOT

ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS

(1)

SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE

ANTICIPATED LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE CONTRACTS.

(2)

BECAUSE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED THE

BEST INDICATION OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK FOR INDIVIDUAL

CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE CARRYING VALUE EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF A

LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF THAT MAY EXIST UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE

NETTING AGREEMENT AND THE EFFECT OF NETTING OF CASH PAID

PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS. THESE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS ARE RISK MANAGED TOGETHER WITH DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45 AND,

THEREFORE, THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT REFLECT THE FIRMS OVERALL

RISK RELATED TO ITS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.

(3)

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE LENDERS IN

CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS WAS

$19.95 BILLION AND $27.49 BILLION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE

THE CONTRACTUAL NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES THE FIRM

TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE THAT EXCEEDS THE VALUE

OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER, THERE IS MINIMAL

PERFORMANCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES.

(4)

INCLUDES CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT

MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE AS OF NOVEMBER 2007.

(5)

EXCLUDES CASH COLLATERAL OF

$2.05 BILLION RELATED TO THIS OBLIGATION.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED TRUSTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL

I, II AND III, AND OTHER ENTITIES FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF

ISSUING SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, LENDING THE PROCEEDS TO THE

FIRM AND ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FIRM

AND THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO THIS PURPOSE. SEE NOTE 7 FOR

INFORMATION REGARDING THE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING GOLDMAN SACHS

CAPITAL I, II AND III. THE FIRM EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES FOR THE

FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY

THESE ENTITIES, WHICH ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES. TIMELY PAYMENT BY THE FIRM OF AMOUNTS DUE TO THESE

ENTITIES UNDER THE BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER PAYMENTS

DUE ON THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WILL OCCUR,

SUCH AS NONPERFORMANCE ON THE PART OF PAYING AGENTS OR OTHER

SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR THE FIRM TO

MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED

GUARANTEES CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS CLEARING AND

CUSTODY AGENTS, TRUSTEES AND ADMINISTRATORS, AGAINST SPECIFIED

POTENTIAL LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACTING AS AN AGENT OF,

OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO, THE FIRM OR ITS AFFILIATES. THE FIRM

ALSO INDEMNIFIES SOME CLIENTS AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES INCURRED

IN THE EVENT SPECIFIED

THIRD-PARTY

SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING

SUB-CUSTODIANS

AND

THIRD-PARTY

BROKERS, IMPROPERLY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

IS A MEMBER OF PAYMENT, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT NETWORKS AS WELL

AS SECURITIES EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD THAT MAY REQUIRE THE

FIRM TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF SUCH NETWORKS AND EXCHANGES IN

THE EVENT OF MEMBER DEFAULTS. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PRIME

BROKERAGE AND CLEARING BUSINESSES, THE FIRM AGREES TO CLEAR AND

SETTLE ON BEHALF OF ITS CLIENTS THE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY

THEM WITH OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS. THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS IN

RESPECT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE SECURED BY THE ASSETS IN THE

CLIENTS ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ANY PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE

TRANSACTIONS CLEARED AND SETTLED BY THE FIRM ON BEHALF OF THE

CLIENT. IN CONNECTION WITH JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS, THE FIRM

MAY ISSUE LOAN GUARANTEES UNDER WHICH IT MAY BE LIABLE IN THE

EVENT OF FRAUD, MISAPPROPRIATION, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND

CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS INVOLVING THE BORROWER. THE FIRM IS UNABLE

TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL

PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO LIABILITIES RELATED TO

THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007.

THE FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TO

COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH A VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL

TRANSACTIONS AND OCCASIONALLY INDEMNIFIES THEM AGAINST POTENTIAL

LOSSES CAUSED BY THE BREACH OF THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS

PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN OR ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN

U.S. TAX LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH ORDINARY-COURSE

TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS SECURITIES ISSUANCES, BORROWINGS OR

DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS

TO SOME COUNTERPARTIES TO PROTECT THEM IN THE EVENT ADDITIONAL

TAXES ARE OWED OR PAYMENTS ARE WITHHELD, DUE EITHER TO A CHANGE

IN OR AN ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN

NON-U.S. TAX

LAWS. THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS GENERALLY ARE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL

TERMS AND ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

GENERALLY, THERE ARE NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN

THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND THE CONTINGENCIES TRIGGERING THE

OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR. THE FIRM IS

UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL

PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO LIABILITIES RELATED TO

THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 2007.

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.), GS BANK USA AND GS

BANK EUROPE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. IN

NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES WITH AN

AGGREGATE OF $117.16 BILLION OF ASSETS INTO GS BANK USA

(WHICH BROUGHT TOTAL ASSETS IN GS BANK USA TO

$145.06 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008) AND GROUP INC. AGREED

TO GUARANTEE CERTAIN LOSSES, INCLUDING

CREDIT-RELATED

LOSSES, RELATING TO ASSETS HELD BY THE CONTRIBUTED ENTITIES. IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE, GROUP INC. ALSO AGREED TO PLEDGE

TO GS BANK USA CERTAIN COLLATERAL, INCLUDING INTERESTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.

GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES ON A

TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION

BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. GROUP INC. IS UNABLE

TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER ITS

OBLIGATIONS ARE ALSO OBLIGATIONS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

INCLUDED IN THE TABLES ABOVE, GROUP INC.S LIABILITIES AS

$3.86 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE WARRANT IS EXERCISABLE AT

ANY TIME UNTIL OCTOBER 1, 2013 AND THE NUMBER OF

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE WARRANT AND THE EXERCISE

PRICE ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN DILUTIVE EVENTS.

IN OCTOBER 2008, UNDER THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE

TREASURYS (U.S. TREASURY) TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE

IN THE FIRMS FISCAL YEAR-END. SEE NOTE 21 FOR FURTHER

EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. THESE

PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE BENEFITS BASED ON YEARS OF CREDITED

SERVICE AND A PERCENTAGE OF THE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION. THE FIRM MAINTAINS A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

FOR MOST U.K. EMPLOYEES. AS OF APRIL 2008, THE U.K. DEFINED

BENEFIT PLAN WAS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS, BUT WILL CONTINUE

TO ACCRUE BENEFITS FOR EXISTING PARTICIPANTS.

THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO

NOVEMBER 1, 2003. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, THIS PLAN

WAS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS AND FROZEN SUCH THAT EXISTING

PARTICIPANTS WOULD NOT ACCRUE ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAINTAINS UNFUNDED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE FOR ELIGIBLE

RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS COVERED UNDER THESE PROGRAMS.

ON NOVEMBER 30, 2007, THE FIRM ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 158 WHICH REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE IN

ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION THE FUNDED STATUS OF ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, MEASURED AS

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS AND THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION. UPON ADOPTION, SFAS NO. 158

REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED

ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS, AND TRANSITION

OBLIGATIONS AND ASSETS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. ADDITIONAL MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITIES ARE DERECOGNIZED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW

STANDARD.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 158, THE FIRM

RECORDED INCREASES OF $59 MILLION AND $253 MILLION TO

GENERALLY, THE FIRM DETERMINED THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS BY REFERENCING INDICES FOR

LONG-TERM,

HIGH-QUALITY

BONDS AND ENSURING THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE DOES NOT EXCEED THE

YIELD REPORTED FOR THOSE INDICES AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR THE

DURATION OF THE PLANS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH IN DETERMINING THE

LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL

FINANCIAL MARKET RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE EXISTED OVER TIME WITH

THE PRESUMPTION THAT THIS TREND WILL GENERALLY REMAIN CONSTANT

IN THE FUTURE.

FOR MEASUREMENT PURPOSES, AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN THE PER

CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS OF 9.30% WAS ASSUMED

FOR THE YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2009. THE RATE WAS ASSUMED TO

DECREASE RATABLY TO 5.00% FOR THE YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2015

AND REMAIN AT THAT LEVEL THEREAFTER.

THE ASSUMED COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS AN EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS

REPORTED FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. A 1% CHANGE

IN THE ASSUMED HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE WOULD HAVE THE

FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

APPROACH, WHEREBY A MIX, WHICH IS BROADLY SIMILAR TO THE ACTUAL

ASSET ALLOCATION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, OF EQUITY SECURITIES,

DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS, IS TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE THE

LONG-TERM

INCENTIVE PLAN

THE FIRM SPONSORS A STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, THE GOLDMAN SACHS

AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (AMENDED SIP), WHICH

PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED

STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT

RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AWARDS WITH

PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS AND OTHER

SHARE-BASED

AWARDS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE AMENDED SIP WAS

APPROVED BY THE FIRMS SHAREHOLDERS, EFFECTIVE FOR GRANTS

AFTER APRIL 1, 2003.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED

UNDER THE AMENDED SIP THROUGH 2008 MAY NOT EXCEED

250 MILLION SHARES AND, IN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER, MAY NOT

EXCEED 5% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK,

DETERMINED AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING YEAR,

INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS IN

PREVIOUS YEARS BUT NOT COVERED BY AWARDS GRANTED IN SUCH YEARS.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007,

162.4 MILLION AND 160.6 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY,

WERE AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE AMENDED SIP.

OTHER

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

THE FIRM HAS MAINTAINED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES. IN GENERAL, UNDER THE PLANS, PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE

TO DEFER PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THEIR CASH YEAR-END

COMPENSATION. DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE

TO NOTIONALLY INVEST THEIR DEFERRALS IN CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES

AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLANS. GENERALLY, UNDER CURRENT TAX LAW,

PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX ON AMOUNTS DEFERRED

OR ON ANY NOTIONAL INVESTMENT EARNINGS UNTIL THE RETURNS ARE

DISTRIBUTED, AND THE FIRM IS NOT ENTITLED TO A CORRESPONDING TAX

DEDUCTION UNTIL THE AMOUNTS ARE DISTRIBUTED. BEGINNING WITH THE

2008 YEAR, THESE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS WERE FROZEN

WITH RESPECT TO NEW CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE PLANS WERE TERMINATED.

PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY WILL RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THEIR

BENEFITS IN 2009 EXCEPT THAT NO PAYMENTS WILL BE ACCELERATED FOR

CERTAIN SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR THE AMOUNTS DEFERRED UNDER THESE PLANS. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, $220 MILLION AND

$281 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE PLANS WAS

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE FIRM HAS A DISCOUNT STOCK PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH

PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS MAY BE PERMITTED TO ACQUIRE

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT AN EFFECTIVE 25% DISCOUNT (FOR

2008 YEAR-END COMPENSATION, THE PROGRAM WAS SUSPENDED, AND

NO INDIVIDUAL WAS PERMITTED TO ACQUIRE DISCOUNTED RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS THEREUNDER). IN PRIOR YEARS, THE 25% DISCOUNT WAS

EFFECTED BY AN ADDITIONAL GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS EQUAL

TO

ONE-THIRD

OF THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS PURCHASED BY QUALIFYING

PARTICIPANTS. THE PURCHASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE 100%

VESTED WHEN GRANTED, BUT THE SHARES UNDERLYING THEM GENERALLY

WERE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS (WHICH WERE WAIVED

IN DECEMBER 2008 EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN SENIOR EXECUTIVES). THE

SHARES UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT WERE GRANTED

TO EFFECT THE 25% DISCOUNT GENERALLY VEST IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS

ON THE SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE

AND WERE NOT TRANSFERABLE BEFORE THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE

GRANT DATE (TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON VESTED AWARDS WERE WAIVED

IN DECEMBER 2008 EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN SENIOR EXECUTIVES).

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS

RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE TOTAL VALUE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED FOR 2007 IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE

25% DISCOUNT WAS $66 MILLION.

REGULATION

ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2008, GROUP INC. BECAME A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF

1956. AS OF THAT DATE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BECAME THE

PRIMARY U.S. REGULATOR OF GROUP INC., AS A CONSOLIDATED

ENTITY. PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 21, 2008, GROUP INC. WAS

SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED

ENTITY (CSE) AND WAS SUBJECT TO

GROUP-WIDE

SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE SEC AND TO MINIMUM CAPITAL

STANDARDS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. ON

SEPTEMBER 26, 2008, THE SEC ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS

ENDING THE CSE PROGRAM. THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL

U.S. BROKER-DEALER,

GS&CO., REMAINS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES. THE

FIRMS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING

GS BANK USA, ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR CAPITAL GUIDELINES. UNDER

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA) THAT

IS APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA, THE FIRM AND ITS BANK

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL

GUIDELINES THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS AS CALCULATED

UNDER REGULATORY REPORTING PRACTICES. THE FIRM AND ITS BANK

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES CAPITAL AMOUNTS, AS

WELL AS GS BANK USAS PCA CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT

COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE FIRM

ANTICIPATES REPORTING CAPITAL RATIOS AS FOLLOWS.



BEFORE GROUP INC. BECAME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, IT WAS SUBJECT

TO CAPITAL GUIDELINES BY THE SEC AS A CSE THAT WERE GENERALLY

CONSISTENT WITH THOSE SET OUT IN THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE

INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL

STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION

(BASEL II). THE FIRM CURRENTLY COMPUTES AND REPORTS ITS

FIRMWIDE CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL II

REQUIREMENTS AS APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM WHEN IT WAS REGULATED AS

A CSE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL.

UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS IT APPLIED TO THE FIRM WHEN IT

WAS REGULATED AS A CSE, THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS TIER 1

CAPITAL AND TOTAL ALLOWABLE CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS (RWAS). AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRMS TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL ALLOWABLE CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS)

WAS 18.9% AND THE FIRMS TIER 1 RATIO (TIER 1

CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS) WAS 15.6%, IN EACH CASE

CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS IT APPLIED TO THE

FIRM WHEN IT WAS REGULATED AS A CSE. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO

CONTINUE TO REPORT TO INVESTORS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME ITS

BASEL II CAPITAL RATIOS AS APPLICABLE TO IT WHEN IT WAS

REGULATED AS A CSE.



THE REGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES ARE BASED ON THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL I), WITH

BASEL II TO BE PHASED IN OVER TIME. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY

WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO PUT IN PLACE THE

APPROPRIATE REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS AND

METHODOLOGIES TO ALLOW REPORTING OF THE BASEL I CAPITAL

RATIOS AS OF THE END OF MARCH 2009.



IN ADDITION, THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE

BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS APPLICABLE TO IT AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY

(AS OPPOSED TO AS A CSE). U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE

INCORPORATED THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS GROUP INC., TRANSITION TO BASEL

II OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO HAS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIO GUIDELINES. THE FIRM WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THESE GUIDELINES

BEFORE BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND, ACCORDINGLY, IS

CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE ITS

METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THIS RATIO. THE TIER 1 LEVERAGE

RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL (AS APPLICABLE TO THE

FIRM AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY) DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE

TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR DISALLOWED GOODWILL

AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE

RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE

HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

GUIDELINES OR THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

MUST HAVE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE

THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION,

RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, THE

FIRMS ESTIMATED TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 6.1%. THIS

RATIO REPRESENTS A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE AND MAY BE REVISED IN

SUBSEQUENT FILINGS AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO FINALIZE THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE

CALCULATION.

GS&CO. AND GSEC HAVE ELECTED TO COMPUTE THEIR MINIMUM

CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

MARKET AND CREDIT RISK STANDARDS OF APPENDIX E OF

RULE 15C3-1.

AND THE FDIC, IS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE

NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS) ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. GS BANK

USA WAS FORMED IN NOVEMBER 2008 THROUGH THE MERGER OF THE

FIRMS EXISTING UTAH INDUSTRIAL BANK (NAMED GS BANK USA)

INTO THE FIRMS NEW YORK LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY,

WITH THE SURVIVING COMPANY TAKING THE NAME GS BANK USA. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2007, GS BANK USAS PREDECESSOR WAS A WHOLLY

OWNED INDUSTRIAL BANK REGULATED BY THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WAS A MEMBER OF THE FDIC AND WAS SUBJECT

TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM COMPUTES THE CAPITAL

RATIOS FOR GS BANK USA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL I

FRAMEWORK FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL.

IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A WELL CAPITALIZED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

GUIDELINES, GS BANK USA MUST MAINTAIN A TIER 1 CAPITAL

RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10% AND

A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. IN CONNECTION WITH

THE NOVEMBER 2008 ASSET TRANSFER DESCRIBED BELOW, GS BANK USA

AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS

IN EXCESS OF THESE WELL CAPITALIZED LEVELS.

ACCORDINGLY, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, GS BANK USA IS EXPECTED

TO MAINTAIN A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8%, A TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 11% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO

TO $145.06 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2008). AS A RESULT, THE

FIRM IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO

FINALIZE ITS METHODOLOGY FOR THE BASEL I CALCULATIONS. AS

OF NOVEMBER 2008, UNDER BASEL I, GS BANK USAS

ESTIMATED TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 8.9% AND ESTIMATED TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIO WAS 11.6%. IN ADDITION, GS BANK USAS

ESTIMATED TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 9.1%.

THE DEPOSITS OF GS BANK USA ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC TO THE

EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL

RESERVE BANK. THE RESERVE BALANCE DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES HELD AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BANK WAS APPROXIMATELY $94 MILLION AND $32 MILLION AS

OF NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007, RESPECTIVELY. GS

BANK EUROPE, A WHOLLY OWNED CREDIT INSTITUTION, IS REGULATED BY

THE IRISH FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND IS SUBJECT

TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, GS

BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE WERE BOTH IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

TO STATE INSURANCE REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT IN THE STATES IN

WHICH THEY ARE DOMICILED AND IN THE OTHER STATES IN WHICH THEY

ARE LICENSED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. ARE REGULATED BY THE

BERMUDA MONETARY AUTHORITY AND BY LLOYDS (WHICH IS, IN

TURN, REGULATED BY THE U.K.S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY

(FSA)). THE FIRMS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WERE IN

COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007.

THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL

NON-U.S. REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) AND

IS SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE FSA. GSJCL, THE

FIRMS REGULATED JAPANESE

GS BANK USA) IF, IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND PRACTICE IN THE LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

BANKING ORGANIZATION. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, GS BANK USA WAS NOT

ABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS TO GROUP INC. WITHOUT REGULATORY

APPROVAL.

BUSINESS

SEGMENTS

IN REPORTING TO MANAGEMENT, THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS

ARE CATEGORIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INVESTMENT BANKING, TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS LINES

HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS.

(I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE,

(II) THEIR METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF

CLIENTS THEY SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS A WHOLE 

COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY  ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES WITHIN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AS WELL AS THE

PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS. CONSEQUENTLY,

PRE-TAX

MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES REVENUES AND EXPENSES AMONG THE THREE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF THESE

SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ALLOCATING

CERTAIN REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS

ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE

THIRD-PARTY

RATES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT

HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE

ALLOCATION PROCESS IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE BUSINESS OF THE FIRM.

THE SEGMENT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW IS PREPARED

ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES.



REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE

INCLUDED IN DETERMINING

PRE-TAX

EARNINGS.



NET REVENUES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS OF

INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE TO SPECIFIC SECURITIES,

COMMODITIES AND OTHER POSITIONS IN RELATION TO THE CASH

GENERATED BY, OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF, SUCH UNDERLYING

POSITIONS. NET INTEREST IS INCLUDED WITHIN SEGMENT NET REVENUES

AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH MANAGEMENT ASSESSES

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE.



OVERHEAD EXPENSES NOT DIRECTLY ALLOCABLE TO SPECIFIC SEGMENTS

ARE ALLOCATED RATABLY BASED ON DIRECT SEGMENT EXPENSES.

GEOGRAPHIC

INFORMATION

DUE TO THE HIGHLY INTEGRATED NATURE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL

MARKETS, THE FIRM MANAGES ITS BUSINESSES BASED ON THE

PROFITABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE. SINCE A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES REQUIRE CROSS-BORDER

COORDINATION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE NEEDS OF THE FIRMS

CLIENTS, THE METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING THE FIRMS

PROFITABILITY TO GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IS DEPENDENT ON THE JUDGMENT

OF MANAGEMENT.

GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS.



INVESTMENT BANKING: LOCATION OF THE CLIENT AND INVESTMENT

BANKING TEAM.



FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES, AND EQUITIES: LOCATION

OF THE TRADING DESK.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS: LOCATION OF THE INVESTMENT.
