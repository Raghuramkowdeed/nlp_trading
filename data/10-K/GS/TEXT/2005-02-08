OFFERING BROAD MARKET-MAKING AND MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON

A GLOBAL BASIS. IN ADDITION, WE USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TAKE POSITIONS

IN MARKETS, BY COMMITTING CAPITAL AND TAKING RISK, TO FACILITATE

CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. OUR WILLINGNESS TO

MAKE MARKETS, COMMIT CAPITAL AND TAKE RISK IN A BROAD RANGE OF

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRODUCTS AND THEIR

DERIVATIVES IS CRUCIAL BOTH TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND TO

SUPPORT OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET

LIQUIDITY.

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM

OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESSES IN THREE WAYS.



FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS

FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG MARKET RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL POSITION,

WE UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WHERE SPREADS AND FEES ARE

GENERALLY LARGER.



FINALLY, WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM STRUCTURING AND EXECUTING TRANSACTIONS THAT

ADDRESS COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS

SPONSORED NUMEROUS CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE PRIVATE INVESTMENT

FUNDS. OUR STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO THESE FUNDS GENERALLY IS TO

INVEST OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS THAT

IS DIVERSIFIED BY INDUSTRY, PRODUCT TYPE, GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND

TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND TYPE. OUR CORPORATE INVESTMENT FUNDS

PURSUE ON A GLOBAL BASIS, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT

SECURITIES IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, LEVERAGED BUYOUTS,

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL PARTIES.

OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS INVEST IN REAL ESTATE OPERATING

COMPANIES, DEBT AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, AND

OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS. OUR CLIENTS IN PRIVATE

INVESTMENT FUNDS INCLUDE PENSION PLANS, ENDOWMENTS, CHARITABLE

INSTITUTIONS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED $40.67 BILLION

OF COMMITTED EQUITY CAPITAL IN THESE FUNDS, OF WHICH

$28.54 BILLION RELATES TO OUR CORPORATE FUNDS AND $12.13 BILLION

RELATES TO OUR REAL ESTATE FUNDS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004,

$31.75 BILLION OF THE COMMITTED EQUITY CAPITAL WAS FUNDED AND

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN THESE FUNDS WERE $27.81 BILLION.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE

THREE PRIMARY REVENUE STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE

THAT IS GENERALLY A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL,

INVESTED CAPITAL, TOTAL GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE.

THESE ANNUAL MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET REVENUES. SECOND, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTOR IN

THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE FUNDS

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING FROM CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON REALIZATION. THIRD,

AFTER THE FUND HAS ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE

RECEIVE AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS THAT IS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS. THE

SECOND AND THIRD OF THESE REVENUE STREAMS ARE INCLUDED IN NET

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS  LEGAL AND

TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY

GOLDMAN SACHS IS COMMITTED TO THE

ONGOING DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT

THE ORGANIZATION. OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES CAN BE BROADLY

CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR EFFORTS.



ENHANCING CLIENT SERVICE THROUGH INCREASED CONNECTIVITY AND THE PROVISION OF

VALUE-ADDED, TAILORED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



IMPROVING OUR TRADING, EXECUTION AND CLEARING CAPABILITIES;



RISK MANAGEMENT; AND



OVERALL EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY AND CONTROL.

WE HAVE TAILORED OUR SERVICES TO OUR

CLIENTS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR GLOBAL ELECTRONIC

TRADING AND INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES; SUCH

CAPABILITIES COVER MANY OF OUR FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY,

EQUITY AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND TECHNOLOGY

HAVE CHANGED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE WAYS THAT SECURITIES

AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE TRADED, DISTRIBUTED AND SETTLED.

THIS CREATES BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR OUR BUSINESSES.

WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ONE OF THE

STRENGTHS AND PRINCIPAL REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS

THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION OF ITS PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF

BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT

FOSTERS PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY AND COOPERATION

AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE

IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS

AN IMPORTANT PART. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT

VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW

PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND

EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS

INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, WE HAD 20,722

EMPLOYEES, WHICH EXCLUDES 1,206 EMPLOYEES OF GOLDMAN SACHS

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND LOAN SERVICING SUBSIDIARIES. THE MAJORITY

OF THE COSTS OF THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND LOAN SERVICING

EMPLOYEES ARE REIMBURSED TO GOLDMAN SACHS BY THE INVESTMENT FUNDS

FOR WHICH THESE SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE SERVICES. THIS ALSO EXCLUDES

EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT ARE HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY 

AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE

EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER BROKERS AND

DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, INVESTMENT

ADVISORS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS,

COMMERCIAL BANKS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT OR

NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN

ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO

CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR

EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, DUE IN PART TO U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT

HAS EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A

U.S. BANK. IN PARTICULAR, A NUMBER OF LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS,

INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS

HAVE ESTABLISHED OR ACQUIRED BROKER-DEALERS OR HAVE MERGED WITH

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY

TO OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND

INSURANCE TO BROKERAGE, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING

SERVICES, WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY ALSO

HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES

PRODUCTS WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH HAS

RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURE IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND COULD

RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT

TO CONTINUE TO FACE, PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING

CAPITAL TO BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS

THAT MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR,

CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS

AGREEMENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR

OTHER REVOLVING LOAN FACILITIES) FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. IN 2003,

WE ESTABLISHED THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES, THROUGH WHICH WE HAVE

ISSUED COMMITMENTS TO

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEND TO COUNTERPARTIES, PRIMARILY INVESTMENT-GRADE CLIENTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CREDIT RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE COMMITMENTS HAS BEEN COVERED BY CREDIT LOSS

PROTECTION PROVIDED TO GOLDMAN SACHS BY SMFG. THESE ARRANGEMENTS

MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT, HOWEVER, TO FULLY SATISFY OUR CLIENTS

DESIRE FOR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT LOSS

PROTECTION IS LIMITED GENERALLY TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS GOLDMAN

SACHS REALIZES ON APPROVED INVESTMENT-GRADE LOAN COMMITMENTS,

SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $1 BILLION, AND GOLDMAN SACHS MAY ALSO

OBTAIN PROTECTION FOR 70% OF THE SECOND LOSS ON SUCH COMMITMENTS,

SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.125 BILLION. SEE MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

AND NOTE 6 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES AND FOR

A DESCRIPTION OF THE CREDIT LOSS PROTECTION PROVIDED BY SMFG. WE

ALSO ISSUE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS THROUGH GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT

PARTNERS L.P. AND OTHER ENTITIES IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING

TRANSACTIONS.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND

GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO

HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO

SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND BETTER

CAPITALIZED AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE AND LONGER

OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE

COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. THERE HAS

BEEN CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE IN THE PRICING OF LARGE BLOCK TRADES.

ALSO, EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS TRADING

SPREADS, HAVE BEEN UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE

ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND

THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE

PRESSURE ON TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD

ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE. WE OWN INTERESTS IN AND

PARTICIPATE IN A NUMBER OF THESE TRADING SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE THAT

WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND

OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN

MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES.

REGULATION

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN

THE SECURITIES AND COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS INDUSTRIES, IS

SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE.

AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY, REGULATORY BODIES IN THE UNITED

STATES AND THE REST OF THE WORLD ARE CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING THE

INTEGRITY OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL MARKETS AND WITH

PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF CUSTOMERS PARTICIPATING IN THOSE

MARKETS. THEY ARE NOT, HOWEVER, CHARGED WITH PROTECTING THE

INTERESTS OF GOLDMAN SACHS SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS.

BROKER-DEALERS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITIES

BUSINESS, INCLUDING SALES METHODS, TRADE PRACTICES, USE AND

SAFEKEEPING OF CUSTOMERS FUNDS AND SECURITIES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

RECORDKEEPING, THE FINANCING OF CUSTOMERS PURCHASES, AND THE

CONDUCT OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. A NUMBER OF OUR

AFFILIATES ARE REGULATED BY INVESTMENT ADVISORY LAWS IN AND OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION, CHANGES IN RULES

PROMULGATED BY SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, OR CHANGES IN THE

INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES, EITHER IN

THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE, MAY DIRECTLY AFFECT THE OPERATION

AND PROFITABILITY OF GOLDMAN SACHS.

REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SEC IS THE

FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS. OUR PRINCIPAL BROKER-DEALER IN THE UNITED STATES

IS GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., WHICH IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER AND AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH THE SEC AND AS A BROKER-

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEALER IN

ALL 50 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE NYSE AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. (NASD), ADOPT RULES THAT APPLY TO, AND

EXAMINE, BROKER-DEALERS SUCH AS GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IN

ADDITION, STATE SECURITIES AND OTHER REGULATORS ALSO HAVE

REGULATORY OR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE OFFICES.

GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P. (FORMERLY KNOWN AS

SPEAR, LEEDS & KELLOGG, L.P.) AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES ARE

REGISTERED U.S. BROKER-DEALERS AND ARE REGULATED BY THE SEC,

THE NYSE AND THE NASD. GOLDMAN SACHS FINANCIAL MARKETS, L.P. IS

REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN OTC DERIVATIVES DEALER AND CONDUCTS

CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES.

THE COMMODITY FUTURES AND COMMODITY

OPTIONS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION

UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED. THE COMMODITY FUTURES

TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC) IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY CHARGED WITH

THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AND THE

REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. SEVERAL OF GOLDMAN SACHS SUBSIDIARIES,

INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. AND GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION &

CLEARING, L.P., ARE REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AND ACT AS FUTURES

COMMISSION MERCHANTS, COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS OR COMMODITY TRADING

ADVISORS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AND THE

REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF VARIOUS

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE,

OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION, ALSO

GOVERN THE COMMODITY FUTURES AND COMMODITY OPTIONS BUSINESSES OF

THESE ENTITIES.

AS A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND

MEMBER OF VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, GOLDMAN, SACHS &

CO. IS SUBJECT TO THE SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE, RULE 15C3-1.

THIS RULE SPECIFIES THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF NET CAPITAL A

BROKER-DEALER MUST MAINTAIN AND ALSO REQUIRES THAT A SIGNIFICANT

PART OF ITS ASSETS BE KEPT IN RELATIVELY LIQUID FORM. GOLDMAN, SACHS &

CO. IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE

CFTC AND VARIOUS SECURITIES AND COMMODITY EXCHANGES. SEE NOTE 14

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8

OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

THE SEC HAS ADOPTED RULE AMENDMENTS

THAT ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

BROKER-DEALERS THAT ARE PART OF A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY.

AS A CONDITION TO ITS USE OF THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD, A

BROKER-DEALERS ULTIMATE HOLDING COMPANY AND AFFILIATES (REFERRED

TO COLLECTIVELY AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY OR CSE) MUST

CONSENT TO GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE SEC.

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. ANTICIPATES APPLYING FOR PERMISSION TO USE

THIS ALTERNATIVE METHOD. WE EXPECT THAT DOING SO WILL ENABLE US TO

COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL GROUPS DIRECTIVE

DESCRIBED BELOW. ON BECOMING SUBJECT TO THE SECS GROUP-WIDE

SUPERVISION, GOLDMAN SACHS WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE SEC

COMPUTATIONS OF OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

THE SEC RECENTLY ADOPTED RULES

REQUIRING THE REGISTRATION OF HEDGE FUNDS ADVISERS UNDER THE

INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940. WE CANNOT PREDICT AT THIS TIME THE

IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THESE RULES ON OUR TRADING, PRIME

BROKERAGE AND OTHER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEDGE FUNDS.

THE SEC AND VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS IMPOSE RULES THAT REQUIRE NOTIFICATION WHEN NET

CAPITAL FALLS BELOW CERTAIN PREDEFINED CRITERIA, LIMIT THE RATIO OF

SUBORDINATED DEBT TO EQUITY IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL COMPOSITION

OF A BROKER-DEALER AND CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF A BROKER-DEALER TO

EXPAND ITS BUSINESS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ADDITIONALLY, THE

SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE IMPOSES CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT

MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF PROHIBITING A BROKER-DEALER FROM

DISTRIBUTING OR WITHDRAWING CAPITAL AND REQUIRING PRIOR NOTICE TO

THE SEC FOR CERTAIN WITHDRAWALS OF CAPITAL.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED THE

GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY, N.A. (GSTC), A NATIONAL BANK

LIMITED TO FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PERSONAL TRUST

AND ESTATE ADMINISTRATION AND RELATED SERVICES TO ITS

HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS. GSTC MAINTAINS

COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS FOR ELIGIBLE PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING

PLAN CLIENTS. AS A NATIONAL BANK, GSTC IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY

THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND IS A MEMBER BANK

OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. GSTC WILL NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS OR

MAKE LOANS AND, AS A RESULT, IT IS NOT

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSIDERED TO BE A BANK FOR PURPOSES OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT. IT ALSO DOES NOT CARRY

FDIC INSURANCE AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS ESTABLISHED GOLDMAN

SACHS BANK USA (GS BANK), A UTAH-CHARTERED INDUSTRIAL LOAN COMPANY,

IN ORDER TO EXTEND CREDIT AND TO TAKE DEPOSITS, OTHER THAN DEMAND

DEPOSITS. GS BANK IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FDIC AND THE UTAH

COMMISSIONER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ACCEPT

DEMAND DEPOSITS, GS BANK IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A BANK FOR

PURPOSES OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT. THE DEPOSITS MAINTAINED

AT GS BANK ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,

AND GS BANK IS SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY

REINVESTMENT ACT.

J. ARON & COMPANY IS

AUTHORIZED BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION (FERC) TO

SELL WHOLESALE PHYSICAL POWER AT MARKET-BASED RATES. AS A

FERC-AUTHORIZED POWER MARKETER, J. ARON & COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

REGULATION UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER ACT AND FERC REGULATIONS.

THE EFFORT TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING

AND TERRORIST FINANCING IS A PRIORITY IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICY WITH

RESPECT TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001

CONTAINS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND

MANDATES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS NEW REGULATIONS APPLICABLE

TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, INCLUDING

STANDARDS FOR VERIFYING CLIENT IDENTIFICATION AT ACCOUNT OPENING,

AND OBLIGATIONS TO MONITOR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS, THE USA

PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES

THAT MAY BE INVOLVED IN TERRORISM OR MONEY LAUNDERING. ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING LAWS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES CONTAIN SOME SIMILAR

PROVISIONS. THE OBLIGATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

GOLDMAN SACHS, TO IDENTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS, WATCH FOR AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND SHARE

INFORMATION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS REQUIRED THE

IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNAL PRACTICES, PROCEDURES

AND CONTROLS WHICH HAVE INCREASED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE,

OUR COSTS, AND ANY FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR PROGRAMS IN THIS

AREA COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY AND REGULATORY

DAMAGES.

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT

TO COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS ENACTED BY U.S. FEDERAL AND

STATE GOVERNMENTS, THE EUROPEAN UNION, OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND/OR

ENACTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS OR EXCHANGES RELATING

TO THE PRIVACY OF CLIENT INFORMATION, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY

WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY AND/OR

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

IN ADDITION, OUR POWER GENERATION

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL

AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW

UNDER  CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS 

INVESTMENTS IN THE POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY.

REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

GOLDMAN SACHS IS AN ACTIVE

PARTICIPANT IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS.

MANY OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THESE

MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ELSEWHERE THAT INCLUDE SOME FORM OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY

RULES AND OTHER CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES. GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDES

INVESTMENT SERVICES IN AND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM UNDER THE

REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA). VARIOUS

GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BANKING AND REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES OF THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN WHICH GOLDMAN SACHS

OPERATES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (BAFIN) AND THE BUNDESBANK IN GERMANY, THE

AUTORITÉ DES MARCHÉS FINANCIERS AND BANQUE DE FRANCE IN FRANCE,

BANCA DITALIA AND THE COMMISSIONE NAZIONALE PER LE SOCIETÀ E LA

BORSA (CONSOB) IN ITALY AND THE SWISS FEDERAL BANKING

COMMISSION. GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE

EUROPEAN SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES EXCHANGES OF WHICH

THEY ARE MEMBERS. THE INVESTMENT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

OVERSIGHT BY THE FSA AND OTHER EUROPEAN REGULATORS ARE REGULATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES REQUIRING, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS,

CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS RULES.

THESE STANDARDS, REQUIREMENTS AND RULES ARE SIMILARLY IMPLEMENTED,

UNDER THE

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SAME DIRECTIVES, THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ARE

BROADLY COMPARABLE IN SCOPE AND PURPOSE TO THE REGULATORY CAPITAL

AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED UNDER THE SEC AND CFTC

RULES. SOME EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES ALSO PERMIT LOCAL REGULATION

IN EACH JURISDICTION, INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO BE

MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH DIRECTIVES AND THESE

LOCAL REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN CERTAIN COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES

TO GOLDMAN SACHS.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

THE TOKYO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL FUTURES EXCHANGE AND THE JAPAN

SECURITIES DEALERS ASSOCIATION IN JAPAN, THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES

COMMISSION IN HONG KONG, THE MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE AND

THE COUNCIL) INTRODUCED CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE WAY IN WHICH

FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS

OPERATING IN EUROPE WILL BE REGULATED, WITH THE CHANGES TO BE

IMPLEMENTED BY MEMBER STATES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING IN 2005.

THESE CHANGES WILL CAUSE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTED IN

UNREGULATED ENTITIES TO BECOME SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FORMS OF

REGULATION, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

REQUIREMENTS. OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE INVOLVE

APPLYING TO BE SUBJECT TO THE CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY RULES

DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER  REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES.

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE IN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES, REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, AS

WELL AS STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE

EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN

CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS, OR THE

SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR ITS DIRECTORS,

OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. FROM TIME TO TIME, OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

BEEN SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE

BEEN IMPOSED FOR INFRACTIONS OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR

ACTIVITIES, NONE OF WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US

OR OUR BUSINESSES.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE NET CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS COULD LIMIT THOSE

OPERATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT REQUIRE THE INTENSIVE USE OF

CAPITAL, SUCH AS UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES, SPECIALIST

ACTIVITIES AND THE FINANCING OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNT BALANCES, AND ALSO

COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW CAPITAL FROM OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH IN TURN COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT

OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK.

OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT

TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY A NUMBER OF SECURITIES EXCHANGES. THE

RULES OF THESE EXCHANGES GENERALLY REQUIRE OUR SPECIALISTS TO

MAINTAIN ORDERLY MARKETS IN THE SECURITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE

SPECIALISTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS, IN TURN, MAY REQUIRE US TO COMMIT

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING STOCK

MARKETS AND THE CONDUCT OF SPECIALISTS ON THOSE MARKETS, INCLUDING

THE NYSE, MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES OR IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATING TO THOSE BUSINESSES.

THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT

BANKS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN THE SUBJECT OF INCREASED REGULATORY

SCRUTINY. IN 2002 AND 2003, ACTING IN PART PURSUANT TO A MANDATE

CONTAINED IN THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, THE SEC, THE NYSE AND

THE NASD ADOPTED RULES IMPOSING HEIGHTENED RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING

PERSONNEL AT MEMBER SECURITIES FIRMS. VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS

HAVE ALSO CHANGED OR PROPOSED TO CHANGE THEIR

REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, IN 2003,

SEVERAL LEADING SECURITIES FIRMS OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH

CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THEIR EQUITY RESEARCH

ANALYSTS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST PURSUANT TO WHICH THE FIRMS

HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS. AS PART

OF THIS SETTLEMENT, RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPOSED ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BANKING DEPARTMENTS,

AND THESE SECURITIES FIRMS ARE REQUIRED TO FUND THE PROVISION OF

INDEPENDENT RESEARCH TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESEARCH

SETTLEMENT, THE FIRM HAS ALSO SUBSCRIBED TO A VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE

IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE ALLOCATION OF SHARES IN INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS TO EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. DURING

2004, THE FSA IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IMPOSED NEW REQUIREMENTS ON THE

CONDUCT OF THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME

SECURITIES OFFERINGS (INCLUDING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND

SECONDARY DISTRIBUTIONS). THE NASD HAS PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD

FURTHER AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH SECURITIES ARE DISTRIBUTED AND

ALLOCATED IN REGISTERED PUBLIC OFFERINGS. WE CANNOT FULLY PREDICT

THE PRACTICAL EFFECT THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS OR MEASURES WILL HAVE

ON OUR BUSINESS, AND THE SEC, NYSE AND NASD AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS

SUCH AS THE FSA MAY ADOPT ADDITIONAL AND MORE STRINGENT

RULES WITH RESPECT TO OFFERING PROCEDURES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE FUTURE.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

MARKET CONDITIONS

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES

AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY. BUSINESS CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN

2004, AFTER IMPROVING SOMEWHAT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2003: THE

NUMBER AND SIZE OF EQUITY UNDERWRITINGS AND COMPLETED MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS TRANSACTIONS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2004, AFTER

DECLINING FOR THREE STRAIGHT YEARS, AND FIXED INCOME ORIGINATION

LEVELS REMAINED STRONG; FIXED INCOME MARKET CONDITIONS REMAINED

GENERALLY FAVORABLE, AS INTEREST RATES, ALTHOUGH RISING, REMAINED

LOW BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS, AND CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS REMAINED

NARROW; AND IN THE GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS, ALTHOUGH VOLATILITY

LEVELS AND COMMISSION RATES CONTINUED TO DECLINE, PRICE LEVELS AND

VOLUMES WERE GENERALLY STRONGER.

ADVERSE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN

THE FUTURE ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY

WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH

CHANGES ARE RAPID, MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS. MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS,

INCLUDING OUR INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY

POSITIONS AND OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, OR MAY REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO

ENTER INTO NEW TRANSACTIONS. CONVERSELY, CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON

MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE

BUSINESSES.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM

OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE

TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE CONTINUED, EVEN AS THE VOLUME AND

NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS HAVE STARTED TO INCREASE. THESE PRESSURES

HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF LARGE BLOCK TRADES. IN ADDITION,

THE TREND (PARTICULARLY IN THE EQUITY UNDERWRITING BUSINESS) TOWARD MULTIPLE BOOK

RUNNERS AND CO-MANAGERS HANDLING

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSACTIONS, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WOULD HAVE

BEEN A SINGLE BOOK RUNNER, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS ALSO TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS.

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF

BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND,

THEREFORE, IN THE INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING

AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE PRIMARILY

CLIENT-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE BLOCKS OF STOCK ARE INCREASINGLY BEING SOLD IN

BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A MARKETED BASIS, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT GOLDMAN

SACHS MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE PURCHASED SECURITIES AT FAVORABLE PRICES.

MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY. WE ALSO

REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE

NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN

PERIOD.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND AS A SPECIALIST

MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO

MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET.

THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN

GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON

MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE

VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

RISK MANAGEMENT, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT

IF ANY OF THE VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS,

PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES WE UTILIZE TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

VARIOUS TYPES OF RISK ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY INCUR LOSSES. OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY

EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING OUR RISK EXPOSURE IN ALL MARKET

ENVIRONMENTS OR AGAINST ALL TYPES OF RISK.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR

BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS.

THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL

PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE

SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO

OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER

OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR

TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER SUCH

PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE

CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY

BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. IS A

HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, IT DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS,

DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE

REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF

THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT

OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (OR ANY OTHER ENTITY) HOLDS EQUITY

INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS REGULATED OR UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, ITS

RIGHTS AS AN EQUITY HOLDER TO THE ASSETS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES ARE

SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE CLAIMS OF THE CREDITORS OF SUCH

SUBSIDIARIES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD

PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT

PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR

RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL

CIRCUMSTANCES. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE

BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS HAS THE BREADTH OF

THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURES. AS A CLEARING

MEMBER FIRM, WE FINANCE OUR CUSTOMER POSITIONS AND WE COULD BE HELD

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN

ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE

TO EXTEND CREDIT AND PRICE MORE AGGRESSIVELY THE CREDIT RISKS WE

TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE

CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING

AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION,

CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT

ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES, AND THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. IF ANY OF OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING OR OTHER

DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS DO NOT OPERATE PROPERLY OR ARE DISABLED OR

IF THERE ARE OTHER SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR INTERNAL

PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS, WE COULD SUFFER AN IMPAIRMENT TO OUR

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL LOSS, A DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES,

LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE. THESE SYSTEMS MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME

DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND

OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING A DISRUPTION OF ELECTRICAL OR COMMUNICATIONS

SERVICES OR OUR INABILITY TO OCCUPY ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUILDINGS.

THE INABILITY OF OUR SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS COULD ALSO CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR TERMINATION OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES,

CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO

FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. ANY SUCH FAILURE OR

TERMINATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT

TRANSACTIONS AND MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK.

IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY

PLANS WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE

ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE

LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL,

COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY GOLDMAN

SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE

DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT

AFFECT ONLY THE BUILDINGS OF GOLDMAN SACHS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES,

OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT ON THE CITIES WHERE

THOSE BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED. NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR

PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING NEW YORK, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG

AND TOKYO, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER, IN ONE OR MORE

BUILDINGS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES

IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER

LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY

SUFFER AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY

PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE

PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER

INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE

PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES

WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE

VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER

MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT.

IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD

JEOPARDIZE OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND

OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS

OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD

PARTIES OPERATIONS. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO

INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE

EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY

INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION

SECURITY ARE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS

CONTINUITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE

FIRMS CRITICAL FACILITIES. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE

CRISIS MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY,

PEOPLE RECOVERY FACILITIES AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF

INFORMATION SECURITY, A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND

TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION ASSETS OF

THE FIRM AND ITS CLIENTS. SAFEGUARDS ARE APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION

RESOURCES.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY

FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A DIFFICULT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM A VARIETY OF

REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE SEC, NYSE, NASD AND STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE

INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THIS

ENVIRONMENT HAS LED SOME OF OUR CLIENTS TO BE LESS WILLING TO

ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY CARRY A RISK OF INCREASED SCRUTINY

BY REGULATORS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE FIRM ALWAYS STRIVES TO FULLY

COMPLY WITH ALL LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THIS REGULATORY

AND ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO

A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN ENTERED INTO BY

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR FIRM, AND THAT WERE

GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE PERMISSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. THIS

ENVIRONMENT HAS LED US AND OUR COMPETITORS TO MODIFY TRANSACTION

STRUCTURES AND, IN SOME CASES, TO LIMIT OR CEASE OUR EXECUTION OF

SOME TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND HAVE ENHANCED EXISTING POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, TO ADDRESS THE RISKS ARISING FROM THE CURRENT

ENVIRONMENT.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR

SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE

MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT

REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY

HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR

BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND

PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN INCREASING.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION

IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED,

PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR

SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS

OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESSES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER

REGULATION, THE RESEARCH AREAS OF INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE BEEN AND

REMAIN THE SUBJECT OF INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY WHICH HAS LED

TO INCREASED RESTRICTIONS ON

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKING PERSONNEL AT SECURITIES

FIRMS. VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALSO CHANGED OR

PROPOSED CHANGING THEIR REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH

MATTERS. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL LEADING SECURITIES FIRMS IN THE

UNITED STATES, INCLUDING GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., REACHED A GLOBAL

SETTLEMENT IN 2003 WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES

REGULATORS AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE

INVESTIGATIONS INTO EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST PURSUANT TO WHICH THE FIRMS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS. CERTAIN OF THESE REQUIREMENTS AND

RESTRICTIONS HAVE IMPOSED ADDITIONAL COSTS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE

CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES. CURRENT OR FUTURE CIVIL LAWSUITS

IMPLICATING INVESTMENT RESEARCH ANALYSTS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

WERE NOT SETTLED AS PART OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT. GOLDMAN SACHS

TOTAL POTENTIAL LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF SUCH CIVIL CASES CANNOT BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN A GIVEN PERIOD. THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ALSO DID NOT RESOLVE

POTENTIAL CHARGES INVOLVING INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING

SUPERVISORS, AND REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONTINUING.

IN ADDITION, THE SEC AND OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF

COMPLEX, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE BROUGHT

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IN SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS, CLIENTS OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY ENGAGED IN

ACCOUNTING, DISCLOSURE OR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS,

AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGEDLY FACILITATED THESE

IMPROPRIETIES BY ENTERING INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH THE CLIENTS. WE

SEEK TO CREATE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS NEEDS,

AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO, AND CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO, STRUCTURED

TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN

PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS

WE ENTER INTO ARE APPROPRIATELY REVIEWED AND COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN OF THESE

TRANSACTIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND

LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH, STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS WILL

MAKE OUR CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS, AND

WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN THIS AREA.

RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN

INDUSTRY-WIDE AND OTHER INVESTIGATIONS BY FEDERAL AND STATE

AUTHORITIES CONCERNING MARKET TIMING, LATE TRADING AND OTHER

ACTIVITIES INVOLVING MUTUAL FUNDS AND INVESTMENT ADVISORS. FEDERAL

AND STATE AUTHORITIES HAVE MADE INFORMATIONAL REQUESTS REGARDING

TRADING PRACTICES BROADLY ACROSS ALL OF THE MAJOR FUND COMPANIES

AND BROKER-DEALERS. GOLDMAN SACHS HAS RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION AND HAS BEEN FULLY COOPERATING WITH THOSE AUTHORITIES.

WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE REASONABLE MEASURES TO

DETECT AND DETER DISRUPTIVE AND ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES AND

COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE CANNOT

PREDICT THE COURSE THAT THE EXISTING INQUIRIES AND AREAS OF FOCUS

MAY TAKE OR THE IMPACT THAT ANY NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING

MUTUAL FUNDS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.

THE NYSE AND THE SEC HAVE ALSO BEEN

CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS INTO CERTAIN TRADING PRACTICES OF NYSE

SPECIALIST FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST UNIT. IN MARCH 2004,

CERTAIN OF THESE NYSE SPECIALIST FIRMS, INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST

UNIT, AGREED TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC AND THE NYSE TO

RESOLVE CHARGES THAT THE FIRMS VIOLATED CERTAIN FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AND NYSE RULES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACTIVITIES AS NYSE

SPECIALISTS DURING THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2003. THE GLOBAL

SETTLEMENT INVOLVES, AMONG OTHERS, RESTITUTION AND PENALTIES, A

CENSURE, CEASE AND DESIST ORDER AND CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS WITH

RESPECT TO OUR SPECIALIST UNITS SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES. THE

SETTLEMENT DID NOT RESOLVE THE RELATED CIVIL ACTIONS DISCUSSED

UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  SPECIALIST MATTERS IN PART I,

ITEM 3 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, OR POTENTIAL

REGULATORY CHARGES AGAINST INDIVIDUALS. THIS GLOBAL SETTLEMENT,

INCLUDING THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR

SPECIALIST UNIT, OR NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING SPECIALISTS

MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES. AS A

RESULT OF THIS GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND ANY RELATED DEVELOPMENTS, OUR

SPECIALIST BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND THE VALUE OF

OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THESE

BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPAIRED.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY

PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE

RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE

PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

REGULATORY IMPACT ON CAPITAL MARKETS

FINANCIAL SCANDALS IN RECENT YEARS

HAVE LED TO INSECURITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

CONTRIBUTED TO DECLINES IN CAPITAL MARKETS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE

SCANDALS, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE RULES OF THE SEC,

THE NYSE AND NASDAQ HAVE NECESSITATED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. THESE PROVISIONS

GENERALLY APPLY TO COMPANIES WITH SECURITIES LISTED ON U.S. SECURITIES

EXCHANGES, AND SOME PROVISIONS APPLY TO NON-U.S. ISSUERS

WITH SECURITIES TRADED ON U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGES. TO

THE EXTENT THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO AVOID BECOMING

SUBJECT TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS, DECIDE TO FORGO INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS, OUR EQUITY UNDERWRITING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXIT SOME OF OUR MERCHANT

BANKING INVESTMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SIMILARLY, THE

IMPOSITION OF THOSE PROVISIONS ON NON-U.S. ISSUERS HAS MADE

THESE ISSUERS LESS LIKELY TO LIST THEIR SECURITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES OR UNDERTAKE MERGER OR ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD

RESULT IN THEIR SECURITIES BEING LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE

MEASURES MAY RESULT IN LESS ACTIVITY BY NON-U.S. ISSUERS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND, AS A RESULT, THE U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS AND

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY

ACT OF 2002 AND THE NYSE AND NASDAQ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RULES HAVE

DIVERTED MANY COMPANIES ATTENTION AWAY FROM CAPITAL MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES OFFERINGS AND ACQUISITION AND

DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, COMPANIES THAT ARE OR ARE

PLANNING TO BE PUBLIC ARE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN

COMPLYING WITH THE SEC AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATING TO

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND COMPANIES THAT

DISCLOSE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN SUCH CONTROLS UNDER THE NEW

STANDARDS MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

THESE FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO ADOPTED OR PROPOSED ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE CHANGES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ENTITIES, MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

BUSINESS.

COMPETITION AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY 

AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE

EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY

EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. OVER

TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. U.S. FEDERAL

LEGISLATION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE ACTIVITIES

PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK, MAY

ACCELERATE THIS CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASE COMPETITION.

THIS TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR COMPETITORS.

THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES

AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS.

OUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF OUR MOST

IMPORTANT ASSETS. AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESS AND

OUR CLIENT BASE, WE INCREASINGLY HAVE TO ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST. WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE

DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT AND OUR

REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO DEAL

APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

IN ADDITION, THE SEC AND OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. WHILE WE HAVE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ANY POTENTIAL

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED, IT IS POSSIBLE

THAT POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION

OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE HEIGHTENED

REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF, AND LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH,

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL MAKE OUR

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLIENTS LESS WILLING TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MAY OCCUR, AND WILL

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY. THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESS AND

PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS

TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY AND THROUGH

OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND

TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE AND PROBABLY

ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH

OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, AND

GOLDMAN SACHS MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN

THESE AND OTHER AREAS.

RECRUITING AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT

ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS.

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION WITH BUSINESSES

OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, FOR THE MOST HIGHLY

SKILLED INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN INTENSE. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT MAY CAUSE US TO MOVE

EMPLOYEES FROM ONE BUSINESS TO ANOTHER OR TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES; THIS MAY CAUSE TEMPORARY

DISRUPTIONS AS OUR EMPLOYEES ADAPT TO NEW ROLES AND MAY REDUCE OUR

ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS (INCLUDING LAWS

RELATING TO IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING) MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY

TO MOVE RESPONSIBILITIES OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO

ANOTHER. THIS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES OR POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES.

ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES

WE EXPECT THE GROWTH OF OUR CORE

BUSINESSES TO COME THROUGH BOTH INTERNAL EXPANSION AND THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES. WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN JOINT VENTURES

IN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA AND MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL JOINT VENTURES

FROM TIME TO TIME. TO THE EXTENT WE MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO

COMBINATIONS OR JOINT VENTURES, WE FACE NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES COMBINING OR INTEGRATING THE RELEVANT BUSINESSES AND

SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE NEED TO COMBINE ACCOUNTING AND DATA

PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND TO INTEGRATE

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. IN THE CASE OF

JOINT VENTURES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES IN THAT WE MAY BE DEPENDENT UPON, AND SUBJECT TO

LIABILITY, LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE RELATING TO, SYSTEMS,

CONTROLS AND PERSONNEL THAT ARE NOT UNDER OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION,

CONFLICTS OR DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND OUR JOINT VENTURE

PARTNERS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

INVESTMENTS IN THE POWER GENERATION INDUSTRY

WE OWN EQUITY INTERESTS IN COMPANIES

ENGAGED IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, PRINCIPALLY COGENTRIX ENERGY,

INC. AND EAST COAST POWER L.L.C., AND HAVE ACQUIRED INTERESTS IN POWER PLANTS AND RELATED BUSINESSES FROM

NATIONAL ENERGY & GAS TRANSMISSION, INC. AS A RESULT OF THESE

INTERESTS AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY MAKE IN THE POWER

GENERATION INDUSTRY, WE FACE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

WE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW ENTRANT TO

THE POWER GENERATION BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LESS EXPERTISE

AND EXPERIENCE IN OWNING AND MANAGING POWER GENERATION BUSINESSES

THAN MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OWNING

AND MANAGING OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. IN PARTICULAR, IN THE

FUTURE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT

CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES.

THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION

FACILITIES MAY BE DISRUPTED. THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF POWER

GENERATION FACILITIES INVOLVES MANY RISKS, INCLUDING THE BREAKDOWN

OR FAILURE OF POWER

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS

OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY. ALTHOUGH OUR FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS

REDUNDANCIES AND BACKUP MECHANISMS, A BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE MAY

PREVENT THE AFFECTED FACILITIES FROM PERFORMING UNDER APPLICABLE

POWER SALES AGREEMENTS OR OTHERWISE OPERATING AS PLANNED.

THE POWER PLANTS IN WHICH WE OWN

INTERESTS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, SUCH

AS COAL AND NATURAL GAS, AND THE MARKET FOR AND AVAILABILITY OF

THESE RAW MATERIALS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS

BEYOND OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2004 WE FACED DIFFICULTIES

IN OBTAINING AND RETAINING ADEQUATE COAL INVENTORIES AT MANY PLANTS

DUE TO SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS ON COAL AND A RATIONING OF SERVICES BY

RAILROADS. ANY INABILITY TO OBTAIN COAL OR OTHER RAW MATERIALS IN

SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS COULD LEAD TO LOST REVENUES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE

AND DEFAULTS UNDER OUR LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH ENERGY PURCHASERS,

WHICH CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO COAL-FIRED PLANTS GENERALLY CONTAIN

STANDARDS REGARDING INVENTORY LEVELS OF COAL.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND

EVOLVING ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INTENSIFIED SCRUTINY OF THE

ENERGY MARKET BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE

PUBLIC HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING ENERGY COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE ENGAGED IN POWER

GENERATION. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POWER

GENERATION, AND OUR OVERALL BUSINESSES AND REPUTATION MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT

OF OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR POWER

GENERATION OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS,

AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES,

SITE REMEDIATION, AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO COMMIT

SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION

OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES, AND

APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES AT OUR

FACILITIES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR

REGULATIONS OR THE ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS AND PROVISIONS OF THE

PERMITS AND LICENSES MAY RESULT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF SEVERE CIVIL

OR CRIMINAL LIABILITIES AGAINST US AND THE NEED TO EXPEND

SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR COMPLIANCE OR REMEDIATION.

INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS WITH RESPECT

TO OUR POWER GENERATION FACILITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE

PROCEEDS FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY, IF ANY, MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO

COVER OUR LIABILITIES IN A PARTICULAR INCIDENT. AS A RESULT, OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL OR A HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEM AT ONE

OF OUR FACILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF

UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ATTACKS AND

OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE MAY NOT HAVE INSURANCE

AGAINST THESE RISKS, AND, IN CASES IN WHICH WE DO HAVE INSURANCE,

THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND

MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS

THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING RISKS

OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. IN MANY COUNTRIES,

THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS

IN EVERY MARKET. OUR INABILITY TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL

LAWS IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN MARKET COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND

NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO

ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED

RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, VARIOUS

EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR

NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF

SUBSIDIARIES. REFERENCES HEREIN TO THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

THE MEANING OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE

NOT HISTORICAL FACTS BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ONLY OUR BELIEFS

REGARDING FUTURE EVENTS, MANY OF WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE STATEMENTS

RELATE TO OUR FUTURE PLANS AND OBJECTIVES, AMONG OTHER THINGS. BY

IDENTIFYING THESE STATEMENTS FOR YOU IN THIS MANNER, WE ARE

ALERTING YOU TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER,

POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THE RESULTS INDICATED IN THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, THAT

COULD CAUSE OUR RESULTS TO DIFFER, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THOSE

INDICATED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW

PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE

$8.92 FOR 2004, A 52% INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2003. RETURN ON

AVERAGE TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS 25.2%

(1)

AND

RETURN ON AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS 19.8%. OUR RESULTS IN

2004 REFLECTED STRONG GROWTH IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS,

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES, AND INVESTMENT BANKING.

THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND

(1)

RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS BY AVERAGE MONTHLY TANGIBLE

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. SEE  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CALCULATION OF

RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND

COMMODITIES (FICC), AS ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES AND REGIONS PERFORMED

WELL IN A GENERALLY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. NET REVENUES IN OUR

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, DUE TO

AN UNREALIZED GAIN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED

STOCK OF SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG), AS WELL AS

GAINS FROM OTHER CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION,

EQUITIES NET REVENUES IMPROVED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS EARLY IN

2004, BUT RESULTS REMAINED BELOW THE PEAK LEVELS ACHIEVED IN 2001

AND 2000. EQUITIES OPERATED IN A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT AFTER

OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2004, AS VOLATILITY LEVELS CONTINUED TO

DECLINE AND MARKETS GENERALLY LACKED DIRECTION BEFORE MOVING HIGHER

IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

SECURITIES SERVICES GENERATED STRONG NET REVENUE GROWTH, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCREASED

INCENTIVE FEES AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CUSTOMER BALANCES IN

SECURITIES SERVICES. IN INVESTMENT BANKING, NET REVENUES INCREASED

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS, HIGHLIGHTED BY STRONG GROWTH IN

OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE CORPORATE

ACTIVITY. OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2004 WAS

HIGHER THAN AT THE END OF 2003.

(2)

OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN 2004

REFLECTED IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS A

NUMBER OF TRENDS THAT HAVE EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS. WE CONTINUED TO

SEE INCREASED TRADING AND INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CLIENTS

AND OURSELVES IN 2004 AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE INCREASED OUR MARKET

RISK DURING THE YEAR TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES. OUR

INVESTMENT BANKING RESULTS REFLECTED OUR BEST PERFORMANCE IN THREE

YEARS AS CORPORATE ACTIVITY BEGAN TO RECOVER, ALTHOUGH COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES REMAINED. IN OUR EQUITIES BUSINESS, ALTHOUGH OUR RESULTS

WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2003 AS CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY

IMPROVED, COMMISSION RATES CONTINUED TO DECLINE AND DEMANDS FOR US

TO COMMIT CAPITAL REMAINED SIGNIFICANT. IN THE REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS CONTINUED TO BE UNDER INTENSE

SCRUTINY, WITH THE SCOPE OF SUCH SCRUTINY UNABATED IN THE LAST

YEAR. CONSEQUENTLY, THE VOLUME AND AMOUNT OF CLAIMS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER RELATED COSTS REMAINED SIGNIFICANT

IN 2004. GIVEN THE RANGE OF LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS PRESENTLY

UNDER WAY, OUR LITIGATION EXPENSES CAN BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH.

THOUGH OUR OPERATING RESULTS WERE

STRONG IN 2004, OUR BUSINESS, BY ITS NATURE, DOES NOT PRODUCE

PREDICTABLE EARNINGS. OUR RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD CAN BE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE

TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES, SEE  CERTAIN

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS INCLUDED BELOW AS

WELL AS BUSINESS  CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES

AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE

AROUND THE WORLD. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY LOW INFLATION, LOW AND DECLINING INTEREST RATES,

AND STRONG EQUITY MARKETS. OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE, THESE FACTORS

PROVIDE A POSITIVE CLIMATE FOR OUR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES,

FOR MANY OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES AND FOR WEALTH CREATION, WHICH

CONTRIBUTES TO GROWTH IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED AND INFLATION WAS SLIGHTLY

HIGHER, INTEREST RATES, ALTHOUGH RISING, REMAINED LOW, MERGER

ACTIVITY IMPROVED, AND GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES, ALTHOUGH SPENDING MUCH

OF THE YEAR IN A FAIRLY NARROW RANGE, GENERALLY INCREASED. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW MARKET CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES, SEE  CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2004 IS SET FORTH BELOW.

GLOBAL.

AFTER IMPROVING DURING THE

SECOND HALF OF 2003, GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUED TO

IMPROVE DURING 2004, WITH WORLDWIDE REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN

THE CALENDAR YEAR GROWING AT ONE OF ITS HIGHEST RATES IN THE LAST

TWENTY YEARS. THE PACE OF GROWTH WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE

FIRST HALF OF 2004, BUT SLOWED THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE

YEAR. THE JAPANESE ECONOMY GREW VERY STRONGLY EARLY IN 2004 BUT

SLOWED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER. AFTER RISING EARLY IN

OUR FISCAL YEAR, GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS SPENT MUCH OF THE YEAR IN A

FAIRLY NARROW RANGE, BUT MANY OF THE MAJOR MARKETS RALLIED

BEGINNING IN LATE OCTOBER, LEADING TO SOLID GAINS OVER THE YEAR.

ALTHOUGH THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE BEGAN TO RAISE ITS FEDERAL

FUNDS RATE TARGET IN JUNE 2004, FIXED INCOME MARKETS GENERALLY

PERFORMED WELL, AS LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS ENDED THE YEAR CLOSE TO,

OR BELOW THE LEVELS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, AND CORPORATE

CREDIT SPREADS REMAINED TIGHT. IN THE CURRENCY MARKETS, THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENED FURTHER AGAINST THE MAJOR CURRENCIES, THOUGH

THE WEAKENING WAS GENERALLY SMALLER THAN IN 2003 AND OCCURRED

LARGELY AT THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. CORPORATE ACTIVITY, AS

MEASURED BY INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED AND ANNOUNCED MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS AS WELL AS EQUITY UNDERWRITING VOLUMES, INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE YEAR, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC

RECOVERY AND STRENGTHENING EQUITY MARKETS. IN ADDITION,

INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT ORIGINATION VOLUMES REMAINED STRONG.

UNITED STATES.

THE U.S. ECONOMY

GREW AT A STRONG PACE DURING THE YEAR. REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

IN THE 2004 CALENDAR YEAR ROSE BY APPROXIMATELY 4.4%. ALTHOUGH

QUARTERLY GROWTH FELL FROM THE VERY HIGH LEVEL SEEN IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003, IT REMAINED STRONG THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. A BRIEF

SOFTENING IN CONSUMER SPENDING LED TO A DECLINE IN QUARTERLY REAL

GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH DURING THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER,

BUT THE PACE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH APPEARS TO HAVE ACCELERATED AGAIN

IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS. STRONG ECONOMIC AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH

CONTRIBUTED TO STRONG CORPORATE PROFIT GROWTH DURING THE YEAR.

INFLATION INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN RESPONSE TO THE

IMPROVING ENVIRONMENT AND RISING INFLATION, THE U.S. FEDERAL

RESERVE RAISED THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE TARGET BY 25 BASIS POINTS

IN JUNE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY RAISED RATES A FURTHER 75 BASIS

POINTS BY THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR TO 2.0%. DESPITE RISING

SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, LONG-TERM YIELDS MOVED HIGHER ONLY

BRIEFLY, FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AROUND MIDYEAR, AND ENDED THE YEAR

CLOSE TO LEVELS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. WITH THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENING FURTHER, FINANCIAL CONDITIONS REMAINED SUPPORTIVE

OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE, THE S&P 500

INDEX AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX INCREASED 8%, 12% AND 7%,

RESPECTIVELY, DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

EUROPE.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IMPROVED

IN EUROPE DURING 2004. REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH IN THE

EUROZONE ECONOMIES ROSE TO APPROXIMATELY 1.8% IN THE 2004 CALENDAR

YEAR, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS, AS

DOMESTIC DEMAND ROSE AND EXPORT PERFORMANCE IMPROVED. GROWTH IN THE

EUROZONE ECONOMIES APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN STRONGER IN THE FIRST HALF

OF THE YEAR THAN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AS CONSUMER SPENDING

SLOWED FROM THE STRONG FIRST QUARTER, AND THE STRENGTHENING EURO,

IN PART, RESTRAINED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY LATER IN THE YEAR. THE

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK LEFT INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED THROUGH THE

YEAR, BUT LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS FELL SIGNIFICANTLY IN RESPONSE TO

SIGNS OF SOFTER ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE SHARP RISE IN THE EURO IN

LATE 2004. THE U.K. ECONOMY RECORDED STRONG GROWTH IN 2004, THOUGH

REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH SLOWED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE

THIRD QUARTER. AFTER STARTING TO RAISE INTEREST RATES IN NOVEMBER

2003, THE BANK OF ENGLAND RAISED INTEREST RATES DURING 2004 BY 100 BASIS

POINTS. THE FTSE 100 INDEX INCREASED 9% DURING OUR

FISCAL YEAR.

ASIA.

JAPANS ECONOMY GREW VERY

STRONGLY IN EARLY 2004, THOUGH THE PACE OF GROWTH SLOWED

SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE FIRST CALENDAR QUARTER, AS INVESTMENT

SPENDING AND EXPORT GROWTH SLOWED. DESPITE SLOWING AFTER THE FIRST

QUARTER, CONSUMER SPENDING GROWTH REMAINED STRONG THROUGH MUCH OF

2004 AND CORPORATE PROFITABILITY CONTINUED TO IMPROVE. THE BANK OF

JAPAN CONTINUED TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY TO THE MARKET AND

CONTINUED TO HOLD SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AT ZERO PERCENT THROUGH

THE YEAR. THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE CEASED INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT

THE JAPANESE YEN IN MARCH 2004 AND THE YEN REMAINED GENERALLY

STRONG. BOND YIELDS ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE YEAR BUT SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED IN LINE WITH GLOBAL TRENDS, WHILE THE

NIKKEI 225 INDEX INCREASED 7% DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

GROWTH IN OTHER ASIAN ECONOMIES

REMAINED VERY STRONG IN 2004, REFLECTING STRONG GLOBAL DEMAND

GROWTH, THOUGH THE PACE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH APPEARS TO HAVE PEAKED

IN MANY ECONOMIES AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. CHINAS GROWTH

GENERALLY REMAINED FIRM, THOUGH THE PACE OF GROWTH SLOWED IN THE

MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, AS ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES TO SLOW CERTAIN

PARTS OF THE ECONOMY HAD A DAMPENING EFFECT ON INVESTMENT SPENDING.

INFLATION GENERALLY ROSE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND, IN OCTOBER, THE

CENTRAL BANK OF CHINA INCREASED INTEREST RATES FOR THE FIRST TIME

SINCE JULY 1995, RAISING ITS BENCHMARK LENDING RATE BY 27 BASIS

POINTS.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE

SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET,

CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE RISKS,

SEE  RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDED BELOW. A SUMMARY OF SOME OF

THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS FOLLOWS BELOW.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT

COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, SEE BUSINESS  CERTAIN FACTORS THAT

MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MARKET RISK.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY. BUSINESS

CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN 2004, AFTER IMPROVING SOMEWHAT

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2003: THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF EQUITY

UNDERWRITINGS AND COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS TRANSACTIONS

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2004, AFTER DECLINING FOR THREE STRAIGHT

YEARS, AND FIXED INCOME ORIGINATION LEVELS REMAINED STRONG; FIXED

INCOME MARKET CONDITIONS REMAINED GENERALLY FAVORABLE, AS INTEREST

RATES, ALTHOUGH RISING, REMAINED LOW BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS, AND

CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS REMAINED NARROW; AND IN THE GLOBAL EQUITY

MARKETS, ALTHOUGH VOLATILITY LEVELS AND COMMISSION RATES CONTINUED

TO DECLINE, PRICE LEVELS AND VOLUMES WERE GENERALLY STRONGER.

ADVERSE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND MAY IN

THE FUTURE ADVERSELY AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN MANY

WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A LOW INTEREST RATE MARKET FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATES AND/OR WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH

CHANGES ARE RAPID, MAY CREATE A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES.



WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES

AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING, SPECIALIST AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS. MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THOSE POSITIONS OR MAY

REDUCE OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO NEW TRANSACTIONS. CONVERSELY, OUR TRADING

BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE

OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES.



INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS AND INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

REVENUES AND, BECAUSE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES CORRESPONDINGLY, OUR

PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS DUE TO UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE EQUITY MARKETS ALSO TEND TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR

CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IN TURN MAY REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS.

EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UNCERTAIN OR UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BELOW THE PERFORMANCE OF

BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITORS

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND,

THEREFORE, IN THE INCENTIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES WE RECEIVE.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING, UNDERWRITING

AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

PROPRIETARY TRADING BUSINESSES OR COMMIT CAPITAL TO FACILITATE PRIMARILY CLIENT-DRIVEN BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE BLOCKS OF STOCK ARE INCREASINGLY BEING SOLD IN

BLOCK TRADES RATHER THAN ON A MARKETED BASIS, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK GOLDMAN SACHS

MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL THE PURCHASED SECURITIES AT FAVORABLE PRICES. MOREOVER,

BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY. WE ALSO REGULARLY

ENTER INTO LARGE TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE

OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.



THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND AS A SPECIALIST

MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. IN OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO

MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET.

THIS MAY RESULT IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY. WEAKNESS IN

GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ON

MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE

VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES  GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDED BELOW.



IF ANY OF THE VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS, PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES WE UTILIZE TO

MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS TYPES OF RISK ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY INCUR LOSSES.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE IN

MITIGATING OUR RISK EXPOSURE IN ALL MARKET ENVIRONMENTS OR AGAINST ALL TYPES OF RISK.

CREDIT RISK.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE

RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER

ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY

DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF

LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. WE ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT

BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR

CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS,

AS HAS THE BREADTH OF THE ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CREDIT

EXPOSURE. AS A CLEARING MEMBER FIRM, WE FINANCE OUR CUSTOMER

POSITIONS AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR

MISCONDUCT OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, DUE

TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND CREDIT AND PRICE MORE

AGGRESSIVELY THE CREDIT RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS SOMETIMES SEEK TO REQUIRE CREDIT COMMITMENTS FROM US IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH

WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS

THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE

FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR

FORESEE. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE

INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR

DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

LIQUIDITY RISK.

LIQUIDITY IS

ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR AN INABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE

MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US. FURTHER, OUR

ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS

ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO

OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER

OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR

TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER SUCH

PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY

BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION

OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GOLDMAN SACHS OF A REDUCTION IN OUR

CREDIT RATINGS, SEE  CAPITAL AND FUNDING  CREDIT

RATINGS INCLUDED BELOW.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE

HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON A DAILY BASIS, A

LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN

MANY CURRENCIES, AND THE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS HAVE BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN OUR INTERNAL

PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS COULD LEAD TO, AMONG OTHER

CONSEQUENCES, FINANCIAL LOSS AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. IN ADDITION,

DESPITE THE CONTINGENCY PLANS WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE

INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN

WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING

ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED

BY GOLDMAN SACHS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION

AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS

OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS, WHICH IN

TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS. FIRMS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A DIFFICULT

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR

BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND

PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN INCREASING. FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW WE

ACCOUNT FOR OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY EXPOSURES, SEE  USE OF ESTIMATES INCLUDED BELOW.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FAIR VALUE

TOTAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED,

AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET

PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION CONSIST OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, WITH RELATED

UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WITH

RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE

EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER

THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE.

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUES

OF OUR CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM QUOTED

MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, BROKER OR DEALER PRICE QUOTATIONS,

OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED IN THIS MANNER

INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, OTHER SOVEREIGN

GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, LIQUID MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT-GRADE

CORPORATE BONDS, LISTED EQUITIES, MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, STATE,

MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS

TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND, THEREFORE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN HIGH-YIELD DEBT,

CORPORATE BANK LOANS, MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND DISTRESSED DEBT. WE

VALUE THESE INSTRUMENTS USING METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS THE PRESENT

VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS AND GENERALLY DO NOT ADJUST

UNDERLYING VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS UNLESS THERE IS SUBSTANTIVE

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

INSTRUMENT OR VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS (SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR VALUES OF OUR EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC

DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING VALUATION MODELS. WE USE A VARIETY OF

VALUATION MODELS INCLUDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED

CASH FLOWS, OPTION-PRICING MODELS AND OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD

MODELS. THE VALUATION MODELS THAT WE USE TO DERIVE THE FAIR VALUES

OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES REQUIRE INPUTS INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS,

MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY,

PREPAYMENT RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. THE SELECTION OF

A MODEL TO VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL

TERMS OF, AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS

THE AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. WE GENERALLY

USE SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE

VERIFY THE VALUES PRODUCED BY OUR PRICING MODELS TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS,

SUCH AS GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL SELECTION DOES

NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BECAUSE MARKET PRICES ARE READILY

AVAILABLE. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS,

MODEL SELECTION REQUIRES MORE JUDGMENT BECAUSE SUCH INSTRUMENTS

TEND TO BE MORE COMPLEX AND PRICING INFORMATION IS LESS AVAILABLE

IN THE MARKET. AS MARKETS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MORE PRICING

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND REFINE THE

MODELS THAT WE USE.

AT THE INCEPTION OF AN OTC DERIVATIVE

CONTRACT (DAY ONE), WE VALUE THE CONTRACT AT THE MODEL VALUE IF WE

CAN VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. WHEN APPROPRIATE,

VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS

LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS

ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED POLICIES.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS,

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THESE ADJUSTMENTS.

WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY ALL OF THE

SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND VERIFY THE

MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, WE VALUE THE CONTRACT AT THE

TRANSACTION PRICE AT INCEPTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, RECORD NO DAY ONE

GAIN OR LOSS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO. 02-3, ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS

INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

FOLLOWING DAY ONE, WE ADJUST THE

INPUTS TO OUR VALUATION MODELS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT CHANGES IN

SUCH INPUTS CAN BE VERIFIED BY SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR BROKER QUOTES OR CAN BE DERIVED

FROM OTHER SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUCH AS EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD

PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE.

VALUE OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIO. IN THE TABLES ABOVE, FOR

OPTION CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF AN

DATE OF THE UNDERLYING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. IN THOSE INSTANCES

THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVALUATION. WE HEDGE OUR

ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR

INVESTMENT IN SMFG BY BORROWING JAPANESE YEN. FOREIGN

EXCHANGE REVALUATION ON THE INVESTMENT AND THE RELATED

BORROWING ARE GENERALLY EQUAL AND OFFSETTING. FOR

EXAMPLE, IF THE JAPANESE YEN APPRECIATES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR,

THE U.S. DOLLAR CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

SMFG INVESTMENT WILL INCREASE AND THE U.S. DOLLAR

CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED BORROWING WILL ALSO

RESPECTIVELY.

OUR PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY

THEIR NATURE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH

INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY CARRIED AT COST AS AN APPROXIMATION OF

FAIR VALUE. ADJUSTMENTS TO CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE IF THERE ARE

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE. DOWNWARD

ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS, IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN REACHING THAT

DETERMINATION, WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO, THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANIES OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO BUDGETS OR PROJECTIONS, TRENDS

WITHIN SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS, UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODELS, EXPECTED

EXIT TIMING AND STRATEGY, AND ANY SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS CONVERSION FEATURES AND

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.

OUR PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS,

WHICH TEND TO BE LARGE, CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS THAT RESULT FROM

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, ARE

VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES DISCOUNTED FOR RESTRICTIONS ON

SALE. IF LIQUIDATING A POSITION IS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO AFFECT

MARKET PRICES, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY BASED ON

PREDETERMINED WRITTEN POLICIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DERIVED

FROM A MODEL THAT INCORPORATES SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE AND CREDIT

SPREADS, THE IMPACT OF NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY AND THE

DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE. THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENT IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO MOVEMENTS IN THE

SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE. AS A RESULT OF TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND

THE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE, THE

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT

AND CHANGES IN SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE IS NONLINEAR. DURING THE

FISCAL YEAR, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT INCREASED 42%

(EXPRESSED IN JAPANESE YEN), PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE

SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME IN RESPECT OF THE

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK.

GOLDMAN SACHS HAS THE RIGHT TO

CONVERT OUR PREFERRED STOCK INVESTMENT IN SMFG INTO SHARES OF SMFG

COMMON STOCK BEGINNING ON FEBRUARY 8, 2005. THE CURRENT

CONVERSION PRICE IS ¥322,300, BUT THIS PRICE IS SUBJECT TO DOWNWARD

ADJUSTMENT IF THE PRICE OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF

CONVERSION IS LESS THAN THE CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT TO A FLOOR OF

¥106,300). OUR CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENT IS GENERALLY

NONTRANSFERABLE. ONE-THIRD OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF SMFG COMMON

STOCK WILL BECOME TRANSFERABLE ON FEBRUARY 8, 2005, WITH THE

REMAINING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK BECOMING TRANSFERABLE IN EQUAL

INSTALLMENTS ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006 AND FEBRUARY 7, 2007. IN

ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE THE UNDERLYING

COMMON STOCK WILL LAPSE IN THREE EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS

BEGINNING ON FEBRUARY 7, 2005.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

PROPER CONTROLS, INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTING FUNCTIONS, ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY AND CONSISTENTLY VALUED AND

THAT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE RELIABLE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY

IMPORTANT IN VALUING INSTRUMENTS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY.

WE EMPLOY AN OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT

INCLUDES APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT,

INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

OVERSIGHT OF CONTROL AND VALUATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

REPORTING THE RESULTS OF SUCH WORK TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE SEEK

TO MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES, WITH THE APPROPRIATE

EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING, TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL AND INDEPENDENT

PRICE VERIFICATION FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED TO THE HIGHEST

STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, WE EMPLOY PROCEDURES FOR THE APPROVAL OF

NEW TRANSACTION TYPES AND MARKETS, INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION,

REVIEW OF DAILY PROFIT AND LOSS, AND REVIEW OF VALUATION MODELS BY

PERSONNEL WITH APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE OF RELEVANT PRODUCTS

AND MARKETS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE THE RISKS

INHERENT IN OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING BUSINESSES, SEE  RISK

MANAGEMENT INCLUDED BELOW.

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS A RESULT OF OUR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS, PRINCIPALLY WITH SLK LLC (SLK) IN FISCAL 2000, WE

HAVE ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL

IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL.

WE TEST THE GOODWILL IN

EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BY

COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WITH

ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. WE DERIVE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF

OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE-EARNINGS MULTIPLES.

WE DERIVE THE NET BOOK VALUE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS BY

ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT

THE ASSETS OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT. OUR LAST ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT

TEST WAS PERFORMED DURING OUR FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND NO

IMPAIRMENT WAS IDENTIFIED.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE

AMORTIZE OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, AND TEST FOR

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE

FULLY RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET

GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE

CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

DURING THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF

2003, THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE, THE CHICAGO BOARD OPTIONS

EXCHANGE AND THE PHILADELPHIA STOCK EXCHANGE ALL ANNOUNCED PROPOSED

RESTRUCTURING PLANS AND CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE LOSS OF MARKET

SHARE TO THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE, WHICH BECAME THE

LEADING U.S. OPTIONS EXCHANGE DURING 2003. CONSEQUENTLY, WE

TESTED OUR RELATED OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS FOR IMPAIRMENT DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, AND RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$133 MILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION SPECIALIST

RIGHTS WAS DERIVED FROM ESTIMATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. WE ALSO

SURRENDERED CERTAIN OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS IN EARLIER QUARTERS OF

2003, RECOGNIZING TOTAL CHARGES OF $20 MILLION. THERE WERE NO

INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL 2004.

A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN

GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND THE TRADING OF SECURITIES IN MULTIPLE

MARKETS AND ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND/OR IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, AN ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING BY THE

NYSE OR ANY OTHER EXCHANGE ON WHICH WE HOLD SPECIALIST RIGHTS OR AN

ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR COULD INDICATE A

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE ASSOCIATED IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN

ESTIMATES. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES IS ALSO

IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY

ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS. WE

ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS TO THE EXTENT

THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE ESTIMATED, IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR

FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A

CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES

AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE,

OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN SIMILAR CASES, AND

THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF LEGAL COUNSEL. GIVEN THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF OUR LITIGATION MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY IN CASES IN WHICH CLAIMANTS SEEK SUBSTANTIAL OR

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES OF

LOSSES FOR CASES WHERE THERE IS ONLY A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT

A LOSS MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I,

OUR NET REVENUES

WERE $20.55 BILLION IN 2004, AN INCREASE OF 28% COMPARED WITH

2003, REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES, AND

INVESTMENT BANKING. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN FICC, AS

ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES AND REGIONS PERFORMED WELL IN A GENERALLY

FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. NET REVENUES IN OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

BUSINESS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, DUE TO AN UNREALIZED GAIN ON

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG, AS WELL

AS GAINS FROM OTHER CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION,

EQUITIES NET REVENUES IMPROVED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS EARLY IN

2004. EQUITIES OPERATED IN A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT AFTER OUR

FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2004, AS VOLATILITY LEVELS CONTINUED TO

DECLINE AND MARKETS GENERALLY LACKED DIRECTION BEFORE MOVING HIGHER

IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

AN INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE CORPORATE ACTIVITY.

2003 VERSUS 2002.

OUR NET REVENUES

WERE $16.01 BILLION IN 2003, AN INCREASE OF 14% COMPARED WITH

2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER NET REVENUES IN TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS NET REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FICC, WHICH

OPERATED IN A GENERALLY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT THROUGHOUT 2003, AND

BY PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDED AN UNREALIZED GAIN ON OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG. NET REVENUES

IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES INCREASED 14% COMPARED

WITH 2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER CUSTOMER BALANCES IN SECURITIES SERVICES. NET

REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING DECLINED 4% COMPARED WITH 2002, DUE

TO GENERALLY LOWER LEVELS OF CORPORATE ACTIVITY.

OPERATING EXPENSES

OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY

INFLUENCED BY COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR COMPENSATION EXPENSE

REPRESENTS DISCRETIONARY BONUSES, WITH OUR OVERALL COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES GENERALLY TARGETED AT 50% (PLUS OR MINUS A FEW

PERCENTAGE POINTS) OF CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUES. IN ADDITION TO THE

LEVEL OF NET REVENUES, OUR COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR

IS ALSO INFLUENCED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, PREVAILING LABOR

MARKETS, BUSINESS MIX AND THE STRUCTURE OF OUR EQUITY-BASED

COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.

WERE $13.87 BILLION FOR 2004, 20% ABOVE 2003. COMPENSATION AND

REGARDING OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

NON-COMPENSATION-RELATED EXPENSES OF

$4.22 BILLION FOR 2004 INCREASED 4% COMPARED WITH 2003. OTHER

EXPENSES INCLUDED NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS OF $103 MILLION FOR 2004 COMPARED WITH $159 MILLION

FOR 2003. EXCLUDING THESE PROVISIONS, OTHER EXPENSES

INCREASED $258 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, INCREASED

LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND HIGHER CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS.

BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND EXCHANGE FEES INCREASED, REFLECTING HIGHER

TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND

MARKET

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE HIGHER, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING $62 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ESTABLISHMENT OF

GOLDMAN SACHS GAO HUA SECURITIES COMPANY LIMITED IN CHINA, AS WELL

AS HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, PROFESSIONAL FEES

WERE HIGHER, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES. THESE INCREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED AMORTIZATION OF IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (2003 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $188 MILLION,

PRIMARILY IN RESPECT OF OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS) AS WELL

AS LOWER OCCUPANCY AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES.

TOTAL EXIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE

SPACE, WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN OCCUPANCY AND DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, WERE $41 MILLION FOR 2004 COMPARED WITH

$153 MILLION FOR 2003. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

2003 VERSUS 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES

WERE $11.57 BILLION FOR 2003, 8% ABOVE 2002. COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES OF $7.39 BILLION INCREASED 10% COMPARED WITH

2002, WITH HIGHER DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION MORE THAN OFFSETTING

LOWER LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

TO NET REVENUES FOR 2003 WAS 46.2%, DOWN FROM 48.2% FOR 2002, IN

PART REFLECTING LOWER EMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN 2003, WHICH DECREASED 1%

COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 2002. EXCLUDING EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATED WITH

OUR COMBINATION WITH AYCO, EMPLOYMENT LEVELS WERE DOWN 7% FROM

NOVEMBER 2002. EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL 2003, WE BEGAN TO ACCOUNT FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FAIR-VALUE METHOD

PRESCRIBED BY SFAS NO. 123, USING THE PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION

METHOD. THE ADOPTION OF THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BECAUSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED

COMPENSATION GRANTED FOR 2003 WAS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS. SEE NOTE 2 AND NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION.

NON-COMPENSATION-RELATED EXPENSES OF

$4.05 BILLION FOR 2003 INCREASED 10% COMPARED WITH 2002. THIS

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO (I) HIGHER OTHER EXPENSES, WHICH

INCLUDED NET PROVISIONS OF $159 MILLION FOR A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS; (II) INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, REFLECTING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$188 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN RESPECT OF OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS;

AND

(III) EXIT COSTS OF $153 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS

IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE. THESE EXIT COSTS WERE PRIMARILY

REFLECTED IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSES, WITH THE BALANCE IN DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES. EXCLUDING THE AGGREGATE

CHARGES OF $500 MILLION DESCRIBED ABOVE, OUR 2003

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES DECLINED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2002,

REFLECTING LOWER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND

TECHNOLOGY, AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AND BROKERAGE,

CLEARING AND EXCHANGE FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROFESSIONAL

FEES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED LEGAL FEES. THE EXPENSE

DECLINES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF REDUCED EMPLOYMENT

LEVELS, LOWER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED

COST-CONTAINMENT DISCIPLINE.

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVISION FOR TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

2004 WAS 31.8%, DOWN FROM 32.4% FOR 2003. THE CHANGE IN THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 REFLECTED A

DECREASE IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND THE EFFECT OF AUDIT

SETTLEMENTS. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2003 OF 32.4% WAS

DOWN FROM 35.0% IN 2002. THE DECLINE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATE FOR 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE

IN TAX CREDITS AND A DECREASE IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE CAN

VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

GEOGRAPHIC AND BUSINESS MIX OF OUR EARNINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR TAX

CREDITS AND THE EFFECT OF TAX AUDITS. CERTAIN OF THESE AND OTHER

FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR HISTORY OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN INTO

ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR NET DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2004 VERSUS 2003.

NET REVENUES IN

INVESTMENT BANKING OF $3.37 BILLION FOR 2004 INCREASED 24%

COMPARED WITH 2003. NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY OF $1.74 BILLION

INCREASED 45% COMPARED WITH 2003, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS. NET REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS OF $1.64 BILLION

INCREASED 8% COMPARED WITH 2003, REFLECTING A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE PUBLIC COMMON STOCK OFFERINGS

AND INDUSTRY-WIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. THE INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT BANKING NET REVENUES PRIMARILY REFLECTS HIGHER LEVELS OF

ACTIVITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER SECTORS. OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2004 WAS HIGHER THAN THE END OF 2003.

(1)

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.97 BILLION

IN 2004, 19% HIGHER THAN 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OCCUPANCY EXPENSES,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER EXIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE, AND

REDUCED AMORTIZATION OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS 2003 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN

RESPECT OF CERTAIN DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WERE ALSO LOWER.

PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $401 MILLION IN 2004 INCREASED 94% COMPARED WITH 2003.

2003 VERSUS 2002.

NET REVENUES IN

INVESTMENT BANKING OF $2.71 BILLION FOR 2003 DECREASED 4%

COMPARED WITH 2002. NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY OF $1.20 BILLION

DECREASED 20% COMPARED WITH 2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A

DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. NET

REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS OF $1.51 BILLION

INCREASED 13% COMPARED WITH 2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE

IN INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT NEW ISSUANCE ACTIVITY. EQUITY UNDERWRITING

NET REVENUES DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A

DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE TOTAL EQUITY UNDERWRITING VOLUME,

INCLUDING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET

REVENUES FROM CONVERTIBLE ISSUANCES. THE REDUCTION IN INVESTMENT

BANKING NET REVENUES REFLECTS LOWER LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE

INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SECTORS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED ACTIVITY IN THE HEALTHCARE AND NATURAL RESOURCES SECTORS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2003 WAS SLIGHTLY

HIGHER THAN AT THE END OF 2002.

(1)

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.50 BILLION

IN 2003, 2% HIGHER THAN 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, WITH HIGHER DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION MORE THAN OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER LEVELS OF

EMPLOYMENT. THE INCREASE IN DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION IN

INVESTMENT BANKING REFLECTED, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL

PERFORMANCE OF GOLDMAN SACHS, CONTINUED STRONG RELATIVE PERFORMANCE

IN THE BUSINESS (AS EVIDENCED BY OUR HIGH RANKINGS AND MARKET

SHARE), AS WELL AS THE SOMEWHAT IMPROVED BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AT

THE END OF 2003. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO

INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN

DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES, REFLECTING INCREASED

LEGAL FEES, AND INCREASED OCCUPANCY EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

EXIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE.

THESE EXPENSE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OTHER

EXPENSES, MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND COMMUNICATIONS AND

TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF REDUCED EMPLOYMENT

LEVELS, LOWER LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED

COST-CONTAINMENT DISCIPLINE. PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $207 MILLION

IN 2003 DECREASED 45% COMPARED WITH 2002.

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE REVALUATION OR SALE OF THESE

IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY EARLY IN THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY HIGHER

EQUITY PRICES. HOWEVER, VOLATILITY LEVELS CONTINUED TO DECLINE

DURING 2004. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET REVENUES OF $1.33 BILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN UNREALIZED GAIN RELATED TO OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG OF $771 MILLION

(NET OF UNREALIZED FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES ON THE JAPANESE

YEN-DENOMINATED BORROWING FUNDING THIS INVESTMENT), AS WELL AS

GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM OTHER CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $8.29 BILLION

IN 2004, 19% HIGHER THAN 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASED LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT.

OTHER EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION

OF CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND INCREASED

LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND

EXCHANGE FEES WERE HIGHER, REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED, PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER CONSULTING AND LEGAL FEES, AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES INCREASED, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

AMORTIZATION OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS 2003 INCLUDED

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN RESPECT OF OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS. IN

ADDITION, OCCUPANCY EXPENSES DECREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER

EXIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE,

AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WERE LOWER. PRE-TAX

EARNINGS OF $5.04 BILLION IN 2004 INCREASED 44% COMPARED WITH

NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED PERFORMANCES

IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES, WHICH PERFORMED PARTICULARLY WELL

IN 2002. DURING 2003, FICC OPERATED IN A GENERALLY FAVORABLE

ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY TIGHTENING CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS,

LOW INTEREST RATES, A STEEP YIELD CURVE AND STRONG CUSTOMER DEMAND.

EQUITIES NET REVENUES OF $4.28 BILLION INCREASED 7% COMPARED

WITH 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUES IN PRINCIPAL

STRATEGIES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET

REVENUES IN OUR GLOBAL EQUITIES PRODUCTS GROUP, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING LOWER COMMISSION VOLUMES AND CLEARANCE AND EXECUTION

FEES IN OUR U.S. SHARES BUSINESS. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

RECORDED NET REVENUES OF $566 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED AN

UNREALIZED GAIN RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG OF $293 MILLION (NET OF UNREALIZED

FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES ON THE JAPANESE YEN-DENOMINATED BORROWING

FUNDING THIS INVESTMENT), AND GAINS AND OVERRIDES FROM REAL ESTATE

AND OTHER CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $6.94 BILLION

IN 2003, 7% HIGHER THAN 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, WITH HIGHER DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION (REFLECTING INCREASED NET REVENUES) MORE THAN

OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. OPERATING

EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

IN RESPECT OF OPTION SPECIALIST RIGHTS, HIGHER OTHER EXPENSES, AND

INCREASED OCCUPANCY EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO EXIT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN OUR GLOBAL OFFICE SPACE. THESE

EXPENSE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMMUNICATIONS AND

THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE

MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL

AND OTHER INTERESTS IN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIZATION VEHICLES; HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT,

LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS, AND PREFERRED AND COMMON

STOCK IN OTHER NONCONSOLIDATED VEHICLES; ENTERING INTO INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY, COMMODITY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES;

ENTERING INTO OPERATING LEASES; AND PROVIDING GUARANTEES,

INDEMNIFICATIONS, LOAN COMMITMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR

A VARIETY OF BUSINESS PURPOSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

SECURITIZATION OF COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND HOME

EQUITY LOANS, GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS. OTHER REASONS FOR ENTERING INTO THESE

ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE UNDERWRITING CLIENT SECURITIZATION

TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKING

INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, REAL ESTATE AND

OTHER ASSETS; PROVIDING INVESTORS WITH CREDIT-LINKED AND

ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES; AND RECEIVING OR PROVIDING LETTERS OF

CREDIT TO SATISFY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE

CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) AND

QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES) ARE CRITICAL TO THE

FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE

MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MARKETS, SINCE THEY

PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY TO FINANCIAL ASSETS BY OFFERING INVESTORS

ACCESS TO SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS CREATED THROUGH THE

SECURITIZATION PROCESS. OUR FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN, AND DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS WITH, NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT

FAIR VALUE, IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE WE EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER AN ENTITY

AND APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

CAPITAL AND FUNDING

CAPITAL

THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WE HOLD IS

PRINCIPALLY DETERMINED BY SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

REGULATORY AND RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES, AND OUR OVERALL RISK

PROFILE, WHICH IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR

TRADING AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS. GOLDMAN SACHS TOTAL CAPITAL

(SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS) INCREASED 34% TO

$105.78 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 COMPARED WITH $79.11 BILLION

AS OF NOVEMBER 2003. SEE  RISK MANAGEMENT 

LIQUIDITY RISK  CASH FLOWS INCLUDED BELOW, FOR A DISCUSSION

OF HOW WE DEPLOYED CAPITAL RAISED AS PART OF OUR FINANCING

ACTIVITIES.

THE INCREASE IN TOTAL CAPITAL

RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS TO

$80.70 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 FROM $57.48 BILLION AS

OF NOVEMBER 2003. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 WAS APPROXIMATELY 7 YEARS. WE

SWAP A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR

OBLIGATIONS WITH SHORT-TERM FLOATING INTEREST RATES IN

ORDER TO MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS. SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, OUR

RATIO OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY HAS BEEN

INCREASING. THE GROWTH IN OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS HAS BEEN DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY (I) THE NEED TO INCREASE TOTAL CAPITAL IN RESPONSE

TO OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR TRADING AND INVESTING BUSINESSES AND (II) IN

LIGHT OF THE FAVORABLE DEBT FINANCING ENVIRONMENT, OUR

ABILITY TO REPLACE A PORTION OF OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WITH

LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND PRE-FUND NEAR-TERM REFINANCING

REQUIREMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED BY 16%

TO $25.08 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 FROM $21.63 BILLION

AS OF NOVEMBER 2003. DURING 2004, WE REPURCHASED 18.7 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, TO SATISFY MINIMUM

STATUTORY EMPLOYEE TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE

DELIVERY OF SHARES UNDERLYING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, WE CANCELLED

9.1 MILLION RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $95.20 PER

UNIT IN 2004.

OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING

FROM EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AND TO HELP MAINTAIN OUR

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

HAS BEEN EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES,

THE SIZES OF WHICH HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, PREVAILING PRICES AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE

AVERAGE PRICE PAID PER SHARE FOR REPURCHASED SHARES WAS $96.29 AND

$76.83 FOR THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE

UP TO 6.4 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES OF STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR

REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON JANUARY 25, 2005, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF GOLDMAN SACHS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 40.0 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

CREDIT RATINGS

WE RELY UPON THE SHORT-TERM AND

LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING

IS INFLUENCED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT

WHEN WE ARE COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND WHEN WE SEEK TO ENGAGE

IN LONGER TERM TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES. WE BELIEVE

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT RATING

AGENCIES ASSESSMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET AND CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY OF OUR EARNINGS,

OUR FRANCHISE, REPUTATION AND MANAGEMENT, OUR CAPITAL BASE, OUR

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE EXTERNAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. SEE  CERTAIN

DISCUSSION OF OUR POTENTIAL INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR REGULATED ENTITIES, SEE  RISK

MANAGEMENT  LIQUIDITY RISK  INTERCOMPANY FUNDING

INCLUDED BELOW.

THE FINANCIAL GROUPS DIRECTIVE

(DIRECTIVE 2002/87/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE

COUNCIL) INTRODUCED CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE WAY IN WHICH FINANCIAL

CONGLOMERATES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING

IN EUROPE WILL BE REGULATED, WITH THE CHANGES TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY

MEMBER STATES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING IN 2005. THESE CHANGES

WILL CAUSE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTED IN UNREGULATED

ENTITIES TO BECOME SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FORMS OF REGULATION,

INCLUDING CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

REQUIREMENTS. OUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE INVOLVE

APPLYING TO BE SUBJECT TO THE CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY RULES

DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE SEC HAS ADOPTED RULE AMENDMENTS

THAT ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

BROKER-DEALERS THAT ARE PART OF A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY.

AS A CONDITION TO ITS USE OF THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD, A

BROKER-DEALERS ULTIMATE HOLDING COMPANY AND AFFILIATES (REFERRED

TO COLLECTIVELY AS A CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITY OR CSE) MUST

CONSENT TO GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE SEC.

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. ANTICIPATES APPLYING FOR PERMISSION TO USE

THIS ALTERNATIVE METHOD. WE EXPECT THAT DOING SO WILL ENABLE US TO

COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL GROUPS DIRECTIVE

DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON BECOMING SUBJECT TO THE SECS GROUP-WIDE

SUPERVISION, GOLDMAN SACHS WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE SEC

COMPUTATIONS OF OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

RISK MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EFFECTIVE

RISK MANAGEMENT IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN

SACHS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

TO MONITOR, EVALUATE AND MANAGE THE PRINCIPAL RISKS WE ASSUME IN

CONDUCTING OUR ACTIVITIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE MARKET, CREDIT,

LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL EXPOSURES.

RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

GOLDMAN SACHS SEEKS TO MONITOR AND

CONTROL ITS RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL REPORTING

SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

MONITORING RISK EXPOSURES AND FOR GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESS. THESE COMMITTEES, WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE

DESCRIBED BELOW, MEET REGULARLY AND CONSIST OF SENIOR MEMBERS OF

BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE

INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS.

MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.

ALL RISK

CONTROL FUNCTIONS ULTIMATELY REPORT TO OUR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.

THROUGH BOTH DIRECT AND DELEGATED AUTHORITY, THE MANAGEMENT

COMMITTEE APPROVES ALL OF OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, TRADING RISK

PARAMETERS AND CUSTOMER REVIEW GUIDELINES.

RISK COMMITTEES.

BUSINESS UNITS, APPROVES SOVEREIGN CREDIT RISK LIMITS AND CREDIT

RISK LIMITS BY RATINGS GROUP, AND REVIEWS SCENARIO ANALYSES BASED

ON ABNORMAL OR CATASTROPHIC MARKET MOVEMENTS.

THE DIVISIONAL RISK COMMITTEE SETS

MARKET RISK LIMITS, SUBJECT TO OVERALL FIRMWIDE RISK LIMITS, FOR

BOTH FICC AND EQUITIES BASED ON A NUMBER OF MEASURES, INCLUDING

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) AND SCENARIO ANALYSES. IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS, THE CONTROL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, THE INVESTMENT POLICY

GROUP AND THE VALUATION COMMITTEE OVERSEE VARIOUS OPERATIONAL,

CREDIT, VALUATION AND BUSINESS PRACTICE ISSUES.

BUSINESS PRACTICES COMMITTEE.

THE

BUSINESS PRINCIPLES. THE COMMITTEE MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE AREAS SO AS TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL RISKS AND

TO ASSIST IN ENHANCING ADHERENCE TO OUR BUSINESS PRINCIPLES.

CAPITAL COMMITTEE.

THE CAPITAL

COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING COMMITMENTS

OF OUR CAPITAL. SUCH CAPITAL COMMITMENTS INCLUDE EXTENSIONS OF

CREDIT, ALTERNATIVE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS, CERTAIN BOND

UNDERWRITINGS, CERTAIN DISTRESSED DEBT AND PRINCIPAL FINANCE

ACTIVITIES AND CERTAIN EQUITY-LINKED STRUCTURED PRODUCTS. THE

CAPITAL COMMITTEE IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT BUSINESS

AND REPUTATIONAL STANDARDS FOR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS ARE MAINTAINED

ON A GLOBAL BASIS.

COMMITMENTS COMMITTEE.

THE

COMMITMENTS COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES UNDERWRITING AND

DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES AND SETS AND MAINTAINS POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL, REGULATORY

AND BUSINESS STANDARDS ARE MAINTAINED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THESE

ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO REVIEWING SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, THE

COMMITMENTS COMMITTEE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTS STRATEGIC REVIEWS OF

OVERSIGHT ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEES DESCRIBED ABOVE, DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE

INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, SUCH AS COMPLIANCE,

FINANCE, LEGAL, MANAGEMENT CONTROLS (INTERNAL AUDIT) AND

OPERATIONS, IN PART PERFORM RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, WHICH

INCLUDE MONITORING, ANALYZING AND EVALUATING RISK.

BUSINESS UNIT RISK LIMITS ARE

ESTABLISHED BY THE VARIOUS RISK COMMITTEES AND MAY BE FURTHER

ALLOCATED BY THE BUSINESS UNIT MANAGERS TO INDIVIDUAL TRADING

DESKS. TRADING DESK MANAGERS HAVE THE FIRST LINE OF RESPONSIBILITY

FOR MANAGING RISK WITHIN PRESCRIBED LIMITS. THESE MANAGERS HAVE

IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF RISK IN THEIR

INDIVIDUAL MARKETS AND THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO HEDGE THEIR

EXPOSURES.

MARKET RISK LIMITS ARE MONITORED ON A

DAILY BASIS BY THE FINANCE DIVISION, AND ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY

THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE. LIMIT VIOLATIONS ARE REPORTED TO

THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE APPROPRIATE BUSINESS UNIT

MANAGERS. SELECTED BUSINESS UNIT INVENTORY POSITION LIMITS ARE ALSO

MONITORED BY THE FINANCE DIVISION AND POSITION LIMIT VIOLATIONS ARE

REPORTED TO THE APPROPRIATE BUSINESS UNIT MANAGERS AND THE FINANCE

COMMITTEE.

MARKET RISK

THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF OUR TRADING AND INVESTING POSITIONS IS REFERRED TO

AS MARKET RISK. SUCH POSITIONS RESULT FROM MARKET-MAKING,

SPECIALIST AND PROPRIETARY TRADING, INVESTING AND UNDERWRITING

ACTIVITIES.

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE

EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND

COMMODITY PRICES. A DESCRIPTION OF EACH MARKET RISK CATEGORY IS SET

FORTH BELOW.



INTEREST RATE RISKS PRIMARILY RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE

AND CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE, THE VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, MORTGAGE

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF

INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, EQUITY BASKETS AND EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD

PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD

PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL,

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THESE RISKS THROUGH

DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES, CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING

HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY

HEDGE A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCKS BY TAKING AN OFFSETTING POSITION

IN A RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE

AN EXPOSURE MAY, HOWEVER, BE LIMITED BY ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE

LIQUIDITY OF THE SECURITY OR THE RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT AND IN

THE CORRELATION OF PRICE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND RELATED

HEDGE INSTRUMENT.

IN ADDITION TO APPLYING BUSINESS

JUDGMENT, SENIOR MANAGEMENT USES A NUMBER OF QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO

MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. THESE TOOLS INCLUDE.



RISK LIMITS BASED ON A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE REFERRED TO AS VAR;



SCENARIO ANALYSES, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT MEASURE THE

POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON OUR TRADING NET REVENUES OF VARIOUS MARKET EVENTS, INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A LARGE WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN

EQUITY MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT MOVES IN SELECTED EMERGING MARKETS; AND



INVENTORY POSITION LIMITS FOR SELECTED BUSINESS UNITS.

VAR

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF

GOLDMAN SACHS TRADING POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS

OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

FOR THE VAR NUMBERS REPORTED BELOW, A

ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL WERE USED. THIS

MEANS THAT THERE IS A 1 IN 20 CHANCE THAT DAILY TRADING NET

REVENUES WILL FALL BELOW THE EXPECTED DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES BY

AN AMOUNT AT LEAST AS LARGE AS THE REPORTED VAR. THUS, SHORTFALLS

FROM EXPECTED TRADING NET REVENUES ON A SINGLE TRADING DAY GREATER

THAN THE REPORTED VAR WOULD BE ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR, ON AVERAGE,

ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. SHORTFALLS ON A SINGLE DAY CAN EXCEED REPORTED

VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. SHORTFALLS CAN ALSO ACCUMULATE OVER A

LONGER TIME HORIZON SUCH AS A NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

THE VAR NUMBERS BELOW ARE SHOWN

SEPARATELY FOR INTEREST RATE, EQUITY, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS FOR OUR OVERALL TRADING POSITIONS. THE VAR

NUMBERS IN EACH RISK CATEGORY INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING PRODUCT

POSITIONS AND RELATED HEDGES THAT MAY INCLUDE POSITIONS IN OTHER

PRODUCT AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HEDGE OF A FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD

MAY INCLUDE AN INTEREST RATE FUTURES POSITION, AND THE HEDGE OF A

LONG CORPORATE BOND POSITION MAY INCLUDE A SHORT POSITION IN THE

RELATED EQUITY.

THE MODELING OF THE RISK

CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR TRADING POSITIONS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF

ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS. WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPROXIMATIONS ARE REASONABLE, THERE IS NO

UNIFORM INDUSTRY METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING VAR, AND DIFFERENT

ASSUMPTIONS AND/OR APPROXIMATIONS COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT VAR ESTIMATES.

WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE

OUR VAR AND, TO BETTER REFLECT CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WE

GENERALLY WEIGHT HISTORICAL DATA TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE

RECENT OBSERVATIONS. GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS

MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH

THERE ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION OF VAR IS THAT THE DISTRIBUTION

OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE

PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK. DIFFERENT VAR METHODOLOGIES AND

DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

VAR. MOREOVER, VAR CALCULATED FOR A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON DOES NOT

FULLY CAPTURE THE MARKET RISK OF POSITIONS THAT CANNOT BE

LIQUIDATED OR OFFSET WITH HEDGES WITHIN ONE DAY. CHANGES IN VAR

BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS ARE GENERALLY DUE TO CHANGES IN LEVELS OF

EXPOSURE, VOLATILITIES AND/OR CORRELATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE MADE

EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES WAS NOT MATERIAL AND, ACCORDINGLY,

PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED.

(2)

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, WE BEGAN TO

EXCLUDE FROM OUR CALCULATION DISTRESSED ASSET PORTFOLIOS

IN FICC THAT CANNOT BE PROPERLY MEASURED IN VAR. THE

EFFECT OF EXCLUDING THESE PORTFOLIOS WAS NOT MATERIAL TO

PRIOR PERIODS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SUCH PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN

ADJUSTED. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MARKET RISK

EQUALS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIRMWIDE VAR AND

THE SUM OF THE VARS FOR THE FOUR RISK CATEGORIES. THIS

EFFECT ARISES BECAUSE THE FOUR MARKET RISK CATEGORIES ARE

NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED.

OUR AVERAGE DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $67 MILLION

IN 2004 FROM $58 MILLION IN 2003. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO EQUITY PRICES,

CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED

EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS REDUCED VOLATILITIES,

PARTICULARLY IN INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY ASSETS. THE INCREASE IN

AVERAGE DAILY VAR TO $58 MILLION IN 2003 FROM $46 MILLION

IN 2002 WAS DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPOSURE IN ALL PRODUCT

CATEGORIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED VOLATILITIES, PARTICULARLY

IN EQUITY ASSETS.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, WE BEGAN TO

EXCLUDE FROM OUR CALCULATION DISTRESSED ASSET PORTFOLIOS

IN FICC THAT CANNOT BE PROPERLY MEASURED IN VAR. THE

EFFECT OF EXCLUDING THESE PORTFOLIOS WAS NOT MATERIAL TO

PRIOR PERIODS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SUCH PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN

ADJUSTED. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MARKET RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PORTFOLIOS, SEE  DISTRESSED

ASSET PORTFOLIOS BELOW.

(2)

EQUALS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIRMWIDE VAR AND

THE SUM OF THE VARS FOR THE FOUR RISK CATEGORIES. THIS

EFFECT ARISES BECAUSE THE FOUR MARKET RISK CATEGORIES ARE

NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED.

OUR DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $66 MILLION

AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 FROM $63 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2003.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPOSURE

TO COMMODITY PRICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED EXPOSURE TO

CURRENCY RATES AND EQUITY PRICES, AS WELL AS REDUCED VOLATILITIES,

PARTICULARLY IN INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY ASSETS.

DISTRESSED ASSET PORTFOLIOS

THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

DISTRESSED ASSET PORTFOLIOS IN FICC THAT CANNOT BE PROPERLY

MEASURED IN VAR (PRIMARILY DUE TO INADEQUATE HISTORICAL DATA ON THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS IN THE AGGREGATE) IS MEASURED BASED ON A

POTENTIAL 10% DECLINE IN THE ASSET VALUE OF SUCH PORTFOLIOS. THE

MARKET VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING DISTRESSED ASSET POSITIONS ARE

SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING DISCOUNT

RATES AND THE PROJECTED TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. AS

OF NOVEMBER 2004, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A 10% DECLINE IN THE

ASSET VALUE OF THESE PORTFOLIOS WAS $416 MILLION COMPARED WITH

$228 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2003.

NONTRADING RISK

SMFG.

THE MARKET RISK OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS MEASURED

USING A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS THAT ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION

IN OUR NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10% DECLINE IN THE SMFG

COMMON STOCK PRICE. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR

INVESTMENT TO A 10% DECLINE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE WAS $236 MILLION

COMPARED WITH $75 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2003. THE

CHANGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE SMFG COMMON STOCK

PRICE AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. THIS SENSITIVITY

SHOULD NOT BE EXTRAPOLATED TO OTHER MOVEMENTS IN THE SMFG COMMON

STOCK PRICE, AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT AND THE SMFG COMMON STOCK PRICE IS NONLINEAR.

THE

MARKET RISK FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN OUR NONTRADING PORTFOLIO,

INCLUDING OUR MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS BUT EXCLUDING OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG, IS MEASURED

USING A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS THAT ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION

IN OUR NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10% DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS. THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN STOCK PRICE INDICES

AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IN OUR NONTRADING PORTFOLIO. DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS

COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RISK ESTIMATES. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004,

THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR NONTRADING PORTFOLIO (EXCLUDING

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG) TO A 10%

EQUITY MARKET DECLINE WAS $118 MILLION COMPARED WITH $104 MILLION

AS OF NOVEMBER 2003, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN

THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

CREDIT RISK

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS THAT

WE WOULD INCUR IF A COUNTERPARTY OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR

OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD FAILS TO PERFORM UNDER ITS CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TO US. TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE SEEK TO ENTER

INTO NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO

OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. IN

ADDITION, WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES BY ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE US TO OBTAIN

COLLATERAL FROM A COUNTERPARTY OR TO TERMINATE OR RESET THE TERMS

OF TRANSACTIONS AFTER SPECIFIED TIME PERIODS OR UPON THE OCCURRENCE

OF CREDIT-RELATED EVENTS, BY SEEKING THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES OF THE

COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS, AND THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER STRUCTURES AND TECHNIQUES.

FOR MOST BUSINESSES, COUNTERPARTY

CREDIT LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE CREDIT DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS

INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING DEPARTMENTS, BASED ON

GUIDELINES SET BY THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE CREDIT POLICY

COMMITTEE. FOR MOST PRODUCTS, WE MEASURE AND LIMIT CREDIT EXPOSURES

BY REFERENCE TO BOTH CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. WE TYPICALLY

MEASURE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE BASED ON PROJECTED WORST-CASE MARKET

MOVEMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION WITHIN A 95% CONFIDENCE

INTERVAL. FOR COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS, WE ALSO EVALUATE

POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OVER A SHORTER COLLECTION PERIOD, AND GIVE

EFFECT TO THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL RECEIVED. WE FURTHER SEEK TO

MEASURE CREDIT EXPOSURE THROUGH THE USE OF SCENARIO ANALYSES,

STRESS TESTS AND OTHER QUANTITATIVE TOOLS. OUR GLOBAL CREDIT

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MONITOR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO

COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. THE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRMWIDE RISK AND CREDIT POLICY

COMMITTEES, WITH INFORMATION REGARDING OVERALL CREDIT RISK BY

PRODUCT, INDUSTRY SECTOR, COUNTRY AND REGION.

AS OF BOTH NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER

2003, WE HELD U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS

THAT REPRESENTED 5% AND 6% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. IN

ADDITION, MOST OF OUR SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO

RESELL ARE COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL AGENCY

AND OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER

2003, WE DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY

THAT EXCEEDED 5% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE

BEEN INCREASING, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE GROWTH OF OUR

LENDING AND OTC DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS BELOW.

DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS,

SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS, SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, WHICH DERIVE

THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A

COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, IN ORDER TO

FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS OR

AS A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, WE ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO HEDGE OUR NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS AND TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON

OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSOCIATED MARKET RISK CAN ONLY

BE UNDERSTOOD RELATIVE TO THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OR RISKS BEING

HEDGED, OR AS PART OF A BROADER TRADING STRATEGY. ACCORDINGLY, THE

MARKET RISK OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS IS MANAGED WITH ALL OF OUR

OTHER NONDERIVATIVE MARKET RISK.

FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS REFLECT CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS AND ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE

NETTING AGREEMENT. FOR AN OTC DERIVATIVE, OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE IS

DIRECTLY WITH OUR COUNTERPARTY AND CONTINUES UNTIL THE MATURITY OR

TERMINATION OF SUCH CONTRACT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE

DISTRIBUTION, BY CREDIT RATING, OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO OTC DERIVATIVES AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, AFTER

WHERE WE HAVE OBTAINED COLLATERAL FROM A

COUNTERPARTY UNDER A MASTER TRADING AGREEMENT THAT COVERS

MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE ALLOCATED THE

COLLATERAL RATABLY BASED ON EXPOSURE BEFORE GIVING EFFECT

TO SUCH COLLATERAL.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO

INVOLVE LEGAL RISKS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER RISKS, THAT THEY ARE NOT

AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATE FOR A COUNTERPARTY, THAT DOCUMENTATION

HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY EXECUTED OR THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT

BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE

THESE RISKS BY OBTAINING ADVICE OF COUNSEL ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF

AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS ON THE AUTHORITY OF A COUNTERPARTY TO EFFECT

THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION.

LIQUIDITY RISK

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE

TO COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOST FAILURES OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO

INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RESULTING FROM ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

ACCORDINGLY, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO MAINTAIN

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS BOTH FIRM-SPECIFIC AND BROADER

INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO

BE ABLE TO FUND GOLDMAN SACHS AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO

CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER

OF POLICIES ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK.



EXCESS LIQUIDITY  MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE

OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING FINANCING OBLIGATIONS.



ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  ENSURE WE FUND OUR ASSETS WITH THE APPROPRIATE

FINANCING.



INTERCOMPANY FUNDING  MAINTAIN PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY AND MANAGE THE

DISTRIBUTION OF LIQUIDITY ACROSS THE GROUP STRUCTURE.



CRISIS PLANNING  ENSURE ALL FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS BASED ON

STRESS-SCENARIO PLANNING AND FEEDS INTO OUR LIQUIDITY CRISIS PLAN.

83

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCESS LIQUIDITY

MAINTENANCE OF A POOL OF HIGHLY

LIQUID SECURITIES.

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO

PRE-FUND WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR LIKELY CASH NEEDS DURING A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD SUCH EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF

UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT MAY BE SOLD OR PLEDGED

TO PROVIDE SAME-DAY LIQUIDITY. THIS GLOBAL CORE EXCESS LIQUIDITY

IS INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT

NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM

CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PRE-FUNDED POOL OF

EXCESS LIQUIDITY PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS AND

GIVES US SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT

FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING

PRINCIPLES.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO

FINANCING FLOWS. GOLDMAN SACHS BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND ITS CASH NEEDS ARE

DRIVEN BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND

CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING

ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND

SOME TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE AND THE TERMS OR

AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO PRE-FUND LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN

A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND LARGER UNSECURED DEBT BALANCES

THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY IS

STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH

IT INCREASES OUR UNSECURED LIABILITIES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS

SURVIVAL.

THE LOAN VALUE (THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT

OF CASH THAT WOULD BE ADVANCED BY COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST THESE

SECURITIES) OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AVERAGED $41.99 BILLION

IN 2004 AND $38.46 BILLION IN 2003.

SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE FEDERAL RESERVE REPO-ELIGIBLE. OUR

NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED EXCESS INCLUDES ONLY UNENCUMBERED

FRENCH, GERMAN, UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS AND

NON-U.S. DOLLAR OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO THIS NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES AND

CASH WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT

FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT IT IS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND ALL

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE REMAINDER IS HELD IN OUR PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. OPERATING

ENTITIES, PRIMARILY TO BETTER MATCH THE CURRENCY AND

TIMING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE ENTITIES POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY

OBLIGATIONS.

THE SIZE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS

DETERMINED BY AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL TOGETHER WITH A

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS

AND OF GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR LIQUIDITY

IN

ADDITION TO OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AS A RESULT OF

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THESE ASSETS, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA, INCLUDE OTHER GOVERNMENT BONDS,

HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND MARGINABLE

EQUITIES. WE DO NOT INCLUDE THESE SECURITIES IN OUR GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS.

WE MAINTAIN GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND

OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS IN AN AMOUNT THAT, IF PLEDGED OR SOLD,

WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST 110% OF OUR

UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE (OR WHERE

HOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION TO REDEEM) WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

THIS IMPLIES THAT WE COULD FUND OUR POSITIONS ON A SECURED BASIS

FOR ONE YEAR IN THE EVENT WE WERE UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW UNSECURED

DEBT OR LIQUIDATE ASSETS. WE ASSUME CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES THAT

ARE BASED ON STRESS-SCENARIO BORROWING CAPACITY AND WE REVIEW THESE

ASSUMPTIONS ASSET-BY-ASSET AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE ESTIMATED

AGGREGATE LOAN VALUE OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND OUR OTHER

UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AVERAGED $100.51 BILLION IN 2004 AND $76.42 BILLION

IN 2003.

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

ASSET QUALITY AND BALANCE SHEET

COMPOSITION.

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY IS MARKED-TO-MARKET DAILY. OUR

BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN FINANCIAL STATEMENT

DATES AND IS LOWER AT FISCAL PERIOD END THAN WOULD BE OBSERVED ON

AN AVERAGE BASIS. WE REQUIRE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES TO REDUCE

BALANCE SHEET USAGE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE

WITH LIMITS SET BY MANAGEMENT, THEREBY PROVIDING A DISINCENTIVE TO

COMMITTING OUR CAPITAL OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. THESE BALANCE

SHEET REDUCTIONS ARE GENERALLY ACHIEVED DURING THE LAST SEVERAL

WEEKS OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER THROUGH ORDINARY-COURSE, OPEN-MARKET

TRANSACTIONS IN THE MOST LIQUID PORTIONS OF OUR BALANCE SHEET,

PRINCIPALLY U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, SECURITIES

OF FOREIGN SOVEREIGNS, AND MORTGAGE AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS,

AS WELL AS THROUGH THE ROLL-OFF OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND

CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OVER

THE LAST SIX QUARTERS, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND ADJUSTED ASSETS AT

QUARTER END HAVE BEEN, ON AVERAGE, 17% LOWER AND 16% LOWER,

RESPECTIVELY, THAN AMOUNTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OBSERVED, BASED ON

A WEEKLY AVERAGE, OVER THAT PERIOD. THESE DIFFERENCES, HOWEVER,

HAVE NOT RESULTED IN MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RISK, MARKET

RISK OR LIQUIDITY POSITION BECAUSE THEY ARE GENERALLY IN HIGHLY

LIQUID ASSETS THAT ARE TYPICALLY FINANCED ON A SECURED BASIS.

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MAY BE

MORE DIFFICULT TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS DURING TIMES OF MARKET

STRESS AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE GENERALLY HOLD HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL

FOR THESE ASSETS THAN MORE LIQUID TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

ARE CONTINUALLY FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS THROUGH NORMAL SECURED

FUNDING MARKETS AND NONRECOURSE FUNDING. WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING

CAPACITY FOR FUNDING THESE ASSETS ON A TERM SECURED BASIS IN ORDER

TO ENSURE THAT THESE ASSETS MAINTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LOAN VALUE

IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS.

SEE NOTE 3 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD.

APPROPRIATE FINANCING OF ASSET BASE.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THE MATURITY PROFILE OF OUR FUNDING BASE SUCH

THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS PRIOR TO OUR

LIABILITIES COMING DUE, EVEN IN TIMES OF PROLONGED OR SEVERE

LIQUIDITY STRESS. WE GENERALLY DO NOT RELY ON IMMEDIATE SALES OF

ASSETS (OTHER THAN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS) TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY IN

A DISTRESSED ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ORDERLY ASSET

SALES MAY BE PRUDENT AND NECESSARY IN A PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET

SALES, WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL CAPITAL (LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS PLUS SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) TO FUND OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR

AT LEAST ONE YEAR. WE THEREFORE SEEK TO MAINTAIN TOTAL CAPITAL IN

EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE OF THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM FINANCING

REQUIREMENTS.



THE PORTION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED THAT WE BELIEVE COULD NOT BE FUNDED ON

A SECURED BASIS IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, ASSUMING CONSERVATIVE LOAN VALUES;

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND

EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS;



OUR TOTAL CAPITAL OF $105.78 BILLION

AND $79.11 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003,

RESPECTIVELY, EXCEEDED THE AGGREGATE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSERVATIVE LIABILITY STRUCTURE.

WE

STRUCTURE OUR LIABILITIES CONSERVATIVELY TO MINIMIZE REFINANCING

AND BUY-BACK RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, WE EMPHASIZE THE USE OF PROMISSORY

NOTES OVER COMMERCIAL PAPER IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE STABILITY OF

OUR SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FINANCING BASE. WE HAVE ALSO CREATED

INTERNAL GUIDELINES REGARDING THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT MATURING

ON ANY ONE DAY OR DURING ANY SINGLE WEEK OR YEAR AND HAVE AVERAGE

MATURITY TARGETS FOR OUR UNSECURED DEBT PROGRAMS.

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND

DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES GLOBALLY FOR BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED

FUNDING. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL GUIDELINES, INCLUDING THE

AMOUNT OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER THAT CAN BE OWNED AND LETTERS OF

CREDIT THAT CAN BE ISSUED BY ANY SINGLE INVESTOR OR GROUP OF

INVESTORS. WE BENEFIT FROM DISTRIBUTING OUR DEBT ISSUANCES THROUGH

OUR OWN SALES FORCE TO A LARGE, DIVERSE GLOBAL CREDITOR BASE AND WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE CRITICAL TO

OUR LIQUIDITY.

WE ACCESS FUNDING IN A VARIETY OF

MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE ISSUE DEBT

THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS, U.S. REGISTERED

AND 144A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAMS, OFFSHORE

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES OFFERINGS AND OTHER BOND OFFERINGS, U.S. AND

NON-U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND PROMISSORY NOTE ISSUANCES, AND OTHER

METHODS. WE MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND

SECURITIES LENDING MARKETS AND ARRANGE FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT TO BE

ISSUED ON OUR BEHALF.

ADDITIONALLY, SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT

ISSUED BY GROUP INC. DOES NOT CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT WOULD, BASED

SOLELY UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL

RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR OUR STOCK PRICE, TRIGGER A

REQUIREMENT FOR AN EARLY PAYMENT, COLLATERAL SUPPORT, CHANGES IN

TERMS, ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OR THE CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL

FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

INTERCOMPANY FUNDING

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY OUR PARENT

COMPANY, GROUP INC. THE PARENT COMPANY THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY

FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET

THEIR ASSET FINANCING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE

PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THE NECESSARY

CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF THIS

STRATEGY INCLUDE ENHANCED CONTROL AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET

THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ARE

PREDICATED ON OUR ASSUMPTION THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR,

FUNDS OR SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE FROM A SUBSIDIARY TO

ITS PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. AS SUCH, WE ASSUME THAT

CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

IS NOT AVAILABLE TO OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN

ADDITION, WE ASSUME THAT THE GLOBAL CORE EXCESS HELD IN OUR

PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. OPERATING ENTITIES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO

OUR PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND THEREFORE IS AVAILABLE

ONLY TO MEET THE POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE ENTITIES.

IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES

TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO

GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO

FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL

AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY, TO ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES; FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF

NOVEMBER 2004, GROUP INC. HAD $16.21 BILLION OF SUCH EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., ITS

PRINCIPAL U.S. REGULATED BROKER-DEALER, $12.14 BILLION

INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL, A REGISTERED U.K.

BROKER-DEALER, $2.55 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION &

CLEARING, L.P.

(1)

, A U.S. REGULATED

BROKER-DEALER, AND $2.07 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS

(JAPAN) LTD., A TOKYO-BASED BROKER-DEALER. GROUP INC. ALSO HAD

$46.84 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS TO THESE ENTITIES AS OF

NOVEMBER 2004, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INVESTED

IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

GROUP INC. RENAMED SPEAR, LEEDS & KELLOGG, L.P., GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P., EFFECTIVE JANUARY 14, 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO MANAGE OUR INTERCOMPANY

EXPOSURE BY REQUIRING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO

HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE

AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES

THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL

GENERALLY MATURE IN ADVANCE OF THE PARENT COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY

BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES

PLEDGE COLLATERAL AT LOAN VALUE TO THE PARENT COMPANY TO COVER

THEIR INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN SUBORDINATED DEBT) IN

ORDER TO MITIGATE PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY RISK. EQUITY INVESTMENTS

IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH PARENT COMPANY EQUITY

CAPITAL. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, GROUP INC.S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN

SUBSIDIARIES WAS $23.67 BILLION COMPARED WITH ITS SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY OF $25.08 BILLION.

SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICIES.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES IS GENERALLY

EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS

HEDGED. CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, NET OF TAX IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME DECREASED TO $5 MILLION

FOR 2004 COMPARED WITH $128 MILLION FOR 2003, PRIMARILY

DUE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR POLICY FOR HEDGING OUR NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY HEDGE THE

NONTRADING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THAT ARISES FROM

TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE TRANSACTING

ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

CRISIS PLANNING

IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR A

LIQUIDITY EVENT, OR A PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS, WE BASE OUR

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND OUR RESULTING FUNDING AND

LIQUIDITY POLICIES ON CONSERVATIVE STRESS-SCENARIO PLANNING.

IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A LIQUIDITY

CRISIS PLAN THAT SPECIFIES AN APPROACH FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING

TO A LIQUIDITY-THREATENING EVENT. THE PLAN PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK

TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELY IMPACT OF A LIQUIDITY EVENT ON GOLDMAN SACHS

BASED ON SOME OF THE RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE AND OUTLINES WHICH AND

TO WHAT EXTENT LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE

IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. IT ALSO LISTS THE

CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTIES TO BE

CONTACTED TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION.

CASH FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION,

OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED AND BEAR LITTLE

RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE

BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN

EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO

TRENDS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESS.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2004.

OUR CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $2.72 BILLION TO $4.37 BILLION

AT THE END OF 2004. WE RAISED $31.75 BILLION IN NET

CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY IN LONG-TERM DEBT, IN

LIGHT OF THE FAVORABLE DEBT FINANCING ENVIRONMENT. WE USED NET CASH

OF $34.47 BILLION IN OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE ON TRADING AND INVESTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR

OURSELVES AND OUR CLIENTS, TO MEET ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS AT SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND

TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SUPPORT FOR OUR WILLIAM STREET LOAN

COMMITMENTS PROGRAM.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2003.

OUR CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $2.27 BILLION TO $7.09 BILLION

AT THE END OF 2003. WE RAISED $20.58 BILLION IN NET

CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY IN LONG-TERM DEBT. WE

USED NET CASH OF $18.32 BILLION IN OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING

ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE ON OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF

INVESTMENTS THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO FUND IN PERIODS OF MARKET

STRESS. WE ALSO INCREASED OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS LIQUIDITY,

PROVIDED FUNDING SUPPORT FOR OUR WILLIAM STREET LOAN COMMITMENTS

PROGRAM, INVESTED IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG AND

FINANCED THE ACQUISITION OF EAST COAST POWER L.L.C.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2002.

OUR CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $2.09 BILLION TO $4.82 BILLION

AT THE END OF 2002. WE RAISED $9.09 BILLION IN NET CASH

FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY IN NET SHORT-TERM DEBT AND

LONG-TERM DEBT (NET OF REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT). WE USED NET

CASH OF $11.18 BILLION IN OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY TO CAPITALIZE ON OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF

INVESTMENTS THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO FUND IN PERIODS OF MARKET

STRESS. WE ALSO INCREASED OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS LIQUIDITY, MADE

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND PURCHASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND

TECHNOLOGY-RELATED EQUIPMENT.

OPERATIONAL RISK

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO THE RISK

OF LOSS ARISING FROM SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN INTERNAL

PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR SYSTEMS, AND FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OPERATIONAL

RISK CAN ARISE FROM MANY FACTORS RANGING FROM MORE OR LESS ROUTINE

PROCESSING ERRORS TO POTENTIALLY COSTLY INCIDENTS ARISING, FOR

EXAMPLE, FROM MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILURES. OPERATIONAL RISK MAY ALSO

ENTAIL REPUTATIONAL HARM. THUS, EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY, MANAGE AND

MITIGATE OPERATIONAL RISK MUST BE EQUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE RISK OF

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AS WELL AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS.

WE MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH

THE APPLICATION OF LONG STANDING, BUT CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING,

FIRMWIDE CONTROL STANDARDS; THE TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND

DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE; THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND COMMITMENT

OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND

MITIGATING KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS AT BOTH THE BUSINESS UNIT LEVEL

AND FOR THE FIRM AS A WHOLE; AND A FRAMEWORK OF STRONG AND

INDEPENDENT CONTROL DEPARTMENTS THAT MONITOR QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE INDICATORS OF OPERATIONAL RISK. TOGETHER, THESE

ELEMENTS COMPRISE A STRONG FIRMWIDE CONTROL CULTURE THAT IS AT THE

CENTER OF OUR EFFORTS AIMED AT MINIMIZING OPERATIONAL SHORTCOMINGS

AND THE DAMAGE THEY CAN CAUSE.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK DEPARTMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION OF THE DESIGN,

IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE OF OUR OVERALL OPERATIONAL RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. THIS FRAMEWORK, WHICH EVOLVES WITH THE

CHANGING NEEDS OF BUSINESS COMPLEXITIES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE,

TAKES INTO ACCOUNT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS,

BUSINESS UNIT SPECIFIC RISK ASSESSMENTS, THE ONGOING ANALYSIS OF

BUSINESS SPECIFIC RISK METRICS AND THE USE OF SCENARIO ANALYSIS.

WHILE THE DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTROL AND MITIGATION OF

OPERATIONAL RISK LIES WITH THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS, THIS

FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING AND

MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS FOR BOTH INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS

UNIT MANAGERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION

(FIN) NO. 46-R. FIN NO. 46-R REPLACED FIN NO. 46,

WHICH WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY 2003. AS PERMITTED, WE ADOPTED

EITHER FIN NO. 46 OR FIN NO. 46-R FOR SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL VIES IN WHICH WE HELD A VARIABLE INTEREST AS OF NOVEMBER 2003.

AS OF MAY 2004, WE ADOPTED FIN NO. 46-R FOR ALL VIES IN

WHICH WE HELD A VARIABLE INTEREST. THE EFFECT OF OUR ADOPTION OF FIN NO. 46

AND FIN NO. 46-R WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 132

(REVISED 2003), EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT

PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. SFAS NO. 132

(REVISED 2003) AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS BY REQUIRING ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES SUCH AS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TYPES OF PLAN ASSETS,

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, MEASUREMENT DATES, PLAN OBLIGATIONS, CASH

FLOWS AND COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COSTS RECOGNIZED

DURING INTERIM PERIODS. THE STATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE THE

MEASUREMENT OR RECOGNITION OF PLAN ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS. WE

ADOPTED THE INTERIM PERIOD DISCLOSURES BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. AS REQUIRED, WE ADOPTED THE ANNUAL

DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER

2004. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

IN MAY 2004, THE FASB ISSUED THE FASB

STAFF POSITION (FSP) NO. FAS 106-2, ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH SUPERSEDES FSP NO. FAS 106-1

OF THE SAME TITLE ISSUED IN JANUARY 2004. THE

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF

2003 (THE MEDICARE ACT) INTRODUCES A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF

RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT

LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D. MANAGEMENT HAS

CONCLUDED THAT, IF PROVISIONS ARE FINALIZED IN THEIR CURRENT FORM,

BENEFITS PROVIDED UNDER OUR PLAN MEET THE ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT

STANDARD SET FORTH IN THE MEDICARE ACT. AS PERMITTED, WE

PROSPECTIVELY ADOPTED FSP NO. FAS 106-2 IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THEREBY REDUCING OUR ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION BY $13 MILLION. THE IMPACT ON NET PERIODIC

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST IN FUTURE PERIODS IS NOT EXPECTED TO

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED A

REVISION TO SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION, SFAS NO. 123-R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. SFAS NO. 123-R

FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN

ENTITY EXCHANGES ITS EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE SERVICES AND

GENERALLY ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR THE ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS

IN WHICH AN ENTITY OBTAINS GOODS OR SERVICES IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

TRANSACTIONS. SFAS NO. 123-R IS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT

OF ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123-R, BUT DO NOT EXPECT ADOPTION

TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (THE

FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE

SUPERVISION OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL

FINANCIAL OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

AS OF THE END OF THE FIRMS 2004

FISCAL YEAR, MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS

ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 26, 2004 IS

EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND

FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCES THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY

TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT

RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE

FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 26, 2004 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON PAGES 93

AND 94, WHICH EXPRESSES UNQUALIFIED OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 26, 2004.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC..

WE HAVE COMPLETED AN INTEGRATED AUDIT

OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.S 2004 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF NOVEMBER 26, 2004 AND AUDITS OF ITS 2003 AND 2002

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS

OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT

NOVEMBER 26, 2004 AND NOVEMBER 28, 2003, AND THE RESULTS OF

ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE FISCAL

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 26, 2004 IN CONFORMITY

WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS

TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF

THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING ON PAGE 92, THAT THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF NOVEMBER 26, 2004 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS

FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF NOVEMBER 26, 2004, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN

NOTE 1.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (GROUP

INC.), A DELAWARE CORPORATION, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE FIRM), IS A LEADING GLOBAL

INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM THAT

PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES WORLDWIDE TO A SUBSTANTIAL AND

DIVERSIFIED CLIENT BASE THAT INCLUDES CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES ARE DIVIDED

INTO THREE SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANKING.

THE FIRM PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF INVESTMENT BANKING

SERVICES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS

AND INDIVIDUALS.



TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM FACILITATES CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS

WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND

INDIVIDUALS AND TAKES PROPRIETARY POSITIONS THROUGH MARKET MAKING IN, AND TRADING

OF, FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND DERIVATIVES ON

SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ENGAGES IN FLOOR-BASED AND ELECTRONIC MARKET

MAKING AS A SPECIALIST ON U.S. EQUITIES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES AND CLEARS

CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS MERCHANT BANKING AND OTHER INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, THE

FIRM MAKES PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT THE FIRM RAISES

AND MANAGES.



ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

THE FIRM OFFERS A BROAD ARRAY OF

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, ADVICE AND PLANNING ACROSS ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES TO A

DIVERSE GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE, AND PROVIDES PRIME

BROKERAGE, FINANCING SERVICES AND SECURITIES LENDING SERVICES TO MUTUAL FUNDS,

PENSION FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, FOUNDATIONS AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE.

NOTE 2.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF GROUP INC. AND ALL OTHER

ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST.

ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN

ELIMINATED. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE

ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY

(VIE) OR A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY (QSPE) UNDER GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.



VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE

TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE

ITSELF INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB

LOSSES, THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE RESIDUAL RETURNS AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

THE ENTITYS ACTIVITIES. VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 51, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED. ARB NO. 51 STATES THAT THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY VOTING

INTEREST. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT

HAS THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTING INTEREST.



VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT LACK ONE OR MORE OF THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY. A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A

VIE IS PRESENT WHEN AN ENTERPRISE HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST, OR A COMBINATION OF

VARIABLE INTERESTS, THAT WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES,

RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH.

100

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE ENTERPRISE WITH A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY,

CONSOLIDATES THE VIE.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE BY FIRST PERFORMING A

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VIE THAT INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

CONTRACTUAL TERMS, WHICH VARIABLE INTERESTS CREATE OR ABSORB VARIABILITY, RELATED PARTY

RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DESIGN OF THE VIE. WHERE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE

FIRM PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING A VIES EXPECTED LOSSES

AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS TO THE VIES VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, THE FIRM UTILIZES THE

TOP DOWN METHOD. UNDER THAT METHOD, THE FIRM CALCULATES ITS SHARE OF THE VIES EXPECTED

LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS USING THE SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED

TO IT, BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND/OR THE FIRMS POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE

OF THE VIE, UNDER VARIOUS PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED SCENARIOS.

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 46-R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, IN DECEMBER 2003. FIN NO. 46-R

REPLACED FIN NO. 46, WHICH WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY 2003. AS PERMITTED, THE FIRM

ADOPTED EITHER FIN NO. 46 OR FIN NO. 46-R FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL VIES IN

WHICH IT HELD A VARIABLE INTEREST AS OF NOVEMBER 2003. AS OF MAY 2004, THE FIRM ADOPTED FIN NO. 46-R

FOR ALL VIES IN WHICH IT HELD A VARIABLE INTEREST.



QSPES.

QSPES ARE PASSIVE ENTITIES THAT HOLD FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO THEM

AND ARE COMMONLY USED IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO.

140, ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES, AND FIN NO. 46-R, THE FIRM DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE QSPES.



EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT EXERTS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING

AND FINANCIAL POLICIES (GENERALLY DEFINED AS OWNING A VOTING INTEREST OF 20% TO

50%) AND HAS AN INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OR IN-SUBSTANCE COMMON STOCK, THE FIRM

ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18, THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK.



OTHER.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY OR APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM ALSO HAS FORMED NUMEROUS

NONCONSOLIDATED MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS

THAT ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE FIRM ACTS

AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR THESE FUNDS AND DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF

THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN ANY FUND. WHERE THE FIRM HOLDS MORE THAN

A MINOR INTEREST IN A FUND, IT IS SUBJECT TO REMOVAL AS GENERAL

PARTNER. SUCH FUND INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE

ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE

PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, TAX AUDITS AND OTHER MATTERS THAT AFFECT

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.

THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE

INFORMATION; NONETHELESS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN, ALL

REFERENCES TO NOVEMBER 2004, NOVEMBER 2003 AND NOVEMBER 2002 REFER

TO THE FIRMS FISCAL YEARS ENDED, OR THE DATES, AS THE CONTEXT

REQUIRES,

SHORT-TERM COLLATERALIZED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND ARE CARRIED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT THEIR

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. THESE AMOUNTS ARE

PRESENTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS WHEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF

FIN NO. 41, OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OR FIN NO. 39,

OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS, ARE

SATISFIED. THE FIRM TAKES POSSESSION OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO RESELL, MAKES DELIVERY OF SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE

SECURITIES ON A DAILY BASIS AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL AS APPROPRIATE.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED ARE

RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR

RECEIVED. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY COLLATERALIZED BY CASH,

SECURITIES OR LETTERS OF CREDIT. THE FIRM TAKES POSSESSION OF

SECURITIES BORROWED, MAKES DELIVERY OF SECURITIES LOANED, MONITORS

THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED, AND DELIVERS OR

OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AS APPROPRIATE. INTEREST INCOME OR

EXPENSE ON REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES OVER THE LIFE OF THE

TRANSACTION.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION REFLECT PURCHASES

AND SALES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON A TRADE-DATE BASIS.

TOTAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED,

AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET

PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION CONSIST OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, WITH RELATED

UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRMS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT

AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION

BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM

SEPARATES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO THREE CATEGORIES  CASH

(I.E., NONDERIVATIVE) TRADING INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.



CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE

GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, BROKER OR DEALER

PRICE QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED IN THIS MANNER INCLUDE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, OTHER SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, LIQUID

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BONDS, LISTED EQUITIES, MONEY MARKET

SECURITIES, STATE, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL OBLIGATIONS, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES.

102

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND, THEREFORE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN HIGH-YIELD DEBT, CORPORATE BANK LOANS,

MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND DISTRESSED DEBT. THE FIRM VALUES THESE INSTRUMENTS USING

METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS AND GENERALLY DOES

NOT ADJUST UNDERLYING VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS UNLESS THERE IS SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING

A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT OR VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS (SUCH AS SIMILAR

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RATIOS AND CHANGES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE

UNDERLYING COMPANIES).

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY THE FIRM (LONG POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND

INSTRUMENTS SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS) ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. IF

LIQUIDATING A POSITION IS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO AFFECT ITS PREVAILING MARKET PRICE, THE

VALUATION IS ADJUSTED GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED POLICIES. IN

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE

USED TO DETERMINE THIS ADJUSTMENT.



DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONSIST OF

EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES AND REFLECT CASH THAT

THE FIRM HAS PAID AND RECEIVED (FOR EXAMPLE, OPTION PREMIUMS OR CASH PAID OR

RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS). FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC

DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING VALUATION MODELS. THE FIRM USES A VARIETY OF VALUATION

MODELS INCLUDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS, OPTION-PRICING

MODELS AND OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD MODELS. THE VALUATION MODELS USED TO DERIVE THE

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS OTC DERIVATIVES REQUIRE INPUTS INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL

TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY,

PREPAYMENT RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. THE SELECTION OF A MODEL TO VALUE

AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF, AND SPECIFIC RISKS

INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN

THE MARKET. THE FIRM GENERALLY USES SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM VERIFIES THE VALUES PRODUCED BY ITS PRICING MODELS TO

MARKET TRANSACTIONS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS

GENERIC FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT BECAUSE MARKET PRICES ARE READILY AVAILABLE. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT

TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS, MODEL SELECTION REQUIRES MORE JUDGMENT BECAUSE SUCH

INSTRUMENTS TEND TO BE MORE COMPLEX AND PRICING INFORMATION IS LESS AVAILABLE IN

THE MARKET. AS MARKETS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MORE PRICING INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND REFINE THE MODELS IT USES.

AT THE INCEPTION OF AN OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACT (DAY ONE), THE FIRM VALUES THE CONTRACT AT

THE MODEL VALUE IF THE FIRM CAN VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS. WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE OR PREDETERMINED POLICIES. IN

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS FOR HIGHLY ILLIQUID POSITIONS, MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE

USED TO DETERMINE THESE ADJUSTMENTS.

WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

AND VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM VALUES THE CONTRACT AT THE TRANSACTION

PRICE AT INCEPTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, RECORDS NO DAY ONE GAIN OR LOSS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 02-3, ISSUES INVOLVED IN ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND CONTRACTS INVOLVED IN ENERGY TRADING AND

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

103

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

FOLLOWING DAY ONE, THE FIRM ADJUSTS THE INPUTS TO VALUATION MODELS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT

CHANGES IN SUCH INPUTS CAN BE VERIFIED BY SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY PRICING

SERVICES AND/OR BROKER QUOTES OR CAN BE DERIVED FROM OTHER SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE SUCH AS

EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

IN VALUING CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO IS SEPARATED INTO INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE

COMPANIES, INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC COMPANIES (EXCLUDING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUMITOMO MITSUI FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (SMFG)) AND

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN SMFG.

THE FIRMS PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY CARRIED AT COST AS AN APPROXIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE. ADJUSTMENTS TO CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE IF THERE ARE THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN REACHING THAT DETERMINATION, MANY FACTORS ARE

CONSIDERED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO BUDGETS OR PROJECTIONS, TRENDS WITHIN

SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS, UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODELS, EXPECTED EXIT TIMING AND STRATEGY, AND

ANY SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS CONVERSION FEATURES AND

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.

THE FIRMS PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE LARGE, CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS THAT

RESULT FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS, ARE VALUED USING

QUOTED MARKET PRICES DISCOUNTED FOR RESTRICTIONS ON SALE. IF LIQUIDATING A POSITION IS

REASONABLY EXPECTED TO AFFECT MARKET PRICES, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY BASED ON

PREDETERMINED WRITTEN POLICIES.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SMFG IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE,

WHICH IS DERIVED FROM A MODEL THAT INCORPORATES SMFGS COMMON STOCK PRICE AND CREDIT

SPREADS, THE IMPACT OF NONTRANSFERABILITY AND ILLIQUIDITY AND DOWNSIDE PROTECTION ON THE

CONVERSION STRIKE PRICE. THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT TO CONVERT ITS PREFERRED STOCK INVESTMENT IN

SMFG INTO SHARES OF SMFG COMMON STOCK BEGINNING ON FEBRUARY 8, 2005. THE CURRENT

CONVERSION PRICE IS ¥322,300, BUT THIS PRICE IS SUBJECT TO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IF THE PRICE

OF SMFG COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF CONVERSION IS LESS THAN THE CONVERSION PRICE (SUBJECT TO

A FLOOR OF ¥106,300). THE FIRMS CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENT IS GENERALLY

NONTRANSFERABLE. ONE-THIRD OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF SMFG COMMON STOCK WILL BECOME

TRANSFERABLE ON FEBRUARY 8, 2005, WITH THE REMAINING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK BECOMING

TRANSFERABLE IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006 AND FEBRUARY 7, 2007. IN

ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO HEDGE THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK WILL LAPSE

IN THREE EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING ON FEBRUARY 7, 2005.

IN GENERAL, TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES UNDER SFAS NO. 140 WHEN

THE FIRM HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. FOR

TRANSFERS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, ANY RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES. TRANSFERS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS

SALES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS,

WITH THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES OVER

THE LIVES OF THE TRANSACTIONS.

COMMISSIONS.

THE FIRM GENERATES

COMMISSIONS FROM EXECUTING AND CLEARING CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON

STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES MARKETS WORLDWIDE. THESE COMMISSIONS ARE

RECORDED ON A TRADE-DATE BASIS IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AS AMENDED BY

SFAS NO. 148, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE, USING THE PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION

METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD OF ADOPTION, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS

OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED FOR FISCAL 2003

AND FUTURE YEARS. NO UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS INCLUDED IN

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY FOR SUCH STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS GRANTED. RATHER, SUCH STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY UNDER SFAS NO. 123

WHEN SERVICES REQUIRED FROM EMPLOYEES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE

AWARDS ARE RENDERED AND EXPENSED.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM

THEREFORE, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED

FOR UNMODIFIED STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED FOR YEARS PRIOR TO FISCAL 2003

THAT HAD NO INTRINSIC VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ISSUED FOR THE YEARS PRIOR TO

FISCAL 2003 WAS, AND CONTINUES TO BE, RECOGNIZED OVER THE RELEVANT

EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123

ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS WHEN PAID.

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT ARE LATER

FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES ARE RECLASSIFIED TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FROM RETAINED EARNINGS. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS GRANTED FOR THE YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2002 AND PRIOR

YEARS, ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, ARE CHARGED TO

COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

IF THE FIRM WERE TO RECOGNIZE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE RELEVANT SERVICE PERIOD UNDER THE

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED

COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS AT

ACQUISITION DATE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL IS TESTED AT LEAST

ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS TRIGGERED IF THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS LESS THAN ITS

ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. SUCH LOSS IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH

CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CUSTOMER LISTS AND SPECIALIST RIGHTS, ARE

AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET

GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE

VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE SUM OF THE

ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET

GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET

OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE SUM OF THE EXPECTED

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS

LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

THE FIRMS OPERATING LEASES INCLUDE

SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF CURRENT NEEDS. RENT EXPENSE RELATING TO

SPACE HELD FOR GROWTH IS INCLUDED IN OCCUPANCY IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM RECORDS A LIABILITY, BASED ON THE REMAINING

LEASE RENTALS REDUCED BY ANY POTENTIAL OR EXISTING SUBLEASE

RENTALS, FOR LEASES WHERE THE FIRM HAS CEASED USING THE SPACE AND

MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT DERIVE ANY FUTURE

ECONOMIC BENEFITS. COSTS TO TERMINATE A LEASE BEFORE THE END OF ITS

TERM ARE RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE UPON TERMINATION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN

NON-U.S. CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE

PREVAILING ON THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE

RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. GAINS OR LOSSES ON

TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A NON-U.S. OPERATION,

WHEN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR,

ARE INCLUDED, NET OF HEDGES AND TAXES, ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE FIRM SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS

NET INVESTMENT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

THROUGH THE USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS,

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD

EXCHANGE RATES; ACCORDINGLY, FORWARD POINTS ARE REFLECTED AS A

COMPONENT OF THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED ON

CHANGES IN SPOT RATES.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE RECOGNIZED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF THE FIRMS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

TO THE AMOUNT THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE REALIZED. THE

FIRMS TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF

OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION. TAX PROVISIONS ARE COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

RELATED TO INCOME TAXES ARE RECORDED WHEN THE CRITERIA FOR LOSS

RECOGNITION UNDER SFAS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONTINGENCIES, AS AMENDED, HAVE BEEN MET.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING

NET EARNINGS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING. COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING INCLUDES COMMON STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS FOR WHICH NO FUTURE SERVICE IS REQUIRED AS A

CONDITION TO THE DELIVERY OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. DILUTED

EPS INCLUDES THE DETERMINANTS OF BASIC EPS AND, IN ADDITION,

REFLECTS THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF THE COMMON STOCK DELIVERABLE

PURSUANT TO STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS FOR WHICH

FUTURE SERVICE IS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION TO THE DELIVERY OF THE

UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE FIRM DEFINES CASH EQUIVALENTS AS

HIGHLY LIQUID OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS HELD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN NO. 46-R.

FIN NO. 46-R REPLACED FIN NO. 46,

WHICH WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY 2003. AS PERMITTED, THE FIRM

ADOPTED EITHER FIN NO. 46 OR FIN NO. 46-R FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL VIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HELD A VARIABLE INTEREST

AS OF NOVEMBER 2003. AS OF MAY 2004, THE FIRM ADOPTED FIN NO. 46-R

FOR ALL VIES IN WHICH IT HELD A VARIABLE INTEREST. THE

EFFECT OF THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF FIN NO. 46 AND FIN NO. 46-R

WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 132

(REVISED 2003), EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT

PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. SFAS NO. 132

(REVISED 2003) AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS BY REQUIRING ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES SUCH AS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TYPES OF PLAN ASSETS,

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, MEASUREMENT DATES, PLAN OBLIGATIONS, CASH

FLOWS AND COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COSTS RECOGNIZED

DURING INTERIM PERIODS. THE STATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE THE

MEASUREMENT OR RECOGNITION OF PLAN ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM

ADOPTED THE INTERIM PERIOD DISCLOSURES BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. AS REQUIRED, THE FIRM ADOPTED THE

ANNUAL DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRMS FISCAL YEAR

ENDING NOVEMBER 2004. SEE NOTE 11 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

REGARDING THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

STAFF POSITION (FSP) NO. FAS 106-2, ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH SUPERSEDES FSP NO. FAS 106-1

OF THE SAME TITLE ISSUED IN JANUARY 2004. THE

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF

2003 (THE MEDICARE ACT) INTRODUCES A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF

RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT

LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D. MANAGEMENT HAS

CONCLUDED THAT, IF PROVISIONS ARE FINALIZED IN THEIR CURRENT FORM,

BENEFITS PROVIDED UNDER THE FIRMS PLAN MEET THE ACTUARIALLY

EQUIVALENT STANDARD SET FORTH IN THE MEDICARE ACT. AS PERMITTED,

THE FIRM PROSPECTIVELY ADOPTED FSP NO. FAS 106-2 IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRMS ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $13 MILLION. THE IMPACT ON NET PERIODIC

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST IN FUTURE PERIODS IS NOT EXPECTED TO

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED A

REVISION TO SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION, SFAS NO. 123-R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. SFAS NO. 123-R

FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN

ENTITY EXCHANGES ITS EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE SERVICES AND

GENERALLY ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR THE ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS

IN WHICH AN ENTITY OBTAINS GOODS OR SERVICES IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

TRANSACTIONS. SFAS NO. 123-R IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRMS

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005. MANAGEMENT IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING

THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123-R, BUT DOES NOT

EXPECT ADOPTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS,

SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS, SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, WHICH DERIVE

THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A

COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES MAY INVOLVE FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR COMMODITIES, OR TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY OR

INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE

SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED RATES,

SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY

OBLIGATIONS, AND INDEXED DEBT INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT CONSIDERED

DERIVATIVES EVEN THOUGH THEIR VALUES OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED CASH

FLOWS ARE DERIVED FROM THE PRICE OF SOME OTHER SECURITY OR INDEX.

HOWEVER, CERTAIN COMMODITY-RELATED CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURE, AS THESE CONTRACTS MAY BE SETTLED IN

CASH OR ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, IN

ORDER TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY

POSITIONS OR AS A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. RISK EXPOSURES ARE

MANAGED THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION, BY CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND

BY ESTABLISHING HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAY HEDGE A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCK BY TAKING

AN OFFSETTING POSITION IN A RELATED EQUITY-INDEX FUTURES CONTRACT.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES USED FOR TRADING PURPOSES ARE

GENERALLY INCLUDED IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, THE FIRM ENTERS

INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

(SEE NOTE 2 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING

THE FIRMS POLICY ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION) AND TO MANAGE

THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

AND CERTAIN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. TO MANAGE EXPOSURE ON ITS

BORROWINGS, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVES TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR-BASED

FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM APPLIES FAIR-VALUE

HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE BENCHMARK

INTEREST RATE (I.E., LIBOR) ON ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS REFLECT CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS AND ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS IN THE

DEFERRABLE INTEREST JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

IN FEBRUARY 2004, GOLDMAN SACHS

CAPITAL I (THE TRUST), A WHOLLY OWNED DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST,

WAS FORMED BY THE FIRM FOR THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSES OF (I) ISSUING

$2.75 BILLION OF GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS AND $85 MILLION OF COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE

TRUST, (II) INVESTING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE TO PURCHASE

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM GROUP INC. AND (III) ENGAGING

IN ONLY THOSE OTHER ACTIVITIES NECESSARY OR INCIDENTAL TO

THESE PURPOSES. THE PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS WERE PURCHASED

BY THIRD PARTIES, AND, AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM HELD ALL OF

THE COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS.

THE TRUST IS A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE

SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM FOR LEGAL AND REGULATORY PURPOSES. HOWEVER,

FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, UNDER FIN NO. 46-R, THE TRUST IS

NOT A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM BECAUSE THE FIRMS

OWNERSHIP OF THE COMMON BENEFICIAL INTEREST IS NOT CONSIDERED AT

RISK, SINCE THE TRUSTS PRINCIPAL ASSET IS THE $2.84 BILLION OF

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM PAYS

INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY ON THESE DEBENTURES AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF

6.345% AND THE DEBENTURES MATURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2034. THE

COUPON RATE AND PAYMENT DATES APPLICABLE TO THE BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ARE THE SAME AS THE INTEREST RATE AND PAYMENT DATES

APPLICABLE TO THE DEBENTURES. SEE NOTE 6 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS GUARANTEE OF THE PREFERRED

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE TRUST.

THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT, FROM TIME TO

TIME, TO DEFER PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEBENTURES, AND, THEREFORE, CAUSE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON THE

TRUSTS PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO BE DEFERRED, IN EACH CASE

FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE SEMIANNUAL PERIODS, AND DURING ANY SUCH

EXTENSION PERIOD GROUP INC. WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR MAKE CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON

STOCK. THE TRUST IS NOT PERMITTED TO PAY ANY DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE

COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY THE FIRM UNLESS ALL DIVIDENDS

PAYABLE ON THE PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HAVE BEEN PAID IN

FULL.

FORMED TO RAISE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE WILLIAM STREET CREDIT

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT

THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY

BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH

118

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

WHICH CLAIMANTS SEEK SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE FIRM

CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES OF LOSSES FOR CASES WHERE THERE IS

ONLY A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED.

GUARANTEES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE UNDER

FIN NO. 45. SUCH DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS INCLUDE CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS, WRITTEN EQUITY AND COMMODITY PUT OPTIONS, WRITTEN

CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS, FLOORS AND SWAPTIONS. FIN NO. 45

DOES NOT REQUIRE DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS IF SUCH CONTRACTS MAY BE CASH SETTLED AND THE FIRM HAS NO

BASIS TO CONCLUDE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES HELD, AT

INCEPTION, THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS. THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN

MET, FOR CERTAIN LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE COMMERCIAL AND

INVESTMENT BANK END USERS AND CERTAIN OTHER USERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

FIRM HAS NOT INCLUDED SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE TABLES BELOW.

THE FIRM, IN ITS CAPACITY AS AN

AGENCY LENDER, OCCASIONALLY INDEMNIFIES SECURITIES LENDING

CUSTOMERS AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED IN THE EVENT THAT BORROWERS DO

NOT RETURN SECURITIES AND THE COLLATERAL HELD IS INSUFFICIENT TO

COVER THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED. IN RELATION TO

CERTAIN ASSET SALES AND SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM

GUARANTEES THE COLLECTION OF CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS. IN CONNECTION

WITH ITS MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM MAY ISSUE LOAN

GUARANTEES TO SECURE FINANCING AND TO OBTAIN PREFERENTIAL TERMS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM PROVIDES LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER GUARANTEES,

ON A LIMITED BASIS, TO ENABLE CLIENTS TO ENHANCE THEIR CREDIT

STANDING AND COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUST, GROUP INC. EFFECTIVELY PROVIDED FOR THE

FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE

TRUST HELD BY THIRD PARTIES. TIMELY PAYMENT BY GROUP INC. OF

INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES AND OTHER AMOUNTS

DUE AND PERFORMANCE OF ITS OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TRANSACTION

DOCUMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER PAYMENTS DUE BY THE TRUST ON

ITS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. AS A RESULT, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT

IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE

TRUST OTHER THAN THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEBENTURES AND IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE

TRUST.

THE FIRMS APPROACH IN DETERMINING

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS IS BASED UPON

HISTORICAL FINANCIAL MARKET RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE EXISTED OVER

TIME WITH THE PRESUMPTION THAT THIS TREND WILL GENERALLY REMAIN

CONSTANT IN THE FUTURE.

FOR MEASUREMENT PURPOSES, AN ANNUAL

GROWTH RATE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS

OF 12.53% WAS ASSUMED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 2005. THE

RATE WAS ASSUMED TO DECREASE RATABLY TO 5.00% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR

ENDING NOVEMBER 2009 AND REMAIN AT THAT LEVEL THEREAFTER.

THE ASSUMED COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS AN

EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS.

THE INVESTMENT APPROACH OF THE FIRMS

EMPLOYING A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY TO CAPTURE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY OCCUR, WHILE MAINTAINING REASONABLE

PARAMETERS TO ENSURE THAT PRUDENCE AND CARE ARE EXERCISED IN THE

EXECUTION OF THE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS. THE PLANS EMPLOY A TOTAL

RETURN ON INVESTMENT APPROACH, WHEREBY A MIX, WHICH IS BROADLY

SIMILAR TO THE ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, OF

EQUITY SECURITIES, DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS IS TARGETED TO

MAXIMIZE THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON ASSETS FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF RISK.

INVESTMENT RISK IS MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY

THE FIRMS RETIREMENT COMMITTEE THROUGH PERIODIC PORTFOLIO REVIEWS,

MEETINGS WITH INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ANNUAL LIABILITY MEASUREMENTS.

(THE AMENDED SIP), WHICH PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF INCENTIVE STOCK

OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL

2003, THE AMENDED SIP WAS APPROVED BY THE FIRMS SHAREHOLDERS,

EFFECTIVE FOR GRANTS AFTER APRIL 1, 2003, AND NO FURTHER AWARDS

WERE OR WILL BE MADE UNDER THE ORIGINAL PLAN AFTER THAT DATE,

ALTHOUGH AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE ORIGINAL PLAN PRIOR TO THAT DATE

REMAIN OUTSTANDING.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE AMENDED SIP THROUGH FISCAL 2008

MAY NOT EXCEED 250 MILLION SHARES AND, IN EACH FISCAL YEAR

THEREAFTER, MAY NOT EXCEED 5% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

OF COMMON STOCK, DETERMINED AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY

PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR, INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE

FOR AWARDS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS BUT NOT COVERED BY AWARDS

GRANTED IN SUCH YEARS. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003, 218.9 MILLION

AND 236.8 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE AMENDED SIP, AFTER TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT WERE ISSUED SUBSEQUENT

TO YEAR END, AS PART OF YEAR-END COMPENSATION.

OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM ADOPTED

NEW DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES FOR FISCAL

2005. IN GENERAL, UNDER THE PLANS, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ABLE TO

DEFER PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THEIR CASH YEAR-END COMPENSATION.

DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ABLE TO NOMINALLY

INVEST THEIR DEFERRALS IN CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE UNDER THE

PLANS. GENERALLY, UNDER CURRENT TAX LAW, PARTICIPANTS WILL NOT BE

SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX ON AMOUNTS DEFERRED OR ON ANY NOTIONAL

INVESTMENT EARNINGS UNTIL THE RETURNS ARE DISTRIBUTED, AND THE FIRM

WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO A CORRESPONDING TAX DEDUCTION UNTIL THE

AMOUNTS ARE DISTRIBUTED.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FIRM ADOPTED A

TO THE REGULATION IN EUROPE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS).

ON BECOMING SUBJECT TO THE SECS GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION, THE FIRM

NOTE 15.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

IN REPORTING TO MANAGEMENT, THE

FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS ARE CATEGORIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE

SEGMENTS: INVESTMENT BANKING, TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS,

AND ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

THE FIRM MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS

SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE IN 2003. THESE CHANGES INCLUDED

RECLASSIFYING THE FOLLOWING FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES

SERVICES TO TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.



EQUITY COMMISSIONS AND CLEARING AND EXECUTION FEES;



MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES; AND



THE MATCHED BOOK BUSINESSES.

THESE RECLASSIFICATIONS DID NOT

AFFECT THE FIRMS HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE

BEEN MADE TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS LINES HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR

ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING

AREAS: (I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, (II) THEIR

METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF CLIENTS THEY

SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THEY

OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS

A WHOLE  COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY  ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION EXPENSES WITHIN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AS WELL AS

PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS. CONSEQUENTLY, PRE-TAX

MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES REVENUES AND

EXPENSES AMONG THE THREE SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN

ALLOCATING CERTAIN REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN

SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE THIRD-PARTY

RATES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT HAVE

NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE ALLOCATION

PROCESS IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE

BUSINESS OF THE FIRM.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (THE PARENT

COMPANY), A DELAWARE CORPORATION, SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM) AND NOTES THERETO (THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THESE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE PARENT

COMPANY ONLY. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 18 THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK.

THE PARENT COMPANY HAS FORMED

NUMEROUS NONCONSOLIDATED MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS THAT ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE

PARENT COMPANY ACTS AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR THESE FUNDS AND DOES NOT

HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN ANY FUND. WHERE THE

PARENT COMPANY HOLDS MORE THAN A MINOR INTEREST IN A FUND, IT IS

SUBJECT TO REMOVAL AS GENERAL PARTNER. SUCH FUND INVESTMENTS ARE

INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THESE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY

ARISE FROM LITIGATIONS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, TAX AUDITS, AND

OTHER MATTERS THAT AFFECT THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION; NONETHELESS, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN, ALL

REFERENCES TO NOVEMBER 2004, NOVEMBER 2003 AND NOVEMBER 2002 REFER

TO THE PARENT COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS ENDED, OR THE DATES, AS THE

CONTEXT REQUIRES, NOVEMBER 26, 2004, NOVEMBER 28, 2003 AND

NOVEMBER 29, 2002, RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE

BEEN MADE TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION REFLECT PURCHASES

AND SALES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON A TRADE-DATE BASIS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR

VALUE IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION CONSIST OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE OR

AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, WITH RELATED UNREALIZED GAINS

OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN THE PARENT COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE

INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN

WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE PARENT

COMPANY SEPARATES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO TWO CATEGORIES 

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE PARENT COMPANYS

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONSIST OF EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO WITH AFFILIATES AND

REFLECT CASH THAT THE PARENT COMPANY HAS PAID AND RECEIVED. FAIR

VALUES OF THE PARENT COMPANYS EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE

F-5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

(PARENT COMPANY ONLY)

NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES. OTC DERIVATIVES ARE

VALUED USING VALUATION MODELS. THE PARENT COMPANY USES A VARIETY OF

VALUATION MODELS INCLUDING THE PRESENT VALUE OF KNOWN OR ESTIMATED

CASH FLOWS, OPTION-PRICING MODELS AND OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD MODELS.

IN VALUING CORPORATE AND REAL ESTATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, THE PARENT COMPANYS PORTFOLIO IS SEPARATED

INTO INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES AND INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC

COMPANIES.

THE PARENT COMPANYS PRIVATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY CARRIED AT COST AS AN

APPROXIMATION OF FAIR VALUE. ADJUSTMENTS TO CARRYING VALUE ARE MADE

IF THERE ARE THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS EVIDENCING A CHANGE IN VALUE.

DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO MADE, IN THE ABSENCE OF THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE EXPECTED REALIZABLE

VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN

REACHING THAT DETERMINATION, MANY FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES OR PROPERTIES RELATIVE TO

BUDGETS OR PROJECTIONS, TRENDS WITHIN SECTORS AND/OR REGIONS,

UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODELS, EXPECTED EXIT TIMING AND STRATEGY, AND

ANY SPECIFIC RIGHTS OR TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT, SUCH

AS CONVERSION FEATURES AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.

THE PARENT COMPANYS PUBLIC PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE LARGE, CONCENTRATED HOLDINGS THAT

RESULT FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR OTHER CORPORATE

TRANSACTIONS, ARE VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES DISCOUNTED FOR

RESTRICTIONS ON SALE. IF LIQUIDATING A POSITION IS REASONABLY

EXPECTED TO AFFECT MARKET PRICES, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED

ACCORDINGLY BASED ON PREDETERMINED WRITTEN POLICIES.

MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES.

THE

PARENT COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE MERCHANT BANKING OVERRIDES

(I.E., AN INCREASED SHARE OF A FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS) WHEN THE

RETURN ON THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS.

OVERRIDES ARE BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH

MERCHANT BANKING FUND, AND FUTURE INVESTMENT UNDERPERFORMANCE MAY

REQUIRE AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE PARENT COMPANY TO BE

RETURNED TO THE FUNDS. ACCORDINGLY, OVERRIDES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS ONLY WHEN ALL

MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. OVERRIDES ARE INCLUDED

IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED

COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS AT

ACQUISITION DATE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL IS TESTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR

IMPAIRMENT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS TRIGGERED IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK

VALUE. SUCH LOSS IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE.

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND

EQUIPMENT, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2001,

THE PARENT COMPANY CHANGED TO THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OF

DEPRECIATION FOR CERTAIN PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND

EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2001.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN

NON-U.S. CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE

PREVAILING ON THE DATES OF THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT

AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. THE PARENT COMPANY

SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS NET INVESTMENT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES THROUGH THE USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT. FOR FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED

ON CHANGES IN FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES; ACCORDINGLY, FORWARD POINTS

ARE REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BASED ON

CHANGES IN SPOT RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR

LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS IN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE INCLUDED IN

THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE RECOGNIZED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF THE PARENT COMPANYS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE

REALIZED. THE PARENT COMPANYS TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES

AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONDENSED

NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. TAX PROVISIONS

ARE COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING

FOR INCOME TAXES. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO INCOME TAXES

ARE RECORDED WHEN THE CRITERIA FOR LOSS RECOGNITION UNDER SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, AS AMENDED, HAVE BEEN

MET.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE PARENT COMPANY DEFINES CASH

EQUIVALENTS AS HIGHLY LIQUID OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS HELD IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS

UNSECURED LIQUIDITY IS RAISED BY THE PARENT COMPANY. THE PARENT

COMPANY THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR FINANCING

AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY ADVANCES

ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. SUCH FUNDING IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM

LOANS TO AFFILIATES AND SUBORDINATED LOANS TO AFFILIATES IN THE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INTERCOMPANY EXPOSURE IS MANAGED BY REQUIRING SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO HAVE MATURITIES EQUAL TO OR

SHORTER THAN THE MATURITIES OF THE AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OF THE

PARENT COMPANY. THIS POLICY ENSURES THAT THE SUBSIDIARIES

OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARENT COMPANY WILL GENERALLY MATURE IN ADVANCE

OF THE PARENT COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, MANY

OF THE SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES PLEDGE COLLATERAL AT LOAN VALUE

TO COVER THEIR INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS (OTHER THAN SUBORDINATED

DEBT) IN ORDER TO MITIGATE PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY RISK. EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED WITH EQUITY

CAPITAL AND INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES IN THE

CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PARENT COMPANY ENTERS INTO

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH AFFILIATES TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS AND TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE AND

CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. TO MANAGE EXPOSURE ON ITS BORROWINGS, THE PARENT

NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR-BASED

FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS. THE PARENT COMPANY APPLIES

FAIR-VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE

BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE (I.E., LIBOR) ON ITS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

DERIVATIVE BALANCES WITH AFFILIATES ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND WERE $7.40 BILLION AND

$4.26 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003,

RESPECTIVELY.

INTEREST INCOME IS LARGELY GENERATED

FROM LOANS MADE TO AFFILIATES.

THE PARENT COMPANY ALSO ALLOCATES

RENTAL AND OTHER COSTS RELATING TO PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES TO THOSE SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES.

THE PARENT COMPANY ADDITIONALLY ALLOCATES THE COST OF STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION PROGRAMS TO SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ASSOCIATED

WITH EMPLOYEES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES.

NOTE 2.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

THE PARENT COMPANY OBTAINS

THIRD-PARTY UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS PRIMARILY THROUGH

ISSUANCE OF PROMISSORY NOTES, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND BANK LOANS.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ALSO INCLUDE THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS MATURING WITHIN ONE YEAR AND CERTAIN LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS THAT MAY BE REDEEMABLE WITHIN ONE YEAR AT THE OPTION OF

THE HOLDER. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS

APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.

DEFERRABLE INTEREST JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

IN FEBRUARY 2004, GOLDMAN SACHS

CAPITAL I (THE TRUST), A WHOLLY OWNED DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST,

WAS FORMED BY THE PARENT COMPANY FOR THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSES OF (I) ISSUING

$2.75 BILLION OF GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS AND $85 MILLION OF COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE

TRUST, (II) INVESTING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE TO PURCHASE

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM THE PARENT COMPANY AND (III) ENGAGING

IN ONLY THOSE OTHER ACTIVITIES NECESSARY OR

INCIDENTAL TO THESE PURPOSES. THE PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS

WERE PURCHASED BY THIRD PARTIES, AND, AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, THE

PARENT COMPANY HELD ALL OF THE COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS.

THE PARENT COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT,

FROM TIME TO TIME, TO DEFER PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, AND, THEREFORE, CAUSE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

ON THE TRUSTS PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO BE DEFERRED, IN

EACH CASE FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE SEMIANNUAL PERIODS, AND DURING

ANY SUCH EXTENSION PERIOD THE PARENT COMPANY WILL NOT BE PERMITTED

TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR MAKE CERTAIN

REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THE TRUST IS NOT PERMITTED TO PAY

ANY DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY THE

PARENT COMPANY UNLESS ALL DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON THE PREFERRED

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL.

NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS AND REAL ESTATE

TRANSACTIONS. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE ACTIVITIES, THE PARENT

AS OF NOVEMBER 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

CONTINGENCIES

THE PARENT COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN A

NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF ITS

BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN THE

AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PARENT

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE PARENT

COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING,

IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD. GIVEN THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE PARENT

COMPANYS LITIGATION MATTERS, PARTICULARLY IN CASES IN WHICH

CLAIMANTS SEEK SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE PARENT

COMPANY CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES OF LOSSES FOR CASES WHERE

THERE IS ONLY A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY HAVE BEEN

INCURRED.

GUARANTEES

THE PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEES MANY OF

THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDING ITS

LARGEST OPERATING ENTITIES IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA AND

MANY OF ITS PRIMARY DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES TRADING ENTITIES AS

WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. THE PARENT COMPANY TYPICALLY

DOES NOT GUARANTEE ALL OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTICULAR

SUBSIDIARY; RATHER, IT GUARANTEES OBLIGATIONS ON A

TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH THE

COUNTERPARTY. THE PARENT COMPANY TYPICALLY DOES NOT ISSUE

GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS U.S. BROKER-DEALER

SUBSIDIARIES, ALTHOUGH THE PARENT COMPANY IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OF

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. THE PARENT COMPANY IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN

ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE GUARANTEES. HOWEVER,

BECAUSE THE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS ARE OBLIGATIONS OF CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES, THE PARENT COMPANYS LIABILITIES AS GUARANTOR ARE

ALREADY REPORTED AND DISCLOSED IN NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

THE PARENT COMPANY OCCASIONALLY

INDEMNIFIES SECURITIES LENDING CUSTOMERS AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED IN

THE EVENT THAT BORROWERS DO NOT RETURN SECURITIES AND THE

COLLATERAL HELD IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

SECURITIES BORROWED. IN RELATION TO CERTAIN ASSET SALES AND

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, THE PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEES THE

COLLECTION OF CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, THE PARENT COMPANY MAY ISSUE LOAN

GUARANTEES TO SECURE FINANCING AND TO OBTAIN PREFERENTIAL TERMS. IN

ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER

GUARANTEES, ON A LIMITED BASIS, TO ENABLE CLIENTS TO ENHANCE THEIR

CREDIT STANDING AND COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARENT

COMPANYS ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUST, THE PARENT COMPANY

EFFECTIVELY PROVIDED FOR THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE OF

THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE TRUST HELD BY THIRD PARTIES. TIMELY

PAYMENT BY THE PARENT COMPANY OF INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE AND PERFORMANCE OF

ITS OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO COVER PAYMENTS DUE BY THE TRUST ON ITS BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS. AS A RESULT, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE

PARENT COMPANY WILL HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE TRUST

OTHER THAN THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

AND IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE TRUST.

THE PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TO COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH

A VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND OCCASIONALLY INDEMNIFIES

THEM AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY THE BREACH OF THOSE

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE PARENT COMPANY MAY ALSO PROVIDE

INDEMNIFICATIONS PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN OR ADVERSE

APPLICATION OF CERTAIN U.S. TAX LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH

ORDINARY-COURSE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS SECURITIES ISSUANCES,

BORROWINGS OR DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE PARENT COMPANY MAY

PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS TO SOME COUNTERPARTIES TO PROTECT THEM IN

THE EVENT ADDITIONAL TAXES ARE OWED OR PAYMENTS ARE WITHHELD, DUE

EITHER TO A CHANGE IN OR AN ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. TAX

LAWS. THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS GENERALLY ARE STANDARD

CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF
