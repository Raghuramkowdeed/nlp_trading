BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

GOLDMAN SACHS IS A LEADING GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING AND

SECURITIES FIRM THAT PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES WORLDWIDE

TO A SUBSTANTIAL AND DIVERSIFIED CLIENT BASE THAT INCLUDES

CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS. AS OF NOVEMBER 26, 1999, WE

OPERATED OFFICES IN OVER 20 COUNTRIES AND 37% OF OUR 15,361

EMPLOYEES WERE BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE SUCCESSOR TO A COMMERCIAL PAPER BUSINESS

FOUNDED IN 1869 BY MARCUS GOLDMAN. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE EXPANDED

OUR BUSINESS AS A PARTICIPANT AND INTERMEDIARY IN SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES TO BECOME ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN

THE INDUSTRY.

IN 1989, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, L.P. WAS FORMED TO SERVE AS THE

PARENT COMPANY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS ORGANIZATION. ON MAY 7,

1999, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, L.P. AND COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERING OF ITS COMMON STOCK.

ALL REFERENCES TO 1999, 1998 AND 1997 REFER TO OUR FISCAL YEAR

ENDED, OR THE DATE, AS THE CONTEXT REQUIRES, NOVEMBER 26,

1999, NOVEMBER 27, 1998 AND NOVEMBER 28, 1997,

RESPECTIVELY.

WHEN WE USE THE TERMS GOLDMAN SACHS, WE

AND OUR, WE MEAN, PRIOR TO OUR CONVERSION TO

PARTNERSHIP, AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND, AFTER OUR

CONVERSION TO CORPORATE FORM, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., A

INVESTMENT BANKING

INVESTMENT BANKING REPRESENTED 33% OF 1999 NET REVENUES. WE

PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF INVESTMENT BANKING SERVICES TO A DIVERSE

GROUP OF CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND

INDIVIDUALS AND SEEK TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN LONG-TERM

RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE CLIENTS AS THEIR LEAD INVESTMENT BANK.

OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE, WHICH IS ORGANIZED ALONG REGIONAL, PRODUCT

AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, SEEKS TO COMBINE CLIENT-FOCUSED INVESTMENT

BANKERS WITH EXECUTION AND INDUSTRY EXPERTISE. BECAUSE OUR

BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL, WE HAVE ADAPTED OUR ORGANIZATION TO MEET

THE DEMANDS OF OUR CLIENTS IN EACH GEOGRAPHIC REGION. THROUGH OUR

COMMITMENT TO TEAMWORK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE PROVIDE SERVICES IN

AN INTEGRATED FASHION FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CLIENTS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSIGNMENTS IN LARGE, COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE

MULTIPLE SERVICES, INCLUDING ONE-STOP ACQUISITION

FINANCING, CURRENCY HEDGING AND CROSS-BORDER STRUCTURING

EXPERTISE.

UNDERWRITING.

WE UNDERWRITE A WIDE RANGE OF

SECURITIES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING COMMON AND PREFERRED

STOCK, CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT, HIGH-YIELD

DEBT, SOVEREIGN AND EMERGING MARKETS DEBT, MUNICIPAL DEBT, BANK

LOANS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED

SECURITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND THE SECURITIES

OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS.

EQUITY UNDERWRITING.

EQUITY UNDERWRITING HAS BEEN A

LONG-TERM CORE STRENGTH OF GOLDMAN SACHS. AS WITH MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING

MANDATES FOR LARGE, COMPLEX EQUITY UNDERWRITINGS. WE BELIEVE OUR

LEADERSHIP IN LARGE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS REFLECTS OUR

EXPERTISE IN COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS, RESEARCH STRENGTHS, TRACK

RECORD AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES. WE HAVE ALSO ACTED AS LEAD

MANAGER ON MANY OF THE LARGEST INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS IN THE

INTERNATIONAL ARENA.

WE BELIEVE THAT A KEY FACTOR IN OUR EQUITY UNDERWRITING SUCCESS

IS THE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE INVESTMENT BANKERS,

RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND SALES FORCE AS COORDINATED BY OUR EQUITY

CAPITAL MARKETS GROUP. WITH INSTITUTIONAL SALES PROFESSIONALS AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS LOCATED IN EVERY MAJOR

MARKET AROUND THE WORLD, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH A

LARGE AND DIVERSE GROUP OF INVESTORS.

DEBT UNDERWRITING.

WE ENGAGE IN THE UNDERWRITING AND

ORIGINATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WE BROADLY

CATEGORIZE AS FOLLOWS.



	INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT FOR CORPORATIONS, GOVERNMENTS,

	MUNICIPALITIES AND AGENCIES;



	LEVERAGED FINANCE, WHICH INCLUDES HIGH-YIELD DEBT AND BANK LOANS

	FOR NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE ISSUERS;



	EMERGING MARKET DEBT, WHICH INCLUDES CORPORATE AND SOVEREIGN

	ISSUES; AND



	ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

WE HAVE EMPLOYED A FOCUSED APPROACH IN DEBT UNDERWRITING,

EMPHASIZING HIGH VALUE-ADDED AREAS IN SERVICING OUR CLIENTS.

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 43% OF 1999 NET

REVENUES. OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESS

FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF CORPORATIONS,

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS AND TAKES

PROPRIETARY POSITIONS THROUGH MARKET MAKING IN AND TRADING OF

FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND

SWAPS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES. IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR

CLIENTS, OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESS IS

DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAKE

MARKETS IN TRADITIONAL INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES,

STRUCTURE COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIZE MORTGAGES AND

INSURANCE RISK. WE BELIEVE OUR WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO TAKE

RISK DISTINGUISHES US AND SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES OUR CLIENT

RELATIONSHIPS.

TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE

CATEGORIES.



FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES.

GOLDMAN SACHS

	MAKES MARKETS IN AND TRADES FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES.

FICC IS A

LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED OPERATION THROUGH WHICH WE ENGAGE IN A

VARIETY OF CUSTOMER-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING AND PROPRIETARY TRADING

AND ARBITRAGE ACTIVITIES. FICCS PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS ARE.



	BANK LOANS



	COMMODITIES



	CURRENCIES



	DERIVATIVES



	EMERGING MARKET DEBT

	MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS

	MORTGAGE SECURITIES AND LOANS



	MUNICIPAL SECURITIES

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM OUR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN

BUSINESS IN THREE WAYS. FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS,

WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS.

SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG MARKET RELATIONSHIPS AND

CAPITAL POSITION, WE ALSO UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN LESS LIQUID

MARKETS WHERE SPREADS ARE GENERALLY LARGER. FINALLY, WE GENERATE

NET REVENUES FROM STRUCTURING AND EXECUTING TRANSACTIONS THAT

ADDRESS COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES, WE ASSUME A VARIETY OF RISKS AND

DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY, ANALYZE AND BENEFIT

FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE LEVERAGE OUR STRONG RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES AND CAPITALIZE ON OUR PROPRIETARY ANALYTICAL MODELS

TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE INFORMED TRADING JUDGMENTS. WE

SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED DISPARITIES IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS

IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND FROM MACROECONOMIC AND

COMPANY-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

FICC USES A THREE-PART APPROACH TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY SERVICE

TO ITS CLIENTS. FIRST, WE OFFER BROAD MARKET MAKING, RESEARCH AND

MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. SECOND, WE

CREATE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX CLIENT PROBLEMS BY DRAWING

UPON OUR STRUCTURING AND TRADING EXPERTISE. THIRD, WE USE OUR

EXPERTISE TO TAKE POSITIONS IN MARKETS WHEN WE BELIEVE THE RETURN

IS AT LEAST COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK.

A CORE ACTIVITY IN FICC IS MARKET MAKING IN A BROAD ARRAY OF

SECURITIES AND PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE A PRIMARY DEALER IN

MANY OF THE LARGEST GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND

CANADA. WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE MAJOR FUTURES EXCHANGES, AND ALSO

HAVE INTERBANK DEALER STATUS IN THE CURRENCY MARKETS IN NEW YORK,

LONDON, TOKYO AND HONG KONG. OUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MARKETS IN

A BROAD RANGE OF FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRODUCTS

AND THEIR DERIVATIVES IS CRUCIAL BOTH TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS

AND TO SUPPORT OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY PROVIDING SECONDARY

MARKET LIQUIDITY. OUR RESEARCH CAPABILITIES INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC, CURRENCY AND

FINANCIAL MARKET TRENDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT ANALYSES OF CORPORATE

AND SOVEREIGN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.

EQUITIES.

GOLDMAN SACHS ENGAGES IN A VARIETY OF

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY TRADING AND ARBITRAGE ACTIVITIES IN

EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS (SUCH AS

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS) ON A GLOBAL BASIS. GOLDMAN

SACHS MAKES MARKETS AND POSITIONS BLOCKS OF STOCK TO FACILITATE

CUSTOMERS TRANSACTIONS AND TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY IN THE

MARKETPLACE. GOLDMAN SACHS IS A MEMBER OF MOST OF THE MAJOR STOCK

EXCHANGES, INCLUDING NEW YORK, LONDON, FRANKFURT, TOKYO AND HONG

KONG.

AS AGENT, WE EXECUTE BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS IN EQUITY SECURITIES

FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS THAT GENERATE

COMMISSION REVENUES. COMMISSIONS EARNED ON AGENCY TRANSACTIONS

ARE RECORDED IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

IN EQUITY TRADING, AS IN FICC, WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM OUR

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS IN THREE WAYS. FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY

LIQUID PRINCIPAL MARKETS, SUCH AS THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKET FOR

EQUITY SECURITIES, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS

FOR MODEST SPREADS. SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG MARKET

RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL POSITION, WE ALSO UNDERTAKE LARGE

TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS BLOCK TRADES AND POSITIONS IN SECURITIES,

IN WHICH WE BENEFIT FROM SPREADS THAT ARE GENERALLY LARGER.

FINALLY, WE ALSO BENEFIT FROM STRUCTURING COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS.

GOLDMAN SACHS WAS A PIONEER AND IS CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN THE

EXECUTION OF LARGE BLOCK TRADES (TRADES OF 50,000 OR MORE SHARES)

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CAPITALIZE

ON OUR EXPERTISE IN BLOCK TRADING, OUR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION

NETWORK AND OUR WILLINGNESS TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO EFFECT

INCREASINGLY LARGE AND COMPLEX CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. WE EXPECT

CORPORATE CONSOLIDATION AND RESTRUCTURING AND INCREASED DEMAND

FOR CERTAINTY AND SPEED OF EXECUTION BY SELLERS AND ISSUERS OF

SECURITIES TO INCREASE BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SIZE OF SALES OF

LARGE BLOCKS OF EQUITY SECURITIES. BLOCK TRANSACTIONS, HOWEVER,

EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM

HOLDING LARGE AND CONCENTRATED POSITIONS, AND DECREASING SPREADS.

WE ARE ACTIVE IN THE LISTED OPTIONS AND FUTURES MARKETS, AND WE

STRUCTURE, DISTRIBUTE AND EXECUTE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES ON

MARKET INDICES, INDUSTRY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL COMPANY STOCKS TO

FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES.

WE DEVELOP QUANTITATIVE STRATEGIES AND RENDER ADVICE WITH

RESPECT TO PORTFOLIO HEDGING AND RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET

ALLOCATION TRANSACTIONS. WE ALSO CREATE SPECIALLY TAILORED

INSTRUMENTS TO ENABLE SOPHISTICATED INVESTORS TO UNDERTAKE

HEDGING STRATEGIES AND ESTABLISH OR LIQUIDATE INVESTMENT

POSITIONS. WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING PARTICIPANTS IN THE TRADING

AND DEVELOPMENT OF EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. WE ARE AN

ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE TRADING OF FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON MOST

OF THE MAJOR EXCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA.

WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS. TO PURSUE OUR STRATEGY

OF EXPANDING OUR ELECTRONIC MARKET-MAKING CAPABILITIES, ON

SEPTEMBER 24, 1999, GOLDMAN SACHS COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION

OF THE HULL GROUP, A LEADING GLOBAL ELECTRONIC MARKET MAKER IN

EXCHANGE-TRADED EQUITY DERIVATIVES AND AN ACTIVE MARKET MAKER IN

EQUITY SECURITIES WORLDWIDE.

IN ADDITION, EQUITY ARBITRAGE HAS LONG BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF

OUR EQUITY FRANCHISE. OUR STRATEGY IS BASED ON MAKING INVESTMENTS

ON A GLOBAL BASIS THROUGH A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO ACROSS

DIFFERENT MARKETS AND EVENT CATEGORIES. THIS BUSINESS FOCUSES ON

EVENT-ORIENTED SPECIAL SITUATIONS WHERE WE ARE NOT ACTING AS AN

ADVISOR AND ON RELATIVE VALUE TRADES. THESE SPECIAL SITUATIONS

INCLUDE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS,

RECAPITALIZATIONS AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY EVENTS.

TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

TRADING AND MARKET-MAKING CAPABILITIES ARE KEY INGREDIENTS TO OUR

SUCCESS. WHILE THESE BUSINESSES HAVE GENERALLY EARNED ATTRACTIVE

RETURNS, WE HAVE IN THE PAST INCURRED SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES

IN PERIODS OF MARKET TURBULENCE, SUCH AS IN 1994 AND THE SECOND

HALF OF 1998.

OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY

TO PROFIT FROM TRADING POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL

LOSSES. RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDES INPUT FROM ALL LEVELS OF GOLDMAN

SACHS, FROM THE TRADING DESKS TO THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, WE INVEST BY MAKING PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE RAISE AND MANAGE.

AS OF NOVEMBER 1999, WE HAD COMMITTED $3.06 BILLION, OF

WHICH $2.33 BILLION HAD BEEN FUNDED, OF THE $17.27 BILLION TOTAL

$9.50 BILLION. OTHER FUNDS, WITH TOTAL COMMITTED CAPITAL OF

$7.77 BILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 1999, INVEST IN REAL

ESTATE OPERATING COMPANIES AND DEBT AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN REAL

ESTATE ASSETS.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE THREE REVENUE STREAMS.

FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS GENERALLY A PERCENTAGE

OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL, INVESTED CAPITAL, TOTAL

GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE. THESE ANNUAL MANAGEMENT

FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT REVENUES. SECOND, AFTER

THAT FUND HAS ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE

RECEIVE AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS

THAT IS A PERCENTAGE, TYPICALLY 20%, OF THE CAPITAL APPRECIATION

AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS. REVENUES FROM THE

INCREASED SHARE OF THE FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS ARE INCLUDED

IN COMMISSIONS. FINALLY, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTOR

IN THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON

REALIZATION. THESE ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT OF GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

SECURITIES SERVICES

SECURITIES SERVICES CONSISTS PREDOMINANTLY OF GLOBAL SECURITIES

SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDES PRIME BROKERAGE, FINANCING SERVICES AND

SECURITIES LENDING TO A DIVERSIFIED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CUSTOMER BASE, INCLUDING HEDGE FUNDS, PENSION FUNDS AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS. SECURITIES SERVICES ALSO INCLUDES OUR

MATCHED BOOK BUSINESSES.

WE OFFER PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS, ALLOWING THEM

THE FLEXIBILITY TO TRADE WITH MOST BROKERS WHILE MAINTAINING A

SINGLE SOURCE FOR FINANCING AND PORTFOLIO REPORTS. OUR PRIME

BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES PROVIDE MULTI-PRODUCT CLEARING AND CUSTODY

IN 50 MARKETS, CONSOLIDATED MULTI-CURRENCY ACCOUNTING AND

REPORTING AND OFFSHORE FUND ADMINISTRATION AND ALSO PROVIDE

SERVICING FOR OUR MOST ACTIVE CLIENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE

FINANCING TO OUR CLIENTS THROUGH MARGIN LOANS COLLATERALIZED BY

SECURITIES HELD IN THE CLIENTS ACCOUNT.

SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE THE BORROWING

AND LENDING OF EQUITY SECURITIES TO COVER CUSTOMER AND GOLDMAN

SACHS SHORT SALES AND TO FINANCE GOLDMAN SACHS LONG

POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE

SECURITIES LENDING BROKER-TO-BROKER BUSINESS AND THE THIRD-PARTY

AGENCY LENDING BUSINESS.

COMMISSIONS

GOLDMAN SACHS GENERATES COMMISSIONS BY EXECUTING AGENCY

TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. WE

EFFECT AGENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR CLIENTS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. IN RECENT YEARS, AGGREGATE COMMISSIONS HAVE INCREASED AS A

RESULT OF GROWTH IN TRANSACTION VOLUME ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, COMMISSIONS ALSO INCLUDES THE INCREASED SHARE

OF INCOME AND GAINS FROM MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS AS WELL AS

COMMISSIONS EARNED FROM BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS. FOR A DISCUSSION

REGARDING OUR INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS FROM OUR

MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS, SEE  MERCHANT

BANKING ABOVE.

IN ANTICIPATION OF CONTINUED GROWTH IN ELECTRONIC CONNECTIVITY

AND ON-LINE TRADING, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS MADE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

IN ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND

PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MARKET. SEE

 INTERNET STRATEGY BELOW FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THESE INVESTMENTS.

GLOBAL INVESTMENT RESEARCH

OUR GLOBAL INVESTMENT RESEARCH DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FUNDAMENTAL

RESEARCH ON ECONOMIES, DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS, COMMODITIES

MARKETS, INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. FOR OVER

TWO DECADES, WE HAVE COMMITTED RESOURCES ON A GLOBAL SCALE TO

DEVELOP A LEADING POSITION IN THE INDUSTRY FOR OUR INVESTMENT

RESEARCH PRODUCTS.

GLOBAL INVESTMENT RESEARCH EMPLOYS A TEAM APPROACH THAT AS OF

NOVEMBER 1999 PROVIDED RESEARCH COVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 2,400

COMPANIES WORLDWIDE, 52 ECONOMIES AND 26 STOCK MARKETS. THIS

IS ACCOMPLISHED BY FOUR GROUPS.



	THE COMMODITIES RESEARCH GROUP, WHICH PROVIDES RESEARCH ON THE

	GLOBAL COMMODITY MARKETS;



	THE COMPANY/INDUSTRY GROUP, WHICH PROVIDES FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS,

	FORECASTS AND INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMPANIES AND

	INDUSTRIES WORLDWIDE. EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYSTS ARE ORGANIZED

	REGIONALLY BY SECTOR AND GLOBALLY INTO MORE THAN 20 INDUSTRY

	TEAMS, WHICH ALLOWS FOR EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE

	SHARING ON IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THEMES;



	THE ECONOMIC RESEARCH GROUP, WHICH FORMULATES MACROECONOMIC

	FORECASTS FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST

	RATES BASED ON THE GLOBALLY COORDINATED VIEWS OF ITS REGIONAL

	ECONOMISTS; AND



	THE PORTFOLIO STRATEGY GROUP, WHICH FORECASTS EQUITY MARKET

	RETURNS AND PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS ON BOTH ASSET ALLOCATION AND

	 INDUSTRY REPRESENTATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNET STRATEGY

WE BELIEVE THAT INTERNET TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE WILL,

OVER TIME, CHANGE THE WAYS THAT SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS ARE TRADED AND DISTRIBUTED, CREATING BOTH OPPORTUNITIES

AND CHALLENGES FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IN RESPONSE, WE HAVE

ESTABLISHED A PROGRAM OF INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND EXTERNAL

INVESTMENT.

INTERNALLY, WE ARE EXTENDING OUR GLOBAL ELECTRONIC TRADING AND

INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES TO OUR CLIENTS VIA THE

INTERNET. THESE CAPABILITIES COVER MANY OF OUR FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY, COMMODITY, EQUITIES AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS IN MARKETS

AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE ALSO USING THE INTERNET TO IMPROVE THE

EASE AND QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION WITH OUR INSTITUTIONAL AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, INVESTORS HAVE ON-LINE

ACCESS TO OUR INVESTMENT RESEARCH, MUTUAL FUND DATA AND VALUATION

MODELS. IN ADDITION, OUR HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS ARE INCREASINGLY

ACCESSING THEIR PORTFOLIO INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET. WE HAVE

ALSO RECENTLY ESTABLISHED GS-ONLINE

SM

, WHICH, IN

CONJUNCTION WITH GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., ACTS AS AN

UNDERWRITER OF SECURITIES OFFERINGS VIA THE INTERNET AND OTHER

ELECTRONIC MEANS. GS-ONLINE

SM

WILL DEAL INITIALLY ONLY

WITH OTHER UNDERWRITERS AND SYNDICATE MEMBERS AND NOT WITH

MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

RECENTLY, WE ESTABLISHED AN INTERNAL WORKING GROUP TO FOCUS

PRIMARILY ON UTILIZING THE INTERNET TO ENHANCE AND SUPPORT OUR

WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. EXTERNALLY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONCERNS SUCH AS BRIDGE INFORMATION SYSTEMS,

INC., TRADEWEB LLC, ARCHIPELAGO, L.L.C., THE BRASS UTILITY,

L.L.C., OPTIMARK TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND WIT CAPITAL GROUP, INC.

THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS, WE GAIN AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS EMERGING SECTOR.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY.

GOLDMAN SACHS IS COMMITTED TO THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT,

MAINTENANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION. WE

HAVE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS. OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES CAN BE BROADLY

CATEGORIZED INTO THREE EFFORTS.



	ENHANCING CLIENT SERVICE THROUGH INCREASED CONNECTIVITY AND THE

	PROVISION OF HIGH VALUE-ADDED, TAILORED SERVICES;



	RISK MANAGEMENT; AND



	OVERALL EFFICIENCY AND CONTROL.

WE HAVE TAILORED OUR SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS BY PROVIDING THEM

WITH ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE,

WE DEVELOPED THE

GS FINANCIAL WORKBENCH

SM

, AN

INTERNET WEB SITE THAT CLIENTS AND EMPLOYEES CAN USE TO DOWNLOAD

RESEARCH REPORTS, ACCESS EARNINGS AND VALUATION MODELS, SUBMIT

TRADES, MONITOR ACCOUNTS, BUILD AND VIEW PRESENTATIONS, CALCULATE

DERIVATIVE PRICES AND VIEW MARKET DATA. FIRST MADE AVAILABLE IN

1995, THE

GS FINANCIAL WORKBENCH

SM

REPRESENTS A

JOINT EFFORT AMONG ALL OF OUR BUSINESS AREAS TO CREATE ONE

COMPREHENSIVE SITE FOR CLIENTS AND EMPLOYEES TO ACCESS OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED SOFTWARE THAT ENABLES US TO MONITOR AND

ANALYZE OUR MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS. THIS RISK MANAGEMENT

SOFTWARE NOT ONLY ANALYZES MARKET RISK ON FIRMWIDE, DIVISIONAL

AND TRADING DESK LEVELS, BUT ALSO BREAKS DOWN OUR RISK INTO ITS

UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, PERMITTING MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE EXPOSURES

ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY RATE, EQUITY

PRICE OR COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. TO ASSIST FURTHER IN THE

MANAGEMENT OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, DATA FROM MANY SOURCES ARE

AGGREGATED DAILY INTO CREDIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT GIVE SENIOR

MANAGEMENT AND PROFESSIONALS IN THE CREDIT AND CONTROLLERS

DEPARTMENTS THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE TIMELY INFORMATION WITH

RESPECT TO CREDIT EXPOSURES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING NETTING

INFORMATION, AND THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE COMPLEX RISK SITUATIONS

EFFECTIVELY. OUR SOFTWARE ACCESSES THIS DATA, ALLOWS

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR QUICK ANALYSIS AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL TRADES AND

INTERACTS WITH OTHER GOLDMAN SACHS SYSTEMS.

TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN IMPROVING THE

OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF MANY AREAS OF GOLDMAN SACHS. BY AUTOMATING

MANY TRADING PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONAL AND ACCOUNTING PROCESSES,

WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED OUR EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ONE OF THE STRENGTHS AND PRINCIPAL

REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE QUALITY AND

DEDICATION OF ITS PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF BEING PART OF A

TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS

PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY AND COOPERATION AMONG OUR

EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A

CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART.

ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT VARIOUS

LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW

PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND

EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS

INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

AS OF NOVEMBER 1999, WE HAD 15,361 EMPLOYEES, WHICH EXCLUDES

EMPLOYEES OF GOLDMAN SACHS TWO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

SUBSIDIARIES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COSTS OF THESE PROPERTY

MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES ARE REIMBURSED TO GOLDMAN SACHS BY THE REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS TO WHICH THESE SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER BROKERS AND DEALERS,

INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, INVESTMENT

ADVISORS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMERCIAL BANKS AND

MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS GLOBALLY

AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT OR NICHE BASIS. OUR

COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION,

REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

IN PARTICULAR, A NUMBER OF LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES AND OTHER BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE

ESTABLISHED OR ACQUIRED BROKER-DEALERS OR HAVE MERGED WITH OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM LOANS, DEPOSIT TAKING AND

INSURANCE TO BROKERAGE, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING

SERVICES, WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY ALSO

HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES

PRODUCTS WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH COULD

RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR BUSINESSES.

RECENTLY ENACTED FEDERAL FINANCIAL MODERNIZATION LEGISLATION

SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS

AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK. THE LEGISLATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

ENABLES U.S. BANKS AND INSURANCE FIRMS TO AFFILIATE, FACILITATES

AFFILIATIONS BETWEEN U.S. BANKS AND SECURITIES FIRMS, AND

EXPANDS THE PERMISSIBLE PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF U.S.

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THIS LEGISLATION MAY FURTHER ACCELERATE

CONSOLIDATION AND INCREASE COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY AND WILL ENABLE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO COMPETE MORE

EFFECTIVELY ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR

COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT,

WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS.

WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND

OPPORTUNITIES WILL ARISE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN ORDER TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BASED IN IMPORTANT

NON-U.S. MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE. SOME OF THESE

INSTITUTIONS ARE LARGER AND BETTER CAPITALIZED, AND HAVE A

STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE AND A LONGER OPERATING HISTORY IN THESE

MARKETS.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR

BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS HAVE BEEN UNDER PRESSURE FOR A NUMBER OF

YEARS AND THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH

THE INTERNET AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS MAY

INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON TRADING COMMISSIONS. IT APPEARS THAT

THIS TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE AND

PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SIMILARLY, UNDERWRITING SPREADS IN CERTAIN

PRIVATIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE. WE

BELIEVE THAT WE MAY EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURES IN THESE AND

OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO

OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES.

REGULATION

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE SECURITIES AND COMMODITY

FUTURES AND OPTIONS INDUSTRIES, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE

REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE. AS A MATTER OF

PUBLIC POLICY, REGULATORY BODIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE

REST OF THE WORLD ARE CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL MARKETS AND WITH PROTECTING

THE INTERESTS OF CUSTOMERS PARTICIPATING IN THOSE MARKETS. THEY

ARE NOT, HOWEVER, CHARGED WITH PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF

GOLDMAN SACHS SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE SEC IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO. IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER AND AS AN

INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH THE SEC AND AS A BROKER-DEALER IN ALL

50 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE, THE NYSE AND

THE NASD, ADOPT RULES AND EXAMINE BROKER-DEALERS SUCH AS GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO. IN ADDITION, STATE SECURITIES AND OTHER

REGULATORS ALSO HAVE REGULATORY OR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESSES ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL AND

REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN VIRTUALLY

ALL COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE OFFICES.

BROKER-DEALERS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT COVER ALL ASPECTS

OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS, INCLUDING SALES METHODS, TRADE

PRACTICES AMONG BROKER-DEALERS, USE AND SAFEKEEPING OF

CUSTOMERS FUNDS AND SECURITIES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

RECORD-KEEPING, THE FINANCING OF CUSTOMERS PURCHASES, AND

THE CONDUCT OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATION, CHANGES IN RULES PROMULGATED BY SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS, OR CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF

EXISTING LAWS AND RULES, EITHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR

ELSEWHERE, MAY DIRECTLY AFFECT THE MODE OF OPERATION AND

PROFITABILITY OF GOLDMAN SACHS.

THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES, ARE EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF

CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS, OR THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A

BROKER-DEALER OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.

OCCASIONALLY, OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO

INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED

FOR INFRACTIONS OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR

ACTIVITIES, NONE OF WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US

OR OUR BUSINESSES.

THE COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES

IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS

AMENDED. THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION IS THE FEDERAL

AGENCY CHARGED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE

ACT AND THE

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IS

REGISTERED WITH THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION AS A

FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT, COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR AND

COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.

AS A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND MEMBER OF VARIOUS

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. IS

SUBJECT TO THE SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE,

RULE 15C3-1. THIS RULE SPECIFIES THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF NET

CAPITAL A BROKER-DEALER MUST MAINTAIN AND ALSO REQUIRES THAT PART

OF ITS ASSETS BE KEPT IN RELATIVELY LIQUID FORM. GOLDMAN,

SACHS & CO. IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE NET CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION AND

VARIOUS SECURITIES AND COMMODITY EXCHANGES. SEE NOTE 12 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

THE SEC AND VARIOUS SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS IMPOSE RULES

THAT REQUIRE NOTIFICATION WHEN NET CAPITAL FALLS BELOW CERTAIN

PREDEFINED CRITERIA, DICTATE THE RATIO OF SUBORDINATED DEBT TO

EQUITY IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL COMPOSITION OF A BROKER-DEALER

AND CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF A BROKER-DEALER TO EXPAND ITS

BUSINESS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ADDITIONALLY, THE

SECS UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE IMPOSES CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS

THAT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF PROHIBITING A BROKER-DEALER FROM

DISTRIBUTING OR WITHDRAWING CAPITAL AND REQUIRING PRIOR NOTICE TO

THE SEC FOR CERTAIN WITHDRAWALS OF CAPITAL.

IN JANUARY 1999, THE SEC ADOPTED REVISIONS TO ITS UNIFORM

NET CAPITAL RULE AND RELATED REGULATIONS THAT PERMIT THE

REGISTRATION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES DEALERS AS

BROKER-DEALERS. AN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES DEALER CAN, UPON

ADOPTION OF A RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

NEW RULES, UTILIZE A CAPITAL REQUIREMENT BASED UPON PROPRIETARY

MODELS FOR ESTIMATING MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

GOLDMAN SACHS FINANCIAL MARKETS, L.P. AND REGISTERED THIS COMPANY

WITH THE SEC AS AN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES DEALER TO

CONDUCT IN A MORE CAPITAL-EFFICIENT MANNER CERTAIN

OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE BUSINESSES PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED IN

OTHER AFFILIATES.

GOLDMAN SACHS IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS. MANY OF OUR AFFILIATES THAT

PARTICIPATE IN THOSE MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE

REGULATIONS THAT INCLUDE SOME FORM OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULE AND

OTHER CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES. GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDES

INVESTMENT SERVICES IN AND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM UNDER A

REGULATORY REGIME THAT IS UNDERGOING COMPREHENSIVE RESTRUCTURING

AIMED AT IMPLEMENTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY AS THE

UNITED KINGDOMS UNIFIED FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATOR. THE

RELEVANT GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES IN LONDON ARE AT PRESENT

REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES AUTHORITY LIMITED IN

RESPECT OF THEIR INVESTMENT BANKING, INDIVIDUAL ASSET MANAGEMENT,

BROKERAGE AND PRINCIPAL TRADING ACTIVITIES, AND THE INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT REGULATORY ORGANIZATION IN RESPECT OF THEIR

INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT AND FUND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

SOME OF THESE GOLDMAN SACHS ENTITIES ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE

LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND OTHER U.K. SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES

EXCHANGES OF WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS. IT IS EXPECTED, HOWEVER,

THAT DURING 2000, THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECURITIES AND

FUTURES AUTHORITY LIMITED AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REGULATORY

ORGANIZATION WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AUTHORITY. THE INVESTMENT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT

BY U.K. REGULATORS ARE REGULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EUROPEAN

UNION DIRECTIVES REQUIRING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH

CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS, CUSTOMER PROTECTION

REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS RULES. THESE STANDARDS,

REQUIREMENTS AND RULES ARE SIMILARLY IMPLEMENTED, UNDER THE SAME

DIRECTIVES, THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ARE BROADLY

COMPARABLE IN SCOPE AND PURPOSE TO THE REGULATORY CAPITAL AND

CUSTOMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED UNDER THE SEC AND

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION RULES. EUROPEAN UNION

DIRECTIVES ALSO PERMIT LOCAL REGULATION IN EACH JURISDICTION,

INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN

THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH DIRECTIVES AND THESE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS

CAN RESULT IN CERTAIN COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES TO GOLDMAN SACHS.

IN ADDITION, THE JAPANESE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, THE FINANCIAL

SUPERVISORY AGENCY, THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE, THE TOKYO

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL FUTURES EXCHANGE AND THE JAPAN SECURITIES

DEALERS ASSOCIATION IN JAPAN, THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES

COMMISSION IN HONG KONG,

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE BUNDESBANK IN GERMANY, AS WELL AS FRENCH AND SWISS BANKING

AUTHORITIES, AMONG OTHERS, REGULATE VARIOUS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES

AND ALSO HAVE CAPITAL STANDARDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS COMPARABLE

TO THE RULES OF THE SEC.

COMPLIANCE WITH NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THESE AND OTHER

REGULATORS COULD LIMIT THOSE OPERATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT

REQUIRE THE INTENSIVE USE OF CAPITAL, SUCH AS UNDERWRITING AND

TRADING ACTIVITIES AND THE FINANCING OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNT

BALANCES, AND ALSO COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW CAPITAL

FROM OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH IN TURN COULD LIMIT OUR

ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

AS AN INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES FIRM, OUR BUSINESSES ARE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ELSEWHERE HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD OR NEAR RECORD LEVELS,

AND THE FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE WILL

NOT CONTINUE INDEFINITELY. IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN MARKET

CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESSES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN MANY

WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



	WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS,

	INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS, IN THE FIXED INCOME,

	CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY MARKETS, AND IN REAL ESTATE AND

	OTHER ASSETS, AND WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IF MARKET

	FLUCTUATIONS OR VOLATILITY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THESE

	POSITIONS.



	UNFAVORABLE FINANCIAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD LIKELY REDUCE

	THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE PROVIDE

	UNDERWRITING, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ADVISORY, AND OTHER

	SERVICES, AND COULD THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

	OPERATIONS.



	A MARKET DOWNTURN WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF

	 TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE,

	TO A DECLINE IN THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM COMMISSIONS AND

	SPREADS. A MARKET DOWNTURN COULD ALSO RESULT IN A DECLINE IN THE

	FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING ASSETS. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE

	OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET PERFORMANCE BY OUR MUTUAL

	FUNDS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND

	THEREFORE IN THE FEES WE RECEIVE.



	CONCENTRATION OF RISK IN THE PAST HAS INCREASED THE LOSSES THAT

	WE HAVE INCURRED IN OUR ARBITRAGE, MARKET-MAKING, BLOCK TRADING,

	UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN

	THE FUTURE. IN PARTICULAR, IN THE CASE OF BLOCK TRADING, WE

	EXPECT THE TREND TOWARD AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF

	TRADES WE EXECUTE TO CONTINUE.



	A PROLONGED MARKET DOWNTURN COULD IMPAIR OUR OPERATING RESULTS

	FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IN SUCH A DOWNTURN, OUR REVENUES MAY

	DECLINE AND, IF WE WERE UNABLE TO REDUCE EXPENSES AT THE SAME

	PACE, OUR PROFIT MARGINS WOULD ERODE.

IF ANY OF THE VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS AND STRATEGIES WE UTILIZE TO

HEDGE OR OTHERWISE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS TYPES OF RISK

ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY INCUR LOSSES. OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES

AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE

IN MITIGATING OUR RISK EXPOSURE IN ALL MARKET ENVIRONMENTS OR

AGAINST ALL TYPES OF RISK, INCLUDING RISKS THAT ARE UNIDENTIFIED

OR UNANTICIPATED. SOME OF OUR METHODS OF MANAGING RISK ARE BASED

UPON OUR USE OF OBSERVED HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR. AS A RESULT,

THESE METHODS MAY NOT PREDICT FUTURE RISK EXPOSURES, WHICH COULD

BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE HISTORICAL MEASURES INDICATE.

OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS DEPEND UPON EVALUATION OF

INFORMATION REGARDING MARKETS, CLIENTS OR OTHER MATTERS. THIS

INFORMATION MAY NOT IN ALL CASES BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE,

UP-TO-DATE OR PROPERLY EVALUATED.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION,

REPUTATION AND PRICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY EXPERIENCE PRICING

PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN

MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN

SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. RECENT FINANCIAL SERVICES

LEGISLATION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE ACTIVITIES

PERMISSIBLE FOR FIRMS AFFILIATED WITH A U.S. BANK, MAY ACCELERATE

THIS CONSOLIDATION AND FURTHER INCREASE COMPETITION. THIS TREND

TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF OUR COMPETITORS. THIS

TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS

OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS. COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE. OUR

CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES

DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND

MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN TO

ENCOURAGE THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF OUR EMPLOYEES SINCE OUR

CONVERSION TO CORPORATE FORM MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

LIQUIDITY, I.E., READY ACCESS TO FUNDS, IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR

BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS THE LONG-TERM OR SHORT-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS THE REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING

MARKETS, OR AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS. OUR

ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

IN ADDITION, A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION AND INCREASE OUR

BORROWING COSTS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES HAVE

BEEN INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

ALSO EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO EXTEND

CREDIT AGAINST LESS LIQUID COLLATERAL AND PRICE MORE

AGGRESSIVELY THE CREDIT RISKS THAT WE TAKE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY

REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS

THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY

ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT

OR FORESEE. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT, OR A DEFAULT BY, ONE

INSTITUTION COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES

OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT GOLDMAN SACHS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, ON

A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS

AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES, AND THE TRANSACTIONS WE

PROCESS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. IF ANY OF OUR

FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS DO NOT

OPERATE PROPERLY OR ARE DISABLED, WE COULD SUFFER FINANCIAL LOSS,

A DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REGULATORY

INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE INABILITY OF OUR

SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASING VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS COULD

ALSO CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION

AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL

EFFECT OR CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO GOLDMAN SACHS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS. WE

FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES AND THE VOLUME AND

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AGAINST FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES ARE INCREASING. IN ADDITION, WE WOULD EXPECT LEGAL

CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS TO INCREASE IN A MARKET

DOWNTURN.

GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS

AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT

BUSINESS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE COULD BE FINED OR PROHIBITED

FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. NEW LAWS OR

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR CLIENTS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESSES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER

EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND

DETECT THIS ACTIVITY MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND

OPPORTUNITIES WILL ARISE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN ORDER TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BASED IN IMPORTANT

NON-U.S. MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE. SOME OF THESE

INSTITUTIONS ARE LARGER AND BETTER CAPITALIZED, AND HAVE A

STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE AND A LONGER OPERATING HISTORY IN THESE

MARKETS.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES IN MAJOR MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD,

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND

OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN OTHER COUNTRIES,

INCLUDING RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE

TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES ARE UNCERTAIN

AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE

EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. OUR INABILITY

TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN

MARKET COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON

OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION

GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE

STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE

EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING

SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES AND LOW OR NEGATIVE

GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THESE

CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND

INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY. AS WE EXPAND

OUR BUSINESSES IN EMERGING AND OTHER MARKETS, OUR EXPOSURE TO

THESE RISKS WILL INCREASE.

SECURITIES AND FUTURES TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW BEING CONDUCTED

THROUGH THE INTERNET AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE, NON-TRADITIONAL

TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE

TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. A

DRAMATIC INCREASE IN COMPUTER-BASED OR OTHER ELECTRONIC TRADING

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMMISSION AND TRADING REVENUES, REDUCE

OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND ASSOCIATED ACCESS TO

MARKET INFORMATION AND LEAD TO THE CREATION OF NEW AND STRONGER

COMPETITORS.

SEVERAL YEARS. CURRENTLY, GOLDMAN SACHS IS AT OR NEAR CAPACITY

AT MOST OF ITS LOCATIONS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY

LEASING ADDITIONAL SPACE TO SUPPORT OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH. BASED

ON OUR PROGRESS TO DATE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL SPACE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED NEEDS.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND

ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW)

CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT

MIGHT BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH

PERIOD.

	OUR PRE-TAX EARNINGS IN 1999 REFLECT PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES

	RENDERED BY MANAGING DIRECTORS WHO, PRIOR TO OUR CONVERSION TO

	OF PARTNERS CAPITAL RATHER THAN AS COMPENSATION AND
