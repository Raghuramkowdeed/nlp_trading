INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME AND GAINS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM OUR PRIVATE EQUITY AND CREDIT FUNDS WHEN THE RETURN ON A FUNDS INVESTMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE FUND EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN ALL

MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES ARE RESOLVED.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING CYBER SECURITY, ARE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. THEIR IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN

HIGHLIGHTED BY NUMEROUS HIGHLY PUBLICIZED EVENTS IN RECENT YEARS, INCLUDING CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, LARGE CONSUMER-BASED COMPANIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT RESULTED IN THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF

CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS AND OTHER SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND THE THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF CORPORATE INFORMATION, AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, SUCH AS HURRICANE SANDY.

OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT OUR

CRITICAL FACILITIES OR SYSTEMS AND TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF FINRA. BECAUSE WE ARE A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM IS ALSO SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF

THE PROGRAM ARE CRISIS PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT, PEOPLE RECOVERY, BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND

TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY OUR CLIENTS AND THAT OF THE FIRM FROM CYBER ATTACKS AND OTHER MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS. SAFEGUARDS ARE DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY

OF INFORMATION.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION OF OUR PEOPLE AND

THE SHARED SENSE OF BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE AND HIGH STANDARDS OF BUSINESS ETHICS.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH TRAINING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE

OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE

REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH, AND INCLUDES AN EVALUATION OF AN EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO RISK MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE AND

DIVERSITY. AS OF DECEMBER 2016, WE HAD 34,400 TOTAL STAFF.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER

ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AS WELL AS THOSE ENTITIES THAT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, DERIVATIVES, REAL ESTATE, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS. THESE ENTITIES INCLUDE

BROKERS AND DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME ENTITIES GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL,

PRODUCT OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND

EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE, PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH

AS AGREEMENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR LOAN FACILITIES) FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH

OF SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND HAVE ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS.

TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND HAVE MORE CAPITAL AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE

THE U.S. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SMALLER INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER MORE TARGETED SERVICES, SUCH AS INDEPENDENT ADVISORY FIRMS. SOME CLIENTS MAY PERCEIVE THESE FIRMS TO BE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAN WE ARE, AND, AS DESCRIBED

BELOW, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE WITH THEM COULD BE AFFECTED BY REGULATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON ACTIVITIES THAT APPLY TO US BUT MAY NOT APPLY TO THEM.

A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION. EFFORTS BY OUR COMPETITORS TO GAIN MARKET SHARE HAVE RESULTED IN PRICING

PRESSURE IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING AND CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES AND COULD RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE INCREASING VOLUME OF TRADES EXECUTED ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH ALTERNATIVE

TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON TRADING COMMISSIONS, IN THAT COMMISSIONS FOR ELECTRONIC TRADING ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOR NON-ELECTRONIC TRADING. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD LOW-COMMISSION TRADING WILL CONTINUE. IN ADDITION,

WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY FURTHER REDUCING PRICES, AND AS WE ENTER INTO OR EXPAND OUR PRESENCE IN MARKETS

THAT MAY RELY MORE HEAVILY ON ELECTRONIC TRADING AND EXECUTION.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER

PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT), THE REQUIREMENTS PROMULGATED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL COMMITTEE) AND OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATION COULD AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION TO THE EXTENT THAT LIMITATIONS ON ACTIVITIES,

INCREASED FEES AND COMPLIANCE COSTS OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY, OR DO NOT APPLY EQUALLY, TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT

THAT PROHIBIT PROPRIETARY TRADING AND RESTRICT INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN HEDGE AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN U.S.-BASED AND NON-U.S.-BASED BANKING ORGANIZATIONS AND GIVE NON-U.S.-BASED BANKING ORGANIZATIONS GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO TRADE

OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND TO FORM AND INVEST IN FUNDS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

LIKEWISE, THE OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS UNDER TITLE VII OF THE

DODD-FRANK ACT DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE LOCATION OF THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION. THE IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WILL DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THE

REQUIRED RULEMAKING AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE EVOLVE, THE EXTENT OF INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICE AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE NEW REGULATORY REGIMES AS DESCRIBED FURTHER UNDER REGULATION BELOW.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND

UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES AND TO CONTINUE TO COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES COMPETITIVELY AMID INTENSE PUBLIC AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY ON THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR PAY PRACTICES AND THOSE OF CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND OTHER REGULATORS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA) AND THE

FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FCA) IN THE U.K. WE ALSO COMPETE FOR EMPLOYEES WITH INSTITUTIONS WHOSE PAY PRACTICES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. SEE REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES BELOW AND RISK

FACTORS  OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATION OF OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES.

REGULATION

AS A

PARTICIPANT IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION WORLDWIDE. OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN PARTICULAR, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND THE RULES THEREUNDER, SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE. THE

CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEES FINAL CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL III), AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE PRA AND FCA AND OTHER NATIONAL

REGULATORS, HAVE ALSO HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES. THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS THE PRIMARY GLOBAL STANDARD SETTER FOR PRUDENTIAL BANK REGULATION, AND ITS MEMBER JURISDICTIONS IMPLEMENT REGULATIONS BASED ON ITS STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH REGULATIONS FOR OUR BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON

THEIR IMPLEMENTATION BY THE RELEVANT REGULATORS GLOBALLY, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE REGIME ESTABLISHED BY SUCH REGULATIONS.

OTHER REFORMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS WORLDWIDE, AS DESCRIBED FURTHER THROUGHOUT THIS

SECTION. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THE NEW PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE U.S., HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY TO THE IMPLEMENTATION, SCOPE AND TIMING OF REGULATORY REFORMS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DEREGULATION IN SOME AREAS. ON

FEBRUARY 3, 2017, THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IDENTIFYING CORE PRINCIPLES FOR THE ADMINISTRATIONS FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY POLICY AND DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, IN CONSULTATION

WITH THE HEADS OF OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCIES, TO EVALUATE HOW THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK PROMOTES OR INHIBITS THE PRINCIPLES AND WHAT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN, AND ARE BEING, TAKEN TO PROMOTE THE PRINCIPLES.

GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) AND GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL BANK (GSIB), OUR PRINCIPAL E.U. OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE INCORPORATED AND

HEADQUARTERED IN THE U.K. AND, AS SUCH, ARE SUBJECT TO E.U. LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, BASED ON DIRECTLY BINDING REGULATIONS OF THE E.U. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF E.U. DIRECTIVES BY THE U.K. BOTH CURRENTLY BENEFIT FROM NON-DISCRIMINATORY

ACCESS TO E.U. CLIENTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BASED ON E.U. TREATIES AND E.U. LEGISLATION, INCLUDING CROSS-BORDER PASSPORTING ARRANGEMENTS AND SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF E.U. BRANCHES. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AS

TO THE REGULATORY REGIME THAT WILL BE APPLICABLE IN THE U.K. FOLLOWING THE U.K. REFERENDUM VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION (BREXIT) AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WILL GOVERN TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR U.K. SUBSIDIARIES IN THE

REMAINING E.U. COUNTRIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF OUR CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION. THE PRIMARY REGULATORS OF OUR U.S. NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES DIRECTLY REGULATE THE ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES, WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EXERCISING A SUPERVISORY

ROLE. SUCH FUNCTIONALLY REGULATED U.S. NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE BROKER-DEALERS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC, SUCH AS OUR PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER, GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.), ENTITIES REGISTERED WITH OR REGULATED BY

THE CFTC WITH RESPECT TO FUTURES-RELATED AND SWAPS-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THEIR INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES.

VARIOUS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BANKING AND SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

OUR PRINCIPAL U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARY, GS BANK USA, IS SUPERVISED AND REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC, THE NEW YORK STATE

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES (NYDFS) AND THE U.S. CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. A NUMBER OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY THROUGH GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING: ORIGINATION OF BANK LOANS; PERSONAL LOANS

AND MORTGAGES; INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, CURRENCY AND OTHER DERIVATIVES; LEVERAGED FINANCE; STRUCTURED FINANCE; DEPOSIT-TAKING; AND AGENCY LENDING. OUR CONSUMER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION BY FEDERAL AND

STATE REGULATORS WITH REGARD TO CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS RELATING TO FAIR LENDING AND OTHER PRACTICES IN CONNECTION WITH MARKETING AND PROVIDING CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS.

GSI, OUR REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY, WHICH IS DESIGNATED AS AN INVESTMENT FIRM, AND GSIB, OUR REGULATED U.K. BANK AND PRINCIPAL

NON-U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARY, ARE SUPERVISED AND REGULATED BY THE PRA AND THE FCA. GSI PROVIDES BROKER-DEALER SERVICES IN AND FROM THE U.K., AND GSIB ACTS AS A PRIMARY DEALER FOR EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT BONDS AND IS INVOLVED IN MARKET MAKING IN EUROPEAN

GOVERNMENT BONDS, LENDING (INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING) AND DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES.

GSI, GSIB AND OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES IN THE E.U.

ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECTLY BINDING REGULATIONS OF THE E.U. AND NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF E.U. DIRECTIVES, WHERE APPLICABLE.

CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CALCULATED IN SUBSTANTIALLY

THE SAME MANNER AS THOSE APPLICABLE TO GROUP INC., ALSO SET FORTH BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. GSI IS SUBJECT TO CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRESCRIBED IN THE E.U. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS REGULATION (CRR) AND THE E.U. FOURTH CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE

(CRD IV).

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA MUST MEET SPECIFIC

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS. THE SUFFICIENCY OF OUR CAPITAL LEVELS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS. GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA

ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND GSI IS SUBJECT TO SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY U.K. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CAPITAL RATIOS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARDS REVISED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REGULATIONS, INCLUSIVE OF CERTAIN TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS (REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK). THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK IS LARGELY BASED ON BASEL III AND ALSO IMPLEMENTS CERTAIN

PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT. UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, WE ARE AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION AND HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS A GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANK (G-SIB).

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES FOR THREE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS THAT PHASE IN OVER TIME: (I) FOR CAPITAL

CONSERVATION (CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER), (II) AS A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR DESIGNATION AS A G-SIB (G-SIB BUFFER) AND (III) FOR COUNTER-CYCLICALITY (COUNTER-CYCLICAL BUFFER). THESE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS MUST BE SATISFIED

ENTIRELY WITH CAPITAL THAT QUALIFIES AS COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1).

THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER BEGAN TO PHASE IN ON

JANUARY 1, 2016 AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN INCREMENTS OF 0.625% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 2.5% OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS) ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE G-SIB BUFFER ALSO BEGAN TO PHASE IN ON JANUARY 1, 2016 AND

WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGH JANUARY 1, 2019.

THE COUNTER-CYCLICAL BUFFER, OF UP TO 2.5%, IS DESIGNED TO COUNTERACT SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITIES

AND APPLIES ONLY TO ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE COUNTER-CYCLICAL BUFFER IS CURRENTLY SET AT ZERO PERCENT. SEVERAL OTHER NATIONAL SUPERVISORS HAVE ALSO STARTED TO REQUIRE COUNTER-CYCLICAL BUFFERS. THE G-SIB AND

COUNTER-CYCLICAL BUFFERS APPLICABLE TO US COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE AND, AS A RESULT, THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS WE ARE SUBJECT TO COULD INCREASE.

GS BANK USA ALSO COMPUTES ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING

ORGANIZATION.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PUBLISHED FINAL GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING INCREMENTAL CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING

INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE SYSTEMICALLY SIGNIFICANT FROM A DOMESTIC BUT NOT GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE (D-SIBS). IF THESE GUIDELINES ARE IMPLEMENTED BY NATIONAL REGULATORS, THEY WILL APPLY TO, AMONG OTHERS, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF

G-SIBS.

THESE GUIDELINES ARE IN ADDITION TO THE FRAMEWORK FOR G-SIBS, BUT ARE MORE PRINCIPLES-BASED. CRD IV AND THE CRR PROVIDE THAT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AT THE E.U. OR MEMBER

STATE LEVEL, KNOWN AS OTHER SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS (O-SIIS), MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS OF UP TO 2% OF CET1, ACCORDING TO THEIR DEGREE OF SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE

(O-SII

BUFFERS). O-SIIS ARE IDENTIFIED ANNUALLY, ALONG WITH THEIR APPLICABLE BUFFERS. DURING 2016, THE PRA IDENTIFIED GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP UK LIMITED (GSG UK), THE PARENT COMPANY OF GSI AND GSIB, AS AN O-SII. GSG UKS O-SII BUFFER IS CURRENTLY SET AT

ZERO PERCENT.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED A SERIES OF UPDATES THAT PROPOSE OTHER CHANGES TO CAPITAL REGULATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, IN

JANUARY 2016, THE BASEL COMMITTEE FINALIZED A REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR CALCULATING MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET RISK, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE MARKET RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS

SET AN EFFECTIVE DATE FOR REPORTING UNDER THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR MARKET RISK CAPITAL OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET PROPOSED RULES IMPLEMENTING THESE REVISIONS FOR U.S. BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CRR TO IMPLEMENT THESE REVISIONS FOR CERTAIN E.U. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GSI.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ALSO.



FINALIZED A REVISED STANDARD APPROACH FOR CALCULATING RWAS FOR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ON DERIVATIVES

EXPOSURES (STANDARDIZED APPROACH FOR MEASURING COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES, KNOWN AS SA-CCR);



PUBLISHED GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING AND CONTROLLING LARGE EXPOSURES (SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING

AND CONTROLLING LARGE EXPOSURES); AND



ISSUED CONSULTATION PAPERS ON, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, A REVIEW OF THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT RISK

FRAMEWORK, REVISIONS TO THE BASEL STANDARDIZED AND MODEL-BASED APPROACHES FOR CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL AND THE DESIGN OF A CAPITAL FLOOR FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE REVISED STANDARDIZED APPROACH.

LEVERAGE RATIOS.

UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, WE AND GS BANK USA ARE SUBJECT TO TIER 1 LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ALSO INTRODUCED A SUPPLEMENTARY

LEVERAGE RATIO FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 WHICH IMPLEMENTS THE BASEL III LEVERAGE RATIO FRAMEWORK.

IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CRR TO IMPLEMENT A 3% MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN

E.U. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GSI, WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT THE BASEL III LEVERAGE RATIO FRAMEWORK.

IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR AND GS BANK USAS TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIOS AND SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIOS AND GSIS LEVERAGE RATIO.

LIQUIDITY RATIOS.

THE BASEL COMMITTEES

INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MEASUREMENT, STANDARDS AND MONITORING REQUIRES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY AGAINST TWO SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS.

THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR) APPLICABLE TO BOTH GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES

FRAMEWORK AND IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT A BANKING ORGANIZATION MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER AN ACUTE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO.

IN DECEMBER 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS

BEGINNING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, LCR AVERAGES OVER THE QUARTER, QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE LCR CALCULATION AND PROJECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS.

THE LCR RULE ISSUED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION BECAME EFFECTIVE IN THE U.K. ON

OCTOBER 1, 2015, WITH A PHASE-IN PERIOD WHEREBY CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GSI, MUST HAVE A 90% AND 100% MINIMUM RATIO COMMENCING ON JANUARY 1, 2017 AND JANUARY 1, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR) IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM STABLE FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ACTIVITIES

OF BANKING ORGANIZATIONS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THE BASEL COMMITTEES NSFR FRAMEWORK REQUIRES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM NSFR OF 100%, AND WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. IN MAY 2016, THE U.S.

FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT AN NSFR FOR LARGE U.S. BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING GROUP INC. THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE STABLE FUNDING OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME

HORIZON. THE PROPOSED NSFR REQUIREMENT HAS AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2018, INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT FOR QUARTERLY PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE RATIO, AS WELL AS A DESCRIPTION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS STABLE FUNDING SOURCES.

IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CRR TO IMPLEMENT THE NSFR FOR CERTAIN E.U. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

INCLUDING GSI.

THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS (COVERED BHCS) TO COMPLY WITH ENHANCED LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, INCLUDING A LEVEL OF HIGHLY LIQUID ASSETS BASED ON PROJECTED FUNDING NEEDS FOR 30 DAYS,

AND INCREASED INVOLVEMENT BY BOARDS OF DIRECTORS IN LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT. ALTHOUGH THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT UNDER THESE RULES HAS SOME SIMILARITIES TO THE LCR, IT IS A SEPARATE REQUIREMENT.

STRESS TESTS.

COVERED BHCS, INCLUDING GROUP INC., ARE SUBJECT TO DODD-FRANK ACT ANNUAL SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS CONDUCTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND SEMI-ANNUAL COMPANY-RUN STRESS TESTS. THE STRESS TEST RULES REQUIRE

INCREASED INVOLVEMENT BY BOARDS OF DIRECTORS IN STRESS TESTING AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE RESULTS OF BOTH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS ANNUAL STRESS TESTS AND A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ANNUAL SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS, AND SEMI-ANNUAL

INTERNAL STRESS TESTS.

WE PUBLISH SUMMARIES OF OUR ANNUAL AND MID-CYCLE STRESS TESTS RESULTS ON OUR WEBSITE AS DESCRIBED UNDER

AVAILABLE INFORMATION BELOW. OUR ANNUAL DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST SUBMISSION IS INCORPORATED INTO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL PLANS THAT WE SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AS PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR). THE

PURPOSE OF CCAR IS TO ENSURE THAT LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES HAVE ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESSES THAT ACCOUNT FOR EACH INSTITUTIONS UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMIT CONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

STRESS. AS PART OF CCAR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EVALUATES AN INSTITUTIONS PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASING OR REDEEMING STOCK OR INCREASING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACROSS A RANGE OF MACROECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC

ASSUMPTIONS.

GS BANK USA IS ALSO REQUIRED TO CONDUCT STRESS TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, TO SUBMIT THE RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD,

AND TO MAKE A SUMMARY OF THOSE RESULTS PUBLIC. THE RULES REQUIRE THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GS BANK USA, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CONSIDER THE RESULTS OF THE STRESS TESTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE BANKS BUSINESS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO, ITS CAPITAL PLANNING, ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. GSI ALSO HAS ITS OWN CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, WHICH INCORPORATES INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE PRAS

INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY GROUP INC. TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND STOCK REPURCHASES BY GROUP INC. ARE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE POLICIES OF LARGE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, SUCH AS GROUP INC., ARE REVIEWED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THROUGH THE CCAR PROCESS, BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS AND STRESS TESTS SUBMITTED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY, AND ARE ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BANK HOLDING

COMPANYS ABILITY TO MEET AND EXCEED MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER STRESSED SCENARIOS, ITS EXPECTED SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON UNDER BASELINE AND STRESSED SCENARIOS, AND ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CHANGES TO

ITS BUSINESS PLAN AND ACTIVITIES ON ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL PLAN RULE INCLUDES A LIMITATION ON CAPITAL

DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL CAPITAL ISSUANCES ARE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT INDICATED IN THE CAPITAL PLAN SUBMISSION.

U.S. FEDERAL

AND STATE LAWS IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA. IN GENERAL, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY GS BANK USA IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A

RECENT EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY THE ENTITY IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS

NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE ENTITY OBTAINS PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF THE ENTITYS UNDIVIDED

PROFITS (GENERALLY, ACCUMULATED NET PROFITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PAID OUT AS DIVIDENDS OR TRANSFERRED TO SURPLUS).

THE APPLICABLE U.S.

BANKING REGULATORS HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING

ORGANIZATION. THE BHC ACT PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING A PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THAT SUBSIDIARY OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRES BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AT TIMES WHEN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE

DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT. CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A SUBSIDIARY BANK ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BANK. IN ADDITION, IF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY COMMITS TO A

U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCY THAT IT WILL MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF ITS BANK SUBSIDIARY, WHETHER IN RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS INVOKING ITS SOURCE-OF-STRENGTH AUTHORITY OR IN RESPONSE TO OTHER REGULATORY MEASURES, THAT COMMITMENT WILL

BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE FOR THE HOLDING COMPANY AND THE BANK WILL BE ENTITLED TO PRIORITY PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF THAT COMMITMENT, AHEAD OF OTHER CREDITORS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, ON THE ONE HAND, AND GROUP INC. OR ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THESE REGULATIONS

GENERALLY LIMIT THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM GS BANK USA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. OR ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES) THAT MAY TAKE PLACE AND GENERALLY REQUIRE THOSE TRANSACTIONS TO BE ON

MARKET TERMS OR BETTER TO GS BANK USA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THESE REGULATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT EXPANDED THE COVERAGE AND SCOPE OF THESE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING BY

APPLYING THEM TO THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ARISING UNDER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING TRANSACTIONS.

RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY.

GROUP INC. IS REQUIRED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC TO PROVIDE A PERIODIC PLAN FOR ITS RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE (RESOLUTION PLAN). OUR RESOLUTION PLAN MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DEMONSTRATE THAT GS BANK USA

IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER ENTITIES. THE REGULATORS JOINT RULE SETS SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR THE RESOLUTION PLANS, INCLUDING REQUIRING A DETAILED RESOLUTION STRATEGY AND ANALYSES OF THE COMPANYS MATERIAL

ENTITIES, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, INTERCONNECTIONS AND INTERDEPENDENCIES, AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AMONG OTHER ELEMENTS. IF THE REGULATORS JOINTLY DETERMINE THAT AN INSTITUTION HAS FAILED TO CURE IDENTIFIED SHORTCOMINGS IN ITS

RESOLUTION PLAN AND THAT ITS RESOLUTION PLAN, AFTER ANY PERMITTED RESUBMISSION, IS NOT CREDIBLE OR WOULD NOT FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, THE REGULATORS MAY JOINTLY IMPOSE MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OR RESTRICTIONS ON GROWTH, ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS OR MAY JOINTLY ORDER THE INSTITUTIONS TO DIVEST ASSETS OR OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL  RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

RESOLUTION PLAN.

WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO SUBMIT, AND HAVE SUBMITTED, ON A PERIODIC BASIS, A GLOBAL

RECOVERY PLAN THAT OUTLINES THE STEPS THAT MANAGEMENT COULD TAKE TO REDUCE RISK, MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, AND CONSERVE CAPITAL IN TIMES OF PROLONGED STRESS.

THE FDIC HAS ISSUED A RULE REQUIRING EACH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WITH $50 BILLION

OR MORE IN ASSETS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA, TO PROVIDE A RESOLUTION PLAN. OUR RESOLUTION PLAN FOR GS BANK USA MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER ENTITIES.

THE E.U. BANK RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION DIRECTIVE (BRRD) ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR THE RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE

E.U., SUCH AS GSI. THE BRRD PROVIDES NATIONAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES WITH TOOLS AND POWERS TO PRE-EMPTIVELY ADDRESS POTENTIAL FINANCIAL CRISES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND MINIMIZE TAXPAYERS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES. THE BRRD

REQUIRES E.U. MEMBER STATES TO GRANT BAIL-IN POWERS TO E.U. RESOLUTION AUTHORITIES TO RECAPITALIZE A FAILING ENTITY BY WRITING DOWN ITS UNSECURED DEBT OR CONVERTING ITS UNSECURED DEBT INTO EQUITY. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE E.U.

(INCLUDING GSI) MUST PROVIDE THAT NEW CONTRACTS ENABLE SUCH ACTIONS AND ALSO AMEND PRE-EXISTING CONTRACTS GOVERNED BY NON-E.U. LAW TO ENABLE SUCH ACTIONS, IF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER SUCH PRE-EXISTING CONTRACTS.

THE BRRD ALSO SUBJECTS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR OWN FUNDS AND ELIGIBLE LIABILITIES (MREL) SO THAT THEY CAN BE

RESOLVED WITHOUT CAUSING FINANCIAL INSTABILITY AND WITHOUT RECOURSE TO PUBLIC FUNDS IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE. THE BANK OF ENGLANDS RULES ON MREL ARE DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY.

IN MAY 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RELEASED A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON QUALIFIED FINANCIAL CONTRACTS (QFCS) OF

G-SIBS. THIS PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF A FAILED G-SIB BY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF THE G-SIB TO TRANSACT WITH QFC COUNTERPARTIES UNLESS SUCH COUNTERPARTIES WAIVE RIGHTS TO TERMINATE SUCH CONTRACTS IMMEDIATELY UPON

THE ENTRY OF THE G-SIB OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES INTO RESOLUTION. THE EFFECTIVE DATE IS PROPOSED TO BE APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR AFTER THE PROPOSAL IS FINALIZED.

TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY.

IN DECEMBER 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ADOPTED A FINAL RULE ESTABLISHING LOSS-ABSORBENCY AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. G-SIBS SUCH AS GROUP INC. THE RULE WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2019 WITH

NO PHASE-IN PERIOD. THE RULE ADDRESSES U.S. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARDS (FSB) TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY (TLAC) PRINCIPLES AND TERM SHEET ON MINIMUM TLAC REQUIREMENTS FOR G-SIBS. THE RULE (I) ESTABLISHES MINIMUM

TLAC REQUIREMENTS, (II) ESTABLISHES MINIMUM ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT (I.E., DEBT THAT IS UNSECURED, HAS A MATURITY GREATER THAN ONE YEAR FROM ISSUANCE AND SATISFIES CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CRITERIA) REQUIREMENTS, (III) PROHIBITS

CERTAIN HOLDING COMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND (IV) CAPS THE AMOUNT OF G-SIB LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT.

THE

RULE ALSO PROHIBITS A U.S. G-SIB FROM (I) GUARANTEEING LIABILITIES OF SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO EARLY TERMINATION PROVISIONS IF THE PARENT COMPANY OF A U.S.

G-SIB

ENTERS INTO AN INSOLVENCY OR

RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDING, SUBJECT TO AN EXCEPTION FOR GUARANTEES PERMITTED BY RULES OF THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON QFCS, WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED; (II) INCURRING LIABILITIES GUARANTEED BY SUBSIDIARIES;

(III) ISSUING SHORT-TERM DEBT; OR (IV) ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL CONTRACTS WITH EXTERNAL COUNTERPARTIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE RULE CAPS, AT 5% OF THE VALUE OF THE U.S.

G-SIBS

ELIGIBLE TLAC, THE AMOUNT OF

UNSECURED NON-CONTINGENT THIRD-PARTY LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT THAT COULD RANK EQUALLY WITH OR JUNIOR TO ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT.

IN OCTOBER 2016, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED A FINAL STANDARD TO IMPLEMENT CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS RELATING TO TLAC

HOLDINGS OF OTHER G-SIBS. THIS STANDARD WILL INFORM HOW THE DEDUCTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED BY NATIONAL REGULATORS.

THE FSB, AN INTERNATIONAL

BODY THAT SETS STANDARDS AND COORDINATES THE WORK OF NATIONAL FINANCIAL AUTHORITIES AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, ISSUED A FINAL TLAC STANDARD REQUIRING CERTAIN MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES OF A G-SIB ORGANIZED OUTSIDE OF THE G-SIBS HOME

COUNTRY, SUCH AS GSI, TO MAINTAIN AMOUNTS OF TLAC TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF LOSSES FROM OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES TO THE PARENT COMPANY. IN DECEMBER 2016, THE FSB ISSUED A CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT THAT PRESENTS A SET OF GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TLAC REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES. AS AN OBLIGATION OF MEMBERSHIP, THE FSBS MEMBERS, INCLUDING THE U.S., COMMIT TO IMPLEMENT INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE FSB.

THE BRRD SUBJECTS INSTITUTIONS TO MREL, WHICH IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE FSBS TLAC

STANDARD. IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE BANK OF ENGLAND PUBLISHED ITS POLICY ON SETTING MREL UNDER WHICH CERTAIN U.K. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN EQUITY AND LIABILITIES SUFFICIENT TO CREDIBLY BEAR LOSSES IN RESOLUTION. THE BANK

OF ENGLAND HAS NOT YET PUBLISHED ITS FINAL POLICY ON THE CALIBRATION OF MREL FOR ENTITIES THAT ARE PARTS OF GROUPS, SUCH AS GSI.

IN

NOVEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CRR AND BRRD THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IMPLEMENT THE FSBS MINIMUM TLAC REQUIREMENT FOR G-SIBS COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2019. THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE SUBSIDIARIES OF A

NON-E.U. G-SIB THAT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 5% OF OUR RWAS, OPERATING INCOME OR LEVERAGE EXPOSURE, SUCH AS GSI, TO MEET 90% OF THE REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO E.U. G-SIBS.

IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ALSO PROPOSED AN AMENDMENT TO CRD IV THAT WOULD REQUIRE A NON-E.U. G-SIB, SUCH AS GROUP

INC., TO ESTABLISH AN E.U. INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY (E.U. IHC) IF THE FIRM HAS TWO OR MORE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF E.U. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING BROKER-DEALERS AND BANKS, SUCH AS GSI AND GSIB. THIS PROPOSAL IS SUBJECT TO

ADOPTION AT THE E.U. LEVEL AND IMPLEMENTING RULEMAKINGS BY E.U. MEMBER STATES. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ALSO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CRR THAT WOULD REQUIRE E.U. IHCS TO SATISFY MREL REQUIREMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS.

INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT OF 1950, IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER FOR AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUCH AS GS BANK USA, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE

FDIC HAS BROAD POWERS, INCLUDING THE POWER.



TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR, INCLUDING A

NEWLY FORMED BRIDGE BANK, WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS;



TO ENFORCE THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY

PROVISIONS TRIGGERED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE FDIC IN THAT CAPACITY; OR



TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE

PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMANCE OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

IN ADDITION, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF DOMESTIC DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS, INCLUDING DEPOSITS AT NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND CLAIMS OF DEBTHOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR

OTHER RESOLUTION OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION BY ANY RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF GS BANK USA, THE DEBTHOLDERS (OTHER THAN DEPOSITORS) WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD

RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE DEPOSITORS OF GS BANK USA.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT CREATED A NEW RESOLUTION REGIME (KNOWN AS

ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY (OLA)) FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES THAT ARE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND CERTAIN NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. UNDER OLA, THE FDIC MAY BE APPOINTED AS RECEIVER FOR THE SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT INSTITUTION AND ITS FAILED NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES IF, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF APPLICABLE REGULATORS, THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY DETERMINES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE INSTITUTION IS IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT, THAT THE

INSTITUTIONS FAILURE WOULD HAVE SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THAT RESOLUTION UNDER OLA WOULD AVOID OR MITIGATE THOSE EFFECTS.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS RECEIVER UNDER OLA, THEN THE POWERS OF THE RECEIVER, AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CREDITORS AND OTHER PARTIES

WHO HAVE DEALT WITH THE INSTITUTION, WOULD BE DETERMINED UNDER OLA, AND NOT UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY LAW THAT WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY. THE POWERS OF THE RECEIVER UNDER OLA WERE GENERALLY BASED ON THE POWERS OF THE FDIC AS RECEIVER FOR

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT.

SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS EXIST BETWEEN OLA AND

THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC UNDER OLA TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE USE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE CREDITORS CLAIMS (AS OPPOSED TO THE

JUDICIAL PROCEDURE UTILIZED IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS), AND THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC TO TRANSFER CLAIMS TO A BRIDGE ENTITY. IN ADDITION, OLA LIMITS THE ABILITY OF CREDITORS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL CROSS-DEFAULTS AGAINST AFFILIATES OF

THE INSTITUTION IN RECEIVERSHIP.

THE OLA PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT. THE FDIC HAS COMPLETED

SEVERAL RULEMAKINGS AND TAKEN OTHER ACTIONS UNDER OLA, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF A NOTICE DESCRIBING SOME ELEMENTS OF ITS SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY OR SPOE STRATEGY PURSUANT TO THE OLA PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT. UNDER THIS

STRATEGY, THE FDIC WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESOLVE A FAILED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY BY TRANSFERRING ITS ASSETS TO A BRIDGE HOLDING COMPANY.

WE, ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER MAJOR GLOBAL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, ADHERE TO THE INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION RESOLUTION

STAY PROTOCOL (THE ISDA PROTOCOL) THAT WAS DEVELOPED AND UPDATED IN COORDINATION WITH THE FSB. THE ISDA PROTOCOL IMPOSES A STAY ON CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT AND EARLY TERMINATION RIGHTS WITHIN STANDARD ISDA DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS AND SECURITIES FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN ADHERING PARTIES IN THE EVENT THAT ONE OF THEM IS SUBJECT TO RESOLUTION IN ITS HOME JURISDICTION, INCLUDING A RESOLUTION UNDER OLA IN THE U.S. THE ISDA PROTOCOL IS EXPECTED TO BE ADOPTED MORE BROADLY IN THE FUTURE, FOLLOWING THE

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS BY BANKING REGULATORS (INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS PROPOSAL ON QFCS DESCRIBED ABOVE), AND EXPANDED TO INCLUDE INSTANCES WHERE A U.S. FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY BECOMES SUBJECT TO PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE U.S.

BANKRUPTCY CODE.

FDIC INSURANCE.

GS BANK USA

ACCEPTS DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF FDIC INSURANCE UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE

ASSESSMENTS FOR LARGER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (GENERALLY THOSE THAT HAVE $10 BILLION IN ASSETS OR MORE), SUCH AS GS BANK USA, ARE CURRENTLY BASED ON THE AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD, THE SUPERVISORY RATINGS OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND SPECIFIED FORWARD-LOOKING FINANCIAL MEASURES USED TO CALCULATE THE ASSESSMENT RATE. THE ASSESSMENT RATE IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT

BY THE FDIC.

IN MARCH 2016, THE FDIC ADOPTED A FINAL RULE INCREASING THE RESERVE RATIO FOR THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND TO 1.35%

OF TOTAL INSURED DEPOSITS. THE RULE IMPOSES A SURCHARGE ON THE ASSESSMENTS OF LARGER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, THAT BEGAN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016 AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE EARLIER OF THE QUARTER THAT THE RESERVE RATIO FIRST REACHES OR EXCEEDS

1.35% AND DECEMBER 31, 2018. UNDER THE RULE, IF THE RESERVE RATIO DOES NOT REACH 1.35% BY DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE FDIC WILL IMPOSE A SHORTFALL ASSESSMENT ON LARGER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GS BANK USA.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION.

THE U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA), AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET SPECIFIED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FDICIA ESTABLISHES FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES FOR FDIC-INSURED BANKS: WELL-CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED AND CRITICALLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED.

AN INSTITUTION MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO, OR DEEMED TO BE IN, A CAPITAL CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY

ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IF IT IS DETERMINED TO BE IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS. FDICIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS,

MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, AS THE CAPITAL CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION DECLINES. FAILURE TO MEET THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COULD ALSO REQUIRE A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO RAISE CAPITAL. ULTIMATELY, CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR, AS DESCRIBED UNDER INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY ABOVE.

THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS GROUP INC. HOWEVER,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED UPON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO AN

UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO

FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE HOLDING COMPANY, THE GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE HOLDING COMPANYS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS, AS DESCRIBED UNDER SOURCE OF

STRENGTH ABOVE.

ACTIVITIES.

THE DODD-FRANK

ACT AND THE BHC ACT GENERALLY RESTRICT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES FROM ENGAGING IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THE BUSINESS OF BANKING AND CERTAIN CLOSELY RELATED ACTIVITIES.

VOLCKER RULE.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2015. THE VOLCKER RULE PROHIBITS PROPRIETARY TRADING, BUT PERMITS ACTIVITIES SUCH AS

UNDERWRITING, MARKET MAKING AND RISK-MITIGATION HEDGING, REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND INCLUDES ADDITIONAL REPORTING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE CALCULATING DAILY QUANTITATIVE METRICS ON COVERED

TRADING ACTIVITIES (AS DEFINED IN THE RULE) AND PROVIDING THESE METRICS TO REGULATORS ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

IN ADDITION, THE VOLCKER

RULE LIMITS THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS (AS DEFINED IN THE RULE) BY BANKING ENTITIES, INCLUDING GROUP INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IT ALSO LIMITS CERTAIN TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN US AND OUR SPONSORED FUNDS,

SIMILAR TO THE LIMITATIONS ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR AFFILIATES. COVERED FUNDS INCLUDE OUR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, CERTAIN OF OUR CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS, OUR HEDGE FUNDS AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENT STRUCTURES.

THE LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS IN COVERED FUNDS REQUIRES US TO REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT IN EACH SUCH FUND TO 3% OR LESS OF THE FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE, AND TO REDUCE OUR AGGREGATE INVESTMENT IN ALL SUCH FUNDS TO 3% OR LESS OF OUR TIER 1

CAPITAL.

IN JULY 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EXTENDED THE CONFORMANCE PERIOD THROUGH JULY 2017 FOR INVESTMENTS IN, AND

RELATIONSHIPS WITH, COVERED FUNDS THAT WERE IN PLACE PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2013. IN DECEMBER 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RELEASED GUIDANCE REGARDING THE EXTENDED CONFORMANCE PERIOD AVAILABLE FOR LEGACY ILLIQUID FUNDS

(AS DEFINED IN THE VOLCKER RULE) AND THE PROCESS FOR BANKING ENTITIES TO REQUEST AN EXTENSION OF THE CONFORMANCE PERIOD FOR THOSE FUNDS OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS BEYOND THE EXPIRATION OF THE GENERAL CONFORMANCE PERIOD IN JULY 2017. SEE

OTHER RESTRICTIONS.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY CAN ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND RELATED ACTIVITIES THAN ARE OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO MEET THE ELIGIBILITY

REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. THE BROADER RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES INCLUDES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND MAKING MARKETS IN SECURITIES AND MAKING INVESTMENTS IN NON-FINANCIAL COMPANIES (MERCHANT

BANKING ACTIVITIES). IN ADDITION, CERTAIN FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE GLB ACT TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S. THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE IMPERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SO LONG AS THE ASSETS HELD

PURSUANT TO THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT EQUAL 5% OR MORE OF THEIR CONSOLIDATED ASSETS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, HOWEVER, HAS THE

AUTHORITY TO LIMIT A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONDUCT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PERMISSIBLE, AND WILL LIKELY DO SO IF THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY DOES NOT SATISFACTORILY MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES CEASES TO MAINTAIN ITS STATUS AS WELL-CAPITALIZED OR WELL-MANAGED, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL

REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS. IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST, THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO DIVEST ITS U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OR TO CEASE ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THE

BUSINESS OF BANKING AND CERTAIN CLOSELY RELATED ACTIVITIES.

IF ANY INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY OF A FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT, THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD APPROVAL BEFORE ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES

BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S.

IN SEPTEMBER 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE WHICH, IF ADOPTED,

WOULD IMPOSE NEW REQUIREMENTS ON THE PHYSICAL COMMODITY ACTIVITIES AND CERTAIN MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. THE PROPOSED RULE WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) REQUIRE COMPANIES TO HOLD ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN

CONNECTION WITH COVERED PHYSICAL COMMODITY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN PHYSICAL COMMODITY ACTIVITIES; (II) TIGHTEN THE QUANTITATIVE LIMITS ON PERMISSIBLE PHYSICAL TRADING ACTIVITY; AND

(III) ESTABLISH NEW PUBLIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF FIRMS PHYSICAL COMMODITY HOLDINGS AND ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, IN A SEPTEMBER 2016 REPORT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT CONGRESS REPEAL

(I) THE AUTHORITY OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES TO ENGAGE IN MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES; AND (II) THE AUTHORITY DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES.

IN MARCH 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ISSUED A REVISED PROPOSAL REGARDING SINGLE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT LIMITS, WHICH WOULD IMPOSE

MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT EXPOSURES AMONG MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. SUCH LIMITS (TOGETHER WITH OTHER PROVISIONS INCORPORATED INTO THE BASEL III CAPITAL RULES) MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO TRANSACT OR HEDGE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS PROPOSED EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE MODELED ON THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGIME, DESCRIBED UNDER PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION ABOVE, BUT ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE

ACTION TO BEGIN IN EARLIER STAGES OF A COMPANYS FINANCIAL DISTRESS, BASED ON A RANGE OF TRIGGERS, INCLUDING CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE, STRESS TEST RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT.

IN ADDITION, NEW YORK STATE BANKING LAW IMPOSES LENDING LIMITS (WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS) AND OTHER

REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD IMPACT THE MANNER AND SCOPE OF GS BANK USAS ACTIVITIES.

THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE

ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT FOCUSES ON TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS AND THAT OUTLINES HIGH-LEVEL PRINCIPLES FOR SAFE-AND-SOUND LEVERAGED LENDING, INCLUDING UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, VALUATION AND STRESS TESTING. THIS GUIDANCE HAS,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMITED THE PERCENTAGE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.

FEDERAL AGENCIES PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT THAT REQUIRE ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES OR INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITY TRANSACTION TO RETAIN A PORTION (GENERALLY, AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT) OF ANY CREDIT RISK THAT THE PERSON CONVEYS TO A THIRD

PARTY. SECURITIZATIONS WOULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY RULES PROPOSED BY THE SEC TO IMPLEMENT THE DODD-FRANK ACTS PROHIBITION AGAINST SECURITIZATION PARTICIPANTS ENGAGING IN ANY TRANSACTION THAT WOULD INVOLVE OR RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CONFLICT OF

INTEREST WITH AN INVESTOR IN A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION. THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD EXEMPT BONA FIDE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AND RISK-MITIGATING HEDGING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES FROM THE GENERAL PROHIBITION.

THE SEC, FINRA AND REGULATORS IN VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS HAVE IMPOSED BOTH CONDUCT-BASED AND DISCLOSURE-BASED REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT

THE TERMS SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS ARE GENERALLY

DEFINED BROADLY FOR PURPOSES OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND CAN INCLUDE A WIDE VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN ADDITION TO THOSE CONVENTIONALLY CALLED SWAPS. THE DEFINITION INCLUDES CERTAIN FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS, CERTAIN LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

AND GUARANTEES OF SWAPS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND RELATES TO A WIDE VARIETY OF UNDERLYING ASSETS OR OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, INTEREST OR OTHER MONETARY RATES, YIELDS, INDICES, SECURITIES, CREDIT EVENTS, LOANS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

IN GENERAL, THE CFTC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUING RULES RELATING TO SWAPS, SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR

SWAP PARTICIPANTS, AND THE SEC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ISSUING RULES RELATING TO SECURITY-BASED SWAPS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS. THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES (ACTING JOINTLY) ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

ISSUING MARGIN RULES FOR UNCLEARED SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS FOR SWAP DEALERS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS SUBJECT TO THEIR OVERSIGHT. IN SEPTEMBER 2016, THE FINAL MARGIN

RULES ISSUED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE CFTC FOR UNCLEARED SWAPS BECAME EFFECTIVE. THESE RULES WILL PHASE IN THROUGH MARCH 2017 FOR VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2020 FOR INITIAL MARGIN

REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF SWAPS, SECURITY-BASED SWAPS AND/OR EXEMPT FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION ACTIVITY OF THE SWAP DEALER AND THE RELEVANT COUNTERPARTY. THE FINAL RULES OF THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES

GENERALLY APPLY TO INTER-AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS, WITH LIMITED RELIEF AVAILABLE FROM INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFILIATES. UNDER THE CFTC FINAL RULES, INTER-AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS ARE EXEMPT FROM INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS WITH CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS BUT VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS STILL APPLY.

IN DECEMBER 2016, THE CFTC PROPOSED REVISED CAPITAL REGULATIONS FOR SWAP

DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL RULES OF A PRUDENTIAL REGULATOR, SUCH AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AS WELL AS A LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT FOR THOSE SWAP DEALERS. HOWEVER, MANY OTHER REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING

REGISTRATION OF SWAP DEALERS, MANDATORY CLEARING AND EXECUTION OF CERTAIN SWAPS, BUSINESS CONDUCT STANDARDS AND REAL-TIME PUBLIC TRADE REPORTING, HAVE TAKEN EFFECT ALREADY UNDER CFTC RULES, AND THE SEC AND THE CFTC HAVE FINALIZED THE DEFINITIONS OF

A NUMBER OF KEY TERMS. FINALLY, THE CFTC HAS BEGUN TO DECIDE WHICH SWAPS MUST BE CLEARED THROUGH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES AND EXECUTED ON SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES OR EXCHANGES. IN PARTICULAR, CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS ARE

NOW SUBJECT TO THESE CLEARING AND TRADE-EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS. THE CFTC IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATIONS DURING 2017.

THE SEC HAS ADOPTED RULES RELATING TO TRADE REPORTING AND REAL-TIME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR

SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS. THE SEC HAS ALSO ADOPTED FINAL RULES RELATING TO THE REGISTRATION OF, AND APPLICATION OF BUSINESS CONDUCT STANDARDS TO, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP

PARTICIPANTS, BUT COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH RULES IS NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED. THE SEC HAS PROPOSED, BUT NOT YET FINALIZED, RULES TO IMPOSE MARGIN, CAPITAL AND SEGREGATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP

PARTICIPANTS. THE SEC HAS ALSO PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD GOVERN THE DESIGN OF NEW TRADING VENUES FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAPS AND ESTABLISH THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHICH PRODUCTS MUST BE TRADED ON THESE VENUES.

WE HAVE REGISTERED CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AS SWAP DEALERS UNDER THE CFTC RULES, INCLUDING GS&CO., GS BANK USA, GSI AND J.

ARON & COMPANY. WE ALSO EXPECT TO REGISTER CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AS SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS.

SIMILAR REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN

PROPOSED OR ADOPTED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDIZED EXECUTION AND CLEARING, MARGINING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR OTC DERIVATIVES. FOR INSTANCE, THE E.U. HAS ESTABLISHED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR OTC

DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES UNDER THE EUROPEAN MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO PORTFOLIO RECONCILIATION AND REPORTING, CLEARING CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES AND MARGINING FOR UNCLEARED DERIVATIVES.

THE CFTC AND SEC HAVE ISSUED GUIDANCE AND RULES RELATING TO SWAP ACTIVITIES. THE CFTC HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE AND TIMING ON THE CROSS-BORDER

REGULATION OF SWAPS AND ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD REACHED AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REGARDING THE CROSS-BORDER REGULATION OF DERIVATIVES AND THE COMMON GOALS UNDERLYING THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATIONS. THE CFTC ALSO APPROVED CERTAIN

COMPARABILITY DETERMINATIONS THAT WOULD PERMIT SUBSTITUTED COMPLIANCE WITH NON-U.S. REGULATORY REGIMES FOR CERTAIN SWAP REGULATIONS RELATED TO CERTAIN BUSINESS CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER DUTIES, CONFLICT OF INTEREST

RULES, MONITORING OF POSITION LIMITS, RECORD-KEEPING AND RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE SEC ISSUED RULES AND GUIDANCE ON CROSS-BORDER SECURITY-BASED SWAP ACTIVITIES AND THE CFTC

ISSUED RULES THAT DETERMINE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CFTCS RULES REGARDING MARGIN IN CONNECTION WITH UNCLEARED SWAPS IN CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, CERTAIN NON-U.S. SWAP DEALERS ARE

GENERALLY REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CFTCS RULES BUT, WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUIREMENT TO POST MARGIN, THESE NON-U.S. SWAP DEALERS ARE PERMITTED TO COMPLY WITH COMPARABLE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS IN A FOREIGN JURISDICTION, SUBJECT TO THE

CFTCS APPROVAL OF THE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. SUBSTITUTED COMPLIANCE IS ALSO AVAILABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF MARGIN IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE CFTCS RULES ARE ONLY APPLICABLE TO THOSE SWAP DEALERS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO

THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF A PRUDENTIAL REGULATOR.

IN OCTOBER 2016, THE CFTC PROPOSED RULES ADDRESSING THE EXTENT TO WHICH SWAP

DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CFTCS BUSINESS CONDUCT STANDARDS IN CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS. THE PROPOSAL ALSO WOULD DETERMINE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH U.S. AND NON-U.S. PERSONS WOULD BE REQUIRED

TO INCLUDE THEIR CROSS-BORDER SWAP DEALING TRANSACTIONS OR SWAP POSITIONS IN THEIR CALCULATIONS OF THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY SUBJECT TO CFTC JURISDICTION FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS EITHER A SWAP DEALER OR MAJOR

SWAP PARTICIPANT.

THE APPLICATION OF NEW DERIVATIVES RULES ACROSS DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY

ESTABLISHED AND SPECIFIC DETERMINATIONS OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH REGULATORS IN EACH OF THE RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS WILL DEFER TO REGULATIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED. THE FULL IMPACT OF THE VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY

DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS AREA WILL NOT BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY UNTIL ALL THE RULES ARE FINALIZED AND IMPLEMENTED AND MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES DEVELOP UNDER THE FINAL RULES.

J. ARON & COMPANY IS AUTHORIZED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION (FERC) TO SELL WHOLESALE PHYSICAL POWER AT

MARKET-BASED RATES. AS A FERC-AUTHORIZED POWER MARKETER, J. ARON & COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL POWER ACT AND FERC REGULATIONS AND TO THE OVERSIGHT OF FERC. AS A RESULT OF OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, GROUP INC. IS

ALSO AN EXEMPT HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE U.S. PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 2005 AND APPLICABLE FERC RULES.

IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF OUR POWER-RELATED AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS DESCRIBED UNDER RISK FACTORS  OUR COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR PHYSICAL COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION AND INVOLVE CERTAIN

POTENTIAL RISKS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REGULATION

OUR INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT REGULATION IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD RELATING TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT ASSETS, OFFERINGS OF FUNDS, MARKETING ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS AMONG AFFILIATES AND OUR

MANAGEMENT OF CLIENT FUNDS.

CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED WITH, AND SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY, THE SEC AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS.

THE SEC HAS ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES THAT GOVERN SEC-REGISTERED MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS. THE AMENDED RULES REQUIRE INSTITUTIONAL PRIME MONEY MARKET FUNDS TO VALUE THEIR PORTFOLIO SECURITIES USING MARKET-BASED FACTORS AND TO SELL AND REDEEM

THEIR SHARES BASED ON A FLOATING NET ASSET VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE RULES ALLOW, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS TO IMPOSE LIQUIDITY FEES AND REDEMPTION GATES AND ALSO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE,

REPORTING AND STRESS TESTING.

IN OCTOBER 2016, THE SEC ALSO ADOPTED RULES RELATING TO LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT THAT, AMONG OTHERS,

REQUIRE REGISTERED OPEN-END FUNDS TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, ESTABLISH A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF THEIR NET ASSETS THAT WILL BE INVESTED IN HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS AND ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS

SHORTFALLS IN MEETING THAT MINIMUM (APPLICABLE ONLY TO FUNDS THAT DO NOT PRIMARILY HOLD ASSETS THAT ARE HIGHLY LIQUID), AND CLASSIFY AND REVIEW THE LIQUIDITY OF THEIR PORTFOLIO ASSETS. THE RULES ALSO PERMIT FUNDS TO EMPLOY SWING PRICING,

UNDER WHICH THE NET ASSET VALUE OF A FUNDS SHARES MAY BE ADJUSTED IN ORDER TO PASS THE COST OF TRADING IN SUCH SHARES TO PURCHASING OR REDEEMING SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, THE RULES REQUIRE FUNDS TO MAKE DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THEIR LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND SWING PRICING POLICIES.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

IN DECEMBER 2015, THE SEC ALSO PROPOSED A RULE REGULATING THE USE OF DERIVATIVES BY

REGISTERED FUNDS. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, A REGISTERED FUND WOULD BE REQUIRED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPLY WITH ONE OF TWO ALTERNATIVE PORTFOLIO LIMITATIONS DESIGNED TO IMPOSE A LIMIT ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE THE FUND CAN OBTAIN THROUGH

DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS; MAINTAIN A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF QUALIFYING COVERAGE ASSETS (GENERALLY LIMITED TO CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS) TO SUPPORT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR EACH DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION; ESTABLISH A DERIVATIVES RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM IF DERIVATIVE USE MEETS SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS; AND COMPLY WITH NEW RECORD-KEEPING, DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO ITS USE OF DERIVATIVES.

CERTAIN OF OUR EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND MANAGERS DIRECTIVE AND RELATED REGULATIONS, WHICH GOVERN

THE APPROVAL, ORGANIZATIONAL, MARKETING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF E.U.-BASED ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND THE ABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND MANAGERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE E.U. TO ACCESS THE E.U. MARKET.

THE E.U. LEGISLATIVE INSTITUTIONS HAVE REACHED PROVISIONAL AGREEMENT ON AN E.U. REGULATION RELATING TO MONEY MARKET FUNDS, INCLUDING PROVISIONS

PRESCRIBING MINIMUM LEVELS OF DAILY AND WEEKLY LIQUIDITY, CLEAR LABELING OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND INTERNAL CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENTS. THIS E.U. REGULATION IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017 AND IS EXPECTED TO APPLY

FROM EARLY 2018 (SUBJECT TO TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS).

COMPENSATION PRACTICES

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND, WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND EMPLOYEES,

BY OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATORY BODIES WORLDWIDE. THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF COMPENSATION REGULATION IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP, AND WE EXPECT THAT THESE REGULATIONS AND RESULTING MARKET PRACTICES WILL EVOLVE OVER A NUMBER OF

YEARS.

THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE PROVIDED GUIDANCE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AT BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RISK AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH SAFE AND SOUND PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE SETS FORTH THE FOLLOWING THREE KEY PRINCIPLES WITH RESPECT TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS.

(I) THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO EXPOSE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISK; (II) THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD

BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT; AND (III) THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. THE GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT SUPERVISORY FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION WILL BE

INCORPORATED, AS APPROPRIATE, INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS, WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER ACTIONS. THE GUIDANCE ALSO PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING

ORGANIZATION IF ITS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT, CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS.

THE FSB HAS RELEASED STANDARDS FOR LOCAL REGULATORS TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES FOR BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES

DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE SOUND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. IN THE E.U., THE CRR AND CRD IV INCLUDE COMPENSATION PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO IMPLEMENT THE FSBS COMPENSATION STANDARDS. THESE RULES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY E.U. MEMBER STATES AND, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, LIMIT THE RATIO OF VARIABLE TO FIXED COMPENSATION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE RISK PROFILE OF E.U.-REGULATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING GSI.

THE E.U. HAS ALSO INTRODUCED RULES REGULATING COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN PERSONS PROVIDING SERVICES TO CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS. THESE

REQUIREMENTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVISION DESCRIBED BELOW.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, THE U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE SEC, PROPOSED REVISED RULES ON

INCENTIVE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AT SPECIFIED REGULATED ENTITIES HAVING AT LEAST $1 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS (INCLUDING GROUP INC. AND SOME OF ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER SUBSIDIARIES).

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE PROPOSED REVISED RULES WOULD ESTABLISH GENERAL QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL

COVERED ENTITIES, ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTITIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF AT LEAST $50 BILLION AND FURTHER, MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF AT LEAST $250 BILLION. THE GENERAL

QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE (I) PROHIBITING INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISKS BY PROVIDING EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION; (II) PROHIBITING INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISKS THAT COULD LEAD TO A

MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS; (III) ESTABLISHING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND REWARD; (IV) REQUIRING BOARD OF DIRECTOR OVERSIGHT OF INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS; AND (V) MANDATING APPROPRIATE

RECORD-KEEPING.

FOR LARGER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE PROPOSED REVISED RULES WOULD ALSO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE ONLY

TO SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND SIGNIFICANT RISK-TAKERS (AS DEFINED IN THE PROPOSED RULES), INCLUDING (I) LIMITS ON PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND LEVERAGE RELATING TO PERFORMANCE TARGETS; (II) MINIMUM DEFERRAL PERIODS;

AND (III) SUBJECTING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TO POSSIBLE DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT, FORFEITURE AND CLAWBACK.

IN OCTOBER 2016, THE NYDFS

ISSUED GUIDANCE EMPHASIZING THAT ITS REGULATED BANKING INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GS BANK USA, MUST ENSURE THAT ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS TIED TO EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS ARE SUBJECT TO EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT AND

CONTROL.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ANTI-BRIBERY RULES AND REGULATIONS

THE U.S. BANK SECRECY ACT (BSA), AS AMENDED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (PATRIOT ACT), CONTAINS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL

TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND MANDATED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR VERIFYING CLIENT IDENTIFICATION AT ACCOUNT OPENING, AND OBLIGATIONS TO MONITOR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS, THE BSA AND THE PATRIOT ACT SEEK TO PROMOTE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES THAT MAY BE INVOLVED IN TERRORISM, MONEY LAUNDERING OR OTHER SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS

OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONTAIN SOME SIMILAR PROVISIONS.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING THE U.S. FOREIGN

CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND THE U.K. BRIBERY ACT, RELATING TO CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL PAYMENTS TO, AND HIRING PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OTHERS. THE SCOPE OF THE TYPES OF PAYMENTS OR OTHER BENEFITS COVERED BY THESE LAWS IS VERY

BROAD AND REGULATORS ARE FREQUENTLY USING ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS TO DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THESE LAWS. THE OBLIGATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS, TO IDENTIFY THEIR CLIENTS, TO MONITOR FOR AND REPORT SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, TO

MONITOR DIRECT AND INDIRECT PAYMENTS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS REQUIRED THE IMPLEMENTATION

AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNAL PRACTICES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS.

PRIVACY AND CYBER SECURITY REGULATION

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS ENACTED BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, THE E.U. OR OTHER

NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS AND/OR ENACTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS OR EXCHANGES RELATING TO THE PRIVACY OF THE INFORMATION OF CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHERS, INCLUDING THE GLB ACT, THE E.U. DATA PROTECTION

DIRECTIVE, THE JAPANESE PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION ACT, THE HONG KONG PERSONAL DATA (PRIVACY) ORDINANCE, THE AUSTRALIAN PRIVACY ACT AND THE BRAZILIAN BANK SECRECY LAW.

IN FEBRUARY 2017, THE NYDFS ADOPTED REGULATIONS THAT WILL, BEGINNING MARCH 1, 2017, REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REGULATED BY

THE NYDFS, INCLUDING GS BANK USA, TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A CYBER SECURITY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF THEIR INFORMATION SYSTEMS; (II) IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A

WRITTEN CYBER SECURITY POLICY SETTING FORTH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND NONPUBLIC INFORMATION; AND (III) DESIGNATE A CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. IN ADDITION, IN OCTOBER 2016, THE U.S.

FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED AN ADVANCE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING ON POTENTIAL ENHANCED CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OTHER REGULATION

U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS STATE SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND OTHER

STATE REGULATORS IN THE U.S., ARE EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS, OR THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A REGULATED ENTITY OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR

EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN LICENSES, ADHERE TO APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND BE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF VARIOUS REGULATORS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT THESE ACTIVITIES.

THE E.U. IS FINALIZING IMPLEMENTING MEASURES UNDER THE MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REGULATION AND UNDER A REVISION OF THE MARKETS IN

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE (COLLECTIVELY, MIFID II). MIFID II WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 3, 2018. ALTHOUGH THE IMPLEMENTING RULES AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS WERE LARGELY FINALIZED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN

SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY (ESMA) IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2016, SIGNIFICANT LEGAL UNCERTAINTY STILL REMAINS IN TERMS OF COMMODITIES POSITION LIMITS AND SEVERAL MARKET STRUCTURE RULES. IN ADDITION, LEGAL UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN UNTIL MEMBER

STATES FINALIZE THEIR RULES TRANSPOSING MIFID II INTO THEIR LAW, WHICH THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO BY JULY 2017.

MIFID II INCLUDES

EXTENSIVE MARKET STRUCTURE REFORMS, SUCH AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW TRADING VENUE CATEGORIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF DISCHARGING THE OBLIGATION TO TRADE OTC DERIVATIVES ON A TRADING PLATFORM AND ENHANCED PRE- AND POST-TRADE TRANSPARENCY COVERING A

WIDER RANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. IN EQUITIES, MIFID II INTRODUCES VOLUME CAPS ON NON-TRANSPARENT LIQUIDITY TRADING FOR TRADING VENUES, LIMITS THE USE OF BROKER-DEALER CROSSING NETWORKS AND CREATES A NEW REGIME FOR SYSTEMATIC INTERNALIZERS,

WHICH EXECUTE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS OUTSIDE A TRADING VENUE.

ADDITIONAL CONTROLS WILL BE INTRODUCED FOR ALGORITHMIC TRADING, HIGH FREQUENCY

TRADING AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS. COMMODITIES TRADING FIRMS WILL BE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THEIR POSITIONS AND ADHERE TO SPECIFIC LIMITS. OTHER REFORMS INTRODUCE ENHANCED TRANSACTION REPORTING, THE PUBLICATION OF BEST EXECUTION DATA BY INVESTMENT

FIRMS AND TRADING VENUES, TRANSPARENCY ON COSTS AND CHARGES OF SERVICE TO INVESTORS, CHANGES TO THE WAY INVESTMENT MANAGERS CAN PAY FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVESTMENT RESEARCH AND MANDATORY UNBUNDLING FOR BROKER-DEALERS BETWEEN EXECUTION AND OTHER MAJOR

SERVICES.

THE E.U. AND NATIONAL FINANCIAL LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS IN THE E.U. HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED

NUMEROUS FURTHER MARKET REFORMS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, RULES ON KEY INFORMATION DOCUMENTS FOR PACKAGED RETAIL AND INSURANCE-BASED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND RULES

ON INDICES THAT ARE USED AS BENCHMARKS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR FUNDS. IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, ESMA AND THE EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY HAVE ANNOUNCED OR ARE FORMULATING REGULATORY STANDARDS AND OTHER MEASURES WHICH WILL IMPACT OUR

EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITIES EXCHANGES OF WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS PUBLISHED A PROPOSAL FOR A COMMON SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX WHICH WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN CERTAIN E.U.

MEMBER STATES WILLING TO ENGAGE IN ENHANCED COOPERATION IN THIS AREA. THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX IS BROAD IN SCOPE AND WOULD APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS

ALSO PUBLISHED A DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR STRUCTURAL REFORM OF E.U. BANKS, WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT CERTAIN BANKS FROM PROPRIETARY TRADING AND WOULD REQUIRE SEPARATING CERTAIN TRADING ACTIVITIES FROM DEPOSIT-TAKING ENTITIES.

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. SUBSIDIARIES

NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION MAY HOLD CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS OR INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED UPON ITS UNDERLYING

RISK.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTOR

S

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL,

REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE

BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. THESE CONDITIONS CAN CHANGE SUDDENLY AND NEGATIVELY.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY

CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, REGULATORY AND MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH RESULT IN TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, CLEAR REGULATIONS AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: CONCERNS ABOUT SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS; UNCERTAINTY IN U.S. FEDERAL FISCAL OR MONETARY POLICY, THE U.S.

FEDERAL DEBT CEILING AND THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT; THE EXTENT OF AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND NATURE OF REGULATORY REFORMS; DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON

THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; ILLIQUID MARKETS; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE OR BASIC COMMODITY PRICE VOLATILITY OR DEFAULT RATES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY

OR UNCERTAINTY, SUCH AS BREXIT; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM, ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

BREXIT, AND ABOUT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS OR ACTUAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS IN CHINA, HAVE RESULTED, AT TIMES, IN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY WHILE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTING THE LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY.

GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND MARKET ACTIVITIES, AND THE SCOPE, TIMING AND

FINAL IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATORY REFORM, AS WELL AS WEAK CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE RESULTING IN LARGE PART FROM SUCH UNCERTAINTY, CONTINUES TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT CLIENT ACTIVITY, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES. PERIODS

OF LOW VOLATILITY AND PERIODS OF HIGH VOLATILITY COMBINED WITH A LACK OF LIQUIDITY, HAVE AT TIMES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES.

OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AND THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CAPITAL,

ADDITIONAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY, LEVERAGE, MINIMUM LIQUIDITY AND LONG-TERM FUNDING LEVELS, REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING, DERIVATIVES CLEARING AND MARGIN RULES AND LEVELS OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS

ON WHICH AND, IF PERMITTED, HOW CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY BE CARRIED OUT BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH INTEREST RATES ARE AT OR NEAR HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION RETURNS HAVE ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED

FUNDING COSTS DUE IN PART TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF PERCEIVED GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE FINANCIAL CRISES. IN ADDITION, LIQUIDITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND

MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES ADJUST TO NEW REGULATIONS.

THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE AND OTHER CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

WILL HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE FINAL INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW REGULATIONS, THE MANNER IN WHICH MARKETS, MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ADAPT TO THE NEW

LANDSCAPE, AND THE PREVAILING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT SUCH CHANGES WILL, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM, CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON

EQUITY AT OUR FIRM AND AT OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE REGULATION AROUND THE

WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. IN MANY CASES, OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO

OVERLAPPING AND DIVERGENT REGULATION IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS OR PRIVATE PARTIES CHALLENGING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR

BUSINESSES OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. SUCH LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE IMPACT ON THE SCOPE AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, DAY-TO-DAY COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ADOPTED SINCE 2008, HAS INVOLVED AND WILL, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF SUCH REGULATIONS ARE EVENTUALLY MODIFIED OR OTHERWISE REPEALED, CONTINUE TO INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TIME,

INCLUDING THAT OF OUR SENIOR LEADERS AND THAT OF AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DEDICATED COMPLIANCE AND OTHER REPORTING AND OPERATIONAL PERSONNEL, ALL OF WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

IF THERE ARE NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR

CLIENTS, INCLUDING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE, LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS ON LEVERAGED LENDING OR OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RECOVERY AND

RESOLUTION PLANNING, TAX BURDENS AND COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS, THAT ARE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES, GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), COMPLIANCE WITH THESE NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR CHANGES

IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY. IN ADDITION, REGULATION IMPOSED ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR MARKET

PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY, SUCH AS TAXES ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LEVELS OF MARKET ACTIVITY MORE BROADLY, AND THUS IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT

UNECONOMIC FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING OUR BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESSES AND OUR EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS

AND CREDITORS.

U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND BASEL III, HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY.

AMONG THE ASPECTS OF

THE DODD-FRANK ACT THAT HAVE AFFECTED OR MAY IN THE FUTURE AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES ARE: INCREASED CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; LIMITATIONS ON ACTIVITIES IN WHICH WE MAY ENGAGE; INCREASED REGULATION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON OTC

DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATIONS ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION; LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS; REQUIREMENTS TO REORGANIZE OR LIMIT ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANNING; INCREASED DEPOSIT INSURANCE

ASSESSMENTS; AND INCREASED STANDARDS OF CARE FOR BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE LCR, THE NSFR, REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO LONG-TERM DEBT AND TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING

CAPACITY AND THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING AND THE SPONSORSHIP OF, OR INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS BY THE VOLCKER RULE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY IF THESE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY EQUALLY

TO OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS.

AS DESCRIBED UNDER BUSINESS 

REGULATION  CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS  PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K, GROUP INC.S PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS AND CAPITAL PLAN ARE REVIEWED BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AS PART OF THE CCAR PROCESS. IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OBJECTS TO OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN, GROUP INC. COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM TAKING SOME OR ALL OF THE PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING

INCREASING OR PAYING DIVIDENDS ON COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK OR REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK OR OTHER CAPITAL SECURITIES. OUR INABILITY TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVENT US FROM RETURNING CAPITAL TO OUR

SHAREHOLDERS AND IMPACT OUR RETURN ON EQUITY.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY OF THE INFORMATION OF

CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHERS, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY AND/OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESSES ARE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO SURVEILLANCE, ENCRYPTION

AND DATA ON-SHORING IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY FOR INFORMATION SECURITY, WHICH COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE US MORE

VULNERABLE TO CYBER ATTACKS AND MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF INFORMATION OR TECHNOLOGY.

INCREASINGLY, REGULATORS AND COURTS

HAVE SOUGHT TO HOLD FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIABLE FOR THE MISCONDUCT OF THEIR CLIENTS WHERE SUCH REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE DETECTED THAT THE CLIENT WAS ENGAGED IN WRONGDOING, EVEN THOUGH THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAD NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY ITS CLIENT. REGULATORS AND COURTS HAVE ALSO INCREASINGLY FOUND LIABILITY AS A CONTROL PERSON FOR ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR

FUNDS CONTROLLED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN INVESTMENT, BUT WHICH THEY DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS AND COURTS CONTINUE TO SEEK TO ESTABLISH FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES TO WHICH NO SUCH DUTY HAD BEEN

ASSUMED TO EXIST. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COST OF, AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH, ENGAGING IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, MARKET-MAKING, PRIME BROKERAGE, INVESTING AND OTHER SIMILAR ACTIVITIES COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. TO

THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ACTING AS A FINANCIAL ADVISER, INVESTMENT ADVISER OR IN OTHER ROLES FOR INDIVIDUAL, INSTITUTIONAL, SOVEREIGN OR INVESTMENT FUND CLIENTS, ANY BREACH, OR EVEN AN ALLEGED BREACH, OF SUCH

OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE MATERIALLY NEGATIVE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS

PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS, RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS, DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE

EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE) AND MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. THESE INCLUDE POSITIONS WE TAKE WHEN WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, OR COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, EQUITIES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF CREDIT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LEVERAGED LOANS, AND PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT

ARE NOT FREELY TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM

INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS.

THE INABILITY TO SELL OR EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY OR LEVERAGE RATIOS, INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS AND GENERALLY

REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

IN OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO

MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SECURITIES IN A DECLINING MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE ASSET-BASED MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR

INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN TURN REDUCE

THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS

OF OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL OR THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PARTY POSTING COLLATERAL DECLINE, THE PARTY POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO

PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN

THAT EITHER THE COST OF FUNDING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF POSITIONS IS DECREASED.

IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL,

THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS

LIQUID MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS

IN RECEIVING ADEQUATE COLLATERAL. IN CASES WHERE WE FORECLOSE ON COLLATERAL, WE HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE FORECLOSURE WAS NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS, WAS CONDUCTED IN AN IMPROPER MANNER OR CAUSED A

CLIENT OR COUNTERPARTY TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS,

INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES

IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT, BY ACCEPTING DEPOSITS AT OUR

BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BY ISSUING HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS. ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO

OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS

MERGER AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS, PARTICULARLY LARGE TRANSACTIONS, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

OUR CREDIT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN CREDIT MARKETS. A LACK OF LIQUIDITY

REDUCES PRICE TRANSPARENCY, INCREASES PRICE VOLATILITY AND DECREASES TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND SIZE, ALL OF WHICH CAN INCREASE TRANSACTION RISK OR DECREASE THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH BUSINESSES.

OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET

VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES TO

OUR CLIENTS, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS, ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED

BY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING THE SIZE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING, BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE

MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO REALIZE LOSSES IN ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF OUR RWAS, WHICH INCREASES OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING, CLIENT EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER

ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS,

WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE

TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES IN

MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING

VOLUMES OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET

VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW

THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OR A CLIENT PREFERENCE FOR PRODUCTS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH WE OFFER.

POOR

INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO EITHER GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS OR TO BENCHMARKS) BY FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR SELL,

AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS. THIS COULD AFFECT THE MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION OR THE COMMISSIONS AND NET SPREADS THAT

WE EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED NOTES OR DERIVATIVES. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR CLIENTS CHOOSE TO INVEST IN PRODUCTS THAT WE DO NOT CURRENTLY OFFER, WE WILL SUFFER OUTFLOWS AND A LOSS OF MANAGEMENT FEES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY

FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM MARKET-MAKING, INVESTING OR LENDING

POSITIONS, AND UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES, WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT

ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES. MARKET CONDITIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE

LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THOSE THAT OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009, AND TO SOME EXTENT SINCE

2011, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND

HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS.

IN THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS

FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

IN ADDITION, THE USE OF MODELS IN CONNECTION WITH RISK MANAGEMENT AND NUMEROUS OTHER CRITICAL ACTIVITIES PRESENTS

RISKS THAT SUCH MODELS MAY BE INEFFECTIVE, EITHER BECAUSE OF POOR DESIGN OR INEFFECTIVE TESTING, IMPROPER OR FLAWED INPUTS, AS WELL AS UNPERMITTED ACCESS TO SUCH MODELS RESULTING IN UNAPPROVED OR MALICIOUS CHANGES TO THE MODEL OR ITS INPUTS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE POSITIONS THROUGH OUR MARKET-MAKING OR ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OR WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, MAY CAUSE US TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKETS,

WHICH MAY LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING OR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR LIQUIDITY, PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE

DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY

IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR OTHERWISE ALLOCATE LIQUIDITY OPTIMALLY ACROSS OUR FIRM, AN INABILITY

TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD

PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH

WE ARE A PARTY ARE OFTEN COMPLEX, AND THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE

ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS.

FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THERE IS NOT GENERALLY A LIQUID MARKET FOR SUCH ASSETS, AS WELL AS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR OTHERWISE GENERALLY LIQUID ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR

IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS OR IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES TO RULES OR REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE, WE ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO SELL OUR INTERESTS IN ILLIQUID FUNDS BY JULY 2017. IF OUR REQUEST FOR AN

EXTENSION IS NOT GRANTED, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL SUCH INTERESTS BY JULY 2017 AND WE WILL LIKELY RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE FOR THOSE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE

SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER

THESE PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH US OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

AS OF

DECEMBER 2016, IN THE EVENT OF A ONE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD HAVE CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS

IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $677 MILLION AND $2.22 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF US AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE

IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RISK MANAGEMENT  LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RATINGS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS, MARKET-DRIVEN, AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE MOVEMENTS. OUR CREDIT SPREADS ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY MARKET

PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY

VOLATILE AND AT TIMES HAS LACKED A HIGH DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY.

REGULATORY CHANGES RELATING TO LIQUIDITY MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND COMPETITIVE POSITION. RECENTLY, NUMEROUS REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR PROPOSED, AND ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION, TO INTRODUCE MORE STRINGENT LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE REGULATIONS AND

OTHERS BEING CONSIDERED ADDRESS, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING, MINIMUM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WHOLESALE FUNDING, LIMITATIONS ON THE ISSUANCE OF SHORT-TERM DEBT AND STRUCTURED NOTES AND PROHIBITIONS ON PARENT GUARANTEES THAT ARE

SUBJECT TO CROSS-DEFAULTS. THESE MAY OVERLAP WITH, AND BE IMPACTED BY, OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES, INCLUDING NEW RULES RELATING TO MINIMUM LONG-TERM DEBT REQUIREMENTS AND TLAC, GUIDANCE ON THE TREATMENT OF BROKERED DEPOSITS AND THE CAPITAL, LEVERAGE

AND RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY FRAMEWORKS APPLICABLE TO LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GIVEN THE OVERLAP AND COMPLEX INTERACTIONS AMONG THESE NEW AND PROSPECTIVE REGULATIONS, THEY MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CUMULATIVE EFFECTS, AND THEIR FULL IMPACT WILL REMAIN

UNCERTAIN UNTIL IMPLEMENTATION OF POST-FINANCIAL CRISIS REGULATORY REFORM IS COMPLETE.

A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

DUE TO THE BROAD SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE REGULARLY ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER CLIENT, AS

WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN

ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

IN ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND INCREASED

REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE VIEWED AS AFFILIATES OF OURS AND, UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE, TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GOLDMAN SACHS AND CERTAIN COVERED

FUNDS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST

IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH US MAY BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY, DISCLOSE AND DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL OR

PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE,

OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS HUMAN ERROR, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

HIGHLY COMPLEX AND OCCUR AT HIGH VOLUMES AND FREQUENCIES, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC

GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS.

MANY RULES AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE GOVERN OUR OBLIGATIONS TO REPORT TRANSACTIONS

AND OTHER INFORMATION TO REGULATORS, EXCHANGES AND INVESTORS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LEGAL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CAN BE CHALLENGING, AND THE FIRM AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY FINES AND PENALTIES FOR FAILING TO

REPORT TIMELY, ACCURATE AND COMPLETE INFORMATION. AS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS EXPAND, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS HAS BECOME MORE CHALLENGING.

AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPAND AND THE VOLUME, SPEED, FREQUENCY AND COMPLEXITY OF TRANSACTIONS, ESPECIALLY ELECTRONIC

TRANSACTIONS (AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SUCH TRANSACTIONS ON A REAL-TIME BASIS TO CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND EXCHANGES) INCREASE, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING, AND THE RISK

OF SYSTEMS OR HUMAN ERROR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS INCREASES, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ERRORS DUE TO THE SPEED AND VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVED AND THE POTENTIAL DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH DISCOVERING SUCH ERRORS

QUICKLY ENOUGH TO LIMIT THE RESULTING CONSEQUENCES.

OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL

TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST

CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN REGULATIONS AND MARKETS, AND INVEST HEAVILY IN SYSTEMIC CONTROLS AND TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS DO NOT VIOLATE APPLICABLE RULES AND

REGULATIONS OR, DUE TO ERRORS IN PROCESSING SUCH TRANSACTIONS, ADVERSELY AFFECT MARKETS, OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES OR THE FIRM.

SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND UPDATES, AS WELL AS THE REQUISITE TRAINING, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESSES, ENTAIL

SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM WITH EXISTING ONES.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE

PROLIFERATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY-BASED RISK AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, OUR BUSINESSES ULTIMATELY RELY ON PEOPLE AS OUR GREATEST RESOURCE, AND, FROM TIME-TO-TIME, THEY MAKE MISTAKES THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS CAUGHT IMMEDIATELY BY OUR TECHNOLOGICAL

PROCESSES OR BY OUR OTHER PROCEDURES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PREVENT AND DETECT SUCH ERRORS. THESE CAN INCLUDE CALCULATION ERRORS, MISTAKES IN ADDRESSING EMAILS, ERRORS IN SOFTWARE OR MODEL DEVELOPMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION, OR SIMPLE ERRORS IN JUDGMENT.

WE STRIVE TO ELIMINATE SUCH HUMAN ERRORS THROUGH TRAINING, SUPERVISION, TECHNOLOGY AND BY REDUNDANT PROCESSES AND CONTROLS. HUMAN ERRORS, EVEN IF PROMPTLY DISCOVERED AND REMEDIATED, CAN RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES AND LIABILITIES FOR THE FIRM.

IN ADDITION, WE FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING

HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS

SYSTEMS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND

CLEARING HOUSES AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL BE CLEARED ON EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, AND THE INCREASED

CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CONSTRAINT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, SATELLITE, UNDERSEA CABLE OR OTHER

COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES FACILITIES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR

SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NATURAL DISASTERS, WAR, CIVIL UNREST,

TERRORISM, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, PANDEMICS AND WEATHER EVENTS.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA,

LONDON, BENGALURU, HONG KONG, TOKYO AND SALT LAKE CITY, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR

EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, AND OUR TWO PRINCIPAL OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE NEW YORK AREA BOTH ARE LOCATED ON THE WATERFRONT OF THE HUDSON RIVER, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT

IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OFFICES, INCLUDING A TERRORIST ATTACK, EXTREME WEATHER EVENT OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENT, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT

LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON

COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

A FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, NETWORKS AND INFORMATION, AND OUR CLIENTS INFORMATION, AGAINST CYBER

ATTACKS AND SIMILAR THREATS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND

NETWORKS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, CONSUMER-BASED COMPANIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS REPORTING THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT, CUSTOMER OR OTHER CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IN RECENT

YEARS, AS WELL AS CYBER ATTACKS INVOLVING THE DISSEMINATION, THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF CORPORATE INFORMATION OR OTHER ASSETS, AS A RESULT OF FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROCEDURES BY EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS OR AS A RESULT OF ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES,

INCLUDING ACTIONS BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN SEVERAL HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES WHERE HACKERS HAVE REQUESTED RANSOM PAYMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR NOT DISCLOSING CUSTOMER INFORMATION.

WE ARE REGULARLY THE TARGET OF ATTEMPTED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS, AND

MUST CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR AND DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA FROM MISAPPROPRIATION OR CORRUPTION. WE MAY FACE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATTEMPTED CYBER ATTACKS AS WE EXPAND OUR MOBILE- AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS OUR USAGE OF MOBILE AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES AND AS WE PROVIDE MORE OF THESE SERVICES TO A GREATER NUMBER OF RETAIL CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, CENTRAL AGENTS,

EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF ANY OF THEM IS SUBJECT TO A SUCCESSFUL CYBER ATTACK OR OTHER INFORMATION SECURITY EVENT.

DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE, DETECT OR IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE

PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL CYBER THREATS, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED ARE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED, CHANGE FREQUENTLY AND ARE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED. CYBER ATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING

THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR ARE INVOLVED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME OR TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. THIRD PARTIES MAY ALSO ATTEMPT TO PLACE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE FIRM OR INDUCE EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS OR OTHER USERS OF OUR SYSTEMS

TO DISCLOSE SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR PROVIDE ACCESS TO OUR DATA OR THAT OF OUR CLIENTS, AND THESE TYPES OF RISKS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR PREVENT.

ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE

VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF OUR SYSTEMS, THE PROCESS OF ENHANCING OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES CAN

ITSELF CREATE A RISK OF SYSTEMS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY ISSUES.

IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE

OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSACT WITH US OR OTHERWISE RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

THE INCREASED USE OF MOBILE AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES CAN HEIGHTEN THESE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL

RISKS. WE EXPECT TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, BUT THESE MEASURES MAY BE INEFFECTIVE AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE SECURITY OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE OR BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND THE FAILURE BY MOBILE

TECHNOLOGY AND CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ADEQUATELY SAFEGUARD THEIR SYSTEMS AND PREVENT CYBER ATTACKS COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A

RISK THAT ENCRYPTION AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES, DESPITE THEIR SOPHISTICATION, MAY BE DEFEATED, PARTICULARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT NEW COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES VASTLY INCREASE THE SPEED AND COMPUTING POWER AVAILABLE.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND

WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES AND PROTECT AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH

ALL OF OUR CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION,

MISUSE OR MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO

FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC.

IN ADDITION, OUR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR

ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL

RESTRICTIONS ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO

MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., INCLUDING UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS SOURCE OF STRENGTH POLICY, AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD

IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION

OR REORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS INCREASED REGULATION

AND SUPERVISION OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THOSE SUBSIDIARIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS. CONCERNS ABOUT PROTECTING CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY PERSONS

OR ENTITIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ENTITIES ARE LOCATED OR DO BUSINESS HAVE CAUSED OR MAY CAUSE A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO RING FENCE OR MAINTAIN INTERNAL TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING

CAPACITY AT SUCH ENTITIES IN ORDER TO PROTECT CLIENTS AND CREDITORS OF SUCH ENTITIES IN THE EVENT OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES INVOLVING SUCH ENTITIES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY AMONG OUR AFFILIATED ENTITIES, THEREBY INCREASING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIRED BY US ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO. AND GS BANK USA, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE

SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OWN OBLIGATIONS.

THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA TO DEVELOP AND SUBMIT RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION

DUPLICATIVE OPERATIONAL OR OTHER COSTS AT MULTIPLE ENTITIES, AND MAY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE GROUP INC. GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR RAISE DEBT AT GROUP INC. RESOLUTION PLANNING MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO STRUCTURE

OUR INTERCOMPANY AND EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE DEEM MOST OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT. FURTHERMORE, ARRANGEMENTS TO FACILITATE OUR RESOLUTION PLANNING MAY CAUSE US TO BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TAXES. ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS OR

REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN CAPITAL ACTIONS OR MAKE INTERCOMPANY DIVIDENDS OR PAYMENTS.

FORM 10-K

FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

THE APPLICATION OF REGULATORY STRATEGIES AND REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS TO FACILITATE THE ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD CREATE GREATER RISK OF LOSS FOR GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS.

AS DESCRIBED UNDER BUSINESS  REGULATION  BANKING SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS RECEIVER UNDER OLA, THE RIGHTS OF GROUP INC.S CREDITORS WOULD BE DETERMINED UNDER OLA, AND SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES EXIST IN THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS BETWEEN OLA

AND THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC UNDER OLA TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON DEBTHOLDERS.

THE FDIC HAS ANNOUNCED THAT A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY STRATEGY MAY BE A DESIRABLE STRATEGY UNDER

OLA TO RESOLVE A LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SUCH AS GROUP INC. IN A MANNER THAT WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE LOSSES ON SHAREHOLDERS, DEBTHOLDERS AND OTHER CREDITORS OF THE TOP-TIER HOLDING COMPANY (IN OUR CASE, GROUP INC.), WHILE THE HOLDING

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES MAY CONTINUE TO OPERATE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY STRATEGY UNDER OLA, IN WHICH GROUP INC. WOULD BE THE ONLY LEGAL ENTITY TO ENTER RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS (AND ITS MATERIAL

BROKER-DEALER, BANK AND OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES WOULD NOT ENTER RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS), WOULD RESULT IN GREATER LOSSES TO GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS (INCLUDING HOLDERS OF OUR FIXED RATE, FLOATING RATE AND INDEXED DEBT SECURITIES), THAN THE

LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE APPLICATION OF A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR A DIFFERENT RESOLUTION STRATEGY, SUCH AS A MULTIPLE POINT OF ENTRY RESOLUTION STRATEGY FOR GROUP INC. AND CERTAIN OF ITS MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES.

ASSUMING GROUP INC. ENTERED RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS AND THAT SUPPORT FROM GROUP INC. TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE

SUBSIDIARIES TO REMAIN SOLVENT, LOSSES AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO GROUP INC. AND ULTIMATELY BORNE BY GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS, THIRD-PARTY CREDITORS OF GROUP INC.S SUBSIDIARIES WOULD RECEIVE FULL RECOVERIES ON

THEIR CLAIMS, AND GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS (INCLUDING OUR SHAREHOLDERS, DEBTHOLDERS AND OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS) COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. IN THAT CASE, GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS WOULD FACE LOSSES WHILE THE THIRD-PARTY

CREDITORS OF GROUP INC.S SUBSIDIARIES WOULD INCUR NO LOSSES BECAUSE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND WOULD NOT ENTER RESOLUTION OR BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT AND

HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S OTHER DEBT SECURITIES COULD FACE LOSSES AHEAD OF ITS OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED CREDITORS IN A RESOLUTION UNDER OLA IF THE FDIC EXERCISED ITS RIGHT, DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS.

OLA ALSO PROVIDES THE FDIC WITH AUTHORITY TO CAUSE CREDITORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY SUCH AS GROUP INC. IN RECEIVERSHIP

TO BEAR LOSSES BEFORE TAXPAYERS ARE EXPOSED TO SUCH LOSSES, AND AMOUNTS OWED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD GENERALLY RECEIVE A STATUTORY PAYMENT PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF PRIVATE CREDITORS, INCLUDING SENIOR CREDITORS.

IN ADDITION, UNDER OLA, CLAIMS OF CREDITORS (INCLUDING DEBTHOLDERS) COULD BE SATISFIED THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR OTHER SECURITIES IN A BRIDGE ENTITY TO WHICH GROUP INC.S ASSETS ARE TRANSFERRED. IF SUCH A SECURITIES-FOR-CLAIMS EXCHANGE WERE IMPLEMENTED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES OF THE BRIDGE

ENTITY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY OR SATISFY ALL OR ANY PART OF THE CREDITOR CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE SECURITIES WERE EXCHANGED. WHILE THE FDIC HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT OLA, NOT ALL ASPECTS OF HOW THE FDIC MIGHT EXERCISE THIS AUTHORITY ARE

KNOWN AND ADDITIONAL RULEMAKING IS LIKELY.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE U.K. AND THE E.U., HAVE IMPLEMENTED, OR ARE

CONSIDERING, CHANGES TO RESOLUTION REGIMES TO PROVIDE RESOLUTION AUTHORITIES WITH THE ABILITY TO RECAPITALIZE A FAILING ENTITY BY WRITING DOWN ITS UNSECURED DEBT OR CONVERTING ITS UNSECURED DEBT INTO EQUITY. SUCH BAIL-IN POWERS ARE

INTENDED TO ENABLE THE RECAPITALIZATION OF A FAILING INSTITUTION BY ALLOCATING LOSSES TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND UNSECURED DEBTHOLDERS. U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REQUIREMENTS THAT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF LARGE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS MAINTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY THAT WOULD PASS LOSSES UP FROM THE SUBSIDIARIES TO THE TOP-TIER HOLDING COMPANY AND, ULTIMATELY, TO SECURITY HOLDERS OF THE TOP-TIER HOLDING COMPANY IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE.

THE APPLICATION OF GROUP INC.S PROPOSED RESOLUTION STRATEGY COULD RESULT IN GREATER LOSSES FOR GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS, AND

FAILURE TO ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IN OUR RESOLUTION PLAN COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

IN OUR RESOLUTION

PLAN, GROUP INC. WOULD BE RESOLVED UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE STRATEGY DESCRIBED IN OUR RESOLUTION PLAN IS A VARIANT OF THE SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY STRATEGY: GROUP INC. WOULD RECAPITALIZE AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CERTAIN MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES,

INCLUDING THROUGH THE FORGIVENESS OF INTERCOMPANY INDEBTEDNESS, THE EXTENSION OF THE MATURITIES OF INTERCOMPANY INDEBTEDNESS AND THE EXTENSION OF ADDITIONAL INTERCOMPANY LOANS. IF THIS STRATEGY WERE SUCCESSFUL, CREDITORS OF SOME OR ALL OF GROUP

INC.S MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES WOULD RECEIVE FULL RECOVERIES ON THEIR CLAIMS, WHILE GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

IN THAT CASE, GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS COULD FACE LOSSES WHILE THE THIRD-PARTY

CREDITORS OF GROUP INC.S MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES WOULD INCUR NO LOSSES BECAUSE THOSE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND NOT ENTER RESOLUTION OR BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. AS PART OF THE STRATEGY, GROUP INC. COULD ALSO SEEK TO ELEVATE THE

PRIORITY OF ITS GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO ITS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS SO THAT CROSS-DEFAULT AND EARLY TERMINATION RIGHTS WOULD BE STAYED UNDER THE ISDA PROTOCOL, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S

ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT AND HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S OTHER DEBT SECURITIES INCURRING LOSSES AHEAD OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THOSE GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS.

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES COULD INCUR LOSSES AHEAD OF OTHER

SIMILARLY SITUATED CREDITORS. IF GROUP INC.S PROPOSED RESOLUTION STRATEGY WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL, GROUP INC.S FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND GROUP INC.S SECURITY HOLDERS, INCLUDING DEBTHOLDERS, MAY AS A

CONSEQUENCE BE IN A WORSE POSITION THAN IF THE STRATEGY HAD NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IN ALL CASES, ANY PAYMENTS TO DEBTHOLDERS ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS AND ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO OUR CREDIT RISK.

IN APRIL 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON THE 2015 RESOLUTION PLANS OF EIGHT SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT

DOMESTIC BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND PROVIDED GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS. WHILE OUR PLAN WAS NOT JOINTLY FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT (I.E., NON-CREDIBLE OR TO NOT FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE),

THE FDIC IDENTIFIED CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES AND BOTH THE FDIC AND FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO IDENTIFIED CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS. IN RESPONSE TO THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED, IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE SUBMITTED A STATUS REPORT ON OUR ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE

SHORTCOMINGS AND A SEPARATE PUBLIC SECTION THAT EXPLAINS THESE ACTIONS AT A HIGH LEVEL, WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AS DESCRIBED UNDER AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN, WHICH IS DUE BY JULY 1, 2017, IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT GROUP INC. DID NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC COULD, AFTER ANY PERMITTED RESUBMISSION, FIND OUR RESOLUTION PLAN NOT CREDIBLE AND

REQUIRE US TO HOLD MORE CAPITAL, CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRUCTURE OR DISPOSE OF BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO RETURN CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

AS A RESULT OF OUR RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANNING PROCESSES, INCLUDING INCORPORATING FEEDBACK

FROM OUR REGULATORS, WE MAY INCUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL, FUNDING OR OTHER COSTS AND FACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO STRUCTURE OUR INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OR ENGAGE IN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE DEEM MOST

OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR

DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED

TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. A

FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, DETERIORATION

IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD, INCLUDING A DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY THIRD PARTIES TO SECURE THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US UNDER DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS AND LOAN AGREEMENTS, COULD

RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES.

A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. WHILE IN MANY CASES WE

ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND

THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS. DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND

ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING AND PRIME BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENTS POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING,

UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING, UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR CREDIT

ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

RULES ADOPTED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRE ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES AND

INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTION TO RETAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET, WHICH IS LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST TO US OF ENGAGING IN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING,

SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE

BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE

SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER, ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR GROUP OF RELATED COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE E.U., AND A FAILURE OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. PROVISIONS OF

THE DODD-FRANK ACT HAVE LED TO INCREASED CENTRALIZATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OUR CONCENTRATION OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES. WHILE OUR

ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES, COUNTERPARTIES AND COUNTRIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS,

CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS BOTH HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INTERRELATED.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS

OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE. THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS.

AS A RESULT, WE HAVE

HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATIONS, IMPOSED TAXES, ADOPTED COMPENSATION

RESTRICTIONS OR OTHERWISE PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT HAVE OR MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER OR AT ALL IN CERTAIN OR ALL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON

THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE. THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR RULES, MANY OF WHICH DO NOT APPLY TO ALL OUR U.S. OR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS

MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS

WE TAKE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY INTERRELATED IN THAT A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AMONG A LIMITED NUMBER

OF MEMBERS OF THAT INDUSTRY. MANY TRANSACTIONS ARE SYNDICATED TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OFTEN COUNTERPARTIES IN TRANSACTIONS. THIS HAS LED TO CLAIMS BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND REGULATORS THAT SUCH

INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLUDED IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE MARKETS OR MARKET PRICES, INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS THAT ANTITRUST LAWS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. WHILE WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT SUCH ACTIVITIES,

ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY BY REGULATORS, CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE REPUTATIONAL IMPACT AND CAN SUBJECT US TO LARGE FINES AND SETTLEMENTS, AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES, INCLUDING TREBLE DAMAGES.

WE FACE ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS

INITIATIVES AND EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONTINUE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS AND INVEST IN NEW REGIONS, INCLUDING A WIDE RANGE OF EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS. FURTHERMORE, IN A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING WHERE WE MAKE MARKETS, INVEST AND LEND, WE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

OWN INTERESTS IN, OR OTHERWISE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, SUCH AS AIRPORTS, TOLL ROADS AND SHIPPING PORTS, AS WELL AS PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND COMMODITIES INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE

THE U.S.

WE HAVE RECENTLY INCREASED AND INTEND TO FURTHER INCREASE OUR CONSUMER-ORIENTED DEPOSIT-TAKING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. TO THE

EXTENT WE ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIVITIES OR SIMILAR CONSUMER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES, WE COULD FACE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE, LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISK, INCREASED REPUTATIONAL RISK AND INCREASED OPERATIONAL RISK DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER TRANSACTION

VOLUMES AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RETENTION AND TRANSMISSION OF CUSTOMER AND CLIENT INFORMATION.

NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES EXPOSE US TO

NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED CLIENTS, COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THESE ACTIVITIES,

INCREASED CREDIT-RELATED, MARKET, SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD OR IN WHICH WE INTERACT WITH THESE

COUNTERPARTIES.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND NON-STANDARDIZED, WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE TO

US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE RISK THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY EXECUTED, THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE

ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY, OR THAT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE NETTED AGAINST OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, COUNTERPARTIES MAY CLAIM THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS WERE NOT

APPROPRIATE OR AUTHORIZED.

AS A SIGNATORY TO THE ISDA PROTOCOL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE REMEDIES AGAINST COUNTERPARTIES AND, AS

THIS NEW REGIME HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED, WE MAY SUFFER RISKS OR LOSSES THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED TO SUFFER IF WE COULD IMMEDIATELY CLOSE OUT TRANSACTIONS UPON A TERMINATION EVENT. VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED

IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE ISDA PROTOCOL, AND THOSE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXERCISE REMEDIES AGAINST COUNTERPARTIES. THE ISDA PROTOCOLS IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICE AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.

DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR DURING ANY

DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS.

IN ADDITION, AS NEW COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF

UNDERLYING CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS. THE PROVISIONS

OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRING CENTRAL CLEARING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVES, OR A MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND TO HEDGE OUR OWN RISKS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW TALENTED AND DIVERSE EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SUCH EMPLOYEES INCLUDE OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OUR REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITH A CULTURE OF FAIRLY HIRING, TRAINING AND PROMOTING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. AS A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE COMPENSATION THAT WE PAY TO OUR EMPLOYEES IS IN THE FORM OF YEAR-END DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WHICH IS IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED EQUITY-RELATED AWARDS, DECLINES IN OUR PROFITABILITY, OR IN THE OUTLOOK FOR OUR

FUTURE PROFITABILITY, AS WELL AS REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION LEVELS AND TERMS, CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES HAS

OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. RECENTLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED COMPETITION IN HIRING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES TO ADDRESS THE DEMANDS OF NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE IN EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

CHANGES IN LAW OR REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED THAT AFFECT

TAXES ON OUR EMPLOYEES INCOME, OR THE AMOUNT OR COMPOSITION OF COMPENSATION, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS  REGULATION COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

FORM 10-K,

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON

COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE PRA, THE FCA, THE FDIC AND OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPOSED BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION OR

REGULATION, MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN WAYS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO COMPENSATION, OUR

BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS ADVERSE STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. PRESS COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ASSERT SOME FORM OF WRONGDOING (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, PRESS COVERAGE AND PUBLIC

STATEMENTS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVE US) OFTEN RESULT IN SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORS, LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS.

RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING, IS TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE AND CAN

DIVERT THE TIME AND EFFORT OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO

COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO ADVANCE OR SUPPORT LEGISLATION TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ON

THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE NOTE 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED AND NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS INCREASE

FOLLOWING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE REDUCED OUR STAFF. ADDITIONALLY, GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES HAVE BEEN AND ARE PLAINTIFFS IN CERTAIN OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, AND WE MAY FACE FUTURE ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BY THE SAME OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, AS WELL AS FOLLOW-ON CIVIL LITIGATION THAT IS OFTEN COMMENCED AFTER REGULATORY SETTLEMENTS.

RECENTLY, SIGNIFICANT

SETTLEMENTS BY SEVERAL LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, US, WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED. THE TREND OF LARGE SETTLEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OUTCOMES FOR OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN SIMILAR ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHERE GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE LARGE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE USED AS THE BASIS OR A TEMPLATE FOR OTHER SETTLEMENTS. THE UNCERTAIN REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT MAKES IT

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE PROBABLE LOSSES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL DISPARITIES BETWEEN LEGAL RESERVES AND SUBSEQUENT ACTUAL SETTLEMENTS OR PENALTIES.

CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE RECENTLY REQUIRED ADMISSIONS OF WRONGDOING, AND, IN SOME CASES, CRIMINAL PLEAS, AS PART OF THE RESOLUTIONS

OF MATTERS BROUGHT BY THEM AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ANY SUCH RESOLUTION OF A MATTER INVOLVING THE FIRM COULD LEAD TO INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CIVIL LITIGATION, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON

OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS AND COULD HAVE OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ANNOUNCED A POLICY OF REQUIRING COMPANIES TO

PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH ALL RELEVANT FACTS RELATING TO THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR ANY COOPERATION CREDIT IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF CORPORATE WRONGDOING, WHICH MAY RESULT IN OUR

INCURRING INCREASED FINES AND PENALTIES IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DETERMINES THAT WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT APPLICABLE INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION, AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS IN RESPONDING TO DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES WILL ADOPT SIMILAR POLICIES.

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING

AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TRADING TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS

FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY

OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH US, PARTICULARLY

OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING

MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE

INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY

GIVEN THE GENERALLY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR PHYSICAL COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION AND INVOLVE CERTAIN POTENTIAL RISKS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

AS PART OF OUR COMMODITIES BUSINESS, WE PURCHASE AND SELL CERTAIN PHYSICAL COMMODITIES, ARRANGE FOR THEIR STORAGE AND TRANSPORT, AND ENGAGE IN

MARKET MAKING OF COMMODITIES. THE COMMODITIES INVOLVED IN THESE ACTIVITIES MAY INCLUDE CRUDE OIL, OIL REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, METALS (BASE AND PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING

UNENRICHED URANIUM), EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES.

IN OUR INVESTING AND LENDING BUSINESSES, WE MAKE

INVESTMENTS IN AND FINANCE ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF NUMEROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING MANY OF THE COMMODITIES REFERENCED ABOVE.

THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US AND/OR THE ENTITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL,

ANTITRUST AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE

REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT COULD INCREASE THE OPERATING COSTS AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

THERE MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND

INVESTMENTS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS OF CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, RENOVATION OF STORAGE FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND

APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

COMMODITIES INVOLVED IN OUR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE

RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO BE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF TRANSPORT VESSELS, STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL

MALFUNCTIONS, FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN

ADDITION, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE ON THEIR PART, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES,

COULD EXPOSE US TO COSTS OR LOSSES. ALSO, WHILE WE SEEK TO INSURE AGAINST POTENTIAL RISKS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM PERFORMING UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS, MAY IMPAIR OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION, REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DIVEST

OR DISCONTINUE CERTAIN OF THESE ACTIVITIES FOR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RECENTLY PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON CERTAIN COMMODITY-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

IF THAT OCCURS, WE MAY RECEIVE A VALUE THAT IS LESS THAN THE THEN CARRYING VALUE, AS WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EXIT THESE ACTIVITIES IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL,

OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND

SUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE IN RECENT YEARS, AND SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BY THE U.S. AND THE E.U. ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES IN RUSSIA. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY

MARKET. ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND

NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. FURTHER, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY SUBJECT THE FIRM AND ITS PERSONNEL NOT ONLY TO CIVIL ACTIONS BUT ALSO

CRIMINAL ACTIONS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

IN JUNE 2016, A REFERENDUM WAS PASSED FOR THE U.K. TO EXIT THE E.U. (BREXIT). THE EXIT OF THE U.K. FROM THE E.U. WILL LIKELY CHANGE THE

ARRANGEMENTS BY WHICH U.K. FIRMS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES INTO THE E.U., WHICH MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE OPERATE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN EUROPE AND COULD REQUIRE US TO RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS. THE

OUTCOME OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE E.U. IN CONNECTION WITH BREXIT IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. SUCH UNCERTAINTY HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, MARKET VOLATILITY AND MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CONFIDENCE OF INVESTORS AND

CLIENTS.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN

EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES, DEFAULTS OR

THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY, CIVIL UNREST OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS

INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WHILE BUSINESS AND OTHER PRACTICES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DIFFER, OUR PRINCIPAL LEGAL ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT IN THEIR OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE TO RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL PAYMENTS, HIRING PRACTICES AND MONEY LAUNDERING, AS WELL AS LAWS RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS

WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND U.K. BRIBERY ACT. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED AND CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING,

THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY OF OUR OPERATIONS, EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT WE DEAL WITH, GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF SUCH RULES OR REGULATIONS AND ANY SUCH

VIOLATION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY

PUBLICIZED CASES AROUND THE WORLD, INVOLVING ACTUAL OR ALLEGED FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. THIS MISCONDUCT HAS INCLUDED AND MAY

INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE THE THEFT OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BEEN AND MAY NOT

BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC,

TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, SUCH AS THE EBOLA OR ZIKA VIRUSES, OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY (OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY), TERRORIST ATTACKS, EXTREME TERRESTRIAL OR SOLAR WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER NATURAL

DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, AND COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

THERE ARE NO MATERIAL UNRESOLVED WRITTEN COMMENTS THAT WERE RECEIVED FROM THE SEC STAFF 180 DAYS OR MORE BEFORE THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR

RELATING TO OUR PERIODIC OR CURRENT REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT 200 WEST STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK AND COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 2.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET. THE

BUILDING IS LOCATED ON A PARCEL LEASED FROM BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY PURSUANT TO A GROUND LEASE. UNDER THE LEASE, BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY HOLDS TITLE TO ALL IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE OFFICE BUILDING, SUBJECT TO GOLDMAN SACHS RIGHT OF

EXCLUSIVE POSSESSION AND USE UNTIL JUNE 2069, THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LEASE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GROUND LEASE, WE MADE A LUMP SUM GROUND RENT PAYMENT IN JUNE 2007 OF $161 MILLION FOR RENT THROUGH THE TERM OF THE LEASE. WE HAVE

OFFICES AT 30 HUDSON STREET IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY, WHICH WE OWN AND WHICH INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL OFFICES AND COMMERCIAL SPACE IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE IN THE AMERICAS, WHICH

TOGETHER COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE.

IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, WE HAVE

OFFICES THAT TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE. OUR EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN LONDON AT PETERBOROUGH COURT, PURSUANT TO A LEASE THAT WE CAN TERMINATE IN 2021. IN TOTAL, WE HAVE OFFICES WITH

APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET IN LONDON, RELATING TO VARIOUS PROPERTIES. WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING A 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FOOT OFFICE IN LONDON. WE EXPECT INITIAL OCCUPANCY DURING 2019.

IN ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND, WE HAVE OFFICES WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET. OUR HEADQUARTERS IN THIS REGION ARE IN

TOKYO, AT THE ROPPONGI HILLS MORI TOWER, AND IN HONG KONG, AT THE CHEUNG KONG CENTER. IN JAPAN, WE CURRENTLY HAVE OFFICES WITH APPROXIMATELY 219,000 SQUARE FEET, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE LEASES THAT WILL EXPIRE IN 2018. IN HONG KONG, WE CURRENTLY

HAVE OFFICES WITH APPROXIMATELY 315,000 SQUARE FEET, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE LEASES THAT WILL EXPIRE IN 2023.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

2016 VERSUS 2015.

WE GENERATED NET EARNINGS OF $7.40 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $16.29 FOR 2016, AN INCREASE OF 22% AND 34%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $6.08 BILLION AND $12.14 PER SHARE FOR 2015.

RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (ROE) WAS 9.4% FOR 2016, COMPARED WITH 7.4% FOR 2015. BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE WAS $182.47 AS OF DECEMBER 2016, 6.7% HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2015.

NET REVENUES WERE $30.61 BILLION FOR 2016, 9% LOWER THAN 2015, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING AND

LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, PARTICULARLY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER,

ALTHOUGH THE ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $20.30 BILLION FOR 2016, 19% LOWER

THAN 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, AS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED PROVISIONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT WITH THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES WORKING GROUP OF THE U.S. FINANCIAL FRAUD ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE (RMBS WORKING GROUP), AS WELL AS LOWER MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES, REFLECTING EXPENSE SAVINGS

INITIATIVES. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES WERE ALSO LOWER, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN NET REVENUES AND THE IMPACT OF EXPENSE SAVINGS INITIATIVES.

WE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS AND LIQUIDITY, WHILE RETURNING $7.20 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS DURING 2016. DURING

THE YEAR, WE REPURCHASED 36.6 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL COST OF $6.07 BILLION AND PAID COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $1.13 BILLION. OUR COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 RATIO AS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED

APPROACH AND THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH, IN EACH CASE REFLECTING THE APPLICABLE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, WAS 14.5% AND 13.1%, RESPECTIVELY, AND OUR GLOBAL CORE LIQUID ASSETS WERE $226 BILLION, ALL AS OF DECEMBER 2016. SEE

NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAPITAL RATIOS. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR GLOBAL CORE LIQUID ASSETS.

IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2016, WE COMPLETED AN

INITIATIVE THAT IDENTIFIED AREAS WHERE WE CAN OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION IN ANNUAL RUN RATE COMPENSATION. FOR 2016, NET SAVINGS FROM THIS INITIATIVE, AFTER SEVERANCE AND OTHER RELATED COSTS,

WERE APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION.

2015 VERSUS 2014.

WE GENERATED NET EARNINGS OF $6.08 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $12.14 FOR 2015, A DECREASE OF 28% AND 29%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $8.48 BILLION AND $17.07 PER SHARE FOR 2014.

ROE WAS 7.4% FOR 2015, COMPARED WITH 11.2% FOR 2014. DURING 2015, WE RECORDED PROVISIONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE RMBS WORKING GROUP OF $3.37 BILLION ($2.99 BILLION AFTER-TAX), WHICH REDUCED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BY $6.53 AND ROE BY 3.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS. SEE NOTE 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2015

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE WAS $171.03 AS OF DECEMBER 2015, 4.9% HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2014. DURING 2015, WE REPURCHASED

22.1 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL COST OF $4.20 BILLION.

NET REVENUES WERE $33.82 BILLION FOR 2015, 2%

LOWER THAN 2014, AS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT

SERVICES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2014.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $25.04 BILLION FOR 2015, 13% HIGHER THAN 2014, DUE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR.

AS OF DECEMBER 2015, OUR COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 RATIO AS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND THE

BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH, IN EACH CASE REFLECTING THE APPLICABLE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, WAS 13.6% AND 12.4%, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, OUR GLOBAL CORE LIQUID ASSETS WERE $199 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2015.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

GLOBAL

DURING 2016, REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH APPEARED TO SLOW IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES AND APPEARED MIXED IN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES

COMPARED WITH 2015. IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES, GROWTH WAS LOWER IN THE U.S., THE EURO AREA, THE U.K. AND JAPAN. IN EMERGING MARKETS, GROWTH SLOWED IN CHINA AND APPEARED TO SLOW IN INDIA, WHILE REAL GDP APPEARED TO CONTRACT LESS IN BRAZIL AND RUSSIA THAN

IN 2015. MONETARY POLICY DIVERGENCE CONTINUED IN 2016, AS THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE INCREASED ITS TARGET INTEREST RATE AGAIN, WHILE MONETARY POLICY REMAINED ACCOMMODATIVE IN EUROPE AND JAPAN. IN JUNE, A REFERENDUM WAS PASSED FOR THE U.K. TO EXIT THE

E.U., AND IN NOVEMBER, THE U.S. HELD ITS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE MARKET REACTION TO THE OUTCOMES OF BOTH EVENTS WAS GENERALLY MORE POSITIVE THAN EXPECTATIONS. THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL (WTI) INCREASED BY 45% IN 2016 AND, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, OPEC

MEMBERS ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO REDUCE OIL PRODUCTION. IN INVESTMENT BANKING, INDUSTRY-WIDE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY REMAINED STRONG FOR 2016, BUT DECLINED COMPARED WITH THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN 2015. INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES IN EQUITY

UNDERWRITING DECLINED COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015, WHILE INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT UNDERWRITING VOLUMES INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

UNITED STATES

IN THE U.S., REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.6% IN 2016, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 2.6% IN 2015, AS GROWTH IN TOTAL FIXED INVESTMENT AND CONSUMER

EXPENDITURES DECLINED. MEASURES OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WERE MIXED ON AVERAGE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, BUT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINED TO 4.7% AT THE END OF 2016, AND LABOR MARKET INDICATORS

SUGGEST THE U.S. ECONOMY IS CLOSE TO FULL EMPLOYMENT. HOUSING STARTS, SALES, AND PRICES INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2015, WHILE MEASURES OF INFLATION ALSO INCREASED. THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE RAISED ITS TARGET RATE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT THE

DECEMBER MEETING TO A RANGE OF 0.50% TO 0.75%. THE YIELD ON THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTE INCREASED BY 18 BASIS POINTS DURING 2016 TO 2.45%. IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE, THE S&P 500 INDEX AND THE NASDAQ

COMPOSITE INDEX INCREASED BY 13%, 10% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2016.

EUROPE

IN THE EURO AREA, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.7% IN 2016, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 1.9% IN 2015. GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING DECLINED, WHILE

GROWTH IN FIXED INVESTMENT AND GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION INCREASED. MEASURES OF INFLATION REMAINED SUBDUED, PROMPTING THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) TO ANNOUNCE MULTIPLE EASING MEASURES IN THE FIRST QUARTER, CUTTING THE DEPOSIT RATE BY 10 BASIS POINTS

TO (0.40)% AND LOWERING THE MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS RATE BY 5 BASIS POINTS TO 0.00%, AS WELL AS LAUNCHING A NEW SERIES OF TARGETED LONGER-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONS, INCREASING THE VOLUME OF MONTHLY PURCHASES OF BONDS, AND ADDING INVESTMENT

GRADE, NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATE BONDS TO THE LIST OF BONDS PURCHASED UNDER ITS ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM. IN DECEMBER, THE ECB ANNOUNCED AN EXTENSION OF ITS ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM THROUGH AT LEAST THE END OF 2017, ALTHOUGH THE PACE OF PURCHASES WILL BE

LOWER. THE EURO DEPRECIATED BY 3% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN THE U.K., REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.8% IN 2016, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 2.2% IN 2015. FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THE U.K. REFERENDUM, THE BANK OF ENGLAND ANNOUNCED A MONETARY EASING

PACKAGE COMPRISED OF A 25 BASIS POINTS CUT TO THE OFFICIAL BANK RATE, £70 BILLION OF ASSET PURCHASES, AND A TERM FUNDING SCHEME. THE BRITISH POUND DEPRECIATED BY 16% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING 2016, REACHING ITS LOWEST LEVEL AGAINST

THE U.S. DOLLAR IN OVER 30 YEARS. YIELDS ON 10-YEAR GOVERNMENT BONDS IN THE REGION GENERALLY DECREASED DURING THE YEAR. IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE FTSE 100 INDEX, DAX INDEX, CAC 40 INDEX AND EURO STOXX 50 INDEX INCREASED BY 14%, 7%, 5% AND 1%,

ASIA

IN JAPAN, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 1.0% IN 2016, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 1.2% IN 2015. IN 2016, THE BANK OF JAPAN INTRODUCED A NEGATIVE

INTEREST RATE POLICY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER AND ALTERED THE FRAMEWORK FOR ITS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EASING PROGRAM DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, SHIFTING FROM PURCHASING SET QUANTITIES OF ASSETS TO TARGETING A 0% YIELD ON 10-YEAR JAPANESE

GOVERNMENT BONDS. THE YIELD ON 10-YEAR JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS DECLINED INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, THE U.S. DOLLAR DEPRECIATED BY 3% AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE NIKKEI 225 INDEX ENDED THE YEAR ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED. IN

CHINA, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 6.7% IN 2016, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 6.9% IN 2015. DURING 2016, THE PEOPLES BANK OF CHINA ANNOUNCED CUTS TO ITS RESERVE REQUIREMENT RATIO. MEASURES OF INFLATION INCREASED AND THE U.S. DOLLAR APPRECIATED BY 7%

AGAINST THE CHINESE YUAN. IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX DECREASED BY 12% DURING 2016, WHILE THE HANG SENG INDEX ENDED THE YEAR ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED. IN INDIA, REAL GDP APPEARED TO INCREASE BY 6.8% IN 2016, COMPARED WITH AN

CONTRACTION OF 2.8% IN 2015. THE U.S. DOLLAR DEPRECIATED BY 16% AGAINST THE RUSSIAN RUBLE AND THE MICEX INDEX INCREASED BY 27% DURING 2016.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FAIR VALUE

FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE (I.E., INVENTORY), AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT FAIR VALUE (I.E., MARKED-TO-MARKET), WITH RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO

MEASURE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY.

THE FAIR

VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WE MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES AS A PORTFOLIO (I.E., BASED ON ITS NET EXPOSURE TO MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISKS). IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE HIERARCHY UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) GIVES (I) THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 INPUTS), (II) THE NEXT PRIORITY TO INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY (LEVEL 2

INPUTS), AND (III) THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED IN MARKET ACTIVITY (LEVEL 3 INPUTS). IN EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A VALUATION INPUT, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, A PORTFOLIOS NET RISK EXPOSURE TO

THAT INPUT. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE

CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR

VALUE FOR FACTORS SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND OUR CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS.

INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE THOSE WHICH REQUIRE

ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS REPRESENTED 2.7% AND 2.8%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND RELATED FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION DATE, WE USE OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE

TYPE OF INSTRUMENT. ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE. THESE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.



DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND/OR MODEL FOR EACH TYPE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT;



DETERMINING MODEL INPUTS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICES

EVIDENCED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS; AND



DETERMINING APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ILLIQUIDITY OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

QUALITY.

REGARDLESS OF THE METHODOLOGY, VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY

SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

MARKET MAKERS AND INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRICING OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. OUR CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND IS

FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY VALUED AT MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN SITUATIONS WHERE ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES

JUDGMENT (E.G., CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES OR TRADE COMPARISON, AS DESCRIBED BELOW), THE FINAL VALUATION DECISION IS MADE BY SENIOR MANAGERS IN CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. THIS INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT

OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE PROPERLY VALUED.

PRICE VERIFICATION.

ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE SUBJECT TO OUR INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF PRICE VERIFICATION IS TO HAVE AN INFORMED

AND INDEPENDENT OPINION WITH REGARD TO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UNDER REVIEW. INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS WHICH CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL MARKET DATA ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY. PRICE VERIFICATION STRATEGIES UTILIZED BY OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE.



TRADE COMPARISON.

ANALYSIS OF TRADE DATA (BOTH INTERNAL AND

EXTERNAL WHERE AVAILABLE) IS USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT PRICING INPUTS AND VALUATIONS.



EXTERNAL PRICE COMPARISON.

VALUATIONS AND PRICES ARE COMPARED TO

PRICING DATA OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES (E.G., BROKERS OR DEALERS, MARKIT, BLOOMBERG, IDC, TRACE). DATA OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES IS COMPARED TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY. WHEN BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR THIRD-PARTY PRICING VENDORS

ARE USED FOR VALUATION OR PRICE VERIFICATION, GREATER PRIORITY IS GENERALLY GIVEN TO EXECUTABLE QUOTATIONS.



CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES.

MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE

USED TO CORROBORATE THE VALUATION OF POSITIONS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, RISKS AND COMPONENTS.



RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES.

MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE ANALYZED

TO DETERMINE THE SIMILARITY, MEASURED IN TERMS OF RISK, LIQUIDITY AND RETURN, OF ONE INSTRUMENT RELATIVE TO ANOTHER OR, FOR A GIVEN INSTRUMENT, OF ONE MATURITY RELATIVE TO ANOTHER.



COLLATERAL ANALYSES.

MARGIN CALLS ON DERIVATIVES ARE ANALYZED TO

DETERMINE IMPLIED VALUES WHICH ARE USED TO CORROBORATE OUR VALUATIONS.



EXECUTION OF TRADES.

WHERE APPROPRIATE, TRADING DESKS ARE

INSTRUCTED TO EXECUTE TRADES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.



BACKTESTING.

VALUATIONS ARE CORROBORATED BY COMPARISON TO VALUES

REALIZED UPON SALES.

SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

REVIEW OF NET REVENUES.

INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ENSURE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRICING POLICY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DAILY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE EXPLANATION AND ATTRIBUTION OF NET REVENUES BASED ON THE UNDERLYING FACTORS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE

INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATE NET REVENUES, IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE POTENTIAL FAIR VALUE OR TRADE BOOKING ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS AND SEEK TO ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE BEING PROPERLY CATEGORIZED AND QUANTIFIED.

REVIEW OF VALUATION MODELS.

OUR INDEPENDENT MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP (MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT), CONSISTING OF QUANTITATIVE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE SEPARATE FROM MODEL DEVELOPERS, PERFORMS AN INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION PROCESS OF

OUR VALUATION MODELS. NEW OR CHANGED MODELS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED PRIOR TO BEING PUT INTO USE. MODELS ARE EVALUATED AND RE-APPROVED ANNUALLY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET AND ANY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN PRICING

THEORIES. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF OUR VALUATION MODELS.

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL IS ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST, BY FIRST ASSESSING QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT

WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016, WE ASSESSED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A QUALITATIVE

ASSESSMENT. THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND TO EVALUATE SEVERAL FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDED, BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO, PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, FIRM AND INDUSTRY EVENTS, MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS AND FAIR VALUE

INDICATORS. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF THESE FACTORS, WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED ITS RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, SINCE THE 2015 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

OF THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION REPORTING UNIT WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE, WE ALSO PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE TEST ON THIS REPORTING UNIT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016. IN THE QUANTITATIVE

TEST, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION REPORTING UNIT SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE.

THEREFORE, WE DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL FOR ALL REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED.

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS. CRITICAL

INPUTS TO THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PROJECTED EARNINGS AND ATTRIBUTED EQUITY. THERE IS INHERENT UNCERTAINTY IN THE PROJECTED EARNINGS. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT REFLECTS AN ALLOCATION OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND

REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT UNDER CURRENTLY APPLICABLE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

IF WE EXPERIENCE A PROLONGED OR SEVERE PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT OR FINANCIAL MARKETS, OR ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OUR GOODWILL COULD BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OTHER INPUTS OF THE QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

OF OUR REPORTING UNITS TO DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN THE FUTURE.

SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR GOODWILL.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

WE AMORTIZE OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES GENERALLY USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE.

A PROLONGED OR SEVERE PERIOD OF MARKET WEAKNESS, OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REGULATION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE

VALUE OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING WEAKER BUSINESS PERFORMANCE RESULTING IN A DECREASE IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND DECREASES IN

REVENUES FROM CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT HAVE OCCURRED, AND TO TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT IF REQUIRED.

AN IMPAIRMENT, GENERALLY CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS

RECOGNIZED IF THE TOTAL OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE.

SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE

USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS) AND TAX AUDITS, AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES ON LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS HELD FOR INVESTMENT.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF LITIGATION

AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE RELATED RESERVES FOR LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WHERE WE BELIEVE THE RISK OF LOSS IS MORE THAN SLIGHT. SEE NOTES 18 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN JUDICIAL, LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL

ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE, PROCEEDING OR

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHALLENGING TRENDS IN THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CENTRAL

BANK ACTIVITY AS WELL AS HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE PRESSURE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR ACROSS BOTH EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS. THESE FACTORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INVESTOR CONVICTION AND RISK

APPETITE FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY UNDERWRITING AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY FOR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES. RESULTS IN OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS ALSO REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THESE DIFFICULT MARKET AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AT THE START OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, CONCERNS ABOUT GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH MODERATED AND CONDITIONS IMPROVED IN MANY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING A REBOUND IN INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVED RESULTS IN OTHER PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS. HOWEVER, LATER IN THE SECOND QUARTER, THE MARKET BECAME INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON THE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS SURROUNDING THE POTENTIAL EXIT OF THE U.K. FROM THE E.U., IMPACTING MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES.

THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2016, AS GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS STEADILY INCREASED AND CREDIT SPREADS

TIGHTENED, PROVIDING A MORE FAVORABLE BACKDROP FOR OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. FOR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, OUR ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION CONTINUED TO INCREASE DURING 2016. THE MIX OF OUR AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION SHIFTED SLIGHTLY

COMPARED WITH 2015 FROM LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION TO LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS.

IF THE TREND OF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUES OVER

THE LONG TERM, AND MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY LEVELS, INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITY LEVELS, OR ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION DECLINE OR IF INVESTORS CONTINUE THE TREND OF FAVORING ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION THAT TYPICALLY GENERATE LOWER FEES, NET REVENUES WOULD

LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. SEE SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND MATERIAL TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DURING 2015, THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY DIVERGING CENTRAL BANK MONETARY POLICIES IN THE

U.S. AND THE EURO AREA IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AS INCREASED VOLATILITY LEVELS CONTRIBUTED TO STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS IN CURRENCIES, INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS AND EQUITY PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2015, CONCERNS ABOUT GLOBAL GROWTH

AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVES INTEREST RATE POLICY, ALONG WITH LOWER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES, WIDENING HIGH-YIELD CREDIT SPREADS AND DECLINING COMMODITY PRICES, CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN

MORTGAGES AND CREDIT, AND MORE DIFFICULT MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES FOR 2015 REFLECTED STRONG

INDUSTRY-WIDE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REFLECTED AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CLIENT NET INFLOWS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE DECLINES IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME ASSET PRICES. ALTHOUGH

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 2015 BENEFITED FROM FAVORABLE COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS, INCLUDING SALES, INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND FINANCINGS, A DECLINE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES AND WIDENING HIGH-YIELD CREDIT SPREADS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2015

IMPACTED RESULTS.

2016 VERSUS 2015

NET

REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $30.61 BILLION FOR 2016, 9% LOWER THAN 2015, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, PARTICULARLY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER,

ALTHOUGH THE ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES AND LOWER INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES, NET INTEREST INCOME AND

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES. IN ADDITION, COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER. THESE RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY HIGHER MARKET-MAKING REVENUES.

NON-INTEREST REVENUES.

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $6.27 BILLION FOR 2016, 11% LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015. REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE TRANSACTIONS. REVENUES IN

UNDERWRITING WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES. REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

REVENUES FROM ASSET-BACKED ACTIVITY AND HIGHER REVENUES FROM LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $5.41 BILLION FOR 2016, 8% LOWER THAN 2015, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER, REFLECTING

SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF CLIENT ASSETS AND STRATEGIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION.

COMMISSIONS

AND FEES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $3.21 BILLION FOR 2016, 3% LOWER THAN 2015, REFLECTING LOWER LISTED CASH EQUITY VOLUMES IN ASIA AND EUROPE, CONSISTENT WITH MARKET VOLUMES IN THESE REGIONS.

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $9.93 BILLION FOR

2016, 4% HIGHER THAN 2015, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS AND CREDIT PRODUCTS. THESE RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES IN EQUITY CASH PRODUCTS AND LOWER REVENUES IN CURRENCIES, MORTGAGES,

EQUITY DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES.

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE

$3.20 BILLION FOR 2016, 36% LOWER THAN 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NET GAINS FROM PRIVATE EQUITIES, DRIVEN BY COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND

CORPORATE PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, REVENUES IN DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2015, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES RELATED TO RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS

ON ECONOMIC HEDGES. LOSSES RELATED TO THESE HEDGES WERE $596 MILLION IN 2016, COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $329 MILLION IN 2015. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS. SEE NOTE 9 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ECONOMIC HEDGES RELATED TO OUR RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES.

NET INTEREST INCOME.

NET INTEREST INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WAS $2.59 BILLION FOR 2016, 16% LOWER THAN 2015, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN

INTEREST EXPENSE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON OTHER INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, AND INCREASES IN TOTAL AVERAGE LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND TOTAL AVERAGE

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES, AND LOANS RECEIVABLE, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN TOTAL

AVERAGE BALANCES AND THE IMPACT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES. SEE STATISTICAL DISCLOSURES  DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SOURCES OF NET INTEREST INCOME.

2015 VERSUS 2014

NET REVENUES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $33.82 BILLION FOR 2015, 2% LOWER THAN 2014, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES AND NET INTEREST INCOME, LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKET-MAKING REVENUES AND

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES, AS WELL AS SLIGHTLY HIGHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES. COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2014.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

NON-INTEREST REVENUES.

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $7.03 BILLION FOR 2015, 9% HIGHER THAN 2014, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY, REFLECTING STRONG CLIENT

ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S. INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2014. REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE LOWER

COMPARED WITH 2014, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY. REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE ALSO LOWER, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND CONVERTIBLE OFFERINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES FROM SECONDARY OFFERINGS.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS

WERE $5.87 BILLION FOR 2015, 2% HIGHER THAN 2014, DUE TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION, AND HIGHER TRANSACTION REVENUES.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $3.32 BILLION FOR 2015, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2014.

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $9.52 BILLION FOR 2015, 14% HIGHER THAN 2014. EXCLUDING A GAIN

OF $289 MILLION IN 2014 RELATED TO THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF CERTAIN OF OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT, MARKET-MAKING REVENUES WERE 18% HIGHER THAN 2014, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES, EQUITY CASH

PRODUCTS AND EQUITY DERIVATIVES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES IN MORTGAGES, COMMODITIES AND CREDIT PRODUCTS.

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $5.02 BILLION FOR 2015, 24% LOWER THAN 2014. THIS

DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES FROM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING THE SALE OF METRO INTERNATIONAL TRADE SERVICES (METRO) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014 AND LOWER NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITIES, DRIVEN

BY CORPORATE PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, REVENUES IN DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, REFLECTING LOWER NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS.

NET INTEREST INCOME.

NET INTEREST INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WAS $3.06 BILLION FOR 2015, 24% LOWER THAN 2014. THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH 2014 WAS DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME RESULTING FROM A REDUCTION IN

INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN TOTAL AVERAGE LOANS RECEIVABLE. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, WHICH

PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. SEE

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION  STATISTICAL DISCLOSURES  DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SOURCES OF NET INTEREST INCOME.

OPERATING EXPENSES

OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE

PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS INCLUDES SALARIES, DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF EQUITY AWARDS AND OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS BENEFITS. DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION IS

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE LEVEL OF NET REVENUES, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, PREVAILING LABOR MARKETS, BUSINESS MIX, THE STRUCTURE OF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, SEE

USE OF ESTIMATES FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

IN THE

CONTEXT OF THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2016, WE COMPLETED AN INITIATIVE THAT IDENTIFIED AREAS WHERE WE CAN OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION IN ANNUAL RUN RATE

COMPENSATION. FOR 2016, NET SAVINGS FROM THIS INITIATIVE, AFTER SEVERANCE AND OTHER RELATED COSTS, WERE APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION.

OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $20.30 BILLION FOR 2016, 19% LOWER THAN 2015. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $11.65 BILLION FOR 2016, 8% LOWER THAN 2015, REFLECTING A

DECREASE IN NET REVENUES AND THE IMPACT OF EXPENSE SAVINGS INITIATIVES. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2016 WAS 38.1% COMPARED WITH 37.5% FOR 2015. TOTAL STAFF DECREASED 7% DURING 2016, DUE TO EXPENSE SAVINGS INITIATIVES.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $8.66 BILLION FOR 2016, 30% LOWER THAN 2015,

PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2015,

REFLECTING EXPENSE SAVINGS INITIATIVES. NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS FOR 2016 WERE $396 MILLION COMPARED WITH $4.01 BILLION FOR 2015 (2015 PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS). 2016

INCLUDED A $114 MILLION CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND. COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED TO FUND THIS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES. WE ASK OUR PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS TO MAKE

RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POTENTIAL CHARITABLE RECIPIENTS FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

2015 VERSUS

2014.

OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $25.04 BILLION FOR 2015, 13% HIGHER THAN 2014. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS WERE $12.68 BILLION FOR 2015, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2014. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2015 WAS 37.5% COMPARED WITH 36.8% FOR 2014. TOTAL STAFF INCREASED 8% DURING 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO

ACTIVITY LEVELS IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $12.36 BILLION

FOR 2015, 30% HIGHER THAN 2014, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER EXPENSES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, AND A REDUCTION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF METRO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014. NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS FOR 2015

WERE $4.01 BILLION COMPARED WITH $754 MILLION FOR 2014 (BOTH PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS). 2015 INCLUDED A $148 MILLION CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND.

COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED TO FUND THIS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES. WE ASK OUR PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POTENTIAL CHARITABLE RECIPIENTS FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

PROVISION FOR TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

FOR 2016 WAS 28.2%, DOWN FROM 30.7% FOR 2015. THE DECLINE COMPARED WITH 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS IN 2015, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN

TAX LAW ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, THE MIX OF EARNINGS AND AN INCREASE RELATED TO HIGHER ENACTED TAX RATES IMPACTING CERTAIN OF OUR U.K. SUBSIDIARIES IN 2016.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS 30.7%, DOWN FROM 31.4% FOR 2014. THE DECLINE COMPARED WITH 2014 REFLECTED REDUCTIONS RELATED TO A

CHANGE IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN TAX LAW ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, SETTLEMENTS OF TAX AUDITS AND THE DETERMINATION THAT CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS WOULD BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED ABROAD, AND AN INCREASE RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF

NON-DEDUCTIBLE PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2016, THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ENACTED A

BUDGET THAT WILL REDUCE THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX BASE RATE BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2020. DURING 2016, WE REMEASURED DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS ACCORDINGLY. THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

IN OCTOBER 2016, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY ISSUED RULES UNDER SECTION 385 OF

THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE THAT COULD, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, RE-CHARACTERIZE DEBT AS EQUITY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE RULES CONTAIN EXCLUSIONS APPLICABLE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY REGULATED FINANCIAL

COMPANIES, NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE HOLDER OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT IS INCLUDED IN A CONSOLIDATED U.S. TAX RETURN, AND ORDINARY BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. THE RULES ALSO CONTAIN EXCLUSIONS APPLICABLE TO MEMBERS OF A

REGULATED FINANCIAL GROUP OTHER THAN SUBSIDIARIES HELD UNDER THE MERCHANT BANKING AUTHORITY, GRANDFATHERED COMMODITIES, OR COMPLEMENTARY ACTIVITIES UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956. THESE EXCEPTIONS WOULD EXCLUDE FROM RE-CHARACTERIZATION

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY US. WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE RULES TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OR CASH FLOWS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IN THE TABLE ABOVE.



ANNOUNCED AND COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FULL CREDIT TO EACH OF THE ADVISORS IN A

TRANSACTION. EQUITY AND EQUITY-RELATED OFFERINGS AND DEBT OFFERINGS ARE BASED ON FULL CREDIT FOR SINGLE BOOK MANAGERS AND EQUAL CREDIT FOR JOINT BOOK MANAGERS. TRANSACTION VOLUMES MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF NET REVENUES IN A GIVEN PERIOD. IN ADDITION,

TRANSACTION VOLUMES FOR PRIOR PERIODS MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED DUE TO THE SUBSEQUENT WITHDRAWAL OR A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF A TRANSACTION.



EQUITY AND EQUITY-RELATED OFFERINGS INCLUDES RULE 144A AND PUBLIC COMMON STOCK OFFERINGS, CONVERTIBLE

OFFERINGS AND RIGHTS OFFERINGS.



DEBT OFFERINGS INCLUDES NON-CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

AND TAXABLE MUNICIPAL DEBT. INCLUDES PUBLICLY REGISTERED AND RULE 144A ISSUES. EXCLUDES LEVERAGED LOANS.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED ACTIVITY REMAINED STRONG FOR 2016 AND INDUSTRY-WIDE ANNOUNCED ACTIVITY CONTINUED TO BE

ROBUST FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, BUT BOTH DECLINED FOR THE INDUSTRY COMPARED WITH THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY DURING 2015. IN UNDERWRITING, INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY UNDERWRITING VOLUMES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2015, DUE TO A CONTINUED WEAK BACKDROP

FOR NEW ISSUANCES. THIS COMPARES WITH STRONG ACTIVITY LEVELS IN 2015, WHICH BENEFITED FROM FAVORABLE EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT UNDERWRITING VOLUMES DURING 2016 INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2015. IN THE

FUTURE, IF INDUSTRY-WIDE ACTIVITY LEVELS IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OR EQUITY UNDERWRITING CONTINUE THE DOWNWARD TREND OR IF INDUSTRY-WIDE ACTIVITY LEVELS IN DEBT UNDERWRITING DECLINE, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

DURING 2015, INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG INDUSTRY-WIDE MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY. INDUSTRY-WIDE ACTIVITY IN BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2014.

2016 VERSUS 2015.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WERE $6.27 BILLION FOR 2016, 11% LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015.

NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE $2.93 BILLION, 16% LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE

TRANSACTIONS. NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING WERE $3.34 BILLION, 6% LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES. NET REVENUES IN DEBT

UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES FROM ASSET-BACKED ACTIVITY AND HIGHER NET REVENUES FROM LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.44 BILLION FOR 2016, 7% LOWER THAN 2015, DUE TO DECREASED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $2.84 BILLION IN 2016, 14% LOWER THAN 2015.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG WAS LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG LEVEL OF BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2015,

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL DEBT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING DECREASES IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY

AND ACQUISITION-RELATED FINANCING, RESPECTIVELY. ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL EQUITY UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2015.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF OUR FUTURE NET REVENUES FROM INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS WHERE WE

BELIEVE THAT FUTURE REVENUE REALIZATION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. WE BELIEVE CHANGES IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG MAY BE A USEFUL INDICATOR OF CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS WHICH, OVER THE LONG TERM, IMPACT OUR NET REVENUES. HOWEVER, THE

TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETION AND CORRESPONDING REVENUE RECOGNITION OF TRANSACTIONS IN OUR BACKLOG VARIES BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE ASSIGNMENT, AS CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MAY REMAIN IN OUR BACKLOG FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND OTHERS MAY ENTER AND LEAVE

WITHIN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, OUR TRANSACTION BACKLOG IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT INDIVIDUAL CLIENT TRANSACTIONS WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. TRANSACTIONS MAY BE CANCELLED OR

MODIFIED, AND TRANSACTIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE MAY ALSO OCCUR.

2015 VERSUS 2014.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WERE $7.03 BILLION FOR 2015, 9% HIGHER THAN 2014.

NET

REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE $3.47 BILLION, 40% HIGHER THAN 2014, REFLECTING STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S. INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING WERE $3.56 BILLION, 11% LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2014. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2014, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY. NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING

WERE ALSO LOWER, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND CONVERTIBLE OFFERINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES FROM SECONDARY OFFERINGS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.71 BILLION FOR 2015, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2014. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $3.31 BILLION IN

2015, 19% HIGHER THAN 2014.

AS OF DECEMBER 2015, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG WAS HIGHER COMPARED WITH

PHYSICAL COMMODITIES, INVOLVING CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, BASE, PRECIOUS AND OTHER METALS, ELECTRICITY, COAL, AGRICULTURAL AND OTHER COMMODITY PRODUCTS.

EQUITIES.

INCLUDES CLIENT EXECUTION ACTIVITIES RELATED

TO MAKING MARKETS IN EQUITY PRODUCTS AND COMMISSIONS AND FEES FROM EXECUTING AND CLEARING INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE, AS WELL AS OTC TRANSACTIONS. EQUITIES ALSO INCLUDES OUR SECURITIES

SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES FINANCING, SECURITIES LENDING AND OTHER PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING HEDGE FUNDS, MUTUAL FUNDS, PENSION FUNDS AND FOUNDATIONS, AND GENERATES REVENUES PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF INTEREST

RATE SPREADS OR FEES.

AS A MARKET MAKER, WE FACILITATE TRANSACTIONS IN BOTH LIQUID AND LESS LIQUID MARKETS, PRIMARILY

FOR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, SUCH AS CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTMENT FUNDS AND GOVERNMENTS, TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN MEETING THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND IN MANAGING THEIR RISKS. IN THIS ROLE, WE SEEK TO EARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

PRICE AT WHICH A MARKET PARTICIPANT IS WILLING TO SELL AN INSTRUMENT TO US AND THE PRICE AT WHICH ANOTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT IS WILLING TO BUY IT FROM US, AND VICE VERSA (I.E., BID/OFFER SPREAD). IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN INVENTORY, TYPICALLY FOR A

SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, IN RESPONSE TO, OR IN ANTICIPATION OF, CLIENT DEMAND. WE ALSO HOLD INVENTORY TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES THAT ARISE FROM THESE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. OUR MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY IS RECORDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE (LONG POSITIONS) OR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE (SHORT POSITIONS) IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR RESULTS ARE INFLUENCED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERCONNECTED DRIVERS, INCLUDING (I) CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS AND TRANSACTIONAL BID/OFFER

SPREADS (COLLECTIVELY, CLIENT ACTIVITY), AND (II) CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY AND INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE HOLDING, HEDGING AND FUNDING OF OUR INVENTORY (COLLECTIVELY, MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY CHANGES).

DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, DISAGGREGATION OF NET REVENUES INTO CLIENT ACTIVITY AND MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY CHANGES IS JUDGMENTAL AND HAS INHERENT COMPLEXITIES AND LIMITATIONS.

THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF OUR NET REVENUES VARY OVER TIME AS THESE DRIVERS ARE IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE INTERRELATED FACTORS AFFECTING ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, EQUITY PRICES AND COMMODITY PRICES, INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

IN GENERAL, ASSUMING ALL OTHER MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS REMAIN CONSTANT, INCREASES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS OR BID/OFFER SPREADS TEND TO

RESULT IN INCREASES IN NET REVENUES, AND DECREASES TEND TO HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS AND BID/OFFER SPREADS, AS WELL AS THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY. FOR

EXAMPLE, A DECREASE IN LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET COULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF (I) INCREASING OUR BID/OFFER SPREAD, (II) DECREASING INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND THEREBY DECREASING CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND (III) WIDER CREDIT SPREADS ON OUR

INVENTORY POSITIONS.

THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF NET REVENUES FOR FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, FOR THE

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

CHALLENGING TRENDS IN THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES THAT EXISTED THROUGHOUT THE SECOND HALF OF 2015 CONTINUED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, INCLUDING CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES

ABOUT GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CENTRAL BANK ACTIVITY. THESE CONCERNS CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE PRESSURE ACROSS BOTH EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS. VOLATILITY PEAKED IN FEBRUARY WITH THE VIX REACHING OVER 28, AND GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS

MATERIALLY DECLINED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE FIRST QUARTER WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE, SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX, AND NIKKEI 225 INDEX DOWN 10%, 25% AND 21%, RESPECTIVELY, AT THEIR LOWEST POINTS. CREDIT SPREADS FOR HIGH-YIELD ISSUERS

WIDENED OVER 100 BASIS POINTS EARLY IN THE FIRST QUARTER, DRIVEN BY THE ENERGY SECTOR, AND OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES CONTINUED THEIR DOWNWARD TREND THAT BEGAN DURING THE MIDDLE OF 2015, REACHING AS LOW AS $26 PER BARREL (WTI) AND $1.64

PER MILLION BRITISH THERMAL UNITS, RESPECTIVELY. CONCERNS ABOUT GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH MODERATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER, HOWEVER THE MARKET BECAME INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON THE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS

SURROUNDING THE POTENTIAL EXIT OF THE U.K. FROM THE E.U. IN RESPONSE TO THE LEAVE VOTE, THE MSCI WORLD INDEX DECLINED 7% IN TWO DAYS AND VOLUMES GENERALLY SPIKED, BOTH OF WHICH LARGELY REVERSED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, THE NIKKEI

225 INDEX AND THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX WERE DOWN 18% AND 17%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2016. THIS CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING LOW INTEREST RATES, IMPACTED CLIENT SENTIMENT AND RISK APPETITE, AND MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS

REMAINED DIFFICULT.

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2016, THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED, AS GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS STEADILY

INCREASED, WITH THE MSCI WORLD INDEX UP 6% AND THE S&P 500 INDEX UP 7% DURING THE PERIOD. IN ADDITION, EQUITY MARKETS IN ASIA GENERALLY REBOUNDED, WITH THE NIKKEI 225 INDEX UP 23% AND THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX UP 6%. AVERAGE VOLATILITY

IN EQUITY MARKETS WAS LOWER DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2016 COMPARED WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. IN CREDIT AND COMMODITY MARKETS, U.S. INVESTMENT GRADE AND HIGH-YIELD CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED BY NEARLY 40 BASIS POINTS AND OVER 150 BASIS POINTS,

RESPECTIVELY, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2016, AND OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $54 PER BARREL (WTI) AND $3.72 PER MILLION BRITISH THERMAL UNITS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE TRENDS DROVE IMPROVED CLIENT SENTIMENT AND

MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2016. IF THE TREND OF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUES OVER THE LONG TERM AND ACTIVITY LEVELS DECLINE, NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DURING 2015, THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED

BY DIVERGING CENTRAL BANK MONETARY POLICIES IN THE U.S. AND THE EURO AREA IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AS INCREASED VOLATILITY LEVELS CONTRIBUTED TO STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS IN CURRENCIES, INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, AND MARKET-MAKING

CONDITIONS IMPROVED. HOWEVER, DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2015, CONCERNS ABOUT GLOBAL GROWTH AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVES INTEREST RATE POLICY, ALONG WITH LOWER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES, WIDENING HIGH-YIELD CREDIT SPREADS AND

DECLINING COMMODITY PRICES, CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN MORTGAGES AND CREDIT, AND MORE DIFFICULT MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS.

2016 VERSUS 2015.

NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT

SERVICES WERE $14.47 BILLION FOR 2016, 5% LOWER THAN 2015.

NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT

EXECUTION WERE $7.56 BILLION FOR 2016, 3% HIGHER THAN 2015. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS ON OUR INVENTORY.

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES DETAILS OF OUR FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION NET REVENUES BY BUSINESS, COMPARED WITH 2015

RESULTS.



NET REVENUES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, REFLECTING IMPROVED MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING GENERALLY TIGHTER SPREADS, AND HIGHER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS COMPARED WITH LOW ACTIVITY IN 2015.



NET REVENUES IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS WERE HIGHER, REFLECTING HIGHER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS.



NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, REFLECTING LESS FAVORABLE MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING GENERALLY WIDER SPREADS.



NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES WERE LOWER, REFLECTING LESS FAVORABLE MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS IN EMERGING MARKETS

PRODUCTS COMPARED WITH 2015, WHICH INCLUDED A STRONG FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.



NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES WERE LOWER, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES WERE $6.91 BILLION, 12% LOWER THAN 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES CLIENT

EXECUTION, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN CASH PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA, AS WELL AS LOWER NET REVENUES IN DERIVATIVES. COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER, REFLECTING LOWER LISTED CASH EQUITY VOLUMES IN ASIA AND EUROPE,

CONSISTENT WITH MARKET VOLUMES IN THESE REGIONS, AND NET REVENUES IN SECURITIES SERVICES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2015.

WE ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN UNSECURED BORROWINGS. FOR 2015, THE FAIR VALUE NET

GAIN ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS ON THESE BORROWINGS WAS $255 MILLION ($214 MILLION AND $41 MILLION RELATED TO FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION,

RESPECTIVELY). FOR 2016, WE ADOPTED THE REQUIREMENT IN ASU NO. 2016-01 TO PRESENT SEPARATELY SUCH GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR 2016 WAS A LOSS OF

$844 MILLION ($544 MILLION, NET OF TAX). SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ASU NO. 2016-01.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $9.71 BILLION FOR 2016, 30% LOWER THAN 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR

MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, AND DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $4.75 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED WITH $1.21 BILLION IN 2015.

COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION WERE 12% LOWER THAN 2014. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS ON OUR INVENTORY.

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES DETAILS OF OUR FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION NET REVENUES BY BUSINESS, COMPARED WITH 2014

GAIN OF $121 MILLION ($30 MILLION AND $91 MILLION INCLUDED IN EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND SECURITIES SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY) IN 2014 RELATED TO THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF CERTAIN OF OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT, NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES

WERE 18% HIGHER THAN 2014, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION ACROSS THE MAJOR REGIONS, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RESULTS IN BOTH DERIVATIVES AND CASH PRODUCTS, AND HIGHER NET REVENUES IN SECURITIES

SERVICES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES AND IMPROVED SECURITIES LENDING SPREADS. COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2014.

WE ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN UNSECURED BORROWINGS. THE FAIR VALUE NET GAIN ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT

SPREADS ON THESE BORROWINGS WAS $255 MILLION ($214 MILLION AND $41 MILLION RELATED TO FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, RESPECTIVELY) FOR 2015, COMPARED WITH A NET GAIN OF

$144 MILLION ($108 MILLION AND $36 MILLION RELATED TO FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, RESPECTIVELY) FOR 2014.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $13.94 BILLION FOR 2015, 28% HIGHER THAN 2014, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET PROVISIONS FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

FOLLOWING DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE IMPACT OF A CHALLENGING MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ON CORPORATE PERFORMANCE, PARTICULARLY IN THE ENERGY SECTOR, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, MARKET CONDITIONS

IMPROVED DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR AS MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS MODERATED. GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS INCREASED DURING 2016, CONTRIBUTING TO NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC EQUITIES, AND CORPORATE PERFORMANCE REBOUNDED FROM THE DIFFICULT START TO THE

YEAR. IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS NEGATIVELY AFFECT CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OR COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS, OR IF GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE, NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

ALTHOUGH NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING FOR 2015 BENEFITED FROM FAVORABLE COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS, INCLUDING SALES, INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND FINANCINGS, A DECLINE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES AND WIDENING HIGH-YIELD CREDIT SPREADS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2015 IMPACTED RESULTS.

2016 VERSUS 2015.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTING &

LENDING WERE $4.08 BILLION FOR 2016, 25% LOWER THAN 2015. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES FROM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NET GAINS FROM PRIVATE EQUITIES, DRIVEN

BY COMPANY-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND CORPORATE PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH 2015, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES RELATED TO RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF

CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ON ECONOMIC HEDGES. LOSSES RELATED TO THESE HEDGES WERE $596 MILLION IN 2016, COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $329 MILLION IN 2015. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

INSTRUMENTS AND HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME. SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ECONOMIC HEDGES RELATED TO OUR RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.39 BILLION FOR 2016, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2015. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $1.69 BILLION IN

2016, 44% LOWER THAN 2015.

2015 VERSUS 2014

. NET

REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE $5.44 BILLION FOR 2015, 20% LOWER THAN 2014. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET REVENUES FROM INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING THE SALE OF METRO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2014 AND LOWER NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITIES, DRIVEN BY CORPORATE PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, REFLECTING LOWER NET GAINS FROM INVESTMENTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.40 BILLION FOR 2015, 15% LOWER THAN 2014, DUE TO LOWER

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, AND A REDUCTION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF METRO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE

$3.03 BILLION IN 2015, 24% LOWER THAN 2014.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND OFFERS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS (PRIMARILY THROUGH SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND

COMMINGLED VEHICLES, SUCH AS MUTUAL FUNDS AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS) ACROSS ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES TO A DIVERSE SET OF INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ALSO OFFERS WEALTH ADVISORY SERVICES, INCLUDING PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL COUNSELING, AND BROKERAGE AND OTHER TRANSACTION SERVICES TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES.

ASSETS UNDER

SUPERVISION (AUS) INCLUDE CLIENT ASSETS WHERE WE EARN A FEE FOR MANAGING ASSETS ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS. THIS INCLUDES NET ASSETS IN OUR MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, CREDIT FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS (INCLUDING REAL ESTATE FUNDS), AND SEPARATELY

MANAGED ACCOUNTS FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS. ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION ALSO INCLUDE CLIENT ASSETS INVESTED WITH THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS, BANK DEPOSITS AND ADVISORY RELATIONSHIPS WHERE WE EARN A FEE FOR ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES, BUT DO

NOT HAVE INVESTMENT DISCRETION. ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION DO NOT INCLUDE THE SELF-DIRECTED BROKERAGE ASSETS OF OUR CLIENTS. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION REPRESENT ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS. LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS

REPRESENT MONEY MARKET AND BANK DEPOSIT ASSETS.

ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION TYPICALLY GENERATE FEES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSET VALUE, WHICH

VARY BY ASSET CLASS AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL AND ARE AFFECTED BY INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS ASSET INFLOWS AND REDEMPTIONS. ASSET CLASSES SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND EQUITY ASSETS TYPICALLY GENERATE HIGHER FEES RELATIVE TO FIXED INCOME

AND LIQUIDITY PRODUCT ASSETS. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE (WHICH EXCLUDES NON-ASSET-BASED FEES) WE EARNED ON OUR ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION WAS 35 BASIS POINTS FOR 2016, 39 BASIS POINTS FOR 2015 AND 40 BASIS POINTS FOR 2014. THESE DECREASES

REFLECTED SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF CLIENT ASSETS AND STRATEGIES.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES

BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS OR A SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS RETURN, OR WHEN THE RETURN EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED BENCHMARK OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGETS. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN ALL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES ARE RESOLVED.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

FOLLOWING A CHALLENGING FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE WITH HIGHER ASSET PRICES RESULTING IN FULL YEAR APPRECIATION IN OUR CLIENT ASSETS IN BOTH EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME ASSETS. ALSO, OUR ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION

INCREASED DURING 2016 FROM NET INFLOWS, PRIMARILY IN FIXED INCOME ASSETS, AND LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS. THE MIX OF OUR AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION SHIFTED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2015 FROM LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION TO LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS.

MANAGEMENT FEES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INFLOWS TO ADVISORY SERVICES AND OUTFLOWS FROM ACTIVELY-MANAGED MUTUAL FUNDS. IN THE FUTURE, IF ASSET PRICES DECLINE, OR INVESTORS CONTINUE THE TREND OF FAVORING ASSETS THAT TYPICALLY

GENERATE LOWER FEES OR INVESTORS WITHDRAW THEIR ASSETS, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

DURING 2015, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CLIENT NET INFLOWS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE

DECLINES IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME ASSET PRICES, WHICH RESULTED IN DEPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS, PARTICULARLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015. THE MIX OF AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION SHIFTED SLIGHTLY FROM LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER

SUPERVISION TO LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS COMPARED WITH 2014.

2016 VERSUS 2015.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE $5.79 BILLION FOR 2016, 7% LOWER THAN 2015. THIS DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES COMPARED WITH A STRONG 2015. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT

AND OTHER FEES WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER, REFLECTING SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF CLIENT ASSETS AND STRATEGIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION. DURING THE YEAR, TOTAL ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $127 BILLION

TO $1.38 TRILLION. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $75 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $42 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN FIXED INCOME ASSETS, AND NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $33 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS INCREASED $52 BILLION.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $4.65 BILLION FOR 2016, 4% LOWER

THAN 2015, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $1.13 BILLION IN 2016, 17% LOWER THAN 2015.

2015 VERSUS 2014.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

WERE $6.21 BILLION FOR 2015, 3% HIGHER THAN 2014, DUE TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION, AND HIGHER TRANSACTION REVENUES. DURING 2015, TOTAL ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION

INCREASED $74 BILLION TO $1.25 TRILLION. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $51 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $71 BILLION (WHICH INCLUDES $18 BILLION OF ASSET INFLOWS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF

PACIFIC GLOBAL ADVISORS SOLUTIONS BUSINESS), AND NET MARKET DEPRECIATION OF $20 BILLION, BOTH PRIMARILY IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS. IN ADDITION, LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS INCREASED $23 BILLION.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $4.84 BILLION FOR 2015, 4% HIGHER THAN 2014, DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING

HIGHER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $1.37 BILLION IN 2015, 2% LOWER THAN 2014.

BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES

BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT

ONE OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES IS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR

BALANCE SHEET. WHILE OUR ASSET BASE CHANGES DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY, MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET ALSO REFLECTS FACTORS INCLUDING (I) OUR OVERALL RISK TOLERANCE, (II) THE

AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL WE HOLD AND (III) OUR FUNDING PROFILE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. SEE EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL  EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

PROCESS.

ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AT QUARTER-END AND YEAR-END DATES ARE GENERALLY NOT

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR REPORTING PERIODS.

IN ORDER TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT, WE SEEK TO

MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENTLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DYNAMICALLY MANAGE OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHICH INCLUDE (I) BALANCE SHEET PLANNING, (II) BUSINESS-SPECIFIC LIMITS, (III) MONITORING OF KEY METRICS AND

(IV) SCENARIO ANALYSES.

BALANCE SHEET

PLANNING.

WE PREPARE A BALANCE SHEET PLAN THAT COMBINES OUR PROJECTED TOTAL ASSETS AND COMPOSITION OF ASSETS WITH OUR EXPECTED FUNDING SOURCES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THIS PLAN IS REVIEWED

SEMI-ANNUALLY AND MAY BE ADJUSTED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLANNING PROCESS ARE.



TO DEVELOP OUR BALANCE SHEET PROJECTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERAL STATE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

EXPECTED BUSINESS ACTIVITY LEVELS, AS WELL AS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;



TO ALLOW BUSINESS RISK MANAGERS AND MANAGERS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO OBJECTIVELY

EVALUATE BALANCE SHEET LIMIT REQUESTS FROM BUSINESS MANAGERS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING OUR LIABILITY PROFILE AND EQUITY CAPITAL LEVELS, AND KEY METRICS; AND



TO INFORM THE TARGET AMOUNT, TENOR AND TYPE OF FUNDING TO RAISE, BASED ON OUR PROJECTED ASSETS AND CONTRACTUAL

MATURITIES.

BUSINESS RISK MANAGERS AND MANAGERS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS MEET WITH

BUSINESS MANAGERS TO REVIEW CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION AND DISCUSS EXPECTATIONS FOR THE YEAR TO PREPARE OUR BALANCE SHEET PLAN. THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REVIEWED INCLUDES ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, LIMIT UTILIZATION, RISK

AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES, AND CAPITAL USAGE.

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET PLAN, INCLUDING OUR BALANCE SHEETS BY BUSINESS, FUNDING

PROJECTIONS, AND PROJECTED KEY METRICS, IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE. SEE OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC LIMITS.

THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE

COMMITTEE SETS ASSET AND LIABILITY LIMITS FOR EACH BUSINESS. THESE LIMITS ARE SET AT LEVELS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO ACTUAL OPERATING LEVELS, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK APPETITE, IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROMPT ESCALATION AND

DISCUSSION AMONG BUSINESS MANAGERS AND MANAGERS IN OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ON A ROUTINE BASIS. THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES BALANCE SHEET LIMITS ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AND MAY ALSO APPROVE CHANGES IN

LIMITS ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE SETS AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO HOLD INVENTORY OVER LONGER

PERIODS OF TIME. REQUESTS FOR CHANGES IN LIMITS ARE EVALUATED AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THEIR IMPACT ON KEY FIRM METRICS. COMPLIANCE WITH LIMITS IS MONITORED ON A DAILY BASIS BY BUSINESS RISK MANAGERS, AS WELL AS MANAGERS IN OUR INDEPENDENT

CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS.

MONITORING OF KEY METRICS.

WE MONITOR KEY BALANCE SHEET METRICS DAILY BOTH BY BUSINESS AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, INCLUDING ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, LIMIT UTILIZATION AND RISK MEASURES. WE ALLOCATE ASSETS TO BUSINESSES

AND REVIEW AND ANALYZE MOVEMENTS RESULTING FROM NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY AS WELL AS MARKET FLUCTUATIONS.

SCENARIO ANALYSES.

WE CONDUCT VARIOUS SCENARIO ANALYSES INCLUDING AS PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) AND DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TESTS (DFAST), AS WELL AS OUR RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING. SEE

EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL  EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES. THESE SCENARIOS COVER SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS USING VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC

AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS, BASED ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS. WE USE THESE ANALYSES TO ASSIST US IN DEVELOPING OUR LONGER-TERM BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF ASSETS, FUNDING AND EQUITY CAPITAL.

ADDITIONALLY, THESE ANALYSES HELP US DEVELOP APPROACHES FOR MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE FUNDING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL ACROSS A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS, INCLUDING A SEVERELY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION

IN ADDITION TO PREPARING

OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE PREPARE A BALANCE SHEET THAT GENERALLY ALLOCATES ASSETS TO OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP PRESENTATION AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP

PRESENTATIONS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING OUR ASSETS ON THIS BASIS IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY MANAGEMENT VIEWS AND MANAGES RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS AND BETTER ENABLES INVESTORS TO ASSESS THE

LIQUIDITY OF OUR ASSETS.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS AND METRICS

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, TOTAL ASSETS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE $860.17 BILLION, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED

FROM DECEMBER 2015, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $28.27 BILLION, OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE OF $17.55 BILLION AND A NET DECREASE IN COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS OF

$10.42 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEPOSITS, REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF GE CAPITAL BANKS ONLINE DEPOSIT PLATFORM. THE DECREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED DECREASES IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY, AND THE NET DECREASE IN COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS REFLECTED THE

IMPACT OF FIRM AND CLIENT ACTIVITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, TOTAL LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE

$773.27 BILLION, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 2015, REFLECTING INCREASES IN DEPOSITS OF $26.58 BILLION AND UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS OF $13.66 BILLION, OFFSET BY DECREASES IN PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES

OF $20.89 BILLION, SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, AT FAIR VALUE OF $14.25 BILLION, AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES OF $4.53 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN DEPOSITS REFLECTED THE ACQUISITION OF GE CAPITAL

BANKS ONLINE DEPOSIT PLATFORM, AND THE INCREASE IN UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS WAS DUE TO NET NEW ISSUANCES. THE DECREASE IN PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES REFLECTED CHANGES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY AND THE DECREASE IN SECURITIES SOLD

UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, AT FAIR VALUE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF FIRM AND CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE DECREASE IN OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES PRIMARILY REFLECTED PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE RMBS WORKING GROUP.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, OUR TOTAL SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, WERE

$71.82 BILLION, WHICH WAS 5% LOWER AND 9% LOWER THAN THE DAILY AVERAGE AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE DAILY

AVERAGE DURING 2016 RESULTED FROM THE IMPACT OF FIRM AND CLIENT ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

LEVEL OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FLUCTUATES BETWEEN AND WITHIN PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO PROVIDING CLIENTS WITH ACCESS TO HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL, SUCH AS U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY, AND INVESTMENT-GRADE SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS THROUGH

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

FUNDING SOURCES

OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDING ARE SECURED FINANCINGS, UNSECURED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AND DEPOSITS. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN BROAD

AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES GLOBALLY ACROSS PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS, MARKETS, CURRENCIES AND CREDITORS TO AVOID FUNDING CONCENTRATIONS.

WE

RAISE FUNDING THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING.



COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, SUCH AS REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LOANED AND OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS;



LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT (INCLUDING STRUCTURED NOTES) THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS, U.S.



SAVINGS, DEMAND AND TIME DEPOSITS THROUGH INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS, AS WELL AS FROM RETAIL AND

INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS; AND



SHORT-TERM UNSECURED DEBT AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL THROUGH U.S. AND NON-U.S. HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

OTHER METHODS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR FUNDING IS PRIMARILY RAISED IN U.S. DOLLAR, EURO, BRITISH POUND AND JAPANESE YEN. WE

GENERALLY DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDING PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR OWN SALES FORCE AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS TO A LARGE, DIVERSE CREDITOR BASE IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE

CRITICAL TO OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR CREDITORS INCLUDE BANKS, GOVERNMENTS, SECURITIES LENDERS, PENSION FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL GUIDELINES TO MONITOR CREDITOR CONCENTRATION ACROSS OUR

FUNDING PROGRAMS.

SECURED FUNDING.

WE FUND A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INVENTORY ON A SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LOANED AND OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, SECURED FUNDING INCLUDED IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WAS $100.86 BILLION AND $114.44 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE MAY ALSO PLEDGE OUR INVENTORY AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES BORROWED UNDER A SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENT OR AS COLLATERAL FOR

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. WE ALSO USE OUR OWN INVENTORY TO COVER TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE OR OUR CLIENTS HAVE SOLD SECURITIES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PURCHASED. SECURED FUNDING IS LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT QUALITY THAN UNSECURED FUNDING,

DUE TO OUR POSTING OF COLLATERAL TO OUR LENDERS. NONETHELESS, WE CONTINUALLY ANALYZE THE REFINANCING RISK OF OUR SECURED FUNDING ACTIVITIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TRADE TENORS, MATURITY PROFILES, COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATIONS, COLLATERAL ELIGIBILITY AND

COUNTERPARTY ROLLOVER PROBABILITIES. WE SEEK TO MITIGATE OUR REFINANCING RISK BY EXECUTING TERM TRADES WITH STAGGERED MATURITIES, DIVERSIFYING COUNTERPARTIES, RAISING EXCESS SECURED FUNDING, AND PRE-FUNDING RESIDUAL RISK THROUGH OUR GCLA.

WE SEEK TO RAISE SECURED FUNDING WITH A TERM APPROPRIATE FOR THE LIQUIDITY OF THE ASSETS THAT ARE BEING FINANCED, AND WE SEEK

LONGER MATURITIES FOR SECURED FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY ASSET CLASSES THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS, ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF MARKET STRESS. OUR SECURED FUNDING, EXCLUDING FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY LIQUID GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, IS

PRIMARILY EXECUTED FOR TENORS OF ONE MONTH OR GREATER. ASSETS THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS DURING TIMES OF MARKET STRESS INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: MORTGAGE AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED LOANS AND

SECURITIES, NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES. ASSETS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE GENERALLY FUNDED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS. SEE

NOTES 5 AND 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY AND UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE

USE OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR SECURED FUNDING INCLUDED IN COLLATERALIZED

FINANCINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, EXCLUDING FUNDING THAT CAN ONLY BE COLLATERALIZED BY HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN OUR GCLA, EXCEEDED 120 DAYS AS OF DECEMBER 2016.

A MAJORITY OF OUR SECURED FUNDING FOR SECURITIES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN THE GCLA IS EXECUTED THROUGH TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND

SECURITIES LOANED CONTRACTS. WE ALSO RAISE FINANCING THROUGH OTHER TYPES OF COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, SUCH AS SECURED LOANS AND NOTES. GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA (GS BANK USA) HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB). AS OF

DECEMBER 2016, OUR OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AGAINST THE FHLB WERE $2.43 BILLION.

GS BANK USA ALSO HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING THROUGH

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHILE WE DO NOT RELY ON THIS FUNDING IN OUR LIQUIDITY PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING, WE MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NECESSARY TO ACCESS THIS FUNDING AND TEST DISCOUNT WINDOW BORROWING PROCEDURES.

UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

WE ISSUE UNSECURED

LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSETS AND TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR GCLA. WE ISSUE IN DIFFERENT TENORS, CURRENCIES AND PRODUCTS TO MAXIMIZE THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTOR BASE.

FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

DEPOSITS.

OUR DEPOSITS PROVIDE US WITH A DIVERSIFIED

SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY AND REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON WHOLESALE FUNDING. A GROWING SOURCE OF OUR DEPOSIT BASE IS COMPRISED OF RETAIL DEPOSITS. DEPOSITS ARE PRIMARILY USED TO FINANCE LENDING ACTIVITY, OTHER INVENTORY AND A PORTION OF OUR GCLA. WE RAISE

DEPOSITS PRIMARILY THROUGH GS BANK USA AND GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL BANK (GSIB). AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, OUR DEPOSITS WERE $124.10 BILLION AND $97.52 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR DEPOSITS.

UNSECURED SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WAS ORIGINALLY LONG-TERM DEBT THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE REPORTING DATE. WE USE UNSECURED

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO FINANCE LIQUID ASSETS AND FOR OTHER CASH MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. IN LIGHT OF REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, GROUP INC. NO LONGER ISSUES DEBT WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR,

OTHER THAN TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THE

CURRENT PORTION OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, WERE $39.27 BILLION AND $42.79 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL

CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US. WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK, DEFINES

OBJECTIVES AND ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES TO ASSIST US IN MAINTAINING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL IN BOTH BUSINESS-AS-USUAL AND STRESSED CONDITIONS.

EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

WE DETERMINE THE

APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL BY CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE RESULTS OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS AND OTHER FACTORS

SUCH AS RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES, SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE LEVELS OF OUR CAPITAL USAGE PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE

SHEET ASSETS AND/OR LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE AT BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED AND BUSINESS LEVELS.

WE PRINCIPALLY MANAGE THE LEVEL AND

COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL THROUGH ISSUANCES AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE OR REPURCHASE OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS, AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER FORMS

OF CAPITAL AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT. PRIOR TO ANY REPURCHASES, WE MUST RECEIVE CONFIRMATION THAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) DOES NOT OBJECT TO SUCH CAPITAL ACTIONS. SEE NOTES 16 AND 19 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT.

CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.

AS PART OF

CAPITAL PLANNING, WE PROJECT SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL GIVEN A RANGE OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING STRESSED CONDITIONS. OUR STRESS TESTING PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

INCLUDING MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.



CAPITAL PLANNING.

OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS INCORPORATES AN

INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT WE ARE APPROPRIATELY CAPITALIZED RELATIVE TO THE RISKS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE INCORPORATE STRESS SCENARIOS INTO OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS WITH A GOAL OF HOLDING SUFFICIENT

CAPITAL TO ENSURE WE REMAIN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AFTER EXPERIENCING A SEVERE STRESS EVENT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS VIEWED IN TANDEM WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY AND IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND POLICY FRAMEWORK.

OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDES AN INTERNAL

RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT INCORPORATES MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK. MARKET RISK IS CALCULATED BY USING VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) CALCULATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY RISK-BASED ADD-ONS WHICH INCLUDE RISKS RELATED TO RARE

EVENTS (TAIL RISKS). CREDIT RISK UTILIZES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR COUNTERPARTIES PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE SIZE OF OUR LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT. OPERATIONAL RISK IS CALCULATED BASED ON SCENARIOS INCORPORATING MULTIPLE TYPES OF

OPERATIONAL FAILURES AS WELL AS CONSIDERING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. BACKTESTING FOR MARKET RISK AND CREDIT RISK IS USED TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MODELS AT CAPTURING AND MEASURING RELEVANT RISKS.



STRESS TESTING.

OUR STRESS TESTS INCORPORATE OUR INTERNALLY

DESIGNED STRESS SCENARIOS, INCLUDING OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO, AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER CCAR AND DFAST, AND ARE DESIGNED TO CAPTURE OUR SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS. WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR STRESS

TEST PROCESSES AND A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS ON OUR WEBSITE AS DESCRIBED IN BUSINESS  AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS ANNUAL CCAR RULES, WE SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN FOR REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE

PURPOSE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVIEW IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS THAT ACCOUNTS FOR OUR UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMITS CONTINUED OPERATION DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EVALUATES US BASED, IN PART, ON WHETHER WE HAVE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY

TO CONTINUE OPERATING UNDER THE BASELINE AND STRESS SCENARIOS PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THOSE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. THIS EVALUATION ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT OUR PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING RISK, OUR CONTROLS AND GOVERNANCE FOR CAPITAL

PLANNING, AND OUR GUIDELINES FOR MAKING CAPITAL PLANNING DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EVALUATES OUR PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (I.E., DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF STOCK, SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER

CAPITAL SECURITIES) AND ISSUE CAPITAL, ACROSS A RANGE OF MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE DFAST

RULES REQUIRE US TO CONDUCT STRESS TESTS ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AND PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO CONDUCTS ITS OWN ANNUAL STRESS TESTS AND PUBLISHES A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS.

WE SUBMITTED OUR 2016 CCAR RESULTS IN APRIL 2016 AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFORMED US THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO OUR CAPITAL ACTIONS,

INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL REPURCHASE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, A POTENTIAL INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND THE POSSIBLE ISSUANCE, REDEMPTION AND MODIFICATION OF OTHER CAPITAL SECURITIES FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016 THROUGH THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2017. WE PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF OUR ANNUAL DFAST RESULTS IN JUNE 2016. SEE BUSINESS  AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE SUBMITTED OUR SEMI-ANNUAL DFAST RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND SUBSEQUENTLY PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF OUR

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO RESULTS IN OCTOBER 2016. SEE BUSINESS  AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT OUR 2017 CCAR RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BY APRIL 5, 2017.

IN ADDITION, THE RULES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRE GS BANK USA TO CONDUCT STRESS TESTS ON AN ANNUAL

BASIS AND PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS. GS BANK USA SUBMITTED ITS 2016 ANNUAL DFAST STRESS RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN APRIL 2016 AND PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF ITS RESULTS IN JUNE 2016. SEE BUSINESS 

AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) ALSO HAS ITS OWN CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS,

WHICH INCORPORATES INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITYS (PRA) INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN.

AS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY, WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN. OUR CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IDENTIFICATION OF DRIVERS

OF A CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, AS WELL AS MITIGANTS AND POTENTIAL ACTIONS. IT OUTLINES THE APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW DURING A CRISIS PERIOD, INCLUDING INTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION AS WELL AS TIMELY COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL

STAKEHOLDERS.

CAPITAL ATTRIBUTION.

WE

ASSESS EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES CAPITAL USAGE BASED UPON OUR INTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF RISKS, WHICH INCORPORATES AN ATTRIBUTION OF ALL OF OUR RELEVANT REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE ALLOCATED USING OUR

ATTRIBUTED EQUITY FRAMEWORK, WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION OUR BINDING CAPITAL CONSTRAINTS. WE ALSO ATTRIBUTE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS) TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2016, APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES, SUBJECT TO TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING RWAS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR

INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT. WE MANAGE THE LEVELS OF OUR CAPITAL USAGE BASED UPON BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS, AS WELL AS CAPITAL RETURN ANALYSES OF OUR BUSINESSES BASED ON OUR CAPITAL ATTRIBUTION.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

WE USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES (WHICH MAY INCLUDE REPURCHASE PLANS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH RULE 10B5-1), THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING

OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITION AND OUR CAPITAL PLAN SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AS PART OF CCAR. THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF THE REPURCHASES MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET

CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, THE REMAINING SHARE AUTHORIZATION UNDER OUR EXISTING REPURCHASE

PROGRAM WAS 26.6 MILLION SHARES; HOWEVER, WE ARE ONLY PERMITTED TO MAKE REPURCHASES TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH REPURCHASES HAVE NOT BEEN OBJECTED TO BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. SEE MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES IN PART II, ITEM 5 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND SEE

ABOVE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.

RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANS

WE ARE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC TO SUBMIT A PERIODIC PLAN THAT DESCRIBES OUR STRATEGY FOR A RAPID AND ORDERLY

RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE (RESOLUTION PLAN). WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO SUBMIT AND HAVE SUBMITTED, ON A PERIODIC BASIS, A GLOBAL RECOVERY PLAN THAT OUTLINES THE STEPS THAT MANAGEMENT

COULD TAKE TO REDUCE RISK, MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, AND CONSERVE CAPITAL IN TIMES OF PROLONGED STRESS.

IN APRIL 2016, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON THE 2015 RESOLUTION PLANS OF EIGHT SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT DOMESTIC BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND PROVIDED GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS. WHILE OUR PLAN WAS NOT JOINTLY

FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT (I.E., NON-CREDIBLE OR TO NOT FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE), THE FDIC IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES AND BOTH THE FDIC AND FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO IDENTIFIED CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS. IN RESPONSE TO

THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED, IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE SUBMITTED A STATUS REPORT ON OUR ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE SHORTCOMINGS AND A SEPARATE PUBLIC SECTION THAT EXPLAINS THESE ACTIONS, AT A HIGH LEVEL. OUR 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN, WHICH IS DUE BY

JULY 1, 2017, IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE.

IN ADDITION, GS BANK

USA IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A RESOLUTION PLAN TO THE FDIC AND, ACCORDINGLY, SUBMITTED ITS 2015 RESOLUTION PLAN ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2015. GS BANK USA HAS NOT YET RECEIVED SUPERVISORY FEEDBACK ON ITS 2015 RESOLUTION PLAN. IN JULY 2016, GS

BANK USA RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE FDIC THAT ITS RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSION DATE WAS EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 1, 2017 AND THE 2016 RESOLUTION PLAN REQUIREMENT WILL BE SATISFIED BY THE SUBMISSION OF THE 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN.

RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., WHICH DIRECTLY ISSUES OR GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.) AND GSI HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED LONG- AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS BY CERTAIN CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. GS BANK USA AND GSIB HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSIGNED LONG- AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER

RATINGS, AS WELL AS RATINGS ON THEIR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BANK DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE ASSIGNED RATINGS TO DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF GROUP INC.

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS

OWN DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE CALCULATION. SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT

RATINGS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT RATINGS OF GROUP INC., GS BANK USA, GSIB, GS&CO. AND GSI.

CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVISED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REGULATIONS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSITIONAL

PROVISIONS (REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK). THESE REGULATIONS ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISIONS (BASEL COMMITTEE) CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL III) AND ALSO

IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT. UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, WE ARE AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION.

WE CALCULATE OUR COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1), TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH (I) THE STANDARDIZED

APPROACH AND MARKET RISK RULES SET OUT IN THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK (TOGETHER, THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES) AND (II) THE ADVANCED APPROACH AND MARKET RISK RULES SET OUT IN THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK (TOGETHER, THE BASEL III

ADVANCED RULES) AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE LOWER OF EACH RATIO CALCULATED IN (I) AND (II) IS THE RATIO AGAINST WHICH OUR COMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM RATIO REQUIREMENTS IS ASSESSED. EACH OF THE

RATIOS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES WAS LOWER THAN THAT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND THEREFORE THE BASEL III ADVANCED RATIOS WERE THE RATIOS THAT APPLIED TO US AS OF

DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015.

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, AND FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK.

BUFFER (2.5%), (II) THE FULLY PHASED-IN G-SIB BUFFER (2.5%), AND (III) THE COUNTER-CYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER OF ZERO PERCENT. THE G-SIB BUFFER OF 2.5% IS ESTIMATED BASED ON 2016 FINANCIAL DATA, A REDUCTION FROM THE 3.0% BUFFER EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2016. THE G-SIB AND COUNTER-CYCLICAL BUFFERS IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES DUE TO ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM OUR REGULATORS AND/OR POSITIONAL CHANGES. AS A RESULT, THE MINIMUM RATIOS WE ARE SUBJECT TO AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2019 COULD BE HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNTS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.



AS OF DECEMBER 2016, IN ORDER TO MEET THE QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING

WELL-CAPITALIZED UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REGULATIONS, WE MUST MEET A HIGHER REQUIRED MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10.0%.



TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY QUARTERLY AVERAGE ADJUSTED TOTAL

ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS).

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, THE CURRENT G-SIB BUFFER AND

THE COUNTER-CYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER.

ALTHOUGH THE FULLY PHASED-IN CAPITAL RATIOS ARE NOT APPLICABLE UNTIL 2019, WE BELIEVE THAT THE RATIOS IN THE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INCLUDES A SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. UNDER AMENDMENTS

TO THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES APPROVED A FINAL RULE THAT IMPLEMENTS THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO ALIGNED WITH THE DEFINITION OF LEVERAGE ESTABLISHED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE. THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE

RATIO COMPARES TIER 1 CAPITAL TO A MEASURE OF LEVERAGE EXPOSURE, WHICH CONSISTS OF TOTAL DAILY AVERAGE ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES (WHICH INCLUDE A MEASURE OF DERIVATIVES EXPOSURES AND COMMITMENTS), LESS

CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET DEDUCTIONS. THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK REQUIRES A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO OF 5.0% (COMPRISED OF THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF 3.0% AND A 2.0% BUFFER) FOR U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES DEEMED TO BE G-SIBS, EFFECTIVE

ON JANUARY 1, 2018.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, OUR SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 6.4% AND 5.9%,

RESPECTIVELY, BASED ON TIER 1 CAPITAL ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS OF $81.81 BILLION AND $79.46 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DIVIDED BY TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE OF $1.27 TRILLION (CONSISTS OF TOTAL DAILY AVERAGE ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER OF

$884 BILLION AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES OF $392 BILLION, LESS CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET DEDUCTIONS OF $5 BILLION) AND $1.34 TRILLION (CONSISTS OF TOTAL DAILY AVERAGE ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER OF $878 BILLION AND

CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES OF $471 BILLION, LESS CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET DEDUCTIONS OF $6 BILLION), RESPECTIVELY. WITHIN TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE, THE ADJUSTMENTS TO QUARTERLY AVERAGE ASSETS IN BOTH PERIODS WERE PRIMARILY COMPRISED

OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES RELATED TO DERIVATIVES, SECURED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES.

THIS SUPPLEMENTARY

LEVERAGE RATIO IS BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES FINAL RULE AND MAY EVOLVE AS WE DISCUSS THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THIS RULE WITH OUR REGULATORS.

SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA AND OUR BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

GS BANK USA.

GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CALCULATED IN SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME MANNER AS THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CALCULATES ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK. SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVISED CAPITAL

FRAMEWORK AS IT RELATES TO GS BANK USA, INCLUDING GS BANK USAS CAPITAL RATIOS AND REQUIRED MINIMUM RATIOS.

IN ADDITION, UNDER

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RULES, COMMENCING ON JANUARY 1, 2018, IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A WELL-CAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, GS BANK USA MUST HAVE A SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO OF 6.0% OR GREATER. THE SUPPLEMENTARY

LEVERAGE RATIO COMPARES TIER 1 CAPITAL TO A MEASURE OF LEVERAGE EXPOSURE, DEFINED AS TOTAL DAILY AVERAGE ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES (WHICH INCLUDE A MEASURE OF DERIVATIVES EXPOSURES AND COMMITMENTS), LESS

CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET DEDUCTIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 2016, GS BANK USAS SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 7.3%, BASED ON TIER 1 CAPITAL ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS OF $24.48 BILLION, DIVIDED BY TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE OF

$333 BILLION (CONSISTS OF TOTAL DAILY AVERAGE ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER OF $170 BILLION AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES OF $163 BILLION, LESS CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET DEDUCTIONS OF $20 MILLION). AS OF DECEMBER 2015, GS

BANK USAS SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 7.1%, BASED ON TIER 1 CAPITAL ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS OF $23.02 BILLION, DIVIDED BY TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE OF $324 BILLION (TOTAL DAILY AVERAGE ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER OF

$134 BILLION AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES OF $190 BILLION, LESS CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET DEDUCTIONS OF $5 MILLION). THIS SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO IS BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS RULE AND

MAY EVOLVE AS WE DISCUSS THEIR INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION WITH OUR REGULATORS.

GSI.

OUR REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER, GSI, IS ONE OF OUR PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND IS REGULATED BY THE PRA AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY. GSI IS SUBJECT TO THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR

E.U.-REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRESCRIBED IN THE E.U. FOURTH CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE (CRD IV) AND THE E.U. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS REGULATION (CRR). THESE CAPITAL REGULATIONS ARE LARGELY BASED ON BASEL III.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, GSI HAD A CET1 RATIO OF 12.9%, A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 12.9% AND A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 17.2%. EACH OF THESE

RATIOS INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 71 BASIS POINTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016. THESE RATIOS WILL BE FINALIZED UPON THE COMPLETION OF GSIS 2016 AUDIT. AS OF DECEMBER 2015, GSI HAD A CET1 RATIO OF 12.9%, A

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 12.9% AND A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 17.6%.

IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

TO THE CRR TO IMPLEMENT A 3% MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN E.U. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS LEVERAGE RATIO COMPARES THE CRRS DEFINITION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO A MEASURE OF LEVERAGE EXPOSURE, DEFINED AS THE SUM OF ASSETS

PLUS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES (WHICH INCLUDE A MEASURE OF DERIVATIVES EXPOSURES, SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND COMMITMENTS), LESS TIER 1 CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS. ANY REQUIRED MINIMUM RATIO IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR GSI

NO EARLIER THAN JANUARY 1, 2018. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, GSI HAD A LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3.8% AND 3.6%, RESPECTIVELY. THE RATIO AS OF DECEMBER 2016 INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 21 BASIS POINTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROFIT FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016. THIS LEVERAGE RATIO IS BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS RULE AND MAY EVOLVE AS WE DISCUSS THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THIS RULE WITH GSIS REGULATORS.

OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF SEVERAL

OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTS ARISING FROM THE BASEL COMMITTEE, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS. SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY HOLD CAPITAL TO SATISFY

LOCAL TAX AND LEGAL GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS (FOR ENTITIES WITH ASSIGNED CREDIT RATINGS) OR INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED ON ITS UNDERLYING LEVEL OF RISK.

IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, GROUP INC. MAY BE LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL HELD AT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER CONSTRAINTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, GROUP INC.S EQUITY INVESTMENT

IN SUBSIDIARIES WAS $92.77 BILLION AND $85.52 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $86.89 BILLION AND $86.73 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS MANAGED THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES AND NON-U.S. DENOMINATED DEBT. SEE NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, WHICH ARE USED TO HEDGE THIS RISK.

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES.

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED

THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GS&CO. AND GS BANK USA, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EVOLVING REGULATION. THE DODD-FRANK ACT, ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY

ALTERED THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE. IN ADDITION, OTHER REFORMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS WORLDWIDE. GIVEN THAT MANY OF THE NEW AND PROPOSED RULES ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, THE

FULL IMPACT OF REGULATORY REFORM WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE RULES ARE IMPLEMENTED AND MARKET PRACTICES DEVELOP UNDER THE FINAL REGULATIONS.

THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED REGULATION OF, AND LIMITATIONS ON, OUR ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY

TRADING AND THE LIMITATION ON THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS (AS DEFINED IN THE VOLCKER RULE). IN ADDITION, THERE IS INCREASED REGULATION OF, AND RESTRICTIONS ON, OTC DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS,

PARTICULARLY RELATED TO SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS.

STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY RELATE TO OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS.

VOLCKER RULE

THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2015 (SUBJECT TO A CONFORMANCE

PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE). THE VOLCKER RULE PROHIBITS PROPRIETARY TRADING, BUT PERMITS ACTIVITIES SUCH AS UNDERWRITING, MARKET MAKING AND RISK-MITIGATION HEDGING, REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND INCLUDES ADDITIONAL REPORTING

AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, THE RULE IS HIGHLY COMPLEX, AND ITS IMPACT MAY CHANGE AS MARKET

PRACTICES FURTHER DEVELOP.

IN ADDITION TO THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING, THE VOLCKER RULE LIMITS THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND

INVESTMENT IN, COVERED FUNDS BY BANKING ENTITIES, INCLUDING GROUP INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IT ALSO LIMITS CERTAIN TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN US AND OUR SPONSORED FUNDS, SIMILAR TO THE LIMITATIONS ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

AND THEIR AFFILIATES AS DESCRIBED IN BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K. COVERED FUNDS INCLUDE OUR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, CERTAIN OF OUR CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS, OUR HEDGE FUNDS AND

CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENT STRUCTURES. THE LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS IN COVERED FUNDS REQUIRES US TO REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT IN EACH SUCH FUND TO 3% OR LESS OF THE FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE, AND TO REDUCE OUR AGGREGATE INVESTMENT IN ALL SUCH FUNDS TO

3% OR LESS OF OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL.

OUR INVESTMENTS IN APPLICABLE COVERED FUNDS PURCHASED AFTER DECEMBER 2013 ARE REQUIRED TO BE

DEDUCTED FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL. SEE EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL  FULLY PHASED-IN CAPITAL RATIOS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL AND THE DEDUCTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN COVERED FUNDS.

WE CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR EXISTING INTERESTS IN SUCH FUNDS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CONFORMANCE PERIOD UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE. WE PLAN TO

CONTINUE TO CONDUCT OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE.

OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT IN FUNDS AT NAV IS $6.47 BILLION. IN ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE

VOLCKER RULE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE MOST OF OUR INTERESTS IN THESE FUNDS BY THE END OF THE CONFORMANCE PERIOD. SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS AT NAV AND THE

CONFORMANCE PERIOD FOR COVERED FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH OUR NET REVENUES FROM OUR INTERESTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS

MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, OUR AGGREGATE NET REVENUES FROM THESE INVESTMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 3% AND 5% OF OUR AGGREGATE TOTAL NET REVENUES OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS AND 5 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY.

TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY

IN

DECEMBER 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ADOPTED A FINAL RULE, WHICH ESTABLISHES NEW TOTAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY (TLAC) AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES DESIGNATED AS G-SIBS. THE RULE WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN

JANUARY 2019, WITH NO PHASE-IN PERIOD, AND HAS BEEN DESIGNED SO THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A G-SIBS FAILURE, THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT EXTERNAL LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY AVAILABLE IN ORDER FOR AUTHORITIES TO IMPLEMENT AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF THE

G-SIB. THE RULE (I) ESTABLISHES MINIMUM TLAC REQUIREMENTS, (II) ESTABLISHES MINIMUM ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT REQUIREMENTS, (III) PROHIBITS CERTAIN HOLDING COMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND (IV) CAPS THE AMOUNT OF G-SIB LIABILITIES THAT ARE

NOT ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT.

WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE TLAC REQUIREMENTS BY THE EFFECTIVE DATE. SEE

BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS TLAC RULE.

OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2016, THE FINAL MARGIN RULES ISSUED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE CFTC FOR UNCLEARED SWAPS BECAME

EFFECTIVE. THESE RULES WILL PHASE IN THROUGH MARCH 2017 FOR VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2020 FOR INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF SWAPS, SECURITY-BASED SWAPS AND/OR EXEMPT FOREIGN EXCHANGE

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION ACTIVITY OF THE SWAP DEALER AND THE RELEVANT COUNTERPARTY. THE FINAL RULES OF THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES GENERALLY APPLY TO INTER-AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS, WITH LIMITED RELIEF AVAILABLE FROM INITIAL MARGIN

REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFILIATES.

UNDER THE CFTC FINAL RULES, INTER-AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS ARE EXEMPT FROM INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS WITH

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS BUT VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS STILL APPLY. WE EXPECT THAT OUR MARGIN REQUIREMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS THE RULES PHASE IN. JAPANESE REGULATORS HAVE IMPLEMENTED BROADLY SIMILAR RULES AND REGULATORS IN OTHER MAJOR

JURISDICTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DO SO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE VARIOUS

TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING.



PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL AND OTHER INTERESTS IN SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED AND

OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION VEHICLES;



HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT, INTERESTS IN LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND PREFERRED AND COMMON

STOCK IN OTHER NONCONSOLIDATED VEHICLES;



ENTERING INTO INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY, COMMODITY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING TOTAL

RETURN SWAPS;



ENTERING INTO OPERATING LEASES; AND



PROVIDING GUARANTEES, INDEMNIFICATIONS, COMMITMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS. THE SECURITIZATION

VEHICLES THAT PURCHASE MORTGAGES, CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MARKETS, SINCE THEY OFFER

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS CREATED THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS.

WE ALSO ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO

UNDERWRITE CLIENT SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDE SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS; PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH CREDIT-LINKED AND ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES; AND

RECEIVE OR PROVIDE LETTERS OF CREDIT TO SATISFY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS.

OUR FINANCIAL

INTERESTS IN, AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH, SUCH NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

WE BELIEVE THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO OUR SUCCESS. ACCORDINGLY,

WE HAVE COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH WE MONITOR, EVALUATE AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR ACTIVITIES. THESE INCLUDE LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, MODEL, LEGAL, COMPLIANCE, REGULATORY AND

REPUTATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS BUILT AROUND THREE CORE COMPONENTS: GOVERNANCE, PROCESSES AND PEOPLE.

GOVERNANCE.

RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STARTS WITH OUR BOARD, WHICH PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REVIEWING AND APPROVING RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, BOTH

DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS RISK COMMITTEE. THE BOARD ALSO RECEIVES REGULAR BRIEFINGS ON FIRMWIDE RISKS, INCLUDING MARKET RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND MODEL RISK FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND

SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND ON COMPLIANCE RISK FROM THE HEAD OF COMPLIANCE, ON LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS FROM THE GENERAL COUNSEL, AND ON OTHER MATTERS IMPACTING OUR REPUTATION FROM THE CHAIR OF OUR FIRMWIDE CLIENT

AND BUSINESS STANDARDS COMMITTEE. THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AS PART OF THE REVIEW OF THE FIRMWIDE RISK PORTFOLIO, REGULARLY ADVISES THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF RELEVANT RISK METRICS AND MATERIAL EXPOSURES. NEXT, AT OUR MOST SENIOR LEVELS, OUR

LEADERS ARE EXPERIENCED RISK MANAGERS, WITH A SOPHISTICATED AND DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WE TAKE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND SENIOR MANAGERS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, LEAD AND

PARTICIPATE IN RISK-ORIENTED COMMITTEES. INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE COMPLIANCE, THE CONFLICTS RESOLUTION GROUP (CONFLICTS), CONTROLLERS, CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY (CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT), HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT,

LEGAL, LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS (LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT), MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS (MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT), MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS, OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS (OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT), TAX,

TECHNOLOGY AND TREASURY.

OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE PROTOCOL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISION-MAKING ON RISK MANAGEMENT

ISSUES AND ENSURES IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE DECISIONS. WE MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF RISK-RELATED COMMITTEES THAT MEET REGULARLY AND SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO FACILITATE AND FOSTER ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO IDENTIFY, MANAGE AND MITIGATE RISKS.

WE MAINTAIN STRONG COMMUNICATION ABOUT RISK AND WE HAVE A CULTURE OF COLLABORATION IN

DECISION-MAKING AMONG THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IN MANAGING RISK RESTS WITH THE MANAGERS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS,

WE DEDICATE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES TO INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE A STRONG OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE AND AN APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. WE REGULARLY REINFORCE OUR STRONG CULTURE OF ESCALATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS

ALL DIVISIONS AND FUNCTIONS.

PROCESSES.

WE

MAINTAIN VARIOUS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS OUR DAILY DISCIPLINE OF MARKING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY TO CURRENT MARKET LEVELS. WE CARRY OUR INVENTORY AT FAIR VALUE,

WITH CHANGES IN VALUATION REFLECTED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND IN NET REVENUES. WE DO SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS DISCIPLINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISK AND THAT IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENT AND

REALISTIC INSIGHT INTO OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURES.

WE ALSO APPLY A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK OF LIMITS TO CONTROL RISK ACROSS TRANSACTIONS,

PRODUCTS, BUSINESSES AND MARKETS. THIS INCLUDES APPROVAL OF LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS BY THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING OUR RISK LIMITS FRAMEWORK, SUBJECT

TO THE OVERALL LIMITS APPROVED BY THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, AT A VARIETY OF LEVELS AND MONITORING THESE LIMITS ON A DAILY BASIS. THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE (THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

APPROVING LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS. CERTAIN LIMITS MAY BE SET AT LEVELS THAT WILL REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENT, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK APPETITE. THIS FOSTERS AN ONGOING DIALOGUE ON RISK AMONG

REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS RAPID ESCALATION OF RISK-RELATED MATTERS. SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RISK LIMITS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR POSITIONS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROCESS. PROACTIVE MITIGATION OF OUR

MARKET AND CREDIT EXPOSURES MINIMIZES THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO TAKE OUTSIZED ACTIONS DURING PERIODS OF STRESS.

WE ALSO FOCUS

ON THE RIGOR AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RISK SYSTEMS. THE GOAL OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY IS TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME, WHICH REQUIRES SYSTEMS THAT ARE COMPREHENSIVE, RELIABLE AND TIMELY. WE DEVOTE

SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT IT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES US WITH COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION.

PEOPLE.

EVEN THE BEST TECHNOLOGY SERVES ONLY AS A TOOL

FOR HELPING TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN REAL TIME ABOUT THE RISKS WE ARE TAKING. ULTIMATELY, EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES OUR PEOPLE TO INTERPRET OUR RISK DATA ON AN ONGOING AND TIMELY BASIS AND ADJUST RISK POSITIONS ACCORDINGLY. IN BOTH OUR

REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR PROFESSIONALS, AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NUANCES AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH RISK MEASURE, GUIDE US IN ASSESSING EXPOSURES AND MAINTAINING THEM WITHIN

PRUDENT LEVELS.

WE REINFORCE A CULTURE OF EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IN OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE WAY WE

EVALUATE PERFORMANCE, AND RECOGNIZE AND REWARD OUR PEOPLE. OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN SESSIONS LED BY OUR MOST SENIOR LEADERS, ARE FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RISK MANAGEMENT, CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND REPUTATIONAL

EXCELLENCE. AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW PROCESS, WE ASSESS REPUTATIONAL EXCELLENCE INCLUDING HOW AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISES GOOD RISK MANAGEMENT AND REPUTATIONAL JUDGMENT, AND ADHERES TO OUR CODE OF CONDUCT AND COMPLIANCE POLICIES. OUR

REVIEW AND REWARD PROCESSES ARE DESIGNED TO COMMUNICATE AND REINFORCE TO OUR PROFESSIONALS THE LINK BETWEEN BEHAVIOR AND HOW PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZED, THE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR CLIENTS AND OUR REPUTATION, AND THE NEED TO ALWAYS ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF THE FIRM.

STRUCTURE

ULTIMATE OVERSIGHT OF RISK IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR BOARD. THE BOARD OVERSEES RISK BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS

RISK COMMITTEE. WITHIN THE FIRM, A SERIES OF COMMITTEES WITH SPECIFIC RISK MANAGEMENT MANDATES HAVE OVERSIGHT OR DECISION-MAKING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP GENERALLY CONSISTS OF SENIOR MANAGERS FROM BOTH

OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR THESE COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BARRIERS ARE IN PLACE. OUR PRIMARY RISK COMMITTEES, MOST OF WHICH ALSO HAVE

ADDITIONAL SUB-COMMITTEES OR WORKING GROUPS, ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THESE COMMITTEES, WE HAVE OTHER RISK-ORIENTED COMMITTEES WHICH PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR DIFFERENT BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES, PRODUCTS, REGIONS AND LEGAL ENTITIES. ALL OF OUR

FIRMWIDE, REGIONAL AND DIVISIONAL COMMITTEES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSIDERING THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES WHICH THEY OVERSEE ON OUR REPUTATION.

MEMBERSHIP OF OUR RISK COMMITTEES IS REVIEWED REGULARLY AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

ACCORDINGLY, THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT MEMBERS SERVE ON THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES VARIES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND BASED ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MEMBERS.

IN ADDITION, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, WHICH REPORT TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE PRESIDENTS AND CO-CHIEF OPERATING

OFFICERS, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OR THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAY-TO-DAY OVERSIGHT OR MONITORING OF RISK, AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE CHART BELOW AND AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS. INTERNAL AUDIT, WHICH

REPORTS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AND INCLUDES PROFESSIONALS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF AUDIT AND INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING AND VALIDATING KEY CONTROLS WITHIN THE RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.

CONFLICTS MANAGEMENT

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND OUR APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THEM ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, OUR REPUTATION AND OUR LONG-TERM

COMPLYING WITH OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, IS SHARED BY THE ENTIRE FIRM.

WE HAVE A MULTILAYERED APPROACH TO RESOLVING CONFLICTS AND

ADDRESSING REPUTATIONAL RISK. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT OVERSEES POLICIES RELATED TO CONFLICTS RESOLUTION, AND, IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONFLICTS, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE, THE FIRMWIDE CLIENT AND BUSINESS STANDARDS COMMITTEE, AND OTHER INTERNAL COMMITTEES,

FORMULATES POLICIES, STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES, AND ASSISTS IN MAKING JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION OF PARTICULAR CONFLICTS. RESOLVING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS NECESSARILY DEPENDS ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF A PARTICULAR SITUATION

AND THE APPLICATION OF EXPERIENCED AND INFORMED JUDGMENT.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

LIQUIDITY RISK IS THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO FUND THE FIRM OR MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE EVENT OF FIRM-SPECIFIC, BROADER INDUSTRY,

OR MARKET LIQUIDITY STRESS EVENTS. LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US, AS MOST OF THE FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSERVATIVE

SET OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO FUND THE FIRM AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO SERVE CLIENTS AND GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

TREASURY HAS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING STRATEGY. TREASURY IS INDEPENDENT OF

THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT

FUNCTION RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT OF OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING STRESS TESTING AND LIMIT GOVERNANCE. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND TREASURY, AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF

RISK OFFICER.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

WE MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK ACCORDING TO THREE PRINCIPLES (I) HOLD SUFFICIENT EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF GLOBAL CORE LIQUID ASSETS

(GCLA) TO COVER OUTFLOWS DURING A STRESSED PERIOD, (II) MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND (III) MAINTAIN A VIABLE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.

GLOBAL CORE LIQUID ASSETS.

GCLA IS LIQUIDITY THAT WE

MAINTAIN TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS AND COLLATERAL NEEDS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO PRE-FUND OUR ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD THIS

LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES AND CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR GCLA WOULD BE READILY CONVERTIBLE TO CASH IN A MATTER OF DAYS, THROUGH LIQUIDATION, BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR FROM

MATURITIES OF RESALE AGREEMENTS, AND THAT THIS CASH WOULD ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS.

OUR GCLA REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS SURVIVAL;



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING

FLOWS. OUR BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT;



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED

FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE, AND THE TERMS (E.G., INTEREST RATES, COLLATERAL PROVISIONS AND TENOR) OR AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE; AND



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO PRE-FUND LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE

UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER DEBT BALANCES THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR TOTAL ASSETS

AND OUR FUNDING COSTS.

WE MAINTAIN OUR GCLA ACROSS MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES, ASSET TYPES, AND CLEARING

AGENTS TO PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT OPERATING LIQUIDITY TO ENSURE TIMELY SETTLEMENT IN ALL MAJOR MARKETS, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE GCLA, WE MAINTAIN CASH BALANCES IN SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER ENTITIES, PRIMARILY FOR

USE IN SPECIFIC CURRENCIES, ENTITIES, OR JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR GCLA PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ADVANCE OF POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT.

OUR LIQUIDITY RISK

MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FINANCING, EVEN WHEN FUNDING MARKETS EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT STRESS. WE MANAGE THE MATURITIES AND DIVERSITY OF OUR FUNDING ACROSS MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND SEEK

TO MAINTAIN A LONG-DATED AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR APPROACH TO ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT INCLUDES.



CONSERVATIVELY MANAGING THE OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR FUNDING BOOK, WITH A FOCUS ON MAINTAINING

LONG-TERM, DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDING IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. SEE BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  FUNDING SOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS;



ACTIVELY MANAGING AND MONITORING OUR ASSET BASE, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE LIQUIDITY, HOLDING PERIOD AND

OUR ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS. WE ASSESS OUR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND OUR ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT WHILE APPROPRIATELY MANAGING RISK. THIS ENABLES US TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FUNDING PRODUCTS AND

TENORS. SEE BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT FOR MORE DETAIL ON OUR BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND  FUNDING SOURCES  SECURED FUNDING FOR MORE DETAIL ON ASSET

CLASSES THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS; AND



RAISING SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING THAT HAS A LONG TENOR RELATIVE TO THE LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS.

THIS REDUCES THE RISK THAT OUR LIABILITIES WILL COME DUE IN ADVANCE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS. BECAUSE WE MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET, THE HOLDING PERIOD OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS MAY BE MATERIALLY

SHORTER THAN THEIR CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES.

OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OUR

ASSETS AND MEET OUR CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS IN NORMAL TIMES AS WELL AS DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THROUGH OUR DYNAMIC BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS, WE USE ACTUAL AND PROJECTED ASSET BALANCES TO DETERMINE SECURED AND

UNSECURED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FUNDING PLANS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. IN ADDITION, SENIOR MANAGERS IN OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS REGULARLY ANALYZE, AND THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE

COMMITTEE REVIEWS, OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL CAPITAL POSITION (UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) SO THAT WE MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF LONG-TERM FUNDING THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. IN A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WE WOULD FIRST USE OUR GCLA IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES (OTHER THAN OUR GCLA). HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ORDERLY ASSET SALES MAY BE PRUDENT OR NECESSARY IN A SEVERE OR PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES

THE MAJORITY OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY GROUP INC. WHICH LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED,

TO MEET THEIR ASSET FINANCING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING ARE

ENHANCED CONTROL AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IS ALSO RAISED AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL THROUGH A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SECURED FUNDING, UNSECURED BORROWINGS AND DEPOSITS.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ASSUME THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR, A SUBSIDIARYS FUNDS OR SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE TO

ITS PARENT OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE

ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ASSUME THAT THE CAPITAL PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THE MATURITY OF SUCH FINANCING.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DECEMBER 2016, GROUP INC. HAD $30.09 BILLION OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GS&CO., ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED

BROKER-DEALER; $36.94 BILLION INVESTED IN GSI, A REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER; $2.62 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL), A REGULATED JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER; $26.61 BILLION INVESTED IN GS BANK USA, A REGULATED

NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK; AND $3.77 BILLION INVESTED IN GSIB, A REGULATED U.K. BANK. GROUP INC. ALSO PROVIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, $97.77 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS (INCLUDING SECURED LOANS OF $49.90 BILLION), AND

$19.60 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AND CASH DEPOSITS TO THESE ENTITIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS TO GS&CO., GSI, GSJCL AND GS BANK USA, AS OF DECEMBER 2016. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 2016, GROUP INC. HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

CAPITAL INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.

WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A LIQUIDITY CRISIS SITUATION OR PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. OUR CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN OUTLINES A LIST OF POTENTIAL

RISK FACTORS, KEY REPORTS AND METRICS THAT ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ASSIST IN ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF, AND MANAGING THROUGH, A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND/OR MARKET DISLOCATION. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DESCRIBES IN DETAIL OUR

POTENTIAL RESPONSES IF OUR ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THAT WE HAVE ENTERED A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WHICH INCLUDE PRE-FUNDING FOR WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS AS WELL AS UTILIZING SECONDARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. MITIGANTS

AND ACTION ITEMS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC RISKS WHICH MAY ARISE ARE ALSO DESCRIBED AND ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTION.

THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN IDENTIFIES KEY GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS TO FOSTER EFFECTIVE COORDINATION, CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION,

ALL OF WHICH ARE CRITICAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DETAILS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, WHICH INCLUDE MAKING AND DISSEMINATING KEY DECISIONS, COORDINATING

ALL CONTINGENCY ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS, IMPLEMENTING LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND MANAGING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION.

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE

APPROPRIATE SIZE OF OUR GCLA, WE USE AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, WHICH CAPTURES AND QUANTIFIES OUR LIQUIDITY RISKS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR

POTENTIAL INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL, THE RESULTS OF OUR LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING MODELS, APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF

THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE FIRM. THE RESULTS OF THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, THE INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL AND THE LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON A REGULAR BASIS.

MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.

OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY

OUTFLOW IS BASED ON CONDUCTING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF MARKET-WIDE AND FIRM-SPECIFIC STRESS. THESE SCENARIOS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE FOLLOWING QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS.



SEVERELY CHALLENGED MARKET ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING LOW CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CONFIDENCE, FINANCIAL AND

POLITICAL INSTABILITY, ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DECLINES IN EQUITY MARKETS AND WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS; AND



A FIRM-SPECIFIC CRISIS POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED BY MATERIAL LOSSES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, LITIGATION, EXECUTIVE

DEPARTURE, AND/OR A RATINGS DOWNGRADE.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE CRITICAL MODELING PARAMETERS OF THE MODELED LIQUIDITY

OUTFLOW.



LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A 30-DAY SCENARIO;



A TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF OUR LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT RATINGS;



A COMBINATION OF CONTRACTUAL OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT, AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS

(E.G., ACTIONS THOUGH NOT CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED, WE MAY DEEM NECESSARY IN A CRISIS). WE ASSUME THAT MOST CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS WILL OCCUR WITHIN THE INITIAL DAYS AND WEEKS OF A CRISIS;



NO ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR UNSECURED DEBT;



NO SUPPORT FROM ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACCESS TO VARIOUS CENTRAL BANK

FUNDING PROGRAMS, WE DO NOT ASSUME RELIANCE ON ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS; AND



NO ASSET LIQUIDATION, OTHER THAN THE GCLA.

THE POTENTIAL CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS COVERED IN OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW INCLUDE.

UNSECURED FUNDING



CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND OTHER UNSECURED

FUNDING PRODUCTS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT OR ROLLOVER ANY MATURING DEBT.



CONTINGENT: REPURCHASES OF OUR OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A MARKET MAKER.

DEPOSITS



CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF TERM DEPOSITS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW TERM

DEPOSITS OR ROLLOVER ANY MATURING TERM DEPOSITS.



CONTINGENT: PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS OF DEPOSITS THAT HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE WITHDRAWAL ASSUMPTIONS

REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE TYPE OF DEPOSIT, WHETHER THE DEPOSIT IS INSURED OR UNINSURED, AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPOSITOR.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SECURED FUNDING



CONTRACTUAL: A PORTION OF UPCOMING CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF SECURED FUNDING DUE TO EITHER THE INABILITY TO

REFINANCE OR THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE ONLY AT WIDER HAIRCUTS (I.E., ON TERMS WHICH REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL). OUR ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COUNTERPARTY ROLL PROBABILITIES

(OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE COUNTERPARTYS LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING TO PROVIDE FUNDING ON A SECURED BASIS AT THE MATURITY OF THE TRADE) AND COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION.



CONTINGENT: ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR FINANCING TRANSACTIONS,

WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL POSTINGS UNDER THOSE TRANSACTIONS.

OTC DERIVATIVES



CONTINGENT: COLLATERAL POSTINGS TO COUNTERPARTIES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES,

EXCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE CLEARED AND SETTLED THROUGH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES (OTC-CLEARED).



CONTINGENT: OTHER OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL RELATED TO OTC DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING OTC-CLEARED, INCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF TRADE TERMINATIONS, COLLATERAL SUBSTITUTIONS, COLLATERAL DISPUTES, LOSS OF REHYPOTHECATION RIGHTS, COLLATERAL CALLS OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY A TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, AND COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN

CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES



CONTINGENT: VARIATION MARGIN POSTINGS REQUIRED DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING

EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES.



CONTINGENT: AN INCREASE IN INITIAL MARGIN AND GUARANTY FUND REQUIREMENTS BY DERIVATIVE CLEARING HOUSES.

CUSTOMER CASH AND SECURITIES



CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRIME BROKERAGE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WITHDRAWALS OF CUSTOMER

CREDIT BALANCES, AND A REDUCTION IN CUSTOMER SHORT POSITIONS, WHICH MAY SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.

FIRM SECURITIES



CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION OR COMPOSITION CHANGE IN FIRM SHORT POSITIONS,

WHICH MAY SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS



CONTINGENT: DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. DRAW ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE OF

COMMITMENT AND COUNTERPARTY.

OTHER



OTHER UPCOMING LARGE CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS TAX PAYMENTS.

INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL.

OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL

MEASURES OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS USING A SCENARIO ANALYSIS CHARACTERIZED BY THE SAME QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS AS OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW. THE MODEL ASSESSES THE RISK OF INCREASED INTRADAY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS DURING A SCENARIO WHERE ACCESS

TO SOURCES OF INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MAY BECOME CONSTRAINED.

THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY MODELING ELEMENTS OF THE INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL.



LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A ONE-DAY SETTLEMENT PERIOD;



DELAYS IN RECEIPT OF COUNTERPARTY CASH PAYMENTS;



A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF INTRADAY CREDIT LINES AT OUR THIRD-PARTY CLEARING AGENTS; AND



HIGHER SETTLEMENT VOLUMES DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY.

LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING.

WE UTILIZE A LONGER-TERM

STRESS TEST TO TAKE A FORWARD VIEW ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THROUGH A PROLONGED STRESS PERIOD IN WHICH WE EXPERIENCE A SEVERE LIQUIDITY STRESS AND RECOVER IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGING. WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING CONSERVATIVE

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT TO PREPARE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF POTENTIAL STRESS, SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LONG-DATED AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS.

WE ALSO PERFORM STRESS TESTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC

OR PRODUCT-SPECIFIC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.

MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION

TREASURY REGULARLY REFINES OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL AND OUR OTHER STRESS TESTING MODELS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN

MARKET OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUR BUSINESS MIX. ANY CHANGES, INCLUDING MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE ASSESSED AND APPROVED BY LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT.

MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF OUR LIQUIDITY MODELS. SEE MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF THESE MODELS.

LIMITS

WE USE LIQUIDITY LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND ACROSS LIQUIDITY RISK TYPES TO MANAGE THE SIZE OF OUR LIQUIDITY EXPOSURES. LIMITS ARE MEASURED

RELATIVE TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF RISK GIVEN OUR LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRMWIDE LIMITS IS TO ASSIST SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN MONITORING AND CONTROLLING OUR OVERALL LIQUIDITY PROFILE.

THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AND THE FIRMWIDE FINANCE COMMITTEE APPROVE LIQUIDITY RISK LIMITS AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL. LIMITS ARE REVIEWED

FREQUENTLY AND AMENDED, WITH REQUIRED APPROVALS, ON A PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE, TO REFLECT CHANGING MARKET OR BUSINESS CONDITIONS.

OUR LIQUIDITY RISK LIMITS ARE MONITORED BY TREASURY AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT. TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING, ON A

TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.

GCLA AND UNENCUMBERED METRICS

GCLA.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNAL LIQUIDITY

RISK MODELS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS OUR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR POTENTIAL INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE FIRM,

WE BELIEVE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015 WAS APPROPRIATE. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES AND CERTAIN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS INCLUDED IN OUR GCLA

TOTALED $226.07 BILLION AND $199.12 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN OUR GCLA FROM DECEMBER 2015 TO DECEMBER 2016 IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF GE CAPITAL BANKS ONLINE DEPOSIT PLATFORM IN

APRIL 2016. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ACQUISITION. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR GCLA AVERAGED $211.10 BILLION AND $187.75 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2016 AND

DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED GCLA IS COMPOSED OF ONLY UNENCUMBERED GERMAN, FRENCH, JAPANESE AND U.K. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS IN HIGHLY LIQUID CURRENCIES. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR GCLA TO THIS NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF

SECURITIES AND CASH BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN OUR GCLA, SUCH AS LESS LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.

OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS.

IN ADDITION TO OUR GCLA, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED CASH AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTHER GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS,

MARGINABLE EQUITIES, LOANS AND CASH DEPOSITS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR GCLA. BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2016, TO BE CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT VIEWS UNENCUMBERED ASSETS, WE INCLUDED CERTAIN LOANS WITHIN OUR UNENCUMBERED

ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AVERAGED $142.33 BILLION AND $90.36 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY. HAD THESE LOANS BEEN INCLUDED AS OF DECEMBER 2015, THE FAIR

VALUE OF OUR UNENCUMBERED ASSETS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $44.45 BILLION. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THESE ASSETS LIQUID ENOUGH TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR GCLA.

LIQUIDITY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

THE FINAL RULES ON

MINIMUM LIQUIDITY STANDARDS APPROVED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES CALL FOR A LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR) DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT BANKING ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS (HQLA)

BASED ON EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER AN ACUTE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. OUR GCLA IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME IN COMPOSITION AS THE ASSETS THAT QUALIFY AS HQLA UNDER THESE RULES.

THE LCR BECAME EFFECTIVE IN THE U.S. ON JANUARY 1, 2015, WITH A PHASE-IN PERIOD WHEREBY FIRMS HAD AN 80% MINIMUM IN 2015, WHICH

INCREASED BY 10% PER YEAR UNTIL 2017. IN DECEMBER 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS BEGINNING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, LCR AVERAGES OVER THE

QUARTER, QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE LCR CALCULATION AND PROJECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 2016, OUR AVERAGE LCR EXCEEDED THE FULLY PHASED-IN MINIMUM REQUIREMENT, BASED ON

OUR INTERPRETATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINALIZED FRAMEWORK, WHICH MAY EVOLVE AS WE REVIEW OUR INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION WITH OUR REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED A

PROPOSED RULE THAT CALLS FOR A NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR) FOR LARGE U.S. BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO STABLE FUNDING OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THE PROPOSED NSFR

REQUIREMENT HAS AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2018, INCLUDING QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE OF THE RATIO, AS WELL AS A DESCRIPTION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS STABLE FUNDING SOURCES. BASED ON OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL, WE

ESTIMATE THAT AS OF DECEMBER 2016, OUR NSFR WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT; HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE REQUIREMENT BY THE EFFECTIVE DATE.

THE FOLLOWING IS INFORMATION ON OUR SUBSIDIARY LIQUIDITY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.



GS BANK USA.

GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM LIQUIDITY

STANDARDS UNDER THE LCR RULE APPROVED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015, WITH THE SAME PHASE-IN THROUGH 2017 DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES PROPOSED RULE

ON THE NSFR DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD ALSO APPLY TO GS BANK USA.



GSI.

THE LCR RULE ISSUED BY THE U.K. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

BECAME EFFECTIVE IN THE U.K. ON OCTOBER 1, 2015, WITH A PHASE-IN PERIOD WHEREBY CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GSI, WERE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN 80% MINIMUM RATIO INITIALLY, INCREASING TO 90% ON JANUARY 1, 2017 AND 100% ON

JANUARY 1, 2018.



OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.

WE MONITOR THE LOCAL REGULATORY LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. FOR MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, THESE REQUIREMENTS EITHER HAVE CHANGED OR ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL COMMITTEES FRAMEWORK FOR LIQUIDITY RISK

MEASUREMENT, STANDARDS AND MONITORING, AS WELL AS OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES, AND

ANY AMENDMENTS ADOPTED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE.

OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES;



THE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY OF OUR EARNINGS;



OUR CAPITAL BASE;

THE EXTERNAL OPERATING AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE ASSUMED LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT

SUPPORT OR OTHER SYSTEMIC CONSIDERATIONS, SUCH AS POTENTIAL RESOLUTION.

CERTAIN OF OUR DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSACTED

UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHO MAY REQUIRE US TO POST COLLATERAL OR TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS BASED ON CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS. WE ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THESE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS BY DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL OR

TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT WOULD OCCUR ASSUMING A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. A DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF US AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE

TO THE IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES. WE MANAGE OUR GCLA TO ENSURE WE WOULD, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL REQUIREMENTS, BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A TWO-NOTCH

REDUCTION IN OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

CASH FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE

BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE LIQUIDITY AND ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO

TRENDS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESSES.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $28.27 BILLION TO $121.71 BILLION AT THE END OF 2016. WE GENERATED $9.27 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FROM NET CASH ACQUIRED

IN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS. WE GENERATED $19.00 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FROM INCREASES IN DEPOSITS AND FROM NET ISSUANCES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REPURCHASES

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2015.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $18.41 BILLION TO $93.44 BILLION AT THE END OF 2015. WE USED $18.57 BILLION IN NET CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY DUE TO FUNDING OF LOANS

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE

VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS. WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES, EACH DESCRIBED IN THE RESPECTIVE SECTIONS BELOW, TO MONITOR MARKET RISK. WE HOLD

INVENTORY PRIMARILY FOR MARKET MAKING FOR OUR CLIENTS AND FOR OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. OUR INVENTORY THEREFORE CHANGES BASED ON CLIENT DEMANDS AND OUR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OUR INVENTORY IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE

FLUCTUATES ON A DAILY BASIS, WITH THE RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS. CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



INTEREST RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF YIELD CURVES, THE

VOLATILITIES OF INTEREST RATES, MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND CREDIT SPREADS;



EQUITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES,

BASKETS OF EQUITIES AND EQUITY INDICES;



CURRENCY RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF

CURRENCY RATES; AND



COMMODITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF

COMMODITIES, SUCH AS CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRICITY, AND PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR MARKET RISK. WE MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS THROUGH STRONG FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT

AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

DISCUSS MARKET INFORMATION, POSITIONS AND ESTIMATED RISK AND LOSS SCENARIOS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANAGING RISK WITHIN PRESCRIBED LIMITS. THESE MANAGERS HAVE IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR

POSITIONS, MARKETS AND THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO HEDGE THEIR EXPOSURES.

RISK MEASURES

MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT PRODUCES RISK MEASURES AND MONITORS THEM AGAINST ESTABLISHED MARKET RISK LIMITS. THESE MEASURES REFLECT AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SCENARIOS AND THE RESULTS ARE AGGREGATED AT PRODUCT, BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE LEVELS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVES OVER BOTH SHORT-TERM

AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS. OUR PRIMARY RISK MEASURES ARE VAR, WHICH IS USED FOR SHORTER-TERM PERIODS, AND STRESS TESTS. OUR RISK REPORTS DETAIL KEY RISKS, DRIVERS AND CHANGES FOR EACH DESK AND BUSINESS, AND ARE DISTRIBUTED DAILY TO SENIOR

MANAGEMENT OF BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS.

VALUE-AT-RISK.

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE DUE

TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN VAR, SEE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINKAGES TO MARKET RISK MEASURES. WE TYPICALLY EMPLOY A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON

WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. WE USE A SINGLE VAR MODEL WHICH CAPTURES RISKS INCLUDING INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS SUCH, VAR FACILITATES COMPARISON ACROSS PORTFOLIOS OF DIFFERENT RISK CHARACTERISTICS. VAR

ALSO CAPTURES THE DIVERSIFICATION OF AGGREGATED RISK AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL.

WE ARE AWARE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR AND

THEREFORE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES IN OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR INCLUDE.



VAR DOES NOT ESTIMATE POTENTIAL LOSSES OVER LONGER TIME HORIZONS WHERE MOVES MAY BE EXTREME;



VAR DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIVE LIQUIDITY OF DIFFERENT RISK POSITIONS; AND



PREVIOUS MOVES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF ALL FUTURE MARKET MOVES.

WHEN CALCULATING VAR, WE USE HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS WITH FULL VALUATION OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000

MARKET FACTORS. VAR IS CALCULATED AT A POSITION LEVEL BASED ON SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOCKING THE RELEVANT MARKET RISK FACTORS FOR THAT POSITION. WE SAMPLE FROM FIVE YEARS OF HISTORICAL DATA TO GENERATE THE SCENARIOS FOR OUR VAR CALCULATION. THE HISTORICAL

DATA IS WEIGHTED SO THAT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA REDUCES OVER TIME. THIS GIVES GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTS CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WHICH IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL LOSS. AS A

RESULT, EVEN IF OUR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR WERE UNCHANGED, OUR VAR WOULD INCREASE WITH INCREASING MARKET VOLATILITY AND VICE VERSA.

GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL

CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR VAR MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE.



POSITIONS THAT ARE BEST MEASURED AND MONITORED USING SENSITIVITY MEASURES; AND



THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR OWN

CREDIT SPREADS ON UNSECURED BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED.

WE PERFORM DAILY BACKTESTING OF OUR

VAR MODEL (I.E., COMPARING DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES TO THE VAR MEASURE CALCULATED AS OF THE PRIOR BUSINESS DAY) AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL AND FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND MAJOR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

STRESS TESTING.

STRESS TESTING IS A METHOD OF

DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL STRESS SCENARIOS ON THE FIRM. WE USE STRESS TESTING TO EXAMINE RISKS OF SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES ACROSS THE FIRM. WE USE A VARIETY OF STRESS

TESTING TECHNIQUES TO CALCULATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF MARKET MOVES ON OUR PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, SCENARIO ANALYSIS AND FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. THE RESULTS OF OUR VARIOUS STRESS TESTS ARE ANALYZED TOGETHER FOR

RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A MARKET MOVE IN A SINGLE RISK FACTOR ACROSS ALL

POSITIONS (E.G., EQUITY PRICES OR CREDIT SPREADS) USING A VARIETY OF DEFINED MARKET SHOCKS, RANGING FROM THOSE THAT COULD BE EXPECTED OVER A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON UP TO THOSE THAT COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS TO OCCUR. WE ALSO USE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO

QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANY SINGLE ENTITY, WHICH CAPTURES THE RISK OF LARGE OR CONCENTRATED EXPOSURES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SCENARIO ANALYSIS IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A SPECIFIED EVENT, INCLUDING HOW THE EVENT

IMPACTS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS SIMULTANEOUSLY. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR SOVEREIGN STRESS TESTING WE CALCULATE POTENTIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOVEREIGN INVENTORY AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING DEBT, EQUITY AND CURRENCY EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH

OUR NON-SOVEREIGN INVENTORY THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE SOVEREIGN DISTRESS. WHEN CONDUCTING SCENARIO ANALYSIS, WE TYPICALLY CONSIDER A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR EACH SCENARIO, RANGING FROM MODERATE TO SEVERELY ADVERSE MARKET IMPACTS. IN

ADDITION, THESE STRESS TESTS ARE CONSTRUCTED USING BOTH HISTORICAL EVENTS AND FORWARD-LOOKING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS.

FIRMWIDE STRESS

TESTING COMBINES MARKET, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL AND LIQUIDITY RISKS INTO A SINGLE COMBINED SCENARIO. FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS ARE PRIMARILY USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS; HOWEVER, WE ALSO ENSURE

THAT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTING IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. THIS INCLUDES SELECTING APPROPRIATE SCENARIOS TO USE FOR OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS. SEE EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY

CAPITAL  EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ABOVE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

UNLIKE VAR MEASURES, WHICH HAVE AN IMPLIED PROBABILITY

BECAUSE THEY ARE CALCULATED AT A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THERE IS GENERALLY NO IMPLIED PROBABILITY THAT OUR STRESS TEST SCENARIOS WILL OCCUR. INSTEAD, STRESS TESTS ARE USED TO MODEL BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MOVES IN UNDERLYING MARKET

FACTORS. WHEN ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS, WE GENERALLY ASSUME THAT OUR POSITIONS CANNOT BE REDUCED OR HEDGED (ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO DO SO).

STRESS TEST SCENARIOS ARE CONDUCTED ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO

MARKET EVENTS OR CONCERNS. STRESS TESTING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO QUANTIFY OUR EXPOSURE TO TAIL RISKS, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, UNDERTAKE RISK/REWARD ANALYSIS, AND ASSESS AND

MITIGATE OUR RISK POSITIONS.

LIMITS.

WE USE RISK

LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS (INCLUDING FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT) TO GOVERN RISK APPETITE BY CONTROLLING THE SIZE OF OUR EXPOSURES TO MARKET RISK. LIMITS ARE SET BASED ON VAR AND ON A RANGE OF STRESS TESTS RELEVANT TO OUR EXPOSURES. LIMITS ARE

REVIEWED FREQUENTLY AND AMENDED ON A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BASIS TO REFLECT CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR TOLERANCE FOR RISK.

THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE (THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY

FROM THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE) APPROVE MARKET RISK LIMITS AND SUB-LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS, CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK APPETITE. IN ADDITION, MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT (THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE RISK GOVERNANCE

COMMITTEE) SETS MARKET RISK LIMITS AND SUB-LIMITS AT CERTAIN PRODUCT AND DESK LEVELS.

THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRMWIDE LIMITS IS TO ASSIST

SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN CONTROLLING OUR OVERALL RISK PROFILE. SUB-LIMITS ARE SET BELOW THE APPROVED LEVEL OF RISK LIMITS. SUB-LIMITS SET THE DESIRED MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE THAT MAY BE MANAGED BY ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS WITHOUT

ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, EFFECTIVELY LEAVING DAY-TO-DAY DECISIONS TO INDIVIDUAL DESK MANAGERS AND TRADERS. ACCORDINGLY, SUB-LIMITS ARE A MANAGEMENT TOOL DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE ESCALATION RATHER THAN TO ESTABLISH

MAXIMUM RISK TOLERANCE. SUB-LIMITS ALSO DISTRIBUTE RISK AMONG VARIOUS BUSINESSES IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR LEVEL OF ACTIVITY AND CLIENT DEMAND, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF EACH AREA.

OUR MARKET RISK LIMITS ARE MONITORED DAILY BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING, ON A TIMELY BASIS,

INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.

WHEN A RISK LIMIT HAS BEEN EXCEEDED (E.G., DUE TO POSITIONAL CHANGES OR CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED VOLATILITIES OR CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS), IT IS ESCALATED TO SENIOR MANAGERS IN MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE. SUCH INSTANCES ARE REMEDIATED BY AN INVENTORY REDUCTION AND/OR A TEMPORARY OR

PERMANENT INCREASE TO THE RISK LIMIT.

MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION

OUR VAR AND STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND ENHANCED IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE CHANGES IN THE

COMPOSITION OF POSITIONS INCLUDED IN OUR MARKET RISK MEASURES, AS WELL AS VARIATIONS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND/OR MODELS, MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PERFORMS MODEL VALIDATIONS. SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES TO OUR VAR AND STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED WITH OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

SEE MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF THESE MODELS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE CHART BELOW REFLECTS OUR DAILY VAR OVER THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS.

THE CHART BELOW PRESENTS THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF OUR DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR FOR 2016.

DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES ARE COMPARED WITH VAR CALCULATED AS OF THE END OF THE PRIOR BUSINESS DAY. TRADING

LOSSES INCURRED ON A SINGLE DAY DID NOT EXCEED OUR 95% ONE-DAY VAR DURING 2016 AND 2015 (I.E., A VAR EXCEPTION) AND EXCEEDED OUR 95% ONE-DAY VAR ON ONE OCCASION DURING 2014.

DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE NET REVENUE DAYS THAN NET REVENUE LOSS DAYS, WE EXPECT TO HAVE FEWER VAR EXCEPTIONS

BECAUSE, UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY PRODUCES POSITIVE NET REVENUES. IN PERIODS IN WHICH OUR FRANCHISE REVENUES ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WE GENERALLY HAVE MORE LOSS DAYS, RESULTING IN MORE VAR EXCEPTIONS. THE DAILY

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES USED TO DETERMINE VAR EXCEPTIONS REFLECT THE IMPACT OF ANY INTRADAY ACTIVITY, INCLUDING BID/OFFER NET REVENUES, WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE POSITIVE BY THEIR NATURE.

SENSITIVITY MEASURES

CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS AND INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN VAR BECAUSE VAR IS NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE RISK MEASURE. OTHER SENSITIVITY

MEASURES WE USE TO ANALYZE MARKET RISK ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

10% SENSITIVITY MEASURES.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS MARKET RISK FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN VAR. THE MARKET RISK OF THESE POSITIONS IS DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES OF A 10% DECLINE IN THE

OVERVIEW

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR

LOSS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY OF A COUNTERPARTY (E.G., AN OTC DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY OR A BORROWER) OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK COMES MOSTLY FROM CLIENT

TRANSACTIONS IN OTC DERIVATIVES AND LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. CREDIT RISK ALSO COMES FROM CASH PLACED WITH BANKS, SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS (I.E., RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES) AND

RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS, CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR

CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE ESTABLISH AND REVIEW CREDIT POLICIES AND PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD OTHER POSITIONS

THAT GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK (E.G., BONDS HELD IN OUR INVENTORY AND SECONDARY BANK LOANS). THESE CREDIT RISKS ARE CAPTURED AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK MEASURES, WHICH ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

INVENTORY POSITIONS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. SUCH DERIVATIVES ALSO GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS MONITORED AND MANAGED BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT

OF CREDIT RISK REQUIRES ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION, A HIGH LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF CUSTOMERS, COUNTRIES, INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS. OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING CREDIT RISK INCLUDES.



APPROVING TRANSACTIONS AND SETTING AND COMMUNICATING CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;



ESTABLISHING OR APPROVING UNDERWRITING STANDARDS;



MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;



ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A COUNTERPARTY WILL DEFAULT ON ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS;



MEASURING OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT;



REPORTING OF CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD AND REGULATORS;



USING CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS, INCLUDING COLLATERAL AND HEDGING; AND



COMMUNICATING AND COLLABORATING WITH OTHER INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS SUCH AS OPERATIONS, LEGAL

AND COMPLIANCE.

AS PART OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS, CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PERFORMS CREDIT REVIEWS, WHICH INCLUDE

INITIAL AND ONGOING ANALYSES OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES. FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, THE CORE OF OUR PROCESS IS AN ANNUAL COUNTERPARTY CREDIT REVIEW. A CREDIT REVIEW IS AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS OF A

COUNTERPARTY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, RESULTING IN AN INTERNAL CREDIT RATING. THE DETERMINATION OF INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS ALSO INCORPORATES ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATURE OF AND OUTLOOK FOR THE COUNTERPARTYS INDUSTRY, AND

THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. SENIOR PERSONNEL WITHIN CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, WITH EXPERTISE IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, INSPECT AND APPROVE CREDIT REVIEWS AND INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS.

OUR RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS MAY ALSO INCLUDE, WHERE APPLICABLE, REVIEWING CERTAIN KEY METRICS,

SUCH AS DELINQUENCY STATUS, COLLATERAL VALUES, CREDIT SCORES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.

OUR GLOBAL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CAPTURE

CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES (ECONOMIC GROUPS). THESE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON OUR AGGREGATE CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT, INTERNAL

CREDIT RATING, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND REGION.

RISK MEASURES AND LIMITS

WE MEASURE OUR CREDIT RISK BASED ON THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NON-PAYMENT BY A COUNTERPARTY USING CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. FOR

DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, CURRENT EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PRESENTLY OWED TO US AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT APPLICABLE NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS WHILE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE REPRESENTS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE

EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, THE PRIMARY

MEASURE IS A FUNCTION OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE POSITION.

WE USE CREDIT LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS (E.G., COUNTERPARTY, ECONOMIC GROUP,

INDUSTRY AND COUNTRY) AS WELL AS UNDERWRITING STANDARDS TO CONTROL THE SIZE AND NATURE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES. LIMITS FOR COUNTERPARTIES AND ECONOMIC GROUPS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND REVISED TO REFLECT CHANGING RISK APPETITES FOR A GIVEN

COUNTERPARTY OR GROUP OF COUNTERPARTIES. LIMITS FOR INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES ARE BASED ON OUR RISK TOLERANCE AND ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR REGULAR MONITORING, REVIEW, ESCALATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS. THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE

BOARD AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE (THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE) APPROVE CREDIT RISK LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT (THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE RISK GOVERNANCE

COMMITTEE) SETS CREDIT LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES, ECONOMIC GROUPS, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES. POLICIES AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE, THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE CREDIT POLICY COMMITTEE PRESCRIBE THE LEVEL OF FORMAL

APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR US TO ASSUME CREDIT EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY ACROSS ALL PRODUCT AREAS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY APPLICABLE NETTING PROVISIONS, COLLATERAL OR OTHER CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS.

STRESS TESTS

WE USE REGULAR STRESS TESTS TO CALCULATE THE CREDIT EXPOSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING SHOCKS TO

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS OR CREDIT RISK FACTORS (E.G., CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES). THESE SHOCKS INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVEMENTS. SOME OF OUR STRESS TESTS INCLUDE SHOCKS TO MULTIPLE RISK

FACTORS, CONSISTENT WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF A SEVERE MARKET OR ECONOMIC EVENT. IN THE CASE OF SOVEREIGN DEFAULT, WE ESTIMATE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT ON OUR SOVEREIGN CREDIT EXPOSURES, CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARISING FROM POTENTIAL

MARKET MOVES IN RESPONSE TO THE DEFAULT, AND THE IMPACT OF CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SOVEREIGN DEFAULT. UNLIKE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, WHICH IS CALCULATED WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE

LEVEL, WITH A STRESS TEST THERE IS GENERALLY NO ASSUMED PROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING.

WE PERFORM STRESS TESTS ON A REGULAR BASIS

AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET DEVELOPMENTS. STRESS TESTS ARE CONDUCTED JOINTLY WITH OUR MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK FUNCTIONS.

MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION

OUR POTENTIAL CREDIT

EXPOSURE AND STRESS TESTING MODELS, AND ANY CHANGES TO SUCH MODELS OR ASSUMPTIONS, ARE REVIEWED BY MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT. SEE MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF THESE MODELS.

RISK MITIGANTS

TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ON

DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY ENTER INTO NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. WE MAY ALSO REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH COUNTERPARTIES BY ENTERING

INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM THEM ON AN UPFRONT OR CONTINGENT BASIS AND/OR TO TERMINATE TRANSACTIONS IF THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT RATING FALLS BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL. WE MONITOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL ON A

DAILY BASIS TO ENSURE THAT OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE APPROPRIATELY COLLATERALIZED. WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURES WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES AND THE MARKET VALUE OF COLLATERAL

WE RECEIVE.

FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE BORROWER AND OTHER

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL RISK MITIGANTS. RISK MITIGANTS INCLUDE COLLATERAL PROVISIONS, GUARANTEES, COVENANTS, STRUCTURAL SENIORITY OF THE BANK LOAN CLAIMS AND, FOR CERTAIN LENDING COMMITMENTS, PROVISIONS

IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION THAT ALLOW US TO ADJUST LOAN AMOUNTS, PRICING, STRUCTURE AND OTHER TERMS AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE TYPE AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MITIGANTS EMPLOYED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK INVOLVED IN A

LOAN OR LENDING COMMITMENT.

WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT VISIBILITY INTO A COUNTERPARTYS FINANCIAL STRENGTH OR WHEN WE BELIEVE A

COUNTERPARTY REQUIRES SUPPORT FROM ITS PARENT, WE MAY OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS. WE MAY ALSO MITIGATE OUR CREDIT RISK USING CREDIT DERIVATIVES OR PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.

CREDIT EXPOSURES

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, OUR

CREDIT EXPOSURES INCREASED AS COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2015, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CASH DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS. THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARISING FROM NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE COUNTERPARTIES (BASED ON OUR INTERNALLY

DETERMINED PUBLIC RATING AGENCY EQUIVALENTS) DECREASED AS COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2015, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO CASH DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS AND A DECREASE IN NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE LOANS AND

LENDING COMMITMENTS. DURING 2016, THE NUMBER OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTS INCREASED AS COMPARED WITH 2015 AND SUCH DEFAULTS PRIMARILY OCCURRED WITHIN LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTS REMAINED LOW, REPRESENTING

LESS THAN 0.5% OF ALL COUNTERPARTIES. ESTIMATED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTS WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2015 AND WERE NOT MATERIAL. OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARISES FROM OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH, AND INCLUDES BOTH INTEREST-BEARING AND NON-INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS. TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CREDIT LOSS, WE PLACE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DEPOSITS WITH HIGHLY-RATED BANKS AND CENTRAL BANKS.

UNRESTRICTED CASH WAS $107.06 BILLION AND $75.11 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY, AND EXCLUDES CASH SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES OF $14.65 BILLION AND $18.33 BILLION AS OF

OTC DERIVATIVES.

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON OTC DERIVATIVES ARISES PRIMARILY FROM OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. AS A MARKET MAKER, WE ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER

AND HEDGING OF THEIR RISKS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. WE MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON OTC DERIVATIVES USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES, LIMITS AND RISK MITIGANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR A GIVEN

COUNTERPARTY) WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED OR POSTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS. WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO OTC

DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS UNDER BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE THE DAILY EXCHANGE OF COLLATERAL. AS CREDIT RISK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF FAIR VALUE, WE INCLUDE A CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA) IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES

TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CVA IS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED EXPOSURE, THE PROBABILITY OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT AND THE ASSUMED RECOVERY UPON DEFAULT.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR EXPOSURE TO OTC DERIVATIVES BY TENOR, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE EFFECT OF COLLATERAL AND

NETTING AGREEMENTS.

LENDING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

WE MANAGE OUR LENDING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES, LIMITS AND RISK MITIGANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. OTHER LENDING POSITIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY TRADING POSITIONS, ARE RISK-MANAGED

AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK.



LENDING ACTIVITIES.

OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE LENDING TO

INVESTMENT-GRADE AND NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE BORROWERS. LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES ARE PRINCIPALLY USED FOR OPERATING LIQUIDITY AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES OR IN CONNECTION WITH CONTINGENT ACQUISITIONS.

CORPORATE LOANS MAY BE SECURED OR UNSECURED, DEPENDING ON THE LOAN PURPOSE, THE RISK PROFILE OF THE BORROWER AND OTHER FACTORS. OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDE EXTENDING LOANS TO BORROWERS THAT ARE SECURED BY COMMERCIAL AND OTHER REAL ESTATE.

SEE THE TABLES BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LENDING ACTIVITIES.



SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

WE ENTER INTO SECURITIES

FINANCING TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATE CLIENT ACTIVITIES, INVEST EXCESS CASH, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND FINANCE CERTAIN FIRM ACTIVITIES. WE BEAR CREDIT RISK RELATED TO RESALE AGREEMENTS AND

SECURITIES BORROWED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT CASH ADVANCED OR THE VALUE OF SECURITIES PLEDGED OR DELIVERED TO THE COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED. WE ALSO HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE ON REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LOANED

TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALUE OF SECURITIES PLEDGED OR DELIVERED TO THE COUNTERPARTY FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF CASH OR COLLATERAL RECEIVED. SECURITIES COLLATERAL OBTAINED FOR SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY INCLUDES

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $29 BILLION AND $27 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY, OF CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO

SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS REFLECTING BOTH NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL THAT MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS WHEN DETERMINING CREDIT RISK. AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO

SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WAS WITH INVESTMENT-GRADE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, FUNDS AND GOVERNMENTS, PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE AMERICAS AND EMEA.



OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK FROM OUR

RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF INITIAL MARGIN PLACED WITH CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND RECEIVABLES

RELATED TO SALES OF SECURITIES WHICH HAVE TRADED, BUT NOT YET SETTLED. THESE RECEIVABLES GENERALLY HAVE MINIMAL CREDIT RISK DUE TO THE LOW PROBABILITY OF CLEARING ORGANIZATION DEFAULT AND THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SECURITIES

SETTLEMENTS. RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF COLLATERALIZED RECEIVABLES RELATED TO CUSTOMER SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND GENERALLY HAVE MINIMAL CREDIT RISK DUE TO BOTH THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND

THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE RECEIVABLES. OUR NET CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $31 BILLION AND $33 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY, AND WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF

INITIAL MARGIN (BOTH CASH AND SECURITIES) PLACED WITH INVESTMENT-GRADE CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS. THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN OF OUR NET CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY 44% AND 44% IN THE AMERICAS, APPROXIMATELY 42% AND 45% IN

EMEA, AND APPROXIMATELY 14% AND 11% IN ASIA AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND OTHER LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS TO OUR PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT CLIENTS THAT ARE PRIMARILY

SECURED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS. WE ALSO PURCHASE PERFORMING AND DISTRESSED LOANS BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CONSUMER LOANS. THE GROSS EXPOSURE RELATED TO SUCH LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS WAS APPROXIMATELY

$28 BILLION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015. THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN OF OUR NET CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY 90% AND 84% IN THE AMERICAS, APPROXIMATELY 8% AND 14% IN EMEA, AND APPROXIMATELY

2% AND 2% IN ASIA AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED AGAINST SUCH LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS GENERALLY EXCEEDED THE GROSS CARRYING AMOUNT AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2016 AND

DECEMBER 2015.

EVENTS AND BROAD MARKET CONCERNS. CREDIT EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY OF A COUNTERPARTY OR BORROWER. MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS IN VALUE OF OUR LONG AND SHORT

INVENTORY DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES.

CURRENT LEVELS OF OIL PRICES CONTINUE TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT VENEZUELA AND NIGERIA, AND THEIR

SOVEREIGN DEBT. THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRAQ HAS LED TO ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT ITS ECONOMIC STABILITY. THE DEBT CRISIS IN MOZAMBIQUE HAS RESULTED IN THE SUSPENSION OF ITS FUNDING BY THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE WORLD BANK, AS WELL AS

CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY TRADING RESTRICTIONS IN MALAYSIA HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER RESTRICTIONS.

OUR TOTAL CREDIT AND MARKET EXPOSURE TO EACH OF IRAQ, VENEZUELA, NIGERIA, MOZAMBIQUE AND MALAYSIA AS OF DECEMBER 2016 WAS NOT MATERIAL.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND ASSESS OUR COUNTRY EXPOSURES AND TO

DETERMINE OUR RISK APPETITE. WE DETERMINE THE COUNTRY OF RISK BY THE LOCATION OF THE COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR UNDERLIERS ASSETS, WHERE THEY GENERATE REVENUE, THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE HEADQUARTERED, THE JURISDICTION WHERE A CLAIM AGAINST

THEM COULD BE ENFORCED, AND/OR THE GOVERNMENT WHOSE POLICIES AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY THEIR OBLIGATIONS. WE MONITOR OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO A SPECIFIC COUNTRY BOTH AT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY LEVEL AS WELL AS AT THE AGGREGATE COUNTRY LEVEL.

WE USE REGULAR STRESS TESTS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO CALCULATE THE CREDIT EXPOSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

APPLYING SHOCKS TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS OR CREDIT RISK FACTORS. TO SUPPLEMENT THESE REGULAR STRESS TESTS, WE ALSO CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS THAT WE DEEM SIGNIFICANT. THESE STRESS

TESTS ARE DESIGNED TO ESTIMATE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE EVENT ON OUR CREDIT AND MARKET EXPOSURES RESULTING FROM SHOCKS TO RISK FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, AND EQUITY PRICES. WE ALSO UTILIZE THESE STRESS

TESTS TO ESTIMATE THE INDIRECT IMPACT OF CERTAIN HYPOTHETICAL EVENTS ON OUR COUNTRY EXPOSURES, SUCH AS THE IMPACT OF CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ALONG WITH THE SHOCKS TO THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE

PARAMETERS OF THESE SHOCKS VARY BASED ON THE SCENARIO REFLECTED IN EACH STRESS TEST. WE REVIEW ESTIMATED LOSSES PRODUCED BY THE STRESS TESTS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MAGNITUDE, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR

EXPOSURES WHERE NECESSARY.

SEE STRESS TESTS ABOVE, LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS

AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

 STRESS TESTING FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT STRESS TESTS.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS

RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK ARISES FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS AS WELL AS EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENTS, SUCH AS MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILURES OR LEGAL

AND REGULATORY MATTERS.

POTENTIAL TYPES OF LOSS EVENTS RELATED TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDE.



CLIENTS, PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES;



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT;



BUSINESS DISRUPTION AND SYSTEM FAILURES;



EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND WORKPLACE SAFETY;



DAMAGE TO PHYSICAL ASSETS;



INTERNAL FRAUD; AND



EXTERNAL FRAUD.

WE MAINTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A WELL-CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL RISKS. THE FIRMWIDE

OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK POLICIES AND FRAMEWORK. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS A RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, REPORTS

TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES, METHODOLOGIES AND A FORMALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT WITH THE GOAL OF MINIMIZING OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

MANAGING

OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION AS WELL AS A STRONG CONTROL CULTURE. WE SEEK TO MANAGE OUR OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH.



TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE;



ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING OUR KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS;



INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS THAT MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK ON A DAILY BASIS, AND IMPLEMENTATION

OF EXTENSIVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND CONTROLS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS;



PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS;

AND



A NETWORK OF SYSTEMS TO FACILITATE THE COLLECTION OF DATA USED TO ANALYZE AND ASSESS OUR OPERATIONAL RISK

EXPOSURE.

WE COMBINE TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES TO MANAGE AND MEASURE OPERATIONAL RISK. FROM A TOP-DOWN

PERSPECTIVE, OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT ASSESSES FIRMWIDE AND BUSINESS-LEVEL OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILES. FROM A BOTTOM-UP PERSPECTIVE, REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK IDENTIFICATION AND RISK

MANAGEMENT ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, INCLUDING ESCALATING OPERATIONAL RISKS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

IS IN PART DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND HAS EVOLVED BASED ON THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE.

GOLDMAN SACHS 2016 FORM 10-K

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK COMPRISES THE FOLLOWING PRACTICES.



RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT;



RISK MEASUREMENT; AND



RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING.

INTERNAL AUDIT PERFORMS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING OUR KEY CONTROLS, PROCESSES AND

APPLICATIONS, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FRAMEWORK.

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT

THE CORE OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT. WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS,

INCLUDING FIRMWIDE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, FOR OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES THAT REQUIRE OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING

UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO REPORT AND ESCALATE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WHEN OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS ARE IDENTIFIED, OUR POLICIES REQUIRE THAT THE EVENTS BE DOCUMENTED AND ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES ARE

REQUIRED IN OUR SYSTEMS AND/OR PROCESSES TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE RISK OF FUTURE EVENTS.

IN ADDITION, OUR SYSTEMS CAPTURE INTERNAL

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA, KEY METRICS SUCH AS TRANSACTION VOLUMES, AND STATISTICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS PERFORMANCE TRENDS. WE USE AN INTERNALLY DEVELOPED OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION TO AGGREGATE AND ORGANIZE THIS INFORMATION. ONE OF

OUR KEY RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS IS AN OPERATIONAL RISK AND CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS WHICH IS PERFORMED BY MANAGERS FROM BOTH REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF THE

IDENTIFICATION AND RATING OF OPERATIONAL RISKS, ON A FORWARD-LOOKING BASIS, AND THE RELATED CONTROLS. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROCESS ARE ANALYZED TO EVALUATE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES AND IDENTIFY BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES OR PRODUCTS WITH HEIGHTENED

LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL RISK.

RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MEASURE OUR OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE OVER A TWELVE-MONTH TIME HORIZON USING BOTH STATISTICAL MODELING AND SCENARIO ANALYSES, WHICH INVOLVE

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE POTENTIAL FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF POTENTIAL OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES, FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES. OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT INCORPORATES QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF FACTORS INCLUDING.



INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA;



ASSESSMENTS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS;



EVALUATIONS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;



THE DEGREE OF AND POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION IN OUR PROCESSES;



NEW ACTIVITY INFORMATION;



THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT;



CHANGES IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THE DIVERSITY AND SOPHISTICATION OF OUR

CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES; AND



LIQUIDITY OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE RELIABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE RESULTS FROM THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES ARE USED TO MONITOR CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RISK AND TO DETERMINE BUSINESS LINES

THAT MAY HAVE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK. THESE ANALYSES ULTIMATELY ARE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL TO HOLD.

RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING

WE EVALUATE CHANGES

IN THE OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX OR JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BY MONITORING THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AT A FIRMWIDE LEVEL. WE HAVE BOTH PREVENTIVE AND DETECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROLS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES AND THE PROBABILITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WE MONITOR THE RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS AND INDEPENDENT INTERNAL AUDITS OF THESE INTERNAL CONTROLS.

WE ALSO PROVIDE PERIODIC OPERATIONAL RISK REPORTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RISK COMMITTEES AND THE BOARD. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

THRESHOLDS TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF AN OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT, INCLUDING SINGLE LOSS EVENTS AND CUMULATIVE LOSSES OVER A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, AS WELL AS ESCALATION PROTOCOLS. WE ALSO PROVIDE PERIODIC OPERATIONAL RISK REPORTS, WHICH INCLUDE INCIDENTS

THAT BREACH ESCALATION THRESHOLDS, TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, FIRMWIDE AND DIVISIONAL RISK COMMITTEES AND THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD.

MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION

THE STATISTICAL MODELS UTILIZED BY OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ARE SUBJECT TO INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND VALIDATION BY MODEL RISK

MANAGEMENT. SEE MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF THESE MODELS.

MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

MODEL RISK IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE

CONSEQUENCES FROM DECISIONS MADE BASED ON MODEL OUTPUTS THAT MAY BE INCORRECT OR USED INAPPROPRIATELY. WE RELY ON QUANTITATIVE MODELS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY TO VALUE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, TO MONITOR AND MANAGE

OUR RISK, AND TO MEASURE AND MONITOR OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL.

OUR MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS MANAGED THROUGH A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, WHICH ENCOMPASS STANDARDS DESIGNED TO ENSURE WE MAINTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL INVENTORY, INCLUDING RISK ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION, SOUND MODEL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES, INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND MODEL-SPECIFIC USAGE

CONTROLS. THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK CONTROL COMMITTEE OVERSEE OUR MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF MODEL DEVELOPERS, MODEL OWNERS AND MODEL USERS, REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING SIGNIFICANT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MODELS, AND PROVIDES PERIODIC UPDATES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RISK COMMITTEES AND THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD.

MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION

MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

CONSISTS OF QUANTITATIVE PROFESSIONALS WHO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW, VALIDATION AND APPROVAL OF OUR MODELS. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL DOCUMENTATION, INDEPENDENT TESTING, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

METHODOLOGY USED, AND VERIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS. MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT REVIEWS ALL EXISTING MODELS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AS WELL AS NEW MODELS OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MODELS.

THE MODEL VALIDATION PROCESS INCORPORATES A REVIEW OF MODELS AND TRADE AND RISK PARAMETERS

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (THE

FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE

AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT,

MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 WAS EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON PAGE 109, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC..

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, STATEMENTS

OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

(2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING ON PAGE 108. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES

OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

CONSOLIDATION

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY OR A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE).

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS

ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE LOSSES OF THE ENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE

RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE ENTITY. THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. IF THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, THE

ENTITY IS CONSOLIDATED.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

A VIE IS AN ENTITY THAT LACKS ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY. THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE WHEN THE FIRM HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST OR INTERESTS THAT PROVIDE

IT WITH (I) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND (II) THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD

POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. SEE NOTE 12 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT VIES.

EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE

A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT CAN EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, THE INVESTMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR EITHER (I) UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING OR (II) AT FAIR

VALUE BY ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AVAILABLE UNDER U.S. GAAP. SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE GENERALLY EXISTS WHEN THE FIRM OWNS 20% TO 50% OF THE ENTITYS COMMON STOCK OR IN-SUBSTANCE COMMON STOCK.

IN GENERAL, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED AFTER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION BECAME AVAILABLE, AT FAIR VALUE. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM

APPLIES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO NEW INVESTMENTS THAT ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR CLOSELY RELATED TO THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHEN THE FIRM HAS A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH FLOWS OR OPERATIONS OF THE

INVESTEE OR WHEN COST-BENEFIT CONSIDERATIONS ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT. SEE NOTE 13 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENT FUNDS.

THE FIRM HAS FORMED NUMEROUS INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THESE FUNDS ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM ACTS AS GENERAL PARTNER OR

MANAGER. GENERALLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THESE FUNDS. THESE FUNDS ARE USUALLY VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES AND GENERALLY ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS TYPICALLY HAVE RIGHTS TO TERMINATE THE

FUNDS OR TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGER. INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS ARE GENERALLY MEASURED AT NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTES 6, 18 AND 22 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF

WHICH RELATE TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS) AND TAX AUDITS, AND THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS HELD FOR INVESTMENT. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION BUT ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR

VALUE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE EITHER UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE BY ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT

THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS. FAIR VALUE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING FOR POSITIONS IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS FOR POSITIONS IN

INVESTING & LENDING. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

INVESTMENT BANKING.

FEES FROM FINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS AND UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE SERVICES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION ARE COMPLETED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ASSIGNMENT. EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OR THE ASSIGNMENT IS OTHERWISE CONCLUDED. EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS ARE RECORDED AS NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES, NET OF CLIENT

REIMBURSEMENTS. UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE PRESENTED NET OF RELATED EXPENSES.

INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM EARNS MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES FOR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES. MANAGEMENT FEES FOR MUTUAL FUNDS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF DAILY NET ASSET VALUE AND ARE

RECEIVED MONTHLY. MANAGEMENT FEES FOR HEDGE FUNDS AND SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF MONTH-END NET ASSET VALUE AND ARE GENERALLY RECEIVED QUARTERLY. MANAGEMENT FEES FOR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS ARE CALCULATED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF MONTHLY INVESTED CAPITAL OR COMMITMENTS AND ARE RECEIVED QUARTERLY, SEMI-ANNUALLY OR ANNUALLY, DEPENDING ON THE FUND. ALL MANAGEMENT FEES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD THAT THE RELATED SERVICE IS PROVIDED. INCENTIVE FEES ARE

CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS OR SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS RETURN, OR EXCESS RETURN ABOVE A SPECIFIED BENCHMARK OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGET. INCENTIVE FEES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD OR

OVER THE LIFE OF A FUND. FEES THAT ARE BASED ON PERFORMANCE OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. FOR FEES THAT ARE BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE LIFE OF THE FUND, FUTURE INVESTMENT

UNDERPERFORMANCE MAY REQUIRE FEES PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM TO BE RETURNED TO THE FUND. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN ALL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEE REVENUES ARE INCLUDED IN

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES.

THE FIRM MAKES PAYMENTS TO BROKERS AND ADVISORS RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE

FIRMS INVESTMENT FUNDS. THESE PAYMENTS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON EITHER A PERCENTAGE OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE OR THE INVESTMENT FUNDS NET ASSET VALUE. WHERE THE FIRM IS PRINCIPAL TO THE ARRANGEMENT, SUCH COSTS ARE RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS

AND INCLUDED IN BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, AND WHERE THE FIRM IS AGENT TO THE ARRANGEMENT, SUCH COSTS ARE RECORDED ON A NET BASIS IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES.

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES WHEN THE FIRM HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED. FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES. ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM THE FIRMS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE INITIALLY RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE. FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS THAT ARE

RECEIVABLES FROM AND PAYABLES TO BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS

RECEIVABLES FROM AND PAYABLES TO BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH GENERALLY

APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE

ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IN NOTES 6 THROUGH 8. HAD THESE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 AS OF

DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015.

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES GENERALLY RELATE TO COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS. SUCH RECEIVABLES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF

AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THE CARRYING VALUE OF RECEIVABLES NOT

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE GENERALLY APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE RECEIVABLES ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER

U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IN NOTES 6 THROUGH 8. HAD THESE RECEIVABLES BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 AS

PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES

OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

TO REDUCE CREDIT EXPOSURES ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS OR SIMILAR

ARRANGEMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, NETTING AGREEMENTS) WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT IT TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. A NETTING AGREEMENT IS A CONTRACT WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT PERMITS NET SETTLEMENT OF MULTIPLE

TRANSACTIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, INCLUDING UPON THE EXERCISE OF TERMINATION RIGHTS BY A NON-DEFAULTING PARTY. UPON EXERCISE OF SUCH TERMINATION RIGHTS, ALL TRANSACTIONS GOVERNED BY THE NETTING AGREEMENT ARE TERMINATED AND A NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT

IS CALCULATED. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM RECEIVES AND POSTS CASH AND SECURITIES COLLATERAL WITH RESPECT TO ITS DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE RELATED CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS

(COLLECTIVELY, CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS). AN ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENT GRANTS THE NON-DEFAULTING PARTY EXERCISING TERMINATION RIGHTS THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE THE COLLATERAL AND APPLY THE PROCEEDS TO ANY AMOUNTS OWED. IN ORDER TO ASSESS

ENFORCEABILITY OF THE FIRMS RIGHT OF SETOFF UNDER NETTING AND CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM EVALUATES VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING APPLICABLE BANKRUPTCY LAWS, LOCAL STATUTES AND REGULATORY PROVISIONS IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE PARTIES TO

THE AGREEMENT.

DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES FOR A GIVEN COUNTERPARTY) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED TRANSACTIONS

WITH THE SAME TERM AND CURRENCY ARE PRESENTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN SUCH TRANSACTIONS MEET CERTAIN SETTLEMENT CRITERIA AND ARE SUBJECT TO NETTING AGREEMENTS.

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND POSTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE

CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, WHEN TRANSACTED UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED, ARE NOT REPORTED NET OF THE RELATED

CASH AND SECURITIES RECEIVED OR POSTED AS COLLATERAL. SEE NOTE 10 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PLEDGED, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO DELIVER OR REPLEDGE COLLATERAL. SEE NOTES 7 AND 10 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

OFFSETTING.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING ON THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE PERIOD. FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS IN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS OR

LOSSES ON TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A NON-U.S. OPERATION, WHEN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE INCLUDED, NET OF HEDGES AND TAXES, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (ASC 606).

IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

(TOPIC 606). THIS ASU, AS AMENDED, PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE GUIDANCE ON THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS ARISING FROM THE TRANSFER OF GOODS AND SERVICES, GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN CONTRACT COSTS, AND NEW DISCLOSURES.

THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM IN JANUARY 2018 UNDER A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS

PRESENTED. THE FIRMS IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS INCLUDE IDENTIFYING REVENUES AND COSTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ASU, REVIEWING CONTRACTS, AND ANALYZING ANY CHANGES TO ITS EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THIS ASU, THE

FIRM MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE INCENTIVE FEES EARLIER THAN UNDER THE FIRMS CURRENT REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WHICH DEFERS RECOGNITION UNTIL ALL CONTINGENCIES ARE RESOLVED. THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO CHANGE THE

CURRENT PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN COSTS FROM A NET PRESENTATION WITHIN NET REVENUES TO A GROSS BASIS, OR VICE VERSA. BASED ON IMPLEMENTATION WORK TO DATE, THE FIRM DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE ASU WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.

MEASURING THE FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND THE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES OF A CONSOLIDATED COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ENTITY (ASC 810).

IN AUGUST 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2014-13, CONSOLIDATION

THE DEFERRAL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASU NO. 2009-17, CONSOLIDATIONS (TOPIC 810)  IMPROVEMENTS TO FINANCIAL REPORTING BY ENTERPRISES INVOLVED WITH VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES FOR CERTAIN INTERESTS IN INVESTMENT FUNDS

AND PROVIDES A SCOPE EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS. IT ALSO MAKES SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE FOR VIES AND GENERAL PARTNERS INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AS WELL AS MODIFICATIONS TO THE

EVALUATION OF WHETHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS ARE VIES OR VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

THE FIRM ADOPTED THE ASU IN JANUARY 2016,

USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION WAS A NET REDUCTION TO BOTH TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE

AND IN OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. ADOPTION OF THIS ASU DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 12 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE ADOPTION.

CARRYING AMOUNT OF THAT LIABILITY.

THE FIRM EARLY ADOPTED THE ASU IN SEPTEMBER 2015, USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH.

ADOPTION OF THE ASU DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING

(ASC 718).

IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-09, COMPENSATION  STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718)  IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. THIS ASU INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT THE TAX EFFECT RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS BE RECORDED IN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OR EXPENSE IN THE STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS RATHER THAN DIRECTLY TO ADDITIONAL

PAID-IN-CAPITAL. THIS CHANGE HAS NO IMPACT ON TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED PROSPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE ASU MODIFIES THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

AND THIS CHANGE IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE ASU ALSO ALLOWS FOR FORFEITURES TO BE RECORDED WHEN THEY OCCUR RATHER THAN ESTIMATED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THIS CHANGE IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED ON A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE

BASIS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED THE ASU IN JANUARY 2017 AND THE IMPACT OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT (RSU) DELIVERIES AND OPTION

EXERCISES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017 IS ESTIMATED TO BE A REDUCTION TO THE PROVISION FOR TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THIS AMOUNT MAY VARY IN FUTURE PERIODS

DEPENDING UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE NUMBER OF RSUS DELIVERED AND THEIR CHANGE IN VALUE SINCE GRANT. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU, THIS AMOUNT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED DIRECTLY TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL. OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE ASU WILL

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET IN THE STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, WHILE FOR OPERATING LEASES, SUCH AMOUNTS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A COMBINED EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, THIS ASU REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE NATURE AND TERMS OF LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM IN JANUARY 2019 UNDER A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE FIRMS

IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS INCLUDE REVIEWING EXISTING LEASES AND SERVICE CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE EMBEDDED LEASES. THE FIRM EXPECTS A GROSS UP ON ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION UPON RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND

LEASE LIABILITIES AND DOES NOT EXPECT THE AMOUNT OF THE GROSS UP TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (ASC 326).

IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-13, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326)  MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS ASU AMENDS SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING REPLACING THE EXISTING INCURRED CREDIT

LOSS MODEL AND OTHER MODELS WITH THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (CECL) MODEL AND AMENDING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASED FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY SINCE ORIGINATION.

UNDER CECL, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT ARE MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST

SHOULD REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSETS. EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES FOR NEWLY RECOGNIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES DURING THE PERIOD, WOULD

BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR CERTAIN PURCHASED FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY SINCE ORIGINATION, AN INITIAL ALLOWANCE WOULD BE RECORDED FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREASE TO THE PURCHASE PRICE RATHER

THAN AS AN EXPENSE. EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING LOSSES ON OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURES SUCH AS LENDING COMMITMENTS, WILL BE MEASURED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND FORECASTS THAT AFFECT THE COLLECTABILITY OF THE REPORTED

AMOUNT.

THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM IN JANUARY 2020 UNDER A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED IN

JANUARY 2019. ADOPTION OF THE ASU WILL RESULT IN EARLIER RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES AND AN INCREASE IN THE RECORDED ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN PURCHASED LOANS WITH DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY SINCE ORIGINATION WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE TO

THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUE. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF THIS ASU ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE TYPE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS HELD BY

THE FIRM ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.

CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS

(ASC 230).

IN AUGUST 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-15, STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (TOPIC 230)  CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH

PAYMENTS. THIS ASU PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE DISCLOSURE AND CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN ITEMS WITHIN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM IN JANUARY 2018 UNDER A RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. SINCE THE ASU ONLY IMPACTS

CLASSIFICATION IN THE STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, ADOPTION WILL NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS (ASC 805).

IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2017-01, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(TOPIC 805)  CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS. THE ASU AMENDS THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS AND PROVIDES A THRESHOLD WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TRANSACTION IS AN ASSET ACQUISITION OR A BUSINESS

COMBINATION. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM IN JANUARY 2018 UNDER A PROSPECTIVE APPROACH. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE FIRM IS STILL EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF THE ASU ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

RESTRICTED CASH (ASC 230).

IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-18, STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (TOPIC 230)  RESTRICTED CASH. THIS ASU REQUIRES THAT CASH SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER

PURPOSES BE INCLUDED IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DISCLOSED IN THE STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM EARLY ADOPTED THE ASU IN DECEMBER 2016 AND RECLASSIFIED CASH SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES INTO CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS DISCLOSED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION WAS A DECREASE OF $3.69 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $909 MILLION AND A DECREASE OF $309 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2016,

DECEMBER 2015 AND DECEMBER 2014, RESPECTIVELY, TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY/(USED FOR) OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

IN

DECEMBER 2016, TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENTATION OF SEGREGATED CASH IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE ASU, THE FIRM RECLASSIFIED AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND

OTHER PURPOSES INTO CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, SECURITIES BORROWED AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE, IN THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN THE TABLE ABOVE.



GAINS/(LOSSES) INCLUDE BOTH REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING BOTH DERIVATIVE AND NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.



GAINS/(LOSSES) EXCLUDE RELATED INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE. SEE NOTE 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ABOUT INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE.



GAINS/(LOSSES) ON OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS INVESTING & LENDING

SEGMENT. SEE NOTE 25 FOR NET REVENUES, INCLUDING NET INTEREST INCOME, BY PRODUCT TYPE FOR INVESTING & LENDING, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF NET INTEREST INCOME INCLUDED IN INVESTING & LENDING.



GAINS/(LOSSES) ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRM MANAGES ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES BECAUSE

MANY OF THE FIRMS MARKET-MAKING AND CLIENT FACILITATION STRATEGIES UTILIZE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACROSS VARIOUS PRODUCT TYPES. ACCORDINGLY, GAINS OR LOSSES IN ONE PRODUCT TYPE FREQUENTLY OFFSET GAINS OR LOSSES IN OTHER PRODUCT TYPES. FOR

EXAMPLE, MOST OF THE FIRMS LONGER-TERM DERIVATIVES ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND MAY BE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS. SIMILARLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS CASH INSTRUMENTS

AND DERIVATIVES ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES HAS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND MAY BE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS.

NOTE 5.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS. THE FIRM MEASURES CERTAIN

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AS A PORTFOLIO (I.E., BASED ON ITS NET EXPOSURE TO MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISKS).

THE BEST EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE IS A QUOTED PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. IF QUOTED PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, QUOTED PRICES OR RECENT TRANSACTIONS IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS, OR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY

SOURCED INPUTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY PRICES, CREDIT SPREADS AND FUNDING SPREADS (I.E., THE SPREAD OR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTEREST RATE AT WHICH A

BORROWER COULD FINANCE A GIVEN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RELATIVE TO A BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE).

U.S. GAAP HAS A THREE-LEVEL FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THIS HIERARCHY PRIORITIZES INPUTS TO THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, GIVING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO LEVEL 1 INPUTS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO LEVEL 3 INPUTS. A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LEVEL IN THIS HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO ITS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. IN EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A VALUATION INPUT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, A

PORTFOLIOS NET RISK EXPOSURE TO THAT INPUT. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1.

INPUTS ARE UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS TO WHICH THE FIRM HAD ACCESS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2.

INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.

LEVEL 3.

ONE OR MORE INPUTS TO VALUATION

TECHNIQUES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND UNOBSERVABLE.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE FOR FACTORS SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE.

SEE NOTES 6 THROUGH 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CASH INSTRUMENTS,

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE PRIMARILY UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION (INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES, AND TRANSFERS IN AND OUT OF LEVEL 3), RESPECTIVELY.

CASH INSTRUMENTS

CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, MORTGAGE-BACKED LOANS AND SECURITIES, CORPORATE LOANS AND DEBT SECURITIES, EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES, INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS AT NAV, AND OTHER

NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED. SEE BELOW FOR THE TYPES OF CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN EACH LEVEL OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY AND THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND SIGNIFICANT INPUTS USED

TO DETERMINE THEIR FAIR VALUES. SEE NOTE 5 FOR AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT POLICIES.

LEVEL 1 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 1 CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, MOST NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS,

CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND ACTIVELY TRADED LISTED EQUITIES. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL UNRESTRICTED INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME BOTH IN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND RELATIVE TO THE

MARKET CAPITALIZATION FOR THE INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS BASED ON BOTH THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS WITH TRADING ACTIVITY.

LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 2 CASH

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE MOST MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, MOST GOVERNMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, MOST MORTGAGE-BACKED LOANS AND SECURITIES, MOST CORPORATE LOANS AND DEBT SECURITIES, MOST STATE AND MUNICIPAL

OBLIGATIONS, MOST OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS, RESTRICTED OR LESS LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, COMMODITIES AND CERTAIN LENDING COMMITMENTS.

VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS CAN BE VERIFIED TO QUOTED PRICES, RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS,

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES

PROVIDED FROM ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE TO LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS (I) IF THE CASH

INSTRUMENT IS SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND/OR (II) FOR OTHER PREMIUMS AND LIQUIDITY DISCOUNTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE.

LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 3 CASH

INSTRUMENTS HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT VALUATION INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRM USES OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT. VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING VALUES REALIZED

ON SALES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS.

VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND SIGNIFICANT INPUTS OF LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS

VALUATION TECHNIQUES OF LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS VARY BY INSTRUMENT, BUT ARE GENERALLY BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES. THE

VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND THE NATURE OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH TYPE OF LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENT ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY COLLATERALIZED BY A SINGLE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTY OR A PORTFOLIO OF PROPERTIES, AND MAY INCLUDE TRANCHES OF VARYING LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. SIGNIFICANT INPUTS

ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES AND INCLUDE.



TRANSACTION PRICES IN BOTH THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND INSTRUMENTS WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL AND THE BASIS, OR PRICE DIFFERENCE, TO SUCH PRICES;



MARKET YIELDS IMPLIED BY TRANSACTIONS OF SIMILAR OR RELATED ASSETS AND/OR CURRENT LEVELS AND CHANGES IN MARKET

INDICES SUCH AS THE CMBX (AN INDEX THAT TRACKS THE PERFORMANCE OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BONDS);



A MEASURE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN A DEFAULT SCENARIO (RECOVERY RATES) IMPLIED BY THE VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WHICH IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY CURRENT PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, CAPITALIZATION RATES AND MULTIPLES. RECOVERY RATES ARE EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NOTIONAL OR FACE VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENT AND REFLECT THE BENEFIT

OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS ON CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS; AND



TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS (DURATION) WHICH, IN CERTAIN CASES, MAY INCORPORATE THE IMPACT OF OTHER

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G., PREPAYMENT SPEEDS).

LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE.

LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY COLLATERALIZED BY PORTFOLIOS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND MAY INCLUDE TRANCHES OF VARYING LEVELS OF

SUBORDINATION. SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES, WHICH INCORPORATE COMPARISONS TO INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR COLLATERAL AND RISK PROFILES. SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INCLUDE.



TRANSACTION PRICES IN BOTH THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND INSTRUMENTS WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL;



MARKET YIELDS IMPLIED BY TRANSACTIONS OF SIMILAR OR RELATED ASSETS;



RANGES REPRESENT THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE USED IN THE VALUATION OF EACH TYPE OF CASH

INSTRUMENT.



WEIGHTED AVERAGES ARE CALCULATED BY WEIGHTING EACH INPUT BY THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF THE CASH INSTRUMENTS.



THE RANGES AND WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THESE INPUTS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROPRIATE INPUTS TO USE WHEN

CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE CASH INSTRUMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HIGHEST MULTIPLE FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING A SPECIFIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT BUT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING ANY OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE RANGES OF INPUTS DO NOT REPRESENT UNCERTAINTY IN, OR POSSIBLE RANGES OF, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS.



INCREASES IN YIELD, DISCOUNT RATE, CAPITALIZATION RATE, DURATION OR CUMULATIVE LOSS RATE USED IN THE VALUATION

OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS WOULD RESULT IN A LOWER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT, WHILE INCREASES IN RECOVERY RATE, BASIS, MULTIPLES OR GROWTH RATE WOULD RESULT IN A HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. DUE TO THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF EACH

OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS, THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF INPUTS IS NOT NECESSARILY UNIFORM WITHIN EACH PRODUCT TYPE.



EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE

ENTITIES. GROWTH RATE INCLUDES LONG-TERM GROWTH RATE AND COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE.



BASIS (POINTS) AND GROWTH RATE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS AS OF

DECEMBER 2016.



LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, CORPORATE LOANS AND DEBT SECURITIES AND

OTHER CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AND EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ARE VALUED USING MARKET COMPARABLES AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.



THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE INSTRUMENT MAY BE DETERMINED USING MULTIPLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES. FOR EXAMPLE,

MARKET COMPARABLES AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MAY BE USED TOGETHER TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. THEREFORE, THE LEVEL 3 BALANCE ENCOMPASSES BOTH OF THESE TECHNIQUES.

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. SEE

LEVEL 3 ROLLFORWARD BELOW FOR INFORMATION ABOUT TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3.

DURING 2016, TRANSFERS

INTO LEVEL 2 FROM LEVEL 1 OF CASH INSTRUMENTS WERE $135 MILLION, REFLECTING TRANSFERS OF PUBLIC EQUITY SECURITIES DUE TO DECREASED MARKET ACTIVITY IN THESE INSTRUMENTS. TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 1 FROM LEVEL 2 OF CASH INSTRUMENTS

DURING 2016 WERE $267 MILLION, REFLECTING TRANSFERS OF PUBLIC EQUITY SECURITIES DUE TO INCREASED MARKET ACTIVITY IN THESE INSTRUMENTS.

LEVEL 3 ROLLFORWARD

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN THE TABLE BELOW.



CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE PRESENTED FOR ALL CASH INSTRUMENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE CATEGORIZED AS

LEVEL 3 AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD.



NET UNREALIZED GAINS/(LOSSES) RELATE TO INSTRUMENTS THAT WERE STILL HELD AT PERIOD-END.



PURCHASES INCLUDE ORIGINATIONS AND SECONDARY PURCHASES.



IF A CASH INSTRUMENT ASSET OR LIABILITY WAS TRANSFERRED TO LEVEL 3 DURING A REPORTING PERIOD, ITS ENTIRE

GAIN OR LOSS FOR THE PERIOD IS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. FOR LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENT ASSETS, INCREASES ARE SHOWN AS POSITIVE AMOUNTS, WHILE DECREASES ARE SHOWN AS NEGATIVE AMOUNTS. FOR LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENT LIABILITIES, INCREASES ARE

SHOWN AS NEGATIVE AMOUNTS, WHILE DECREASES ARE SHOWN AS POSITIVE AMOUNTS.



LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE FREQUENTLY ECONOMICALLY HEDGED WITH LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 CASH

INSTRUMENTS AND/OR LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES. ACCORDINGLY, GAINS OR LOSSES THAT ARE REPORTED IN LEVEL 3 CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS AND/OR

LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES. AS A RESULT, GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN THE LEVEL 3 ROLLFORWARD BELOW DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE OVERALL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL

THESE INSTRUMENTS, AND TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN CORPORATE LOANS AND DEBT SECURITIES TO LEVEL 2 PRINCIPALLY DUE TO CERTAIN UNOBSERVABLE YIELD AND DURATION INPUTS NOT BEING SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS AT NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE

CASH INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE MEASURED AT NAV OF THE INVESTMENT FUND. THE FIRM USES NAV TO MEASURE THE

FAIR VALUE OF ITS FUND INVESTMENTS WHEN (I) THE FUND INVESTMENT DOES NOT HAVE A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE AND (II) THE NAV OF THE INVESTMENT FUND IS CALCULATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING MEASUREMENT OF THE INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS AT NAV PRIMARILY CONSIST

OF INVESTMENTS IN FIRM-SPONSORED PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS WHERE THE FIRM CO-INVESTS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS.

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS PRIMARILY INVEST IN A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING LEVERAGED BUYOUTS, RECAPITALIZATIONS, GROWTH

INVESTMENTS AND DISTRESSED INVESTMENTS. CREDIT FUNDS GENERALLY INVEST IN LOANS AND OTHER FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS AND ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING PRIVATE HIGH-YIELD CAPITAL FOR LEVERAGED AND MANAGEMENT BUYOUT TRANSACTIONS, RECAPITALIZATIONS,

FINANCINGS, REFINANCINGS, ACQUISITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS FOR PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, PRIVATE FAMILY COMPANIES AND CORPORATE ISSUERS. REAL ESTATE FUNDS INVEST GLOBALLY, PRIMARILY IN REAL ESTATE COMPANIES, LOAN PORTFOLIOS, DEBT RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

PROPERTY. THE PRIVATE EQUITY, CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS ARE PRIMARILY CLOSED-END FUNDS IN WHICH THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REDEMPTION. DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE RECEIVED FROM THESE FUNDS AS THE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE

LIQUIDATED OR DISTRIBUTED.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN HEDGE FUNDS, PRIMARILY MULTI-DISCIPLINARY HEDGE FUNDS THAT EMPLOY A FUNDAMENTAL

BOTTOM-UP INVESTMENT APPROACH ACROSS VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND STRATEGIES. THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS PRIMARILY INCLUDE INTERESTS WHERE THE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE ILLIQUID IN NATURE, AND PROCEEDS FROM REDEMPTIONS WILL NOT BE RECEIVED

UNTIL THE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE LIQUIDATED OR DISTRIBUTED.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANY OF THE FUNDS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE COVERED FUNDS AS DEFINED BY THE VOLCKER RULE

OF THE U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT). THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) EXTENDED THE CONFORMANCE PERIOD FOR INVESTMENTS IN, AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH, COVERED

FUNDS THAT WERE IN PLACE PRIOR TO DECEMBER 2013 THROUGH JULY 2017, AND IN DECEMBER 2016 PERMITTED BANKING ENTITIES TO APPLY FOR AN EXTENSION OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS FOR LEGACY ILLIQUID FUNDS (AS DEFINED BY THE

VOLCKER RULE). THE FIRM HAS APPLIED FOR THIS EXTENSION FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN, AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH, COVERED FUNDS IN THE TABLE BELOW. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT RECEIVE AN EXTENSION, THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO

SELL ITS INTERESTS IN SUCH FUNDS BY JULY 2017. IF THAT OCCURS, THE FIRM WILL LIKELY RECEIVE A VALUE FOR ITS INTERESTS THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE THEN CARRYING VALUE AS THERE COULD BE A LIMITED SECONDARY MARKET FOR THESE INVESTMENTS AND

THE FIRM MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEM IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVES ARE INSTRUMENTS THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSET PRICES, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES AND OTHER INPUTS, OR A COMBINATION

OF THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVES MAY BE TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE (EXCHANGE-TRADED) OR THEY MAY BE PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY REFERRED TO AS OTC DERIVATIVES. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS OTC DERIVATIVES ARE CLEARED AND SETTLED THROUGH

CENTRAL CLEARING COUNTERPARTIES (OTC-CLEARED), WHILE OTHERS ARE BILATERAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN TWO COUNTERPARTIES (BILATERAL OTC).

MARKET-MAKING.

AS A MARKET MAKER, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER AND HEDGING OF THEIR RISKS. IN THIS ROLE, THE FIRM TYPICALLY ACTS AS PRINCIPAL AND IS

REQUIRED TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO PROVIDE EXECUTION, AND MAINTAINS INVENTORY IN RESPONSE TO, OR IN ANTICIPATION OF, CLIENT DEMAND.

RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE RISK EXPOSURES THAT ARISE FROM ITS MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES IN

DERIVATIVE AND CASH INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRMS HOLDINGS AND EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, IN MANY CASES, ON EITHER A PORTFOLIO OR RISK-SPECIFIC BASIS, AS OPPOSED TO AN INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT BASIS. THE OFFSETTING IMPACT OF THIS ECONOMIC HEDGING IS

REFLECTED IN THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENT AS THE RELATED REVENUES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN FIXED-RATE UNSECURED

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AND DEPOSITS, AND TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON THE NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING.



FUTURES AND FORWARDS.

CONTRACTS THAT COMMIT COUNTERPARTIES TO

PURCHASE OR SELL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES OR CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE.



SWAPS.

CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE COUNTERPARTIES TO EXCHANGE CASH

FLOWS SUCH AS CURRENCY OR INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED RATES, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.



OPTIONS.

CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE OPTION PURCHASER HAS THE RIGHT,

BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE FROM OR SELL TO THE OPTION WRITER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES OR CURRENCIES WITHIN A DEFINED TIME PERIOD FOR A SPECIFIED PRICE.

DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR A GIVEN

COUNTERPARTY) WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT (COUNTERPARTY NETTING). DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED OR POSTED UNDER ENFORCEABLE CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS (CASH

COLLATERAL NETTING). DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, RESPECTIVELY. REALIZED AND UNREALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 ARE INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS IN NOTE 4.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A CLEARING ORGANIZATION ADOPTED A RULE CHANGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017 THAT REQUIRES

TRANSACTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED SETTLED EACH DAY. CERTAIN OTHER CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS ALLOW FOR SIMILAR TREATMENT. TO THE EXTENT TRANSACTIONS WITH THESE CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONSIDERED SETTLED, THE IMPACT WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN GROSS INTEREST

RATE AND CREDIT DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN COUNTERPARTY AND CASH COLLATERAL NETTING, WITH NO IMPACT TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

VALUATION TECHNIQUES FOR DERIVATIVES

THE

FIRMS LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING DERIVATIVE PRICING MODELS (E.G., DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, CORRELATION MODELS, AND MODELS THAT INCORPORATE OPTION PRICING METHODOLOGIES, SUCH AS MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS).

PRICE TRANSPARENCY OF DERIVATIVES CAN GENERALLY BE CHARACTERIZED BY PRODUCT TYPE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.



INTEREST RATE.

IN GENERAL, THE KEY INPUTS USED TO VALUE INTEREST

RATE DERIVATIVES ARE TRANSPARENT, EVEN FOR MOST LONG-DATED CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND OPTIONS DENOMINATED IN THE CURRENCIES OF LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH TRADING VOLUMES AND TIGHT BID/OFFER SPREADS. INTEREST

RATE DERIVATIVES THAT REFERENCE INDICES, SUCH AS AN INFLATION INDEX, OR THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE (E.G., 10-YEAR SWAP RATE VS. 2-YEAR SWAP RATE) ARE MORE COMPLEX, BUT THE KEY INPUTS ARE GENERALLY OBSERVABLE.



CREDIT.

PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, INCLUDING

BOTH SINGLE NAMES AND BASKETS OF CREDITS, VARIES BY MARKET AND UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY OR OBLIGATION. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT REFERENCE INDICES, LARGE CORPORATES AND MAJOR SOVEREIGNS GENERALLY EXHIBIT THE MOST PRICE TRANSPARENCY. FOR CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS WITH OTHER UNDERLIERS, PRICE TRANSPARENCY VARIES BASED ON CREDIT RATING, THE COST OF BORROWING THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS FOR DELIVERY UPON THE DEFAULT OF THE

ISSUER. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT REFERENCE LOANS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND EMERGING MARKET DEBT INSTRUMENTS TEND TO HAVE LESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY THAN THOSE THAT REFERENCE CORPORATE BONDS. IN ADDITION, MORE COMPLEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS

THOSE SENSITIVE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, GENERALLY HAVE LESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY.



CURRENCY.

PRICES FOR CURRENCY DERIVATIVES BASED ON THE EXCHANGE

RATES OF LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH LONGER TENORS, ARE GENERALLY TRANSPARENT. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE TRANSPARENCY OF DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKET CURRENCY DERIVATIVES IS THAT EMERGING MARKETS TEND TO BE

OBSERVABLE FOR CONTRACTS WITH SHORTER TENORS.



COMMODITY.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS REFERENCED

TO ENERGY (E.G., OIL AND NATURAL GAS), METALS (E.G., PRECIOUS AND BASE) AND SOFT COMMODITIES (E.G., AGRICULTURAL). PRICE TRANSPARENCY VARIES BASED ON THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY, DELIVERY LOCATION, TENOR AND PRODUCT QUALITY (E.G., DIESEL FUEL COMPARED

TO UNLEADED GASOLINE). IN GENERAL, PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR COMMODITY DERIVATIVES IS GREATER FOR CONTRACTS WITH SHORTER TENORS AND CONTRACTS THAT ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH MAJOR AND/OR BENCHMARK COMMODITY INDICES.



EQUITY.

PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR EQUITY DERIVATIVES VARIES BY

MARKET AND UNDERLIER. OPTIONS ON INDICES AND THE COMMON STOCK OF CORPORATES INCLUDED IN MAJOR EQUITY INDICES EXHIBIT THE MOST PRICE TRANSPARENCY. EQUITY DERIVATIVES GENERALLY HAVE OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES, EXCEPT FOR CONTRACTS WITH LONG TENORS OR

REFERENCE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES. MORE COMPLEX EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, GENERALLY HAVE LESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OBSERVABILITY OF ALL PRODUCT TYPES. IF TRANSACTION VOLUMES DECLINE, PREVIOUSLY TRANSPARENT PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS

MAY BECOME UNOBSERVABLE. CONVERSELY, EVEN HIGHLY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS MAY AT TIMES HAVE TRADING VOLUMES LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE OBSERVABILITY OF PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS. SEE NOTE 5 FOR AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

POLICIES.

LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS FOR FUTURE DELIVERY OF SECURITIES WHEN THE UNDERLYING SECURITY IS A LEVEL 1

INSTRUMENT, AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES IF THEY ARE ACTIVELY TRADED AND ARE VALUED AT THEIR QUOTED MARKET PRICE.

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES INCLUDE OTC DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT VALUATION INPUTS ARE CORROBORATED BY MARKET EVIDENCE AND

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT ACTIVELY TRADED AND/OR THAT ARE VALUED USING MODELS THAT CALIBRATE TO MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS OF OTC DERIVATIVES.

GOLDMAN SACHS 2016 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO VALUE A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF

AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN THE INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. FOR DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT BECAUSE OUTPUTS OF MODELS

CAN BE CALIBRATED TO MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.

VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, SUCH AS CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD

CURVES, DISCOUNT RATES (INCLUDING THOSE DERIVED FROM INTEREST RATES ON COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND POSTED AS SPECIFIED IN CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FOR COLLATERALIZED DERIVATIVES), CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, PREPAYMENT RATES, LOSS SEVERITY

RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES CAN BE VERIFIED TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES.

LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES

ARE VALUED USING MODELS WHICH UTILIZE OBSERVABLE LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS, AS WELL AS UNOBSERVABLE LEVEL 3 INPUTS. THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.



FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3,

SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE CORRELATIONS OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (E.G., THE CORRELATION BETWEEN EURO INFLATION AND EURO INTEREST RATES) AND SPECIFIC INTEREST RATE VOLATILITIES.



FOR LEVEL 3 CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE ILLIQUID CREDIT SPREADS AND

UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS, WHICH ARE UNIQUE TO SPECIFIC REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS AND REFERENCE ENTITIES, RECOVERY RATES AND CERTAIN CORRELATIONS REQUIRED TO VALUE CREDIT DERIVATIVES (E.G., THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATION

RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER).



FOR LEVEL 3 COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE VOLATILITIES FOR OPTIONS WITH

STRIKE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES AND PRICES OR SPREADS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE PRODUCT QUALITY OR PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THE COMMODITY IS NOT ALIGNED WITH BENCHMARK INDICES.



FOR LEVEL 3 EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS GENERALLY INCLUDE EQUITY VOLATILITY

INPUTS FOR OPTIONS THAT ARE LONG-DATED AND/OR HAVE STRIKE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES. IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED TRADES REQUIRES THE USE OF LEVEL 3 CORRELATION INPUTS, SUCH AS THE

CORRELATION OF THE PRICE PERFORMANCE OF TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS OR THE CORRELATION OF THE PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR A BASKET OF STOCKS TO ANOTHER ASSET CLASS SUCH AS COMMODITIES.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL VALUATION OF A LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE, THE FIRM UPDATES THE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 INPUTS TO REFLECT

OBSERVABLE MARKET CHANGES AND ANY RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN LEVEL 3. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR BROKER OR DEALER

QUOTATIONS OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL VALUE BY REFERENCE TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE. SEE BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIOS AND ARE USED TO ADJUST THE MID-MARKET VALUATIONS

PRODUCED BY DERIVATIVE PRICING MODELS TO THE APPROPRIATE EXIT PRICE VALUATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCORPORATE BID/OFFER SPREADS, THE COST OF LIQUIDITY, CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS AND FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE CREDIT AND

FUNDING RISK INHERENT IN THE UNCOLLATERALIZED PORTION OF DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRM ALSO MAKES FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO COLLATERALIZED DERIVATIVES WHERE THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT DO NOT PERMIT THE FIRM TO DELIVER OR REPLEDGE COLLATERAL

RECEIVED. MARKET-BASED INPUTS ARE GENERALLY USED WHEN CALIBRATING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.

IN ADDITION, FOR

DERIVATIVES THAT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THE FIRM MAKES MODEL OR EXIT PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VALUATION UNCERTAINTY PRESENT IN THE TRANSACTION.



THE RANGES, AVERAGES AND MEDIANS OF THESE INPUTS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROPRIATE INPUTS TO USE WHEN

CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE DERIVATIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HIGHEST CORRELATION FOR INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES IS APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING A SPECIFIC INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE BUT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING ANY OTHER INTEREST RATE

DERIVATIVE. ACCORDINGLY, THE RANGES OF INPUTS DO NOT REPRESENT UNCERTAINTY IN, OR POSSIBLE RANGES OF, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES.



INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITIES DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING OPTION PRICING MODELS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES

ARE VALUED USING OPTION PRICING, CORRELATION AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, AND COMMODITIES DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING OPTION PRICING AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS.



THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE INSTRUMENT MAY BE DETERMINED USING MULTIPLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES. FOR EXAMPLE,

OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED TOGETHER TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. THEREFORE, THE LEVEL 3 BALANCE ENCOMPASSES BOTH OF THESE TECHNIQUES.



CORRELATION WITHIN CURRENCIES AND EQUITIES INCLUDES CROSS-PRODUCT CORRELATION.



NATURAL GAS SPREAD REPRESENTS THE SPREAD PER MILLION BRITISH THERMAL UNITS OF NATURAL GAS.



OIL SPREAD REPRESENTS THE SPREAD PER BARREL OF OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS.

RANGE OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE

FOLLOWING IS INFORMATION ABOUT THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.



CORRELATION.

RANGES FOR CORRELATION COVER A VARIETY OF

UNDERLIERS BOTH WITHIN ONE MARKET (E.G., EQUITY INDEX AND EQUITY SINGLE STOCK NAMES) AND ACROSS MARKETS (E.G., CORRELATION OF AN INTEREST RATE AND A FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE), AS WELL AS ACROSS REGIONS. GENERALLY, CROSS-PRODUCT CORRELATION INPUTS ARE

USED TO VALUE MORE COMPLEX INSTRUMENTS AND ARE LOWER THAN CORRELATION INPUTS ON ASSETS WITHIN THE SAME DERIVATIVE PRODUCT TYPE.



VOLATILITY.

RANGES FOR VOLATILITY COVER NUMEROUS UNDERLIERS

ACROSS A VARIETY OF MARKETS, MATURITIES AND STRIKE PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, VOLATILITY OF EQUITY INDICES IS GENERALLY LOWER THAN VOLATILITY OF SINGLE STOCKS.



CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES.

THE

RANGES FOR CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES COVER A VARIETY OF UNDERLIERS (INDEX AND SINGLE NAMES), REGIONS, SECTORS, MATURITIES AND CREDIT QUALITIES (HIGH-YIELD AND INVESTMENT-GRADE). THE BROAD RANGE OF THIS POPULATION GIVES

RISE TO THE WIDTH OF THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.



COMMODITY PRICES AND SPREADS.

THE RANGES FOR COMMODITY PRICES

AND SPREADS COVER VARIABILITY IN PRODUCTS, MATURITIES AND DELIVERY LOCATIONS.

SENSITIVITY OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT TO CHANGES

IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIRECTIONAL SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS TO CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, IN ISOLATION.



CORRELATION.

IN GENERAL, FOR CONTRACTS WHERE THE HOLDER BENEFITS

FROM THE CONVERGENCE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR INDEX PRICES (E.G., INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, INFLATION RATES AND EQUITY PRICES), AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION RESULTS IN A HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.



VOLATILITY.

IN GENERAL, FOR PURCHASED OPTIONS, AN INCREASE IN

VOLATILITY RESULTS IN A HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.



CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES.

IN

GENERAL, THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASED CREDIT PROTECTION INCREASES AS CREDIT SPREADS OR UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS INCREASE OR RECOVERY RATES DECREASE. CREDIT SPREADS, UPFRONT CREDIT POINTS AND RECOVERY RATES ARE STRONGLY RELATED TO DISTINCTIVE RISK

FACTORS OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE REFERENCE ENTITY-SPECIFIC FACTORS SUCH AS LEVERAGE, VOLATILITY AND INDUSTRY, MARKET-BASED RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS BORROWING COSTS OR LIQUIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATION, AND

MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS.



COMMODITY PRICES AND SPREADS.

IN GENERAL, FOR CONTRACTS WHERE

THE HOLDER IS RECEIVING A COMMODITY, AN INCREASE IN THE SPREAD (PRICE DIFFERENCE FROM A BENCHMARK INDEX DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN QUALITY OR DELIVERY LOCATION) OR PRICE RESULTS IN A HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

DUE TO THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF EACH OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES, THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF INPUTS IS NOT NECESSARILY UNIFORM

WITHIN EACH PRODUCT TYPE.

DERIVATIVES. IN THE TABLE BELOW.



CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE PRESENTED FOR ALL DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE CATEGORIZED AS

LEVEL 3 AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD.



NET UNREALIZED GAINS/(LOSSES) RELATE TO INSTRUMENTS THAT WERE STILL HELD AT PERIOD-END.



IF A DERIVATIVE WAS TRANSFERRED TO LEVEL 3 DURING A REPORTING PERIOD, ITS ENTIRE GAIN OR LOSS FOR THE

PERIOD IS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS ARE REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.



POSITIVE AMOUNTS FOR TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 3 AND NEGATIVE AMOUNTS FOR TRANSFERS OUT OF LEVEL 3

REPRESENT NET TRANSFERS OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS. NEGATIVE AMOUNTS FOR TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 3 AND POSITIVE AMOUNTS FOR TRANSFERS OUT OF LEVEL 3 REPRESENT NET TRANSFERS OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.



A DERIVATIVE WITH LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 IN ITS ENTIRETY IF IT

HAS AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUT.



IF THERE IS ONE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUT, THE ENTIRE GAIN OR LOSS FROM ADJUSTING ONLY OBSERVABLE INPUTS

(I.E., LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 INPUTS) IS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3.



GAINS OR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN LEVEL 3 RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2

INPUTS ARE FREQUENTLY OFFSET BY GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES AND/OR LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS. AS A RESULT, GAINS/(LOSSES) INCLUDED IN THE LEVEL 3 ROLLFORWARD BELOW

DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE OVERALL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

$(240) MILLION REPORTED IN MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS RESPECTIVELY.

THE NET

UNREALIZED GAIN ON LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES OF $777 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAINS ON CERTAIN EQUITY DERIVATIVES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN EQUITY PRICES.

TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES DURING 2016 PRIMARILY REFLECTED TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE ASSETS FROM LEVEL 2,

PRINCIPALLY DUE TO REDUCED TRANSPARENCY OF CERTAIN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THESE DERIVATIVES, AND TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN CREDIT DERIVATIVE ASSETS FROM LEVEL 2 PRIMARILY DUE TO UNOBSERVABLE CREDIT SPREAD INPUTS BECOMING SIGNIFICANT TO

THE NET RISK OF CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS.

TRANSFERS OUT OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES DURING 2016 PRIMARILY REFLECTED TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN CREDIT

DERIVATIVES ASSETS TO LEVEL 2, PRIMARILY DUE TO UNOBSERVABLE CREDIT SPREAD INPUTS NO LONGER BEING SIGNIFICANT TO THE NET RISK OF CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS.

$228 MILLION REPORTED IN MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS RESPECTIVELY.

THE NET

UNREALIZED GAIN ON LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES OF $679 MILLION FOR 2015 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAINS ON CERTAIN CREDIT DERIVATIVES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF WIDER CREDIT SPREADS, AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES.

CREDIT

DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO A BROAD ARRAY OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS

AND TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED BASED ON THE FIRMS NET RISK POSITION.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS AND CAN HAVE VARIOUS SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT CONVENTIONS. CREDIT EVENTS INCLUDE FAILURE

TO PAY, BANKRUPTCY, ACCELERATION OF INDEBTEDNESS, RESTRUCTURING, REPUDIATION AND DISSOLUTION OF THE REFERENCE ENTITY.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO

THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES.



CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS PROTECT

THE BUYER AGAINST THE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL ON ONE OR MORE BONDS, LOANS OR MORTGAGES (REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS) IN THE EVENT THE ISSUER (REFERENCE ENTITY) OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS SUFFERS A CREDIT EVENT. THE BUYER OF PROTECTION PAYS AN INITIAL OR

PERIODIC PREMIUM TO THE SELLER AND RECEIVES PROTECTION FOR THE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. IF THERE IS NO CREDIT EVENT, AS DEFINED IN THE CONTRACT, THE SELLER OF PROTECTION MAKES NO PAYMENTS TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION. HOWEVER, IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS,

THE SELLER OF PROTECTION IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION, WHICH IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT.



CREDIT OPTIONS.

IN A CREDIT OPTION, THE OPTION WRITER ASSUMES

THE OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OR SELL A REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT A SPECIFIED PRICE OR CREDIT SPREAD. THE OPTION PURCHASER BUYS THE RIGHT, BUT DOES NOT ASSUME THE OBLIGATION, TO SELL THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION TO, OR PURCHASE IT FROM, THE OPTION WRITER.

THE PAYMENTS ON CREDIT OPTIONS DEPEND EITHER ON A PARTICULAR CREDIT SPREAD OR THE PRICE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.



CREDIT INDICES, BASKETS AND TRANCHES.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY

REFERENCE A BASKET OF SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS OR A BROAD-BASED INDEX. IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS IN ONE OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, THE PROTECTION SELLER PAYS THE PROTECTION BUYER. THE PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY A PRO-RATA PORTION OF

THE TRANSACTIONS TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT BASED ON THE UNDERLYING DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION. IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, THE CREDIT RISK OF A BASKET OR INDEX IS SEPARATED INTO VARIOUS PORTIONS (TRANCHES), EACH HAVING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

SUBORDINATION. THE MOST JUNIOR TRANCHES COVER INITIAL DEFAULTS AND ONCE LOSSES EXCEED THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE JUNIOR TRANCHES, ANY EXCESS LOSS IS COVERED BY THE NEXT MOST SENIOR TRANCHE IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE.



TOTAL RETURN SWAPS.

A TOTAL RETURN SWAP TRANSFERS THE RISKS

RELATING TO ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF A REFERENCE OBLIGATION FROM THE PROTECTION BUYER TO THE PROTECTION SELLER. TYPICALLY, THE PROTECTION BUYER RECEIVES FROM THE PROTECTION SELLER A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST AND PROTECTION AGAINST ANY REDUCTION IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, AND IN RETURN THE PROTECTION SELLER RECEIVES THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, PLUS ANY INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.

THE FIRM ECONOMICALLY HEDGES ITS EXPOSURE TO WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVES PRIMARILY BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES WITH

IDENTICAL UNDERLIERS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO STRINGENT COLLATERAL THRESHOLDS. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A SPECIFIED TRIGGER EVENT,

THE FIRM MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS UNDERLYING A PARTICULAR WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVE, AND CONSEQUENTLY MAY, UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, RECOVER AMOUNTS ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE EVENT OF

DEFAULT.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES HAD TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $690.47 BILLION AND

$733.98 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TOTAL NET NOTIONAL PURCHASED PROTECTION OF $43.51 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 2015, WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES HAD TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $923.48 BILLION AND

$968.68 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TOTAL NET NOTIONAL PURCHASED PROTECTION OF $45.20 BILLION. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSACTED UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO POST

COLLATERAL OR TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS. THE FIRM ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF THESE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS BY DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT WOULD OCCUR ASSUMING A DOWNGRADE BY

ALL RATING AGENCIES. A DOWNGRADE BY ANY ONE RATING AGENCY, DEPENDING ON THE AGENCYS RELATIVE RATINGS OF THE FIRM AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNGRADE, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE BY ALL RATING AGENCIES.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR (I) CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS USED TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE

UNSECURED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN FIXED-RATE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND (II) CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT USED TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ON THE FIRMS

NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.

TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT

REDUCING THE RISK FROM THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MUST FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AT INCEPTION AND TEST THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT CONTINUES TO BE

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE OVER THE LIFE OF THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE FIRM DESIGNATES CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS HEDGE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

DESIGNATED BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE (E.G., LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) OR OVERNIGHT INDEX SWAP RATE (OIS)), EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS INTO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM APPLIES A STATISTICAL METHOD THAT UTILIZES REGRESSION ANALYSIS WHEN ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FAIR VALUE HEDGING

RELATIONSHIPS IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE RISK BEING HEDGED (I.E., INTEREST RATE RISK). AN INTEREST RATE SWAP IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CHANGES IN THE HEDGED RISK WHEN THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS IN A COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION OF 80% OR GREATER AND A SLOPE BETWEEN 80% AND 125%.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST

EXPENSE. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED IS REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER ITS REMAINING LIFE. GAINS OR LOSSES

RESULTING FROM HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. WHEN A DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, ANY REMAINING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND PAR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM IS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE HEDGED ITEM USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. SEE NOTE 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE GAINS/(LOSSES) FROM INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES, THE RELATED HEDGED BORROWINGS AND DEPOSITS,

AND THE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE DERIVATIVES, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF AMORTIZATION OF PREPAID CREDIT SPREADS RESULTING FROM THE PASSAGE OF TIME.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE FIRM SEEKS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON ITS NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH THE

USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE OVERALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD

CONTRACTS (I.E., BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD RATES). FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE IS ASSESSED BASED ON CHANGES IN SPOT RATES.

FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE

IN ADDITION TO ALL CASH AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR

VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE PRIMARILY UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. THE PRIMARY

REASONS FOR ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE TO.



REFLECT ECONOMIC EVENTS IN EARNINGS ON A TIMELY BASIS;



MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES (E.G., TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCINGS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WHEREAS THE RELATED SECURED FINANCING WOULD BE RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS ABSENT ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION); AND



ADDRESS SIMPLIFICATION AND COST-BENEFIT CONSIDERATIONS (E.G., ACCOUNTING FOR HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT

FAIR VALUE IN THEIR ENTIRETY VERSUS BIFURCATION OF EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DEBT HOSTS).

HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN BIFURCATABLE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND

DO NOT REQUIRE SETTLEMENT BY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS (E.G., PHYSICAL COMMODITIES). IF THE FIRM ELECTS TO BIFURCATE THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE FROM THE ASSOCIATED DEBT, THE DERIVATIVE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THE HOST

CONTRACT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT AMORTIZED COST, ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY FAIR VALUE HEDGES. IF THE FIRM DOES NOT ELECT TO BIFURCATE, THE ENTIRE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION INCLUDE.



REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL RESALE AGREEMENTS;



SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION;



SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS, INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCINGS RATHER

THAN SALES;



CERTAIN UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, CONSISTING OF ALL COMMERCIAL PAPER AND CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS;



CERTAIN UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PREPAID COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS;



CERTAIN RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED

LOANS RATHER THAN PURCHASES AND CERTAIN MARGIN LOANS;



CERTAIN TIME DEPOSITS ISSUED BY THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES (DEPOSITS WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE NOT

ELIGIBLE FOR A FAIR VALUE OPTION ELECTION), INCLUDING STRUCTURED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, WHICH ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; AND



CERTAIN SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES.

VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND SIGNIFICANT INPUTS

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE ARE GENERALLY VALUED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES, WHICH INCORPORATE

INPUTS WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY, AND ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 BECAUSE THE INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE FOR LIQUIDITY AND FOR COUNTERPARTY AND THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY.

SEE BELOW FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS USED TO VALUE OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING

THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES. THESE RANGES REPRESENT THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE USED IN THE VALUATION OF EACH TYPE OF OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE RANGES AND WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THESE INPUTS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROPRIATE INPUTS TO USE WHEN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY ONE INSTRUMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HIGHEST YIELD PRESENTED BELOW FOR

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS IS APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING A SPECIFIC AGREEMENT IN THAT CATEGORY BUT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR VALUING ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS IN THAT CATEGORY. ACCORDINGLY, THE RANGES OF INPUTS PRESENTED BELOW DO NOT REPRESENT UNCERTAINTY

IN, OR POSSIBLE RANGES OF, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES.

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED.

THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES

BORROWED AND LOANED ARE FUNDING SPREADS, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INTEREST RATES. AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THE FIRM HAD NO LEVEL 3 RESALE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED OR SECURITIES

LOANED. AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL. SEE NOTE 10 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND FINANCINGS.

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS.

THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS AT FAIR VALUE ARE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INTEREST RATES, FUNDING SPREADS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL

DELIVERED BY THE FIRM (WHICH IS DETERMINED USING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, MARKET PRICES, MARKET YIELDS AND RECOVERY ASSUMPTIONS) AND THE FREQUENCY OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL CALLS. THE RANGES OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS USED TO VALUE LEVEL 3 OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016.



YIELD: 0.4% TO 16.6% (WEIGHTED AVERAGE: 3.5%)



DURATION: 0.1 TO 5.7 YEARS (WEIGHTED AVERAGE: 2.3 YEARS)

AS OF DECEMBER 2015.



YIELD: 0.6% TO 10.0% (WEIGHTED AVERAGE: 2.7%)



DURATION: 1.6 TO 8.8 YEARS (WEIGHTED AVERAGE: 2.8 YEARS)

GENERALLY, INCREASES IN FUNDING SPREADS, YIELD OR DURATION, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A LOWER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. DUE TO THE

DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF EACH OF THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS, THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF INPUTS IS NOT NECESSARILY UNIFORM ACROSS SUCH FINANCINGS. SEE NOTE 10 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND

FINANCINGS.

UNSECURED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF UNSECURED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AT FAIR VALUE ARE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INTEREST RATES, THE CREDIT SPREADS OF THE FIRM, AS

WELL AS COMMODITY PRICES IN THE CASE OF PREPAID COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS. THE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE COMPONENT OF HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE FIRMS OTHER DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS. SEE NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DERIVATIVES. SEE NOTES 15 AND 16 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT UNSECURED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS UNSECURED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH ARE HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO VALUE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE COMPONENT OF THESE BORROWINGS, THESE INPUTS ARE INCORPORATED IN THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

DISCLOSURES RELATED TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN NOTE 7.

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES AT FAIR VALUE ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED LOANS RATHER THAN PURCHASES. THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF SUCH

RECEIVABLES ARE COMMODITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND FUNDING SPREADS. AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THE FIRMS LEVEL 3 RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND

COUNTERPARTIES WERE NOT MATERIAL.

DEPOSITS.

THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF TIME DEPOSITS ARE INTEREST RATES AND THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE INPUTS USED TO VALUE THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE COMPONENT OF HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INPUTS

USED TO VALUE THE FIRMS OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. SEE NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DERIVATIVES. SEE NOTE 14 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DEPOSITS.

THE FIRMS DEPOSITS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO

VALUE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE COMPONENT OF THESE DEPOSITS, THESE INPUTS ARE INCORPORATED IN THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE DISCLOSURES RELATED TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN NOTE 7.

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. THERE WERE NO

CREDIT QUALITY

THE FIRMS RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS INCLUDES EVALUATING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS LOANS

RECEIVABLE. FOR LOANS RECEIVABLE (EXCLUDING PCI LOANS), THE FIRM PERFORMS CREDIT REVIEWS WHICH INCLUDE INITIAL AND ONGOING ANALYSES OF ITS BORROWERS. A CREDIT REVIEW IS AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS OF A BORROWER TO MEET

ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, RESULTING IN AN INTERNAL CREDIT RATING. THE DETERMINATION OF INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS ALSO INCORPORATES ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATURE OF AND OUTLOOK FOR THE BORROWERS INDUSTRY, AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

THE FIRM ALSO ASSIGNS A REGULATORY RISK RATING TO SUCH LOANS BASED ON THE DEFINITIONS PROVIDED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS GROSS LOANS RECEIVABLE (EXCLUDING PCI LOANS OF $3.97 BILLION AND $2.12 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND

DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE NOT ASSIGNED A CREDIT RATING EQUIVALENT) AND RELATED LENDING COMMITMENTS BY THE FIRMS INTERNALLY DETERMINED PUBLIC RATING AGENCY EQUIVALENT AND BY REGULATORY RISK RATING. NON-CRITICIZED/PASS LOANS

AND LENDING COMMITMENTS REPRESENT LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS THAT ARE PERFORMING AND/OR DO NOT DEMONSTRATE ADVERSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE LIKELY TO RESULT IN A CREDIT LOSS.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO ECONOMIC HEDGES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK ON CERTAIN LOANS RECEIVABLE AND

COMMERCIAL LENDING COMMITMENTS (BOTH OF WHICH ARE HELD FOR INVESTMENT) RELATED TO THE FIRMS RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES. SUCH HEDGES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 18 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COMMERCIAL LENDING

COMMITMENTS AND ASSOCIATED HEDGES.

LOANS RECEIVABLE (EXCLUDING PCI LOANS) ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FIRM

WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DUE UNDER THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN. AT THAT TIME, LOANS ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS AND ALL ACCRUED BUT UNCOLLECTED INTEREST IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME, AND

INTEREST SUBSEQUENTLY COLLECTED IS RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS TO THE EXTENT THE LOAN BALANCE IS DEEMED COLLECTIBLE. OTHERWISE, ALL CASH RECEIVED IS USED TO REDUCE THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM MAY ALSO MODIFY THE

ORIGINAL TERMS OF A LOAN AGREEMENT BY GRANTING A CONCESSION TO A BORROWER EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS AND TYPICALLY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, PAYMENT EXTENSIONS, AND

MODIFICATION OF LOAN COVENANTS. LOANS MODIFIED IN A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC LOAN-LEVEL RESERVES.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THE GROSS CARRYING VALUE OF IMPAIRED LOANS RECEIVABLE (EXCLUDING PCI LOANS) ON NON-ACCRUAL

STATUS WERE $404 MILLION AND $223 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 2016, SUCH LOANS INCLUDED $142 MILLION OF CORPORATE LOANS THAT WERE MODIFIED IN A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING, AND THE FIRM HAD $144 MILLION IN LENDING

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THESE LOANS. THERE WERE NO SUCH LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 2015.

FOR PCI LOANS, THE FIRMS RISK ASSESSMENT

PROCESS INCLUDES REVIEWING CERTAIN KEY METRICS, SUCH AS DELINQUENCY STATUS, COLLATERAL VALUES, CREDIT SCORES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRM CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON THE PCI LOANS OR POOLS OF

LOANS, SUCH LOANS ARE PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS

THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS COMPRISED OF SPECIFIC LOAN-LEVEL RESERVES,

PORTFOLIO LEVEL RESERVES, AND RESERVES ON PCI LOANS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.



SPECIFIC LOAN-LEVEL RESERVES ARE DETERMINED ON LOANS (EXCLUDING PCI LOANS) THAT EXHIBIT CREDIT QUALITY

WEAKNESS AND ARE THEREFORE INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT.



PORTFOLIO LEVEL RESERVES ARE DETERMINED ON LOANS (EXCLUDING PCI LOANS) NOT DEEMED IMPAIRED BY AGGREGATING

GROUPS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS AND ESTIMATING THE PROBABLE LOSS INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO.



RESERVES ON PCI LOANS ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE REASSESSED ON

A QUARTERLY BASIS, WILL BE LOWER THAN THOSE USED TO ESTABLISH THE CURRENT EFFECTIVE YIELD FOR SUCH LOANS OR POOLS OF LOANS. IF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE DETERMINED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE USED TO ESTABLISH THE CURRENT EFFECTIVE

YIELD, SUCH INCREASES ARE INITIALLY RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION TO ANY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND ANY REMAINING INCREASES ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST INCOME PROSPECTIVELY OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN OR POOLS OF LOANS AS AN

INCREASE TO THE EFFECTIVE YIELD.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS DETERMINED USING VARIOUS INPUTS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY

DEFAULT AND LOSS DATA, CURRENT MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS, BORROWERS CAPACITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, BORROWERS COUNTRY OF RISK, LOAN SENIORITY AND COLLATERAL TYPE. MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF LOAN LOSSES ENTAILS JUDGMENT

ABOUT LOAN COLLECTABILITY AT THE REPORTING DATES, AND THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THOSE JUDGMENTS. WHILE MANAGEMENT USES THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE THIS ESTIMATE, FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALLOWANCE MAY BE NECESSARY BASED

ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OR VARIANCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE ORIGINAL ASSUMPTIONS USED. LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE. AS OF DECEMBER 2016

AND DECEMBER 2015, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS LOANS RECEIVABLE WERE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL.

THE FIRM ALSO RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON LENDING COMMITMENTS THAT ARE HELD FOR

INVESTMENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. SUCH ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED USING THE SAME METHODOLOGY AS THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHILE ALSO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROBABILITY OF DRAWDOWNS OR FUNDING, AND IS INCLUDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF SUCH LENDING COMMITMENTS WERE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL.

BORROWED, AND $2.65 BILLION AND $466 MILLION OF SECURITIES LOANED WERE AT FAIR VALUE, RESPECTIVELY.

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

A RESALE AGREEMENT IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM PURCHASES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM A SELLER, TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH, AND

SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO RESELL THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO THE SELLER AT A STATED PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST AT A FUTURE DATE.

A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM SELLS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO A BUYER, TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH, AND

SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM THE BUYER AT A STATED PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST AT A FUTURE DATE.

EVEN THOUGH REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING REPOS- AND REVERSES-TO-MATURITY) INVOLVE THE LEGAL TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OF

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO BE REPURCHASED OR RESOLD BEFORE OR AT THE MATURITY OF THE AGREEMENT. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED OR SOLD IN RESALE AND

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY, AND INVESTMENT-GRADE SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM RECEIVES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND MAKES DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. TO MITIGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON A DAILY BASIS,

AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR RESALE AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM TYPICALLY REQUIRES COLLATERAL WITH A FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE CARRYING VALUE

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED TRANSACTIONS

IN A SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTION, THE FIRM BORROWS SECURITIES FROM A COUNTERPARTY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH OR SECURITIES. WHEN THE FIRM RETURNS

THE SECURITIES, THE COUNTERPARTY RETURNS THE CASH OR SECURITIES. INTEREST IS GENERALLY PAID PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION.

IN A SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTION, THE FIRM LENDS SECURITIES TO A COUNTERPARTY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH OR SECURITIES. WHEN THE COUNTERPARTY

RETURNS THE SECURITIES, THE FIRM RETURNS THE CASH OR SECURITIES POSTED AS COLLATERAL. INTEREST IS GENERALLY PAID PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE FIRM RECEIVES SECURITIES BORROWED AND MAKES DELIVERY OF SECURITIES LOANED. TO MITIGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE

OF THESE SECURITIES ON A DAILY BASIS, AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM TYPICALLY REQUIRES COLLATERAL WITH A FAIR VALUE

APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTION.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. SEE NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN SECURITIES SERVICES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED

INTEREST. AS THESE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY CAN BE TERMINATED ON DEMAND, THEY EXHIBIT LITTLE, IF ANY, SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THEREFORE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE

CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IN

NOTES 6 THROUGH 8. HAD THESE ARRANGEMENTS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015.

NOTE 11.

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CORPORATE BONDS, LOANS AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS BY SELLING THESE

ASSETS TO SECURITIZATION VEHICLES (E.G., TRUSTS, CORPORATE ENTITIES AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES) OR THROUGH A RESECURITIZATION. THE FIRM ACTS AS UNDERWRITER OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INVESTORS. THE FIRMS RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIZATIONS.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES ARE DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES THAT GIVE THE INVESTORS RIGHTS TO RECEIVE ALL OR PORTIONS OF SPECIFIED CASH INFLOWS TO A SECURITIZATION VEHICLE AND INCLUDE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND/OR OTHER CASH INFLOWS.

THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE USED TO PAY THE TRANSFEROR FOR THE FINANCIAL ASSETS SOLD TO THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLE OR TO PURCHASE SECURITIES WHICH SERVE AS COLLATERAL.

THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR A SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN IT HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE

TRANSFERRED ASSETS. PRIOR TO SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ASSETS PENDING TRANSFER AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE DOES NOT TYPICALLY RECOGNIZE SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES UPON THE TRANSFER OF ASSETS. NET REVENUES FROM UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES

ARE RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF THE UNDERLYING BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO INVESTORS.

FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, THE ASSETS REMAIN IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND THE TRANSFER IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A COLLATERALIZED FINANCING, WITH THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION. SEE

NOTES 10 AND 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM GENERALLY

RECEIVES CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BUT MAY ALSO HAVE CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH TRANSFERRED ASSETS, INCLUDING OWNERSHIP OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS, PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED

SECURITIES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PURCHASE SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED SECURITIES ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION VEHICLES (WHICH ARE TYPICALLY VIES) IN CONNECTION WITH SECONDARY MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES.

THE PRIMARY RISKS INCLUDED IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND OTHER INTERESTS FROM THE FIRMS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH SECURITIZATION VEHICLES

ARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, THE POSITION OF THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLE AND THE MARKET YIELD FOR THE SECURITY. THESE INTERESTS ARE PRIMARILY ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND

ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND OTHER INTERESTS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF 3.5 YEARS AS OF DECEMBER 2016, AND A FAIR VALUE OF $44 MILLION AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF 3.5 YEARS AS OF DECEMBER 2015. DUE TO THE NATURE AND CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF THESE RETAINED

INTERESTS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS FOR CONSTANT PREPAYMENT AND DISCOUNT RATES AND THE RELATED SENSITIVITY TO ADVERSE CHANGES ARE NOT MEANINGFUL AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015. THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

A VARIABLE INTEREST IN A VIE IS AN INVESTMENT (E.G., DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES) OR OTHER

INTEREST (E.G., DERIVATIVES OR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS) THAT WILL ABSORB PORTIONS OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND/OR RECEIVE PORTIONS OF THE VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS.

THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES INCLUDE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, CDOS AND CLOS; LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS; LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY; DERIVATIVES THAT MAY INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY AND/OR CREDIT RISK; GUARANTEES; AND

CERTAIN OF THE FEES THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS. CERTAIN INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES THE FIRM ENTERS INTO WITH VIES ARE NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS BECAUSE THEY CREATE, RATHER THAN ABSORB, RISK.

VIES GENERALLY FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF ASSETS BY ISSUING DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE EITHER COLLATERALIZED BY OR INDEXED TO THE ASSETS

HELD BY THE VIE. THE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ISSUED BY A VIE MAY INCLUDE TRANCHES OF VARYING LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES INCLUDES SECURITIZATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11, AND INVESTMENTS

IN AND LOANS TO OTHER TYPES OF VIES, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. SEE NOTE 3 FOR THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATION POLICIES,

THE ENTERPRISE WITH A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE IS KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. THE FIRM DETERMINES

WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE BY PERFORMING AN ANALYSIS THAT PRINCIPALLY CONSIDERS.



WHICH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE;



WHICH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE

VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE;



THE VIES PURPOSE AND DESIGN, INCLUDING THE RISKS THE VIE WAS DESIGNED TO CREATE AND PASS THROUGH TO ITS

VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS;



THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE;



THE TERMS BETWEEN THE VIE AND ITS VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS AND OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED WITH THE VIE; AND



RELATED-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS.

THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS INITIAL EVALUATION OF WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A VIE WHEN CERTAIN RECONSIDERATION EVENTS OCCUR. THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE ON AN ONGOING BASIS BASED ON CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

VIE ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM IS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED WITH VIES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

MORTGAGE-BACKED VIES AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES.

THE FIRM SELLS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES TO MORTGAGE-BACKED VIES AND CORPORATE BONDS AND LOANS TO CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES AND MAY RETAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS SOLD TO THESE VIES. THE FIRM PURCHASES AND

SELLS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY MORTGAGE-BACKED AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES IN CONNECTION WITH MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES WITH CERTAIN OF THESE VIES, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ARE

TYPICALLY NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS. THE FIRM GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK FROM DERIVATIVES WITH THESE VIES.

CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES, USUALLY REFERRED TO AS SYNTHETIC CDOS OR CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VIES, SYNTHETICALLY CREATE

THE EXPOSURE FOR THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THEY ISSUE BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVES, RATHER THAN PURCHASING THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE A SINGLE ASSET, AN INDEX, OR A PORTFOLIO/BASKET OF ASSETS OR INDICES. SEE

NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES. THESE VIES USE THE FUNDS FROM THE SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND THE PREMIUMS RECEIVED FROM CREDIT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES TO PURCHASE SECURITIES WHICH SERVE TO COLLATERALIZE THE

BENEFICIAL INTEREST HOLDERS AND/OR THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THESE VIES MAY ENTER INTO OTHER DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS. THE FIRM MAY BE A COUNTERPARTY TO DERIVATIVES WITH THESE

VIES AND GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS

THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL IS ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE AN

IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. WHEN ASSESSING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, FIRST, QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE ASSESSED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE RESULTS OF THE

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST IS PERFORMED. THE QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS.



THE FIRST STEP COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE

(INCLUDING GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS). IF THE REPORTING UNITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT, A RELATIVE VALUE TECHNIQUE

IS USED BECAUSE THE FIRM BELIEVES MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE THIS TECHNIQUE TO VALUE THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS. THE RELATIVE VALUE TECHNIQUE APPLIES OBSERVABLE PRICE-TO-EARNINGS MULTIPLES OR PRICE-TO-BOOK MULTIPLES AND PROJECTED RETURN ON

EQUITY OF COMPARABLE COMPETITORS TO REPORTING UNITS NET EARNINGS OR NET BOOK VALUE. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT REFLECTS AN ALLOCATION OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT UNDER CURRENTLY APPLICABLE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.



IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF

THE GOODWILL TEST IS PERFORMED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY. AN IMPAIRMENT IS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016, THE FIRM ASSESSED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A QUALITATIVE

ASSESSMENT. MULTIPLE FACTORS WERE ASSESSED WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY OF THESE REPORTING UNITS WAS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ALSO CONSIDERED CHANGES SINCE THE 2015 QUANTITATIVE TEST.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350, THE FIRM CONSIDERED THE

FOLLOWING FACTORS IN THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WHEN EVALUATING WHETHER IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WAS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.



PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.

DURING 2016, THE FIRMS NET

EARNINGS, PRE-TAX MARGIN, DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE, RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE INCREASED AS COMPARED WITH 2015. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS OVERALL COST STRUCTURE DECLINED REFLECTING

THE IMPACT OF EXPENSE SAVINGS INITIATIVES.



FIRM AND INDUSTRY EVENTS.

THERE WERE NO EVENTS, ENTITY-SPECIFIC

OR OTHERWISE, SINCE THE 2015 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST THAT WOULD HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VALUATION OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS.



MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS.

SINCE THE 2015 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL

TEST, THE FIRMS GENERAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED AS CONCERNS ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH MODERATED.



FAIR VALUE INDICATORS.

SINCE THE 2015 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL

TEST, FAIR VALUE INDICATORS IMPROVED AS GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES INCREASED AND CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED. IN ADDITION, MOST PUBLICLY-TRADED INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN STOCK PRICE, PRICE-TO-BOOK MULTIPLES AND

PRICE-TO-EARNINGS MULTIPLES.

AS A RESULT OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED ITS RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE RESULTS OF THE

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, SINCE THE 2015 QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION REPORTING UNIT WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE, THE FIRM

ALSO PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE TEST ON THIS REPORTING UNIT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016. IN THE QUANTITATIVE TEST, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION REPORTING UNIT SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED ITS

CARRYING VALUE.

THEREFORE, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL FOR ALL REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED.

IMPAIRMENTS

THE FIRM TESTS PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS

OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE

AND EVENTUAL DISPOSAL OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, THE FIRM DETERMINES THE ASSET IS IMPAIRED AND RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

WILL RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT PRIOR TO THE SALE OF AN ASSET IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

DURING

BOTH 2016 AND 2015, IMPAIRMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DURING 2014, PRIMARILY

AS A RESULT OF DETERIORATION IN MARKET AND OPERATING CONDITIONS RELATED TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS AND THE FIRMS EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND LEAD MARKET MAKER (LMM) RIGHTS, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN ASSETS WERE

IMPAIRED AND RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS OF $360 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. THESE IMPAIRMENTS CONSISTED OF $268 MILLION RELATED TO PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT,

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, $70 MILLION RELATED TO IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRMS LMM RIGHTS, AND $22 MILLION RELATED TO GOODWILL AS

A RESULT OF THE SALE OF METRO INTERNATIONAL TRADE SERVICES (METRO). THE IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT AND GOODWILL WERE INCLUDED WITHIN THE FIRMS INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT AND THE IMPAIRMENTS

RELATED TO IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE PRINCIPALLY INCLUDED WITHIN THE FIRMS INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT. THE IMPAIRMENTS REPRESENTED THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH ARE CALCULATED USING LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS. THESE FAIR VALUES WERE CALCULATED USING A COMBINATION OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM

THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THESE ASSETS.

THE MURRAY STREET TRUST IS REQUIRED TO REDEEM ITS SENIOR GUARANTEED TRUST SECURITIES UPON THE

MATURITY OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT IT HOLDS.

THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFER PAYMENTS ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT, SUBJECT TO

LIMITATIONS. DURING ANY SUCH DEFERRAL PERIOD, THE FIRM WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR MAKE CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK. HOWEVER, AS GROUP INC. FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEES THE

PAYMENT OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND REDEMPTION AMOUNTS WHEN DUE ON A SENIOR BASIS ON THE SENIOR GUARANTEED TRUST SECURITIES, THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT HELD BY THE MURRAY STREET TRUST IS INCLUDED IN UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AND IS

NOT CLASSIFIED AS SUBORDINATED BORROWINGS.

THE APEX TRUSTS AND THE MURRAY STREET TRUST ARE DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUSTS SPONSORED BY THE FIRM

AND WHOLLY-OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM FOR REGULATORY AND LEGAL PURPOSES BUT ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE

FIRM HAS COVENANTED IN FAVOR OF THE HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S 6.345% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2034, THAT, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, THE FIRM WILL NOT REDEEM OR PURCHASE THE CAPITAL SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE APEX

EXCHANGED A PAR AMOUNT OF $1.32 BILLION OF APEX ISSUED BY THE APEX TRUSTS FOR A CORRESPONDING REDEMPTION VALUE OF THE SERIES E AND SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH WAS PERMITTED UNDER THE COVENANTS REFERENCED ABOVE.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES.

GROUP INC. ISSUED $2.84 BILLION OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT IN 2004 TO GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL I (TRUST), A DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST. THE TRUST ISSUED

$2.75 BILLION OF GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS (TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES) TO THIRD PARTIES AND $85 MILLION OF COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO GROUP INC. AND USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCES TO PURCHASE THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT FROM GROUP INC. DURING 2014 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, THE FIRM PURCHASED $1.43 BILLION (PAR AMOUNT) OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND DELIVERED THESE SECURITIES, ALONG WITH $44.2 MILLION OF COMMON BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS, TO THE TRUST IN EXCHANGE FOR A CORRESPONDING PAR AMOUNT OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT. FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGES, THESE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT WERE EXTINGUISHED. SUBSEQUENT TO

THESE EXTINGUISHMENTS, THE OUTSTANDING PAR AMOUNT OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT HELD BY THE TRUST WAS $1.36 BILLION AND THE OUTSTANDING PAR AMOUNT OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE TRUST WAS

$1.32 BILLION AND $40.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE TRUST IS A WHOLLY-OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM FOR REGULATORY AND LEGAL PURPOSES BUT IS NOT CONSOLIDATED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE FIRM PAYS INTEREST SEMI-ANNUALLY ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 6.345% AND THE DEBT MATURES ON

FEBRUARY 15, 2034. THE COUPON RATE AND THE PAYMENT DATES APPLICABLE TO THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE THE SAME AS THE INTEREST RATE AND PAYMENT DATES FOR THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT. THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO DEFER

PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT, AND THEREFORE CAUSE PAYMENT ON THE TRUSTS PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO BE DEFERRED, IN EACH CASE UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE SEMI-ANNUAL PERIODS. DURING ANY SUCH DEFERRAL PERIOD, THE FIRM

WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR MAKE CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THE TRUST IS NOT PERMITTED TO PAY ANY DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE COMMON BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY GROUP INC. UNLESS ALL DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON

THE PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL.

CONTINGENCIES

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

SEE NOTE 27 FOR INFORMATION

ABOUT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS, AND AGREEMENTS THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO TO TOLL THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES.

THERE ARE

MULTIPLE AREAS OF FOCUS BY REGULATORS, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND OTHERS WITHIN THE MORTGAGE MARKET THAT MAY IMPACT ORIGINATORS, ISSUERS, SERVICERS AND INVESTORS. THERE REMAINS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF ANY

POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THIS MARKET.

THE FIRM HAS NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ORIGINATOR OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.

THE FIRM DID PURCHASE LOANS ORIGINATED BY OTHERS AND GENERALLY RECEIVED LOAN-LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS. DURING THE PERIOD 2005 THROUGH 2008, THE FIRM SOLD APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION OF LOANS TO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES AND APPROXIMATELY

$11 BILLION OF LOANS TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $125 BILLION OF LOANS TO TRUSTS AND OTHER MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES. IN CONNECTION WITH BOTH SALES OF LOANS AND SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM PROVIDED

LOAN-LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS AND/OR ASSIGNED THE LOAN-LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE PARTY FROM WHOM THE FIRM PURCHASED THE LOANS.

THE

FIRMS EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS FOR REPURCHASE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BASED ON ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CLAIMS ARE MADE WITHIN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGREEMENTS TO TOLL THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO WITH TRUSTEES REPRESENTING CERTAIN TRUSTS. BASED UPON THE LARGE NUMBER OF DEFAULTS IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, INCLUDING THOSE SOLD OR SECURITIZED BY THE

FIRM, THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR REPURCHASE CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE FIRM IS NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THAT EXPOSURE AT THIS TIME.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF

METRO, THE FIRM AGREED TO PROVIDE INDEMNITIES TO THE BUYER, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATE TO FUNDAMENTAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AND POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR LEGAL OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF METROS BUSINESS WHILE

THE FIRM OWNED IT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE RMBS WORKING GROUP, THE FIRM AGREED TO

PROVIDE $1.80 BILLION IN CONSUMER RELIEF IN THE FORM OF PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS FOR UNDERWATER HOMEOWNERS AND DISTRESSED BORROWERS; FINANCING FOR CONSTRUCTION, REHABILITATION AND PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING; AND SUPPORT FOR DEBT

RESTRUCTURING, FORECLOSURE PREVENTION AND HOUSING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS LAND BANKS.

DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS DERIVATIVES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S. GAAP, INCLUDING WRITTEN EQUITY AND COMMODITY PUT OPTIONS, WRITTEN CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS, FLOORS AND

SWAPTIONS. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RISK MANAGED TOGETHER WITH DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE, AND THEREFORE THE AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE ABOVE DO NOT REFLECT THE FIRMS OVERALL RISK RELATED TO ITS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVES ARE NOT REQUIRED IF THEY MAY BE CASH SETTLED AND THE FIRM HAS NO BASIS TO CONCLUDE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES HELD THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS AT INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THESE

CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET FOR CERTAIN LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANK COUNTERPARTIES, CENTRAL CLEARING COUNTERPARTIES AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTERPARTIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT INCLUDED SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE TABLE

ABOVE. IN ADDITION, SEE NOTE 7 FOR INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE, WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED THE BEST INDICATION OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK FOR

INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE CARRYING VALUES IN THE TABLE ABOVE EXCLUDE THE EFFECT OF COUNTERPARTY AND CASH COLLATERAL NETTING.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS.

THE FIRM, IN ITS CAPACITY AS AN AGENCY LENDER, INDEMNIFIES MOST OF ITS SECURITIES LENDING CUSTOMERS AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED IN THE

EVENT THAT BORROWERS DO NOT RETURN SECURITIES AND THE COLLATERAL HELD IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED. COLLATERAL HELD BY THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS WAS $34.33 BILLION

AND $32.85 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE THE CONTRACTUAL NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE THAT EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES LENT TO

THE BORROWER, THERE IS MINIMAL PERFORMANCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES.

OTHER

FINANCIAL GUARANTEES.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM PROVIDES OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES (E.G., STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER GUARANTEES TO

ENABLE CLIENTS TO COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS AND FUND-RELATED GUARANTEES). THESE GUARANTEES REPRESENT OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES IF THE GUARANTEED PARTY FAILS TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THAT

BENEFICIARY.

GUARANTEES OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY TRUSTS.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED TRUSTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL I, THE APEX TRUSTS, THE MURRAY STREET TRUST, AND OTHER ENTITIES FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF ISSUING SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, LENDING THE

PROCEEDS TO THE FIRM AND ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FIRM AND THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO THIS PURPOSE. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES. SEE NOTE 16 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING GOLDMAN

SACHS CAPITAL I, THE APEX TRUSTS, AND THE MURRAY STREET TRUST.

THE FIRM EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES FOR THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL

GUARANTEE OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES. TIMELY PAYMENT BY THE FIRM OF AMOUNTS DUE TO THESE ENTITIES UNDER THE GUARANTEE, BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER PAYMENTS DUE ON THE

SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WILL OCCUR, SUCH AS NONPERFORMANCE ON

THE PART OF PAYING AGENTS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR THE FIRM TO MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE ENTITIES OTHER THAN THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEE, BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS AND IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED BY THESE ENTITIES.

INDEMNITIES AND

GUARANTEES OF SERVICE PROVIDERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM INDEMNIFIES AND GUARANTEES CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS CLEARING AND CUSTODY AGENTS, TRUSTEES AND

ADMINISTRATORS, AGAINST SPECIFIED POTENTIAL LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACTING AS AN AGENT OF, OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO, THE FIRM OR ITS AFFILIATES.

THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE LIABLE TO SOME CLIENTS OR OTHER PARTIES FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM ITS CUSTODIAL ROLE OR CAUSED BY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF

THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING SUB-CUSTODIANS AND THIRD-PARTY BROKERS. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT TO SEEK INDEMNIFICATION FROM THESE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR CERTAIN RELEVANT LOSSES INCURRED BY THE FIRM. IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF PAYMENT, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT NETWORKS AS WELL AS SECURITIES EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF SUCH NETWORKS AND EXCHANGES IN THE EVENT OF MEMBER DEFAULTS AND OTHER LOSS

SCENARIOS.

CLEAR AND SETTLE ON BEHALF OF ITS CLIENTS THE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY THEM WITH OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS. THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE SECURED BY THE ASSETS IN THE CLIENTS ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ANY PROCEEDS

RECEIVED FROM THE TRANSACTIONS CLEARED AND SETTLED BY THE FIRM ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT. IN CONNECTION WITH JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS, THE FIRM MAY ISSUE LOAN GUARANTEES UNDER WHICH IT MAY BE LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF FRAUD, MISAPPROPRIATION,

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS INVOLVING THE BORROWER.

THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM

INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015.

OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS.

THE FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TO COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH A VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND OCCASIONALLY INDEMNIFIES THEM AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY THE

BORROWINGS OR DERIVATIVES.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS TO SOME COUNTERPARTIES TO PROTECT THEM IN THE EVENT

ADDITIONAL TAXES ARE OWED OR PAYMENTS ARE WITHHELD, DUE EITHER TO A CHANGE IN OR AN ADVERSE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS GENERALLY ARE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. GENERALLY, THERE ARE

NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND THE CONTINGENCIES TRIGGERING THE OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR. THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE GUARANTEES AND

INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO MATERIAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015.

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES.

GROUP INC. FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEES THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY GS FINANCE CORP., A WHOLLY-OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM.

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.) AND GS BANK USA, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.

IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS,

AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. GROUP INC. IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER ITS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES; HOWEVER, BECAUSE THESE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS ARE ALSO OBLIGATIONS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, GROUP INC.S

LIABILITIES AS GUARANTOR ARE NOT SEPARATELY DISCLOSED.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 20.

REGULATION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF GROUP INC., A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER

THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (BHC ACT) AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER AMENDMENTS TO THE BHC ACT. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE REVISED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS (REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK).

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPRESSED AS CAPITAL RATIOS THAT COMPARE MEASURES OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS).

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS BEING IMPOSED BY THE FIRMS REGULATORS. THE FIRMS CAPITAL LEVELS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, RISK

WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. FURTHERMORE, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATIONS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

CAPITAL FRAMEWORK

THE REGULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED

CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISIONS (BASEL COMMITTEE) CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL III) AND ALSO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK

ACT. UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, THE FIRM IS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATION.

THE FIRM CALCULATES ITS

COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1), TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH (I) THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND MARKET RISK RULES SET OUT IN THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK (TOGETHER, THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES) AND

(II) THE ADVANCED APPROACH AND MARKET RISK RULES SET OUT IN THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK (TOGETHER, THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES). THE LOWER OF EACH RATIO CALCULATED IN (I) AND (II) IS THE RATIO AGAINST WHICH THE FIRMS

COMPLIANCE WITH ITS MINIMUM RATIO REQUIREMENTS IS ASSESSED. EACH OF THE RATIOS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES WAS LOWER THAN THAT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND THEREFORE THE

BASEL III ADVANCED RATIOS WERE THE RATIOS THAT APPLIED TO THE FIRM AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015. THE CAPITAL RATIOS THAT APPLY TO THE FIRM CAN CHANGE IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS AS A RESULT OF THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.



THE MINIMUM RATIOS AS OF DECEMBER 2016 REFLECT (I) THE 25% PHASE-IN OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION

BUFFER (0.625%), (II) THE 25% PHASE-IN OF THE GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANK (G-SIB) BUFFER (0.75%), AND (III) THE COUNTER-CYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER OF ZERO PERCENT, EACH DESCRIBED BELOW.



IN ORDER TO MEET THE QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING WELL-CAPITALIZED UNDER THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARDS REGULATIONS, THE FIRM MUST MEET A HIGHER REQUIRED MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10.0%.



TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY QUARTERLY AVERAGE ADJUSTED TOTAL

ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS).

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORKS REQUIREMENTS PHASE IN OVER TIME (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS). THESE INCLUDE CAPITAL

BUFFERS AND CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS FROM REGULATORY CAPITAL (SUCH AS INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS). THESE DEDUCTIONS FROM REGULATORY CAPITAL ARE REQUIRED TO BE PHASED IN RATABLY PER YEAR FROM 2014 TO 2018, WITH RESIDUAL AMOUNTS

NOT DEDUCTED DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD SUBJECT TO RISK WEIGHTING. IN ADDITION, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS IS BEING PHASED OUT OF REGULATORY CAPITAL. THE MINIMUM CET1, TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS THAT APPLY TO THE FIRM

WILL INCREASE AS THE CAPITAL BUFFERS ARE PHASED IN.

THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF CAPITAL THAT QUALIFIES AS

CET1, BEGAN TO PHASE IN ON JANUARY 1, 2016 AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN INCREMENTS OF 0.625% PER YEAR UNTIL IT REACHES 2.5% OF RWAS ON JANUARY 1, 2019.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE G-SIB BUFFER, WHICH IS AN EXTENSION OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, PHASES IN RATABLY,

BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2016, BECOMING FULLY EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2019, AND MUST CONSIST ENTIRELY OF CAPITAL THAT QUALIFIES AS CET1. THE BUFFER MUST BE CALCULATED USING TWO METHODOLOGIES, THE HIGHER OF WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE

FIRMS MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS. THE FIRST CALCULATION IS BASED UPON THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY WHICH, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, RELIES UPON MEASURES OF THE SIZE, ACTIVITY AND COMPLEXITY OF EACH G-SIB (METHOD ONE). THE SECOND

CALCULATION USES SIMILAR INPUTS, BUT IT INCLUDES A MEASURE OF RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM WHOLESALE FUNDING (METHOD TWO). THE FIRMS G-SIB BUFFER IS 3.0%, USING FINANCIAL DATA PRIMARILY AS OF DECEMBER 2014. THE BUFFER WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY

BASED ON FINANCIAL DATA AS OF THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AND WILL BE APPLICABLE FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ALSO

PROVIDES FOR A COUNTER-CYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHICH IS AN EXTENSION OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, OF UP TO 2.5% (CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF CET1) INTENDED TO COUNTERACT SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS

SET THE COUNTER-CYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER AT ZERO PERCENT.

FAILURE TO MEET THE CAPITAL LEVELS INCLUSIVE OF THE BUFFERS COULD RESULT IN

LIMITATIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE CAPITAL, INCLUDING SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND TO MAKE CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION PAYMENTS.

DEFINITION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

RWAS ARE CALCULATED

IN ACCORDANCE WITH BOTH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES. THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON OF RWA CALCULATIONS UNDER THESE RULES.



RWAS FOR CREDIT RISK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES ARE CALCULATED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER

THAN THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THE USE OF INTERNAL MODELS TO COMPUTE EXPOSURE FOR CREDIT RISK ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHEREAS THE

BASEL III ADVANCED RULES PERMIT THE USE OF SUCH MODELS, SUBJECT TO SUPERVISORY APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, CREDIT RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES UTILIZE PRESCRIBED RISK-WEIGHTS WHICH DEPEND LARGELY ON THE TYPE OF

COUNTERPARTY, RATHER THAN ON INTERNAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SUCH COUNTERPARTIES;



RWAS FOR MARKET RISK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES

ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT; AND



RWAS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK ARE NOT REQUIRED BY THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES, WHEREAS THE BASEL III

ADVANCED RULES DO INCLUDE SUCH A REQUIREMENT.

CREDIT RISK

CREDIT RWAS ARE CALCULATED BASED UPON MEASURES OF EXPOSURE, WHICH ARE THEN RISK WEIGHTED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE CALCULATION OF

CREDIT RWAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES.



FOR CREDIT RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES, THE FIRM UTILIZES PRESCRIBED

RISK-WEIGHTS WHICH DEPEND LARGELY ON THE TYPE OF COUNTERPARTY (E.G., WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK, BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER ENTITY). THE EXPOSURE MEASURE FOR DERIVATIVES IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF POSITIVE NET CURRENT EXPOSURE AND A

PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF EACH DERIVATIVE. THE EXPOSURE MEASURE FOR SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS IS CALCULATED TO REFLECT ADJUSTMENTS FOR POTENTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY, THE SIZE OF WHICH DEPENDS ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE TYPE AND MATURITY

OF THE SECURITY, AND WHETHER IT IS DENOMINATED IN THE SAME CURRENCY AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FINANCING TRANSACTION. THE FIRM UTILIZES SPECIFIC REQUIRED FORMULAIC APPROACHES TO MEASURE EXPOSURE FOR SECURITIZATIONS AND EQUITIES; AND



FOR CREDIT RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES, THE FIRM HAS BEEN GIVEN

PERMISSION BY ITS REGULATORS TO COMPUTE RISK-WEIGHTS FOR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL CREDIT EXPOSURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVANCED INTERNAL RATINGS-BASED APPROACH. THIS APPROACH IS BASED ON INTERNAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF COUNTERPARTIES,

WITH KEY INPUTS BEING THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT, LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND THE EFFECTIVE MATURITY. THE FIRM UTILIZES INTERNAL MODELS TO MEASURE EXPOSURE FOR DERIVATIVES, SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND ELIGIBLE MARGIN LOANS. THE REVISED CAPITAL

FRAMEWORK REQUIRES THAT A BANK HOLDING COMPANY OBTAIN PRIOR WRITTEN AGREEMENT FROM ITS REGULATORS BEFORE USING INTERNAL MODELS FOR SUCH PURPOSES. THE FIRM UTILIZES SPECIFIC REQUIRED FORMULAIC APPROACHES TO MEASURE EXPOSURE FOR SECURITIZATIONS AND

EQUITIES.

MARKET RISK

MARKET RWAS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON MEASURES OF EXPOSURE WHICH INCLUDE VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR), STRESSED VAR, INCREMENTAL RISK AND COMPREHENSIVE

RISK BASED ON INTERNAL MODELS, AND A STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR SPECIFIC RISK. THE MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL RULES REQUIRE THAT A BANK HOLDING COMPANY OBTAIN PRIOR WRITTEN AGREEMENT FROM ITS REGULATORS BEFORE USING ANY INTERNAL MODEL

TO CALCULATE ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENT. THE FOLLOWING IS FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE MEASURES OF EXPOSURE FOR MARKET RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND BASEL III ADVANCED RULES.



VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF INVENTORY POSITIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. FOR BOTH RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS THE FIRM USES A SINGLE VAR MODEL WHICH CAPTURES RISKS

INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. HOWEVER, VAR USED FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (REGULATORY VAR) DIFFERS FROM RISK MANAGEMENT VAR DUE TO DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS AND CONFIDENCE

LEVELS (10-DAY AND 99% FOR REGULATORY VAR VS. ONE-DAY AND 95% FOR RISK MANAGEMENT VAR), AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES IN THE SCOPE OF POSITIONS ON WHICH VAR IS CALCULATED. IN ADDITION, THE DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES USED TO DETERMINE RISK MANAGEMENT VAR

EXCEPTIONS (I.E., COMPARING THE DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES TO THE VAR MEASURE CALCULATED AS OF THE END OF THE PRIOR BUSINESS DAY) INCLUDE INTRADAY ACTIVITY, WHEREAS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REGULATORY CAPITAL RULES REQUIRE THAT INTRADAY

ACTIVITY BE EXCLUDED FROM DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES WHEN CALCULATING REGULATORY VAR EXCEPTIONS. INTRADAY ACTIVITY INCLUDES BID/OFFER NET REVENUES, WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE POSITIVE BY THEIR NATURE. AS A RESULT, THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES

IN THE NUMBER OF VAR EXCEPTIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES CALCULATED FOR REGULATORY VAR COMPARED TO THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT VAR. THE FIRMS POSITIONAL LOSSES OBSERVED ON A SINGLE DAY EXCEEDED ITS 99%

ONE-DAY REGULATORY VAR ON TWO OCCASIONS DURING 2016 AND DID NOT EXCEED ITS 99% ONE-DAY REGULATORY VAR DURING 2015. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE VAR MULTIPLIER USED TO CALCULATE MARKET RWAS;



STRESSED VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF INVENTORY POSITIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, DURING A PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT MARKET STRESS;



INCREMENTAL RISK IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF NON-SECURITIZED INVENTORY POSITIONS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR

CREDIT MIGRATION OF ISSUERS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON;



COMPREHENSIVE RISK IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE, DUE TO PRICE RISK AND DEFAULTS, WITHIN THE FIRMS

CREDIT CORRELATION POSITIONS; AND



SPECIFIC RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ON A POSITION THAT COULD RESULT FROM FACTORS OTHER THAN BROAD MARKET

MOVEMENTS, INCLUDING EVENT RISK, DEFAULT RISK AND IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK. THE STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE SPECIFIC RISK RWAS, BY APPLYING SUPERVISORY DEFINED RISK-WEIGHTING FACTORS AFTER APPLICABLE NETTING IS PERFORMED.

OPERATIONAL RISK

OPERATIONAL RWAS ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES. THE FIRM HAS BEEN GIVEN PERMISSION BY ITS REGULATORS

TO CALCULATE OPERATIONAL RWAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACH, AND THEREFORE UTILIZES AN INTERNAL RISK-BASED MODEL TO QUANTIFY OPERATIONAL RWAS.

CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS

CAPITAL RATIOS AND RWAS.

EACH OF THE RATIOS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL III ADVANCED RULES WAS LOWER THAN THAT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

GS BANK USA, AN

FDIC-INSURED, NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, IS SUPERVISED AND REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC, THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES (NYDFS) AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PROTECTION BUREAU, AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CALCULATED IN SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME MANNER AS THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL, GS BANK USA CALCULATES

ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO STATE MEMBER BANKS. THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK DESCRIBED ABOVE. GS BANK USA IS AN ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING

ORGANIZATION UNDER THE REVISED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK.

UNDER THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION APPLICABLE TO GS BANK

USA, IN ORDER TO MEET THE QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING A WELL-CAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, GS BANK USA MUST MEET HIGHER MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS THAN THE MINIMUM RATIOS IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE MINIMUM

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SIMILAR TO THE FIRM, GS BANK USA IS REQUIRED TO CALCULATE EACH OF THE CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL

AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH BOTH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND BASEL III ADVANCED RULES. THE LOWER OF EACH RATIO CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND BASEL III ADVANCED RULES IS THE RATIO

AGAINST WHICH GS BANK USAS COMPLIANCE WITH ITS MINIMUM RATIO REQUIREMENTS IS ASSESSED. EACH OF THE RATIOS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES WAS LOWER THAN THAT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASEL III

ADVANCED RULES AND THEREFORE THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RATIOS WERE THE RATIOS THAT APPLIED TO GS BANK USA AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015. THE CAPITAL RATIOS THAT APPLY TO GS BANK USA CAN CHANGE IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS AS A RESULT

OF THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

THE INCREASE IN GS BANK USAS STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED CAPITAL RATIOS FROM DECEMBER 2015 TO

DECEMBER 2016 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO NET EARNINGS FOR 2016.

THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARY, GSIB, IS A WHOLLY-OWNED CREDIT INSTITUTION,

REGULATED BY THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA) AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FCA) AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, GSIB WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS.

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES

U.S. REGULATED BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES.

GS&CO. IS THE FIRMS PRIMARY U.S. REGULATED BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY THE SEC AND THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, INC. (FINRA). IN ADDITION, GS&CO. IS A REGISTERED FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE CFTC,

THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. RULE 15C3-1 OF THE SEC AND RULE 1.17 OF THE CFTC SPECIFY UNIFORM MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS DEFINED, FOR THEIR REGISTRANTS, AND ALSO EFFECTIVELY REQUIRE THAT A

SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE REGISTRANTS ASSETS BE KEPT IN RELATIVELY LIQUID FORM. GS&CO. HAS ELECTED TO CALCULATE ITS MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT AS PERMITTED BY

RULE 15C3-1.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, GS&CO. HAD REGULATORY NET CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY

RULE 15C3-1, OF $17.17 BILLION AND $14.75 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY $14.66 BILLION AND $12.37 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION TO ITS ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

GS&CO. IS ALSO REQUIRED TO HOLD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $1 BILLION AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK STANDARDS OF APPENDIX E OF RULE 15C3-1. GS&CO. IS ALSO

REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE SEC IN THE EVENT THAT ITS TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IS LESS THAN $5 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, GS&CO. HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF BOTH THE MINIMUM AND THE

NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.

GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P. (GSEC) WAS ALSO ONE OF THE FIRMS PRIMARY U.S. REGULATED

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES PRIOR TO TRANSFERRING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS CLEARING BUSINESS TO GS&CO. IN 2016. AS OF DECEMBER 2015, GSEC HAD REGULATORY NET CAPITAL, CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL

REQUIREMENT AS PERMITTED BY RULE 15C3-1, OF $1.71 BILLION, WHICH EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT REQUIRED BY $1.59 BILLION.

NON-U.S. REGULATED BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES.

THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL NON-U.S. REGULATED BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) AND GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL). GSI, THE FIRMS U.K. BROKER-DEALER, IS REGULATED

BY THE PRA AND THE FCA. GSJCL, THE FIRMS JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER, IS REGULATED BY JAPANS FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. THESE AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS PROMULGATED BY

AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR LOCAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS.

RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENTS

GROUP INC.S ABILITY

TO WITHDRAW CAPITAL FROM ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS LIMITED BY MINIMUM EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THOSE SUBSIDIARIES, PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO DECLARE AND PAY DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL (E.G., THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY GS BANK USA IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST)

EVEN IF THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARY WOULD SATISFY THE EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO IT AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE DIVIDEND. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC AND THE NYDFS HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE (INCLUDING GS BANK USA) IF, IN THE RELEVANT REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN THE LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING

ORGANIZATION.

AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, GROUP INC. WAS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN $46.49 BILLION AND

$48.09 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF MINIMUM EQUITY CAPITAL IN ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES.

OTHER

THE DEPOSITS OF GS BANK USA ARE INSURED BY

THE FDIC TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES THAT GS BANK USA MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK. THE AMOUNT DEPOSITED BY GS BANK USA HELD AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK WAS

$74.24 BILLION AND $49.36 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNTS BY $74.09 BILLION AND $49.25 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015,

RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT DEPOSITED BY GS BANK USA HELD AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK FROM DECEMBER 2015 TO DECEMBER 2016 IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF GE CAPITAL BANKS ONLINE DEPOSIT PLATFORM

IN APRIL 2016. SEE NOTE 14 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ACQUISITION.

NOTE 21.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE (EPS) IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AND RSUS FOR WHICH NO FUTURE SERVICE IS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION TO THE DELIVERY OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON

STOCK (COLLECTIVELY, BASIC SHARES). DILUTED EPS INCLUDES THE DETERMINANTS OF BASIC EPS AND, IN ADDITION, REFLECTS THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF THE COMMON STOCK DELIVERABLE FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND FOR RSUS FOR WHICH FUTURE SERVICE IS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION

THE VOLCKER RULE RESTRICTS THE FIRM FROM PROVIDING FINANCIAL

SUPPORT TO COVERED FUNDS (AS DEFINED IN THE RULE) AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF ANY APPLICABLE CONFORMANCE PERIOD. AS A GENERAL MATTER, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VOLUNTARY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ANY

COVERED FUNDS BUT MAY CHOOSE TO DO SO WITH RESPECT TO FUNDS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE VOLCKER RULE; HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH SUPPORT IS PROVIDED, THE AMOUNT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE NET TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULT IN TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS IN FUTURE YEARS AND ARE MEASURED USING THE TAX RATES AND LAWS THAT WILL BE IN EFFECT WHEN SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED

TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE REALIZED AND PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE LOSSES IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS. TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER

ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 2016, THE U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS

WERE $207 MILLION AND $800 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IF NOT UTILIZED, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD AND THE STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN 2017. IF THESE CARRYFORWARDS EXPIRE, THEY

WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 2016, FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WERE $1.39 BILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH DO NOT EXPIRE. THE FIRM HAD NO FOREIGN TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS AND NO RELATED NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015.

THE FIRM HAD NO CAPITAL LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS AND NO RELATED NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

INCREASED BY $42 MILLION DURING 2016 AND INCREASED BY $9 MILLION DURING 2015. THE INCREASES IN 2016 AND 2015 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FROM WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO REALIZE ANY BENEFIT.

THE FIRM PERMANENTLY REINVESTS ELIGIBLE EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND, ACCORDINGLY, DOES NOT ACCRUE ANY U.S. INCOME TAXES THAT

WOULD ARISE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED. AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, THIS POLICY RESULTED IN AN UNRECOGNIZED NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $6.18 BILLION AND $5.66 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO REINVESTED

EARNINGS OF $31.24 BILLION AND $28.55 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

THE FIRM RECOGNIZES TAX POSITIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE

SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. A POSITION THAT MEETS THIS STANDARD IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REALIZED ON SETTLEMENT. A

LIABILITY IS ESTABLISHED FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE ACCRUED LIABILITY FOR INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS AND INCOME TAX PENALTIES WAS $141 MILLION AND $101 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 2016 AND DECEMBER 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAX PENALTIES OF $27 MILLION, $17 MILLION AND $45 MILLION FOR 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 2016 DUE TO POTENTIAL AUDIT SETTLEMENTS. HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE ANY POTENTIAL CHANGE.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE CHANGES IN THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THIS

LIABILITY IS INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. SEE NOTE 17 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

THE FIRM HAS BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROCESS PROGRAM BY THE IRS FOR EACH OF THE TAX YEARS FROM 2013 THROUGH 2017. THIS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

THE FIRM REPORTS ITS ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING FOUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INVESTMENT BANKING, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES,

INVESTING & LENDING AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS LINES HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE

SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS: (I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, (II) THEIR METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF CLIENTS THEY SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS A WHOLE, COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY, ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM, AS WELL AS THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES. CONSEQUENTLY, PRE-TAX MARGINS IN

ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES ASSETS (INCLUDING ALLOCATIONS OF GLOBAL CORE LIQUID ASSETS AND CASH, SECURED

CLIENT FINANCING AND OTHER ASSETS), REVENUES AND EXPENSES AMONG THE FOUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF THESE SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE MADE IN ALLOCATING CERTAIN ASSETS, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS

IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY VIEWS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SEGMENTS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE THIRD-PARTY RATES.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE FIRMS NET REVENUES, PRE-TAX EARNINGS AND TOTAL ASSETS BY SEGMENT. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS INFORMATION

PROVIDES A REASONABLE REPRESENTATION OF EACH SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTION TO CONSOLIDATED

THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW) CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE IN EARLY STAGES, AND MANY OF THESE CASES SEEK AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES.

UNDER ASC 450, AN EVENT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IF THE CHANCE OF THE FUTURE EVENT OR EVENTS OCCURRING IS MORE THAN REMOTE

BUT LESS THAN LIKELY AND AN EVENT IS REMOTE IF THE CHANCE OF THE FUTURE EVENT OR EVENTS OCCURRING IS SLIGHT. THUS, REFERENCES TO THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FOR CASES IN WHICH THE FIRM IS ABLE

TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS MEAN THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF LOSS FOR CASES FOR WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES THE RISK OF LOSS IS MORE THAN SLIGHT.

WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS WHERE

THE FULL AMOUNT OF ANY JUDGMENT, OR (III) THE PURCHASERS ARE DEMANDING THAT THE FIRM REPURCHASE SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT HAS ESTIMATED THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS AS BEING EQUAL TO (A) IN THE CASE OF (I), THE

AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES CLAIMED, (B) IN THE CASE OF (II), THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INITIAL SALES PRICE OF THE SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM SOLD IN SUCH OFFERING AND THE ESTIMATED LOWEST SUBSEQUENT PRICE OF SUCH SECURITIES PRIOR TO THE ACTION

BEING COMMENCED AND (C) IN THE CASE OF (III), THE PRICE THAT PURCHASERS PAID FOR THE SECURITIES LESS THE ESTIMATED VALUE, IF ANY, AS OF DECEMBER 2016 OF THE RELEVANT SECURITIES, IN EACH OF CASES (I), (II) AND (III), TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT ANY OTHER FACTORS BELIEVED TO BE RELEVANT TO THE PARTICULAR MATTER OR MATTERS OF THAT TYPE. AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, THE FIRM HAS ESTIMATED THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS FOR SUCH MATTERS AND FOR ANY OTHER

MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW WHERE MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE RESERVES FOR SUCH MATTERS.

MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY UNABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FOR MATTERS OTHER

THAN THOSE INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE ABOVE, INCLUDING WHERE (I) ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT CLAIMED AN AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES, EXCEPT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE MANAGEMENT CAN OTHERWISE DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT,

(II) MATTERS ARE IN EARLY STAGES, (III) MATTERS RELATE TO REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR REVIEWS, EXCEPT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE MANAGEMENT CAN OTHERWISE DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT, (IV) THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE LIKELIHOOD

OF A CLASS BEING CERTIFIED OR THE ULTIMATE SIZE OF THE CLASS, (V) THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE OUTCOME OF PENDING APPEALS OR MOTIONS, (VI) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTUAL ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED, AND/OR (VII) THERE ARE NOVEL LEGAL

ISSUES PRESENTED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE MORTGAGE-RELATED PUT-BACK CLAIMS DESCRIBED BELOW MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE FIRMS LIABILITIES, BUT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTIGATIONS AND REVIEWS DESCRIBED BELOW IN REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND REVIEWS AND RELATED

LITIGATION ALSO GENERALLY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH OTHER MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, THOUGH THE OUTCOMES COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD. SEE NOTE 18 FOR FURTHER
