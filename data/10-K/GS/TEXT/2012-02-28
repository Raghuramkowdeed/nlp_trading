BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY, ARE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY

PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE FIRMS CRITICAL FACILITIES AND TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF FINRA. BECAUSE WE ARE A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY, OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM IS ALSO SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE CRISIS MANAGEMENT, PEOPLE RECOVERY FACILITIES, BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, AND PROCESS

IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES,

POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION ASSETS PROVIDED TO US BY OUR CLIENTS AND THOSE OF THE FIRM FROM CYBER ATTACKS AND OTHER MISAPPROPRIATION, CORRUPTION OR LOSS. SAFEGUARDS ARE

APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION RESOURCES.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION OF OUR

PEOPLE AND THE SHARED SENSE OF BEING PART OF A TEAM. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE AND HIGH STANDARDS OF BUSINESS ETHICS.

INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE IN ALL EMPLOYEES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, IN WHICH

TRAINING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION AND PERIODIC SEMINARS THAT WE SPONSOR AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF INSTILLING THE GOLDMAN SACHS CULTURE

IS OUR EMPLOYEE REVIEW PROCESS. EMPLOYEES ARE REVIEWED BY SUPERVISORS, CO-WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A 360-DEGREE REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH, AND INCLUDES AN EVALUATION OF AN EMPLOYEES PERFORMANCE WITH

RESPECT TO RISK MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE AND DIVERSITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, WE HAD 33,300 TOTAL STAFF, EXCLUDING STAFF AT

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OPERATING EXPENSES IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM

TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AS WELL AS THOSE ENTITIES THAT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, DERIVATIVES, REAL ESTATE, LOANS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL ASSETS. THESE ENTITIES INCLUDE BROKERS AND DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME ENTITIES

GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR

ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES AND TO CONTINUE TO COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES COMPETITIVELY AMID INTENSE PUBLIC AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY ON THE

COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR PAY PRACTICES AND THOSE OF OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND REGULATORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA) IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. SEE REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES BELOW AND RISK FACTORS  OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF

WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE REGULATION OF OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS TREND ACCELERATED IN RECENT YEARS AS THE CREDIT CRISIS CAUSED NUMEROUS MERGERS

AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. MANY COMMERCIAL BANKS AND OTHER BROAD-BASED FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES PRODUCTS WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING AND CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES AND COULD RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE, PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO BUSINESSES OR

TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE CLIENTS SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS AGREEMENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR OTHER LOAN FACILITIES) FROM

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC

REACH OF SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND HAVE ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND HAVE MORE CAPITAL AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE AND LONGER OPERATING

HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS.

FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE INCREASING VOLUME OF TRADES EXECUTED ELECTRONICALLY, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON TRADING COMMISSIONS, IN THAT COMMISSIONS FOR

LOW-TOUCH ELECTRONIC TRADING ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOR HIGH-TOUCH NON-ELECTRONIC TRADING. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD ELECTRONIC AND OTHER LOW-TOUCH, LOW-COMMISSION TRADING WILL CONTINUE. IN ADDITION, WE

BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN MARKET SHARE BY FURTHER REDUCING PRICES.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT), THE REQUIREMENTS PROMULGATED BY THE

BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL COMMITTEE) AND OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATION COULD AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION TO THE EXTENT THAT LIMITATIONS ON ACTIVITIES, INCREASED FEES AND COMPLIANCE COSTS OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS DO NOT

APPLY, OR DO NOT APPLY EQUALLY, TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. THE IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WILL DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT

ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THE REQUIRED RULEMAKING AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE EVOLVE, THE EXTENT OF INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICE AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE NEW REGULATORY REGIMES AS DISCUSSED FURTHER UNDER

REGULATION BELOW.

REGULATION

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE BANKING, SECURITIES, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, OTC DERIVATIVES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS AND INSURANCE INDUSTRIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION WORLDWIDE. REGULATORY BODIES

AROUND THE WORLD ARE GENERALLY CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL MARKETS AND WITH PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE CUSTOMERS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING DEPOSITORS IN BANKING ENTITIES AND THE

CUSTOMERS OF BROKER-DEALERS.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN RECENT

YEARS. OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. IN PARTICULAR, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY

ALTERED THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT FOR OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE RULES THAT WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC, THE SEC, THE CFTC AND

OTHER AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE REGIME ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATION AND THE IMPLEMENTING RULES. SIMILAR REFORMS ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY OTHER REGULATORS AND

POLICY MAKERS WORLDWIDE, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OUR BUSINESS, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND COMPLIANCE PRACTICES TO CONFORM TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

GROUP INC. IS A

BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (BHC ACT) AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER AMENDMENTS TO THE BHC ACT EFFECTED BY THE U.S. GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT OF 1999 (GLB ACT).

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BHC ACT, GROUP INC. IS SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL

REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF OUR CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION, BUT GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY REGULATORS OF OUR U.S. NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH RESPECT TO THE

ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. SUCH FUNCTIONALLY REGULATED NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE BROKER-DEALERS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC, SUCH AS OUR PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER, GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.), INSURANCE COMPANIES

REGULATED BY STATE INSURANCE AUTHORITIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THEIR INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES AND ENTITIES REGULATED BY THE CFTC WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN FUTURES-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT GENERALLY

RESTRICTS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES FROM ENGAGING IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THE BUSINESS OF BANKING AND CERTAIN CLOSELY RELATED ACTIVITIES. AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WE MAY ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND RELATED ACTIVITIES

THAN ARE OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. THESE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE GROUP INC. AND OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES (CURRENTLY

GS BANK USA AND OUR NATIONAL BANK TRUST COMPANY SUBSIDIARY) EACH MAINTAINING THEIR RESPECTIVE STATUS AS WELL-CAPITALIZED AND WELL-MANAGED. THE BROADER RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES

INCLUDES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND MAKING MARKETS IN SECURITIES, INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND MAKING INVESTMENTS IN NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE GLB ACT TO

CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE IMPERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SO LONG AS THE ASSETS HELD PURSUANT TO THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT EQUAL 5% OR MORE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED ASSETS.

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD APPROVAL BEFORE ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BANKING

AND OTHER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

WE EXPECT TO FACE ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR

ACTIVITIES UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE, WHICH WILL PROHIBIT PROPRIETARY TRADING (BUT WILL ALLOW ACTIVITIES SUCH AS UNDERWRITING, MARKET-MAKING RELATED

ACTIVITIES AND RISK-MITIGATION HEDGING ACTIVITIES) AND WILL LIMIT THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS BY BANKING ENTITIES, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. IN OCTOBER 2011, FEDERAL REGULATORS PROPOSED

RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE VOLCKER RULE THAT INCLUDED AN EXTENSIVE REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL. THE PROPOSED RULES ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, AND MANY ASPECTS OF THE VOLCKER RULE REMAIN UNCLEAR. THE FULL IMPACT ON US WILL NOT BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY

UNTIL THE RULES ARE FINALIZED. THE VOLCKER RULE PROVISIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT NO LATER THAN JULY 2012, AND COMPANIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE (SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS).

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

WHILE MANY ASPECTS OF THE VOLCKER RULE REMAIN UNCLEAR, WE EVALUATED THE PROHIBITION ON

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND DETERMINED THAT BUSINESSES THAT ENGAGE IN BRIGHT LINE PROPRIETARY TRADING ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE PROHIBITED. IN 2011 AND 2010, WE LIQUIDATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES AND GLOBAL

MACRO PROPRIETARY TRADING POSITIONS.

IN ADDITION, WE EVALUATED THE LIMITATIONS ON SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENTS IN, HEDGE

FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS. THE FIRM EARNS MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES FOR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FROM PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUNDS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT. THE FIRM ALSO MAKES INVESTMENTS IN

FUNDS, AND THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT; THESE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE VOLCKER RULE. THE VOLCKER RULE LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY

FUNDS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS INVESTMENT IN EACH PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUND TO 3% OR LESS OF NET ASSET VALUE, AND TO REDUCE THE FIRMS AGGREGATE INVESTMENT IN ALL SUCH FUNDS TO 3% OR LESS OF THE FIRMS TIER 1 CAPITAL. OVER THE

PERIOD FROM 1999 THROUGH 2011, THE FIRMS AGGREGATE NET REVENUES FROM ITS INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS AGGREGATE TOTAL NET REVENUES OVER THE SAME PERIOD. WE ARE CONTINUING TO MANAGE

OUR EXISTING PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TRANSITION PERIODS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE. WITH RESPECT TO OUR HEDGE FUNDS, WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO COMPLY WITH THE VOLCKER RULE BY REDEEMING CERTAIN OF OUR INTERESTS IN THE FUNDS. WE CURRENTLY

EXPECT TO REDEEM UP TO APPROXIMATELY 10% OF CERTAIN HEDGE FUNDS TOTAL REDEEMABLE UNITS PER QUARTER OVER TEN CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS, BEGINNING IN THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 2012 AND ENDING IN JUNE 2014. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE LIMITED THE FIRMS

INITIAL INVESTMENT TO 3% FOR CERTAIN NEW FUNDS.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO ESTABLISHES A BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

HAVING BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THIS BUREAU HAS OVERSIGHT OVER CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO BROADLY SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS

DISCUSSED BELOW. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT IS APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA, BOTH GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA MUST MEET SPECIFIC REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS. THE SUFFICIENCY OF OUR CAPITAL LEVELS AND THOSE OF GS BANK USA, AS WELL AS GS BANK USAS PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS.

TIER 1 LEVERAGE AND BASEL 1 CAPITAL RATIOS.

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ON OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO, TIER 1 CAPITAL, TOTAL CAPITAL, RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND TIER 1

PENDING CHANGES IN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS: ADVANCED CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK  BASEL 2, AS APPLICABLE TO US AS

A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (BASEL 2), WHICH ARE BASED ON THE ADVANCED APPROACHES UNDER THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE

INCORPORATED THE BASEL 2 FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS US, ADOPT BASEL 2, ONCE APPROVED TO DO SO BY REGULATORS. AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT,

U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED A RULE THAT REQUIRES LARGE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, UPON ADOPTION OF BASEL 2, TO CONTINUE TO CALCULATE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BOTH BASEL 2 AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (BASEL 1), WHICH ARE BASED ON THE 1988 CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE. FOR EACH OF THE TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS, THE LOWER OF THE BASEL 1 AND BASEL 2 RATIOS CALCULATED WILL BE USED TO

DETERMINE WHETHER THE BANK MEETS ITS MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE ISSUED REVISED PROPOSALS TO MODIFY THEIR

MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TRADING ACTIVITIES. THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MARKET RISK FRAMEWORK THAT WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE

BASEL COMMITTEE IN JUNE 2010 (BASEL 2.5), AS WELL AS THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF CREDIT RATINGS, AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT. ONCE IMPLEMENTED, IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE CHANGES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET RISK.

ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN DECEMBER 2010 (BASEL 3) REVISE THE DEFINITION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL,

INTRODUCE TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AS A REGULATORY METRIC, SET NEW MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS (INCLUDING A NEW CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH MUST BE COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AND WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE MINIMUM CAPITAL

RATIOS), INTRODUCE A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WITHIN INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND MAKE SUBSTANTIAL REVISIONS TO THE COMPUTATION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS) FOR CREDIT EXPOSURES. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS IS EXPECTED

TO TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL 3 GUIDELINES IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN ADDITION, BOTH THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND U.S. BANKING REGULATORS IMPLEMENTING THE DODD-FRANK ACT HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL IMPOSE MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL STANDARDS ON SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED ITS FINAL PROVISIONS FOR ASSESSING THE GLOBAL SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND THE RANGE OF ADDITIONAL TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY BANKING

INSTITUTIONS DEEMED TO BE GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS WOULD INITIALLY RANGE FROM 1% TO 2.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AND COULD BE AS MUCH AS 3.5% FOR A BANK THAT INCREASES ITS SYSTEMIC FOOTPRINT

(E.G., BY INCREASING TOTAL ASSETS). THE FIRM WAS ONE OF 29 INSTITUTIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (ESTABLISHED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE GROUP OF 20) AS GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT UNDER THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY.

THEREFORE, DEPENDING UPON THE MANNER AND TIMING OF THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY, WE EXPECT THAT THE MINIMUM TIER 1 COMMON RATIO REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO US WILL INCLUDE THIS ADDITIONAL

CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED AS GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND THE CALCULATION OF THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE NO LATER THAN

NOVEMBER 2014 BASED ON DATA THROUGH THE END OF 2013.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE ENHANCED

PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS AND EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT. THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD APPLY TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS SUCH AS US, AS WELL AS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT

NONBANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WITH RESPECT TO THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, THE PROPOSED RULES ADDRESS RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND CONCENTRATION/CREDIT

EXPOSURE LIMITS. THE PROPOSED RULES DO NOT INCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING INSTITUTIONS BUT CONTEMPLATE THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS ADOPTING SUCH REQUIREMENTS. THE PROPOSED RULES REQUIRE

INCREASED INVOLVEMENT BY BOARDS OF DIRECTORS IN LIQUIDITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRESS TESTING, SINGLE-COUNTERPARTY CREDIT LIMITS (INCLUDING MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT EXPOSURE AMONG MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS) AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE

OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS ANNUAL STRESS TESTS AND A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ANNUAL AND SEMI-ANNUAL INTERNAL STRESS TESTS. THE PROPOSED EARLY REMEDIATION RULES ARE MODELED AFTER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGIME, DESCRIBED BELOW, BUT

ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ACTION BEGINNING IN EARLIER STAGES OF A COMPANYS FINANCIAL DISTRESS BY MANDATING ACTION ON THE BASIS OF A RANGE OF TRIGGERS, INCLUDING CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE, STRESS TEST RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL SUBJECT US AT A FIRMWIDE LEVEL TO THE SAME LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND DIRECTS BANKING REGULATORS TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT THE NEW LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REGULATIONS IN 2012. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CHANGES, TIER 1

CAPITAL TREATMENT FOR OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS WILL BE PHASED OUT OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THE INTERACTION AMONG THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE BASEL COMMITTEES PROPOSED CHANGES AND OTHER

PROPOSED OR ANNOUNCED CHANGES FROM OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS ADDS FURTHER UNCERTAINTY TO OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND THOSE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

LIQUIDITY RATIOS UNDER BASEL 3.

HISTORICALLY, REGULATION AND MONITORING OF BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, WITHOUT

REQUIRED FORMULAIC MEASURES. BASEL 3 WILL REQUIRE BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY AGAINST TWO SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR IN SOME RESPECTS TO LIQUIDITY MEASURES HISTORICALLY APPLIED BY BANKS AND

REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES, WILL BE MANDATED BY REGULATION. ONE TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO, IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE BANKING ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID

ASSETS EQUAL TO THE ENTITYS EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOW FOR A 30-DAY TIME HORIZON (OR, IF GREATER, 25% OF ITS EXPECTED TOTAL CASH OUTFLOW) UNDER AN ACUTE LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. THE OTHER, REFERRED TO AS THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO, IS

DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF BANKING ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY INCENTIVIZE BANKING ENTITIES TO INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND

CERTAIN OTHER SOVEREIGN DEBT AS A COMPONENT OF ASSETS AND INCREASE THE USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS A FUNDING SOURCE. THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE INTRODUCED AS A REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2015, AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING

RATIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE INTRODUCED AS A REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2018. WHILE THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE NEW FRAMEWORK ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REFINEMENT AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STANDARDS COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES.

WE ALSO EXPECT THAT

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO US AND SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE IMPACTED IN THE FUTURE BY THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTS ARISING FROM THE BASEL COMMITTEE, THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND ACTIONS BY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS.

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY GROUP INC. TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND STOCK REPURCHASES BY GROUP INC. ARE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. UNDER RULES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN

NOVEMBER 2011, THE DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE POLICIES OF LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES,

SUCH AS GROUP INC., ARE REVIEWED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS AND STRESS TESTS SUBMITTED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY, AND WILL BE ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO MEET AND EXCEED MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS, ITS EXPECTED SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON (GENERALLY A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS) UNDER BASELINE AND STRESSED SCENARIOS, AND ANY POTENTIAL

IMPACT OF CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESS PLAN AND ACTIVITIES ON ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE CAPITAL PLAN REVIEW IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESSES THAT ACCOUNT FOR EACH

INSTITUTIONS UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMIT CONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS. AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLAN REVIEW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WILL EVALUATE AN INSTITUTIONS PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS,

SUCH AS REPURCHASING OR REDEEMING STOCK OR INCREASING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.

FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. IN GENERAL, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY GS BANK USA OR OUR NATIONAL BANK TRUST COMPANY SUBSIDIARY IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER

A RECENT EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY THE ENTITY IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT

YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE ENTITY OBTAINS PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF THE ENTITYS UNDIVIDED

PROFITS (GENERALLY, ACCUMULATED NET PROFITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PAID OUT AS DIVIDENDS OR TRANSFERRED TO SURPLUS). THE PAYMENT OF ALL DIVIDENDS IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE BANKING REGULATORS, WHICH HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE

PAYMENT IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF GROUP INC.S NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS AND

DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING OUR BROKER-DEALER AND OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY HISTORICALLY HAS REQUIRED BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT CODIFIES THIS POLICY AS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. THIS SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AT TIMES WHEN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT. CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A

SUBSIDIARY BANK ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BANK. IN ADDITION, IF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY COMMITS TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATOR THAT IT WILL MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF ITS BANK

SUBSIDIARY, WHETHER IN RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS INVOKING ITS SOURCE-OF-STRENGTH AUTHORITY OR IN RESPONSE TO OTHER REGULATORY MEASURES, THAT COMMITMENT WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND THE BANK WILL BE ENTITLED TO

PRIORITY PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF THAT COMMITMENT, AHEAD OF OTHER CREDITORS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE BHC ACT PROVIDES FOR

REGULATION OF BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS AND PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING A PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THAT

SUBSIDIARY OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

COMPENSATION PRACTICES

OUR

COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND, WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND EMPLOYEES, BY OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATORY BODIES WORLDWIDE. THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF COMPENSATION REGULATION IN THE

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP, AND WE EXPECT THAT THESE POLICIES WILL EVOLVE OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

IN JUNE

2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND OTHER FINANCIAL REGULATORS JOINTLY ISSUED GUIDANCE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AT BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RISK AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH SAFE AND SOUND PRACTICES. THE

GUIDANCE SETS FORTH THE FOLLOWING THREE KEY PRINCIPLES WITH RESPECT TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS: THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT

ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO EXPOSE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISK; THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT; AND THE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD

BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF A NUMBER OF LARGE, COMPLEX

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING US. THE JUNE 2010 GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT SUPERVISORY FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION WILL BE INCORPORATED, AS APPROPRIATE, INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS, WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS

ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER ACTIONS. THE GUIDANCE ALSO PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT, CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE

PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS.

THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD HAS RELEASED STANDARDS

FOR IMPLEMENTING CERTAIN COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES FOR BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE SOUND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THESE STANDARDS ARE TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL REGULATORS. THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAS ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO

THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE DESIGNED TO IMPLEMENT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARDS COMPENSATION STANDARDS WITHIN THE EU. REGULATORS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE AND GERMANY, HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED

COMPENSATION POLICIES OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PURSUANT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE. THESE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVISION

DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRES THE U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, TO ESTABLISH

JOINT REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES PROHIBITING INCENTIVE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AT SPECIFIED REGULATED ENTITIES HAVING AT LEAST $1 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH WOULD INCLUDE GROUP INC. AND SOME OF ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, BROKER-DEALER AND

INVESTMENT ADVISOR SUBSIDIARIES) THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISKS BY PROVIDING AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, DIRECTOR OR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER WITH EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION, FEES, OR BENEFITS OR THAT COULD LEAD TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS TO THE

ENTITY. IN ADDITION, THESE REGULATORS MUST ESTABLISH REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURE TO REGULATORS OF INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THE INITIAL VERSION OF THESE REGULATIONS WAS PROPOSED BY THE U.S. FINANCIAL

REGULATORS IN EARLY 2011 AND THE REGULATIONS MAY BECOME EFFECTIVE IN 2012. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS INCORPORATE THE THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FROM THE JUNE 2010 REGULATORY GUIDANCE DISCUSSED ABOVE. IF THE REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTED IN THE FORM

INITIALLY PROPOSED, THEY WILL IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MAY STRUCTURE COMPENSATION FOR OUR EXECUTIVES.

STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES (FORMERLY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT) AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (DESCRIBED BELOW) THAT ARE CALCULATED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. A NUMBER

OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY THROUGH GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING: ORIGINATION OF AND MARKET MAKING IN BANK LOANS; INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, CURRENCY AND OTHER DERIVATIVES; LEVERAGED FINANCE; COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE

ORIGINATION AND TRADING; STRUCTURED FINANCE; AND AGENCY LENDING, CUSTODY AND HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION SERVICES. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THE

FDIC.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT CONTAINS DERIVATIVE PUSH-OUT PROVISIONS THAT, BEGINNING IN JULY 2012, MAY PREVENT US FROM

CONDUCTING CERTAIN SWAPS-RELATED ACTIVITIES THROUGH GS BANK USA OR ANOTHER INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS FOR CERTAIN INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS AND FOR HEDGING OR RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY RELATED

TO THE BANKS BUSINESS. THESE PRECLUDED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE FIRM, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS.

TRANSACTIONS

WITH AFFILIATES

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, ON THE ONE HAND, AND GROUP INC. OR ITS OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THESE REGULATIONS LIMIT THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS TO AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM GS BANK USA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. OR

ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES) THAT MAY TAKE PLACE AND GENERALLY REQUIRE THOSE TRANSACTIONS TO BE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE REGULATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE

DODD-FRANK ACT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE COVERAGE AND SCOPE OF THE REGULATIONS THAT LIMIT AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN A BANKING ORGANIZATION, INCLUDING BY APPLYING THESE REGULATIONS TO THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ARISING UNDER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING TRANSACTIONS, AND TRANSACTIONS WITH SPONSORED HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS.

GROUP INC. HAS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GS BANK USA, ALONG WITH THOSE OF GS&CO., GOLDMAN SACHS BANK (EUROPE) PLC (GS BANK EUROPE) AND GOLDMAN SACHS

EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P. (GSEC).

LIVING WILL

AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND FDIC HAVE JOINTLY ISSUED A RULE THAT REQUIRES EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN ASSETS AND EACH DESIGNATED

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO PREPARE AND PROVIDE TO REGULATORS AN ANNUAL PLAN (A SO-CALLED LIVING WILL) FOR ITS RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE. THE FIRMS

RESOLUTION PLAN MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ENSURE THAT GS BANK USA IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER ENTITIES. THE REGULATORS JOINT RULE SETS SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR THE RESOLUTION PLANS, INCLUDING REQUIRING A DETAILED

RESOLUTION STRATEGY AND ANALYSES OF THE COMPANYS MATERIAL ENTITIES, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, INTERCONNECTIONS AND INTERDEPENDENCIES, AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AMONG OTHER ELEMENTS. WE HAVE COMMENCED WORK ON OUR FIRST RESOLUTION

PLAN, WHICH WE MUST SUBMIT TO THE REGULATORS BY JULY 1, 2012. GS BANK USA IS ALSO REQUIRED BY THE FDIC TO SUBMIT A PLAN FOR ITS RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE BY JULY 1, 2012.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE

GS

BANK USA ACCEPTS DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF FDIC INSURANCE UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS GS BANK USA. THE AMOUNTS OF

THESE ASSESSMENTS FOR LARGER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (GENERALLY THOSE THAT HAVE $10 BILLION IN ASSETS OR MORE), SUCH AS GS BANK USA, ARE CURRENTLY BASED ON THE AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD AND SUPERVISORY RATINGS AND FORWARD-LOOKING FINANCIAL MEASURES USED TO CALCULATE THE ASSESSMENT RATE, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS BY THE FDIC. THE FDIC REQUIRED ALL INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO PREPAY ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS FOR ALL OF 2010, 2011 AND 2012 ON DECEMBER 30, 2009. THE FDIC MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ASSESSMENT RATE SCHEDULE ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT

ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA), AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET SPECIFIED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FDICIA ESTABLISHES FIVE CAPITAL

CATEGORIES FOR FDIC-INSURED BANKS: WELL-CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED AND CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.

GOLDMAN SACHS 2011 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO BE WELL-CAPITALIZED, THE

HIGHEST CATEGORY, IF IT HAS A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. GS BANK USA HAS AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS

OF THESE WELL-CAPITALIZED LEVELS.

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ON THE CALCULATION OF GS BANK USAS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL 1 AND FOR A DISCUSSION OF MINIMUM REQUIRED RATIOS.

GS BANK USA COMPUTES ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH ARE BASED ON BASEL 1 AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD. AN INSTITUTION MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO, OR DEEMED TO BE IN, A CAPITAL CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IF IT IS DETERMINED TO BE IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION

RATING WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS. FDICIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, AS THE CAPITAL CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION DECLINES. FAILURE TO MEET THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COULD

ALSO SUBJECT A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO CAPITAL RAISING REQUIREMENTS. ULTIMATELY, CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR, AS DESCRIBED UNDER  INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY BELOW.

THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS GROUP INC. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED UPON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING

COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO AN UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED

SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE HOLDING COMPANY, THE GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY

OVER THE HOLDING COMPANYS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS, AS DESCRIBED UNDER  SOURCE OF STRENGTH ABOVE.

INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER FOR AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUCH AS GS BANK USA, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN

CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER.



TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR, INCLUDING A NEWLY FORMED BRIDGE BANK

WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS;



TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PROVISIONS TRIGGERED BY THE

APPOINTMENT OF THE FDIC IN THAT CAPACITY; OR



TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC

TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMANCE OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF DOMESTIC DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY

OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST SUCH AN INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION BY ANY RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC

EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF GS BANK USA, THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE DEPOSITORS OF GS BANK USA.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT CREATED A NEW RESOLUTION REGIME (KNOWN AS ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY) FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND

THEIR AFFILIATES, AND SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, THE FDIC MAY BE APPOINTED AS RECEIVER FOR THE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTION, AND ITS FAILED NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES, FOR PURPOSES

OF LIQUIDATING THE ENTITY IF, AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS, IT IS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE INSTITUTIONS FAILURE THAT IT IS IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT AND THE FAILURE POSES A RISK TO THE STABILITY OF THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS RECEIVER UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, THEN THE

POWERS OF THE RECEIVER, AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CREDITORS AND OTHER PARTIES WHO HAVE DEALT WITH THE INSTITUTION, WOULD BE DETERMINED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVISIONS, AND NOT UNDER THE INSOLVENCY LAW THAT WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY. THE

POWERS OF THE RECEIVER UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY WERE BASED ON THE POWERS OF THE FDIC AS RECEIVER FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (FDIA). HOWEVER, THE PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS

UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY WERE MODIFIED FROM THE FDIA REGIME IN CERTAIN RESPECTS TO REDUCE DISPARITIES WITH THE TREATMENT OF CREDITORS CLAIMS UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE AS COMPARED TO THE TREATMENT OF THOSE CLAIMS UNDER THE

NEW AUTHORITY. NONETHELESS, SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS EXIST BETWEEN THESE TWO REGIMES, INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVISIONS TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS IN SOME

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE USE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE CREDITORS CLAIMS (AS OPPOSED TO THE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE UTILIZED IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS), AND THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC TO TRANSFER CLAIMS TO A BRIDGE ENTITY.

THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT. HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF

RULEMAKINGS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ACT, AND A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS OF THE NEW AUTHORITY REQUIRE CLARIFICATION. THE FDIC HAS COMPLETED ITS INITIAL PHASE OF RULEMAKING UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, BUT MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

GUIDANCE. NEW GUIDANCE MAY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NEW AUTHORITY IS APPLIED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO BROKER-DEALER AND FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT SUBSIDIARIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES.

TRUST COMPANIES

GROUP INC.S

TWO LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO AND DO NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS OR MAKE LOANS (OTHER THAN AS INCIDENTAL TO THEIR TRUST ACTIVITIES) AND, AS A RESULT, ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC. THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY, N.A., A

NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT IS LIMITED TO FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES, IS REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND IS A MEMBER BANK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. THE GOLDMAN SACHS TRUST COMPANY OF DELAWARE, A DELAWARE LIMITED

PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY, IS REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE DELAWARE STATE BANK COMMISSIONER.

U.S. SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES REGULATION

GOLDMAN SACHS BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS, INCLUDING

SALES METHODS, TRADE PRACTICES, USE AND SAFEKEEPING OF CLIENTS FUNDS AND SECURITIES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE, RECORDKEEPING, THE FINANCING OF CLIENTS PURCHASES, AND THE CONDUCT OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

SEC IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. GS&CO. IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER, A MUNICIPAL ADVISOR AND AN INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH THE SEC AND AS A BROKER-DEALER IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS FINRA AND THE NYSE, ADOPT RULES THAT APPLY TO, AND EXAMINE, BROKER-DEALERS SUCH AS GS&CO.

IN ADDITION, STATE SECURITIES AND OTHER REGULATORS ALSO HAVE REGULATORY OR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER GS&CO. SIMILARLY, OUR BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL AND

REGULATORY BODIES AND SELF-REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE OFFICES. GSEC AND ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED U.S. BROKER-DEALERS AND ARE REGULATED BY THE SEC, THE NYSE AND FINRA. GOLDMAN SACHS FINANCIAL

MARKETS, L.P. IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN OTC DERIVATIVES DEALER AND CONDUCTS CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES.

THE

COMMODITY FUTURES AND COMMODITY OPTIONS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT (CEA). THE CFTC IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY CHARGED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CEA. SEVERAL OF GOLDMAN SACHS

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO. AND GSEC, ARE REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AND ACT AS FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS, COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS OR COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CEA REGULATIONS. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF VARIOUS

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE AND THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION, ALSO GOVERN THE COMMODITY FUTURES AND COMMODITY OPTIONS ACTIVITIES OF THESE

ENTITIES.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY THE CFTC, THE SEC AND OTHER REGULATORS OF OUR BROKER-DEALER AND REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF RESPECTS. THE LEGISLATION CALLS FOR THE

IMPOSITION OF EXPANDED STANDARDS OF CARE BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING BY PROVIDING THE SEC WITH AUTHORITY TO ADOPT RULES ESTABLISHING FIDUCIARY DUTIES FOR BROKER-DEALERS AND DIRECTING THE SEC TO EXAMINE AND

IMPROVE SALES PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURE BY BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO CONTAINS PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKETS, INCLUDING BY REQUIRING THE REGISTRATION OF ALL

SWAP DEALERS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS, AND THE CLEARING AND EXECUTION OF SWAPS THROUGH REGULATED FACILITIES (SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, INCLUDING SWAPS WITH NON-FINANCIAL END USERS AND SWAPS THAT ARE NOT CLEARED BY A CLEARING AGENCY), IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CFTC AND SEC RULEMAKING. FURTHERMORE, FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT TO DEVELOP RULES WHEREBY ANYONE WHO ORGANIZES OR INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITY TRANSACTION MUST RETAIN A PORTION (GENERALLY, AT

LEAST FIVE PERCENT) OF ANY CREDIT RISK THAT THE PERSON CONVEYS TO A THIRD PARTY.

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE SEC PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE DODD-FRANK ACTS

PROHIBITION AGAINST SECURITIZATION PARTICIPANTS ENGAGING IN ANY TRANSACTION THAT WOULD INVOLVE OR RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH AN INVESTOR IN A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION. THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD EXCEPT BONA FIDE

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AND RISK-MITIGATING HEDGING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES FROM THE GENERAL PROHIBITION.

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN

SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. IN 2011, CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON THE

EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM, AND ABOUT U.S. GROWTH AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL DEBT CEILING, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND DECLINES IN THE PRICES OF MOST FINANCIAL ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF SOVEREIGN

DEBT HELD BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS INCREASED CAPITAL AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHER FUNDING COSTS, HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE COST OF BORROWING AND ACCESS TO DEBT MARKETS FOR MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING US.

SUCH DEVELOPMENTS HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED CLIENT ACTIVITY.

SINCE 2008, GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEAL WITH WHAT REGULATORS,

POLITICIANS AND OTHERS BELIEVE TO BE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES

IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE, AND GENERALLY INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY. IN SOME CASES, ADDITIONAL TAXES HAVE BEEN (OR HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO BE) IMPOSED ON US AND

CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGISLATION (INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ARE STILL BEING DRAFTED OR ARE NOT YET IN EFFECT; THEREFORE, THE EXACT IMPACT THAT THESE REGULATIONS WILL

HAVE ON OUR BUSINESSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR.

NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO

FACE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS DUE TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TAX REVENUES, PARTICULARLY FROM CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS INCREASED OUTLAYS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE COST OF STIMULUS

PROGRAMS.

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY, GENERAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC AND MARKET ACTIVITIES AND A LACK

OF CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY

DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW

INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: CONCERNS ABOUT SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS; DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH,

BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES;

OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS

PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS, RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS, DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE

EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE) AND MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. THESE INCLUDE POSITIONS WE TAKE WHEN WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, OR COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO

MAINTAIN POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF THESE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET ON A DAILY BASIS,

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER

SECURITIES THAT ARE

NOT FREELY TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO

HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF ASSETS MAY

SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN SUCH POSITIONS

AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

IN OUR

EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS

IN LOSSES AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

WE RECEIVE ASSET-BASED MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS

OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN TURN

REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

IF FINANCIAL MARKETS DECLINE, REVENUES FROM OUR VARIABLE ANNUITY PRODUCTS

ARE LIKELY TO DECREASE. IN ADDITION, UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN REINVESTMENT RETURNS, POLICY LAPSES OR MORTALITY RATES MAY ALSO IMPACT EARNINGS FROM OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE

ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL DECLINES, THE PARTY POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION WITH A

BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF FUNDING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF POSITIONS IS DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN INCREASE

OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL, THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID MARKETS

INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING

ADEQUATE COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS,

INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT, BY

ACCEPTING DEPOSITS AT OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BY ISSUING PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING AND MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE THEIR

TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES DUE SOLELY TO

CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR ISSUE.

OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR CLIENTS, AND DECREASES IN VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS, ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING THE SIZE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY, EVEN THOUGH SPREADS ARE WIDENING AND WE MAY

EARN MORE ON EACH TRADE. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING, BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT

MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN

ORDER TO DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF OUR RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, BOTH OF WHICH IN TURN INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING, CLIENT EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE

TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL

DECLINES IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR CLIENT EXECUTION BUSINESSES BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER

TRADING VOLUMES OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS DECLINES

IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT CLIENTS DO NOT

WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO EITHER GENERAL MARKET

CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS OR TO BENCHMARKS) BY FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL

ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS. THIS COULD AFFECT THE MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED NOTES OR DERIVATIVES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY

FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM MARKET-MAKING, INVESTING OR LENDING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES. THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES. MARKET CONDITIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE INVOLVED UNPRECEDENTED DISLOCATIONS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN USING

HISTORICAL DATA TO MANAGE RISK.

THE MODELS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURES REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

DEGREES OF CORRELATION OR LACK THEREOF AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009, AND TO SOME EXTENT IN 2011, PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND HAVE CAUSED US TO

INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. IN THESE AND OTHER

CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE POSITIONS THROUGH OUR MARKET-MAKING OR ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OR WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN SECURITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN PRIVATE EQUITY, DEBT, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL,

REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR LIQUIDITY,

PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED AND/OR UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS,

AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A

GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT

OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS.

FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE

SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL,

INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT

TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN SOME OF

OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS, COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED

FINANCING CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. CERTAIN RATING AGENCIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE DODD-FRANK

ACT COULD RESULT IN THE RATING AGENCIES REDUCING THEIR ASSUMED LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND THEREFORE RESULT IN RATINGS DOWNGRADES FOR CERTAIN LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS. AS OF DECEMBER 2011, EACH OF MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE, STANDARD & POORS RATINGS SERVICES AND RATINGS AND INVESTMENT INFORMATION, INC. HAD ISSUED A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK ON OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 2011, IN THE EVENT OF A ONE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE

OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD HAVE CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.30 BILLION AND $2.18 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF

U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS,

MARKET-DRIVEN, AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE MOVEMENTS. CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO

PURCHASERS OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, ALTHOUGH VERY LARGE, HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND CURRENTLY LACKS A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR

CLIENT BASE, WE INCREASINGLY MUST ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER

CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY WITH WHICH WE ALSO

HAVE AN ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.

IN ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO HEIGHTENED REGULATION

AND INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE VIEWED AS AFFILIATES OF OURS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG OUR BUSINESSES.

HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH US MAY

BE AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY, DISCLOSE AND DEAL APPROPRIATELY WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR BROKER-DEALER, BANK AND INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. IN ADDITION, OUR BROKER-DEALER, BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT

TO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES.

ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO

MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC. AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS

CREDITORS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING

GS&CO., GS BANK USA, GS BANK EUROPE AND GSEC SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT ASSETS TO GS BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A TIME

WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OWN OBLIGATIONS. SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK

OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH

IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE

ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES AND/OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE THOSE SECURITIES

OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES

THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON COLLATERAL MAY SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE

IMPROPER EXERCISE OF OUR RIGHTS. DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING AND PRIME BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENTS POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

DEFAULTS OR MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR MARKET-MAKING,

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES

IN OUR MARKET-MAKING, UNDERWRITING, INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL REQUIRE ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND ANY PERSON WHO ORGANIZES AND INITIATES AN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTION TO RETAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE THE COST TO US OF ENGAGING IN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER OR ISSUER,

INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, AND A FAILURE OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL

ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL

SERVICES ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE COUNTERPARTIES. PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT ARE

EXPECTED TO LEAD TO INCREASED CENTRALIZATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR CONCENTRATION OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE

BASIS OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE. OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS

A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND

MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATIONS, IMPOSED TAXES OR OTHERWISE

PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT HAVE OR MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER OR AT ALL IN CERTAIN OR ALL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN

WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE. THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR RULES, MANY OF WHICH DO NOT APPLY TO ALL OUR U.S. OR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US FOR

THE RISKS WE TAKE.

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED

BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW

MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE INCREASINGLY TRANSACTING BUSINESS AND INVESTING IN NEW REGIONS, INCLUDING A WIDER RANGE OF EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS. FURTHERMORE, IN A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING WHERE WE MAKE MARKETS, INVEST AND LEND, WE

TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE

NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND NON-STANDARDIZED, WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES

REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE THE RISK THAT THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATE FOR A COUNTERPARTY,

THAT DOCUMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY EXECUTED OR THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE COUNTERPARTY.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT

ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR DURING ANY DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY FIND IT MORE

DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD

IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS. THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRING CENTRAL CLEARING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVES, OR A MARKET SHIFT

TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO

HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS OF HIGHLY SKILLED

INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW TALENTED AND DIVERSE EMPLOYEES

AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SUCH EMPLOYEES INCLUDE OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OUR REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITH A CULTURE OF FAIRLY HIRING, TRAINING AND

PROMOTING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRESENCE

OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS  REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION

AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE

ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FSA, THE FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPOSED BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE

LEGISLATION OR REGULATION, MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN WAYS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE

COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING NON-EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, IN A MANNER THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTS IN THE IDENTITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES AND THEIR COMPENSATION BEING MADE PUBLIC. ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

MAY ALSO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND

PERVASIVE REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A BANK HOLDING COMPANY,

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF

REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS ALSO THE

RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, TAX BURDENS AND COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS, COULD

BE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES, GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY. IN

ADDITION, REGULATION IMPOSED ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR MARKET PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY, SUCH AS TAXES ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LEVELS OF MARKET ACTIVITY MORE BROADLY, AND THUS IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES.

THE IMPACT OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE AFFECTED

JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT UNECONOMIC FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING OUR

BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS OR

OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, IN PARTICULAR THE

DODD-FRANK ACT AND BASEL 3, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY. AMONG THE ASPECTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT MOST LIKELY TO AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES

ARE: THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING AND THE LIMITATION ON THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OTHER BANKING ENTITIES; INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; INCREASED REGULATION

OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS; LIMITATIONS ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION; THE PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN SWAPS-BASED ACTIVITIES THROUGH AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION; LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS;

THE ESTABLISHMENT AND ANNUAL UPDATING OF A RESOLUTION PLAN; THE CREATION OF A NEW SYSTEMIC OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FSOC; INCREASED DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS; AND INCREASED STANDARDS OF CARE FOR BROKER-DEALERS IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS. THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO UNDER BASEL 3 MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY IF THE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT APPLY, OR DO NOT

APPLY EQUALLY, TO OUR COMPETITORS OR ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED UNIFORMLY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE FILED LAWSUITS AGAINST

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF RECORDING MORTGAGES AND DESIGNATING A COMMON ENTITY AS THE MORTGAGE HOLDER IS IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW, AND OTHER AUTHORITIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY ARE

CONTEMPLATING SIMILAR ACTIONS. IF THIS SYSTEM AND RELATED PRACTICES ARE DEEMED INVALID, IT MAY CALL INTO QUESTION THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE HAVE

PARTICIPATED, NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MARKET FOR MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND OUR MORTGAGE-RELATED ACTIVITIES, OR SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS OR PENALTIES.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO COMPENSATION,

OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS ADVERSE STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. PRESS COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ASSERT SOME FORM OF WRONGDOING OFTEN RESULT IN SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BY

REGULATORS, LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS. RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING, IS TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE AND CAN DIVERT THE TIME AND EFFORT OF OUR

SENIOR MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO

ADVANCE OR SUPPORT LEGISLATION TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ON THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR

EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

A FAILURE IN OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR

OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN

MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS.

AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES

INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE

IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN REGULATIONS AND MARKETS. THIS

UPDATING ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATES RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM WITH EXISTING ONES.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO

FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES

AND CLEARING HOUSES AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL BE CLEARED ON EXCHANGES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, AND THE INCREASED CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN

OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT

TRANSACTIONS, SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE.

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, SATELLITE, UNDERSEA CABLE OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET, TRANSPORTATION

OR OTHER SERVICES FACILITIES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A

BROADER IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE BUILDINGS OR SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES

IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, LONDON, BANGALORE, HONG KONG, TOKYO AND SALT LAKE CITY, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS

CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A CATASTROPHIC EVENT IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA

OFFICES COULD VERY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS. IF A DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND

INTERACT WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. WE ARE REGULARLY THE TARGET OF ATTEMPTED CYBER ATTACKS

AND MUST CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR AND DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA FROM MISAPPROPRIATION OR CORRUPTION. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE EXPECT TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND TO INVESTIGATE

AND REMEDIATE VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE HAVE

DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES AND PREVENT AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE

CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION.

AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND

REPUTATIONAL HARM.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE MATERIAL

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH.

SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND

THAT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS INCREASE FOLLOWING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE REDUCED OUR STAFF.

THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND

THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TRADING TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY

IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH US, PARTICULARLY OUR EXCHANGE-BASED MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF LOW-COST ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS

AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING

AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR POWER GENERATION INTERESTS AND OUR PHYSICAL

COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

WE ENGAGE IN, OR INVEST IN ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN, THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING AND TRADING OF NUMEROUS

COMMODITIES, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, METALS (BASE AND PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING URANIUM), EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES.

THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS, AIR QUALITY, WATER

QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT COULD INCREASE THE OPERATING COSTS AND

PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE US TO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, RENOVATION OF STORAGE FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND

APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF, PERMITS AND LICENSES.

OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES, TRANSPORT VESSELS, STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS,

FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR

SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE ON THEIR PART, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. ALSO, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM PERFORMING UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS, MAY IMPAIR OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION, REGULATORY ACTION,

NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR

BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE

OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET. ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP

EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK THAT TRANSACTIONS WE

STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKETS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING AND GROWTH MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES,

DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT, CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY OR ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS

INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WHILE BUSINESS AND OTHER

PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DIFFER, OUR PRINCIPAL LEGAL ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT IN THEIR OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE TO RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL PAYMENTS AND MONEY LAUNDERING, AS WELL AS LAWS RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS WITH

CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT, THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND U.K. BRIBERY ACT. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED AND CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING, THE

GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY OF OUR OPERATIONS, EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT WE DEAL WITH, GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF SUCH RULES OR REGULATIONS AND ANY SUCH

VIOLATION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER

OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES AROUND THE WORLD, INVOLVING ACTUAL OR ALLEGED FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. THIS MISCONDUCT HAS

INCLUDED AND MAY INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE THE THEFT OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT

BEEN AND MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

WE MAY INCUR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING THE

EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY (OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY), TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL

DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES.

SUBJECT TO GOLDMAN SACHS RIGHT OF EXCLUSIVE POSSESSION AND USE UNTIL JUNE 2069, THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LEASE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GROUND LEASE, WE MADE A LUMP SUM GROUND RENT PAYMENT IN JUNE 2007 OF $161 MILLION FOR RENT THROUGH THE

TERM OF THE LEASE.

WE HAVE OFFICES AT 30 HUDSON STREET IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY, WHICH WE OWN AND WHICH INCLUDE

APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION GROSS SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE, AND WE OWN OVER 700,000 SQUARE FEET OF ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL SPACE SPREAD AMONG FOUR LOCATIONS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. WE LEASE APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET

IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA.

COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF LEASED SPACE.

IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, WE HAVE

OFFICES THAT TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF LEASED SPACE. OUR EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN LONDON AT PETERBOROUGH COURT, PURSUANT TO A LEASE EXPIRING IN 2026. IN TOTAL, WE LEASE APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION

RENTABLE SQUARE FEET IN LONDON THROUGH VARIOUS LEASES, RELATING TO VARIOUS PROPERTIES.

IN ASIA (INCLUDING INDIA), AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND, WE HAVE OFFICES THAT TOTAL

APPROXIMATELY 2.1 MILLION RENTABLE SQUARE FEET. OUR HEADQUARTERS IN THIS REGION ARE IN TOKYO, AT THE ROPPONGI HILLS MORI TOWER, AND IN HONG KONG, AT THE CHEUNG KONG CENTER. IN TOKYO, WE CURRENTLY LEASE APPROXIMATELY 400,000 RENTABLE SQUARE

FEET, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN 2018. IN HONG KONG, WE CURRENTLY LEASE APPROXIMATELY 340,000 RENTABLE SQUARE FEET UNDER LEASE AGREEMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN 2017.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE AT PRELIMINARY STAGES, AND MANY OF THESE CASES SEEK AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING

RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD. GIVEN THE RANGE OF LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS PRESENTLY UNDER WAY, OUR LITIGATION EXPENSES CAN BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

EQUITY AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO SET EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION DATE. ANY REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

THE FIRM GENERATED NET EARNINGS OF $4.44 BILLION FOR 2011, COMPARED WITH $8.35 BILLION AND $13.39 BILLION FOR 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY. OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $4.51 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011, COMPARED WITH

$13.18

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2010 AND $22.13 FOR THE YEAR ENDED

WAS 3.7%

FOR 2011, COMPARED WITH 11.5%

FOR 2010 AND 22.5% FOR 2009. DURING 2011, WE REDEEMED THE 50,000

SHARES OF OUR 10% CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES G (SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK) HELD BY BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY). EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE $1.64 BILLION PREFERRED

DIVIDEND RELATED TO THIS REDEMPTION, DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $7.46

AND ROE WAS

5.9%

FOR 2011.

BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE WAS $130.31 AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE

4

WAS $119.72 AS OF DECEMBER 2011, BOTH APPROXIMATELY 1% HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2010. DURING THE YEAR, THE FIRM

REPURCHASED 47.0 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL COST OF $6.04 BILLION. OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO UNDER BASEL 1 WAS 13.8% AND OUR TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL 1

WAS 12.1% AS OF DECEMBER 2011.

2011 VERSUS 2010.

THE FIRM GENERATED NET REVENUES OF $28.81 BILLION FOR 2011. THESE RESULTS

REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, AS WELL AS LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING, COMPARED WITH 2010. NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED

COMPARED WITH 2010.

AN OVERVIEW OF NET REVENUES FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS PROVIDED BELOW.

INVESTMENT BANKING

THE DECREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER NET REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN 2010, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A DECLINE

IN INDUSTRY-WIDE ACTIVITY. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010. NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY DECREASED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2010.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES

THE DECREASE IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES COMPARED

WITH 2010 REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION. ALTHOUGH ACTIVITY LEVELS IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION DURING 2011 WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH 2010

LEVELS, AND RESULTS WERE SOLID DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2011 WAS CHARACTERIZED BY BROAD MARKET CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTY, RESULTING IN VOLATILE MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANTLY WIDER CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH

CONTRIBUTED TO DIFFICULT MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS AND LED TO REDUCTIONS IN RISK BY US AND OUR CLIENTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE CONDITIONS, NET REVENUES ACROSS THE FRANCHISE WERE LOWER, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN MORTGAGES AND CREDIT PRODUCTS,

COMPARED WITH 2010.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2010. DURING 2011, AVERAGE VOLATILITY LEVELS

INCREASED AND EQUITY PRICES IN EUROPE AND ASIA DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY, PARTICULARLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUES REFLECTED HIGHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES, PARTICULARLY DURING THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN SECURITIES SERVICES INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2010, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES. EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION NET REVENUES WERE LOWER THAN 2010, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN SHARES.

INVESTING & LENDING

NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE $2.14 BILLION AND $7.54 BILLION FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS FOR 2011 INCLUDED A LOSS OF $517 MILLION FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA LIMITED (ICBC) AND NET GAINS OF $1.12 BILLION FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, PRIMARILY IN PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSSES FROM PUBLIC EQUITIES. IN ADDITION,

INVESTING & LENDING INCLUDED NET REVENUES OF $96 MILLION FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF HEDGES, OFFSET

BY NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET GAINS FROM OTHER DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS. RESULTS FOR 2011 ALSO INCLUDED OTHER NET REVENUES OF $1.44 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

NET REVENUES

IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES, REFLECTING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT DECREASED $12 BILLION TO $828 BILLION, REFLECTING NET OUTFLOWS OF $17 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $5 BILLION. NET OUTFLOWS PRIMARILY REFLECTED OUTFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY INFLOWS IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

THE FIRM GENERATED NET REVENUES OF $39.16 BILLION FOR 2010, DESPITE A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES AND

SLIGHTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING COMPARED WITH 2009. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING AND HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.

AN OVERVIEW OF NET REVENUES FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS PROVIDED BELOW.

INVESTMENT BANKING

THE DECREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING REFLECTED LOWER NET REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY. THE DECLINE IN UNDERWRITING REFLECTED LOWER NET

REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A DECLINE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY IN COMPARISON TO 2009, WHICH INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL-RAISING ACTIVITY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE ESSENTIALLY

UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2009. THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES

THE DECREASE IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND

COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITIES. DURING 2010, FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION OPERATED IN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, WHICH REFLECTED BROAD MARKET

CONCERNS INCLUDING EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND UNCERTAINTY OVER REGULATORY REFORM, AS WELL AS TIGHTER BID/OFFER SPREADS. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUES COMPARED WITH A PARTICULARLY STRONG 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RESULTS IN

INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CREDIT PRODUCTS, COMMODITIES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CURRENCIES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN MORTGAGES, AS 2009 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE

LOANS.

THE DECLINE IN EQUITIES COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES CLIENT

EXECUTION, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RESULTS IN DERIVATIVES AND SHARES. COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE ALSO LOWER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. IN ADDITION, SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY

LOWER COMPARED WITH 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING TIGHTER SECURITIES LENDING SPREADS, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF CUSTOMER BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES. DURING 2010,

ALTHOUGH EQUITY MARKETS WERE VOLATILE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, EQUITY PRICES GENERALLY IMPROVED AND VOLATILITY LEVELS DECLINED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

INVESTING & LENDING

NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE $7.54 BILLION AND $2.86 BILLION FOR 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2010, AN INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND TIGHTER CREDIT SPREADS PROVIDED A

FAVORABLE BACKDROP FOR OUR INVESTING & LENDING BUSINESS. RESULTS IN INVESTING & LENDING FOR 2010 INCLUDED A GAIN OF $747 MILLION FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC, A NET GAIN OF $2.69 BILLION FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS

IN EQUITIES, A NET GAIN OF $2.60 BILLION FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS AND OTHER NET REVENUES OF $1.51 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES ACROSS OUR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES ALSO INCREASED, REFLECTING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE

MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS. DURING 2010, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT DECREASED 4% TO $840 BILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING OUTFLOWS IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS, CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

TRENDS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH GENERALLY MODERATED IN 2011, AS REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP)

GREW IN MOST MAJOR ECONOMIES AND EMERGING MARKETS, BUT AT A SLOWER PACE THAN IN 2010. CERTAIN UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS THAT EMERGED IN 2010 CONTINUED DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT EMERGED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THAT AFFECTED OUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED POLITICAL UNREST IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN AND INFLATION IN EMERGING

MARKETS. DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM INTENSIFIED, WHILE CONCERNS ABOUT U.S. GROWTH AND THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL DEBT CEILING EMERGED,

CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHER VOLATILITY LEVELS, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES AND SIGNIFICANTLY WIDER CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS. THIS PROMPTED THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK TO ANNOUNCE EASING MEASURES IN ORDER TO

STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE U.S. AND TO ALLEVIATE CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPE. INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED AND ANNOUNCED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS VOLUMES INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2010, BUT DECLINED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY

AND EQUITY-RELATED OFFERINGS AND INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT OFFERINGS BOTH DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2010, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE

GLOBAL

DURING 2011, REAL GDP

GROWTH DECLINED IN MOST MAJOR ECONOMIES AND EMERGING MARKETS. THE SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH PRIMARILY REFLECTED SLOWER GROWTH IN DOMESTIC DEMAND COMPARED WITH 2010, WHILE INTERNATIONAL TRADE CONTINUED TO GROW STRONGLY DURING 2011. UNEMPLOYMENT

LEVELS DECLINED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2010, ALTHOUGH THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINED

ELEVATED IN SOME ECONOMIES. DURING 2011, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE, THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE BANK OF JAPAN LEFT INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED, WHILE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK INCREASED AND THEN

REDUCED ITS INTEREST RATE DURING THE YEAR, ENDING THE YEAR UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010. IN ADDITION, THE PEOPLES BANK OF CHINA INCREASED ITS ONE-YEAR BENCHMARK LENDING RATE DURING THE YEAR. THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL INCREASED DURING 2011. THE

MODERATED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECLINE IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND REDUCED GROWTH IN EXPORTS, ALTHOUGH BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND CONSUMER EXPENDITURE INCREASED. BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DECLINED DURING MOST OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

INCREASED GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES. IN ADDITION, RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT REMAINED WEAK AND MEASURES OF CORE INFLATION INCREASED DURING THE YEAR FROM LOW LEVELS. GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE

IMPACT OF SUPPLY-CHAIN DISRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH JAPAN EARLIER IN THE YEAR. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINED SLIGHTLY DURING THE YEAR, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED HIGH. THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE MAINTAINED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT A TARGET RANGE OF ZERO TO

0.25% DURING THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CONCLUDED QUANTITATIVE EASING MEASURES THAT INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF U.S. TREASURY DEBT AND ANNOUNCED FURTHER EASING MEASURES BY EXTENDING THE DURATION OF THE U.S.

TREASURY DEBT IT HOLDS. THE YIELD ON THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTE FELL BY 141 BASIS POINTS DURING 2011 TO 1.89%. IN EQUITY MARKETS, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE INCREASED BY 6%, WHILE THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX DECREASED BY 2% AND THE S&P

500 INDEX ENDED THE YEAR ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.

CHALLENGES IN SEVERAL EURO AREA ECONOMIES INTENSIFIED DURING THE YEAR, WEIGHING ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THESE ECONOMIES AND ON RISK APPETITE MORE BROADLY. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER MARKET VOLATILITY

AND FUNDING PRESSURES. THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK AND GOVERNMENTS IN THE EURO AREA TOOK A RANGE OF POLICY MEASURES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK INCREASED ITS MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS RATE BY 25 BASIS POINTS DURING BOTH THE

SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS, BUT REVERSED THESE INCREASES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, SUCH THAT THE RATE ENDED THE YEAR AT 1.00%, UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2010. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, REAL GDP INCREASED BY 0.8% FOR 2011, COMPARED WITH AN

INCREASE OF 2.1% IN 2010. THE BANK OF ENGLAND MAINTAINED ITS OFFICIAL BANK RATE AT 0.50% DURING THE YEAR. LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS GENERALLY DECLINED DURING THE YEAR, ALTHOUGH LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS IN CERTAIN EURO AREA ECONOMIES

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IN ADDITION, SPREADS BETWEEN GERMAN BOND YIELDS AND THOSE OF MOST EURO AREA ECONOMIES WIDENED DURING THE YEAR. THE EURO DEPRECIATED BY 3% AND THE BRITISH POUND WAS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE EURO

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE (I.E., INVENTORY), AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, ARE

REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT FAIR VALUE (I.E., MARKED-TO-MARKET), WITH RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE HIERARCHY UNDER U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) GIVES (I) THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 INPUTS), (II) THE NEXT PRIORITY TO INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1

INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY (LEVEL 2 INPUTS), AND (III) THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED IN MARKET ACTIVITY (LEVEL 3 INPUTS). ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON

THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE FOR FACTORS SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE.

INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS, REQUIRE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION

PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION DATE, WE USE OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT. ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE. THESE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.



DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND/OR MODEL FOR EACH TYPE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT;



DETERMINING MODEL INPUTS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICES EVIDENCED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INTEREST

RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS; AND



DETERMINING APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO ILLIQUIDITY OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY.

REGARDLESS OF THE METHODOLOGY, VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

MARKET MAKERS AND INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRICING OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. OUR CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS

AND IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY VALUED AT MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN SITUATIONS WHERE ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

REQUIRES JUDGMENT (E.G., CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES OR TRADE COMPARISON, AS DESCRIBED BELOW), THE FINAL VALUATION DECISION IS MADE BY SENIOR MANAGERS IN CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS

(INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS). THIS INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE PROPERLY VALUED.

PRICE VERIFICATION.

THE OBJECTIVE OF PRICE VERIFICATION IS TO HAVE AN INFORMED AND INDEPENDENT OPINION WITH REGARD TO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UNDER REVIEW. INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS

WHICH CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL MARKET DATA ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. PRICE VERIFICATION STRATEGIES UTILIZED BY OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE.



TRADE COMPARISON.

ANALYSIS OF TRADE DATA (BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL WHERE AVAILABLE) IS USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT PRICING INPUTS AND VALUATIONS.



EXTERNAL PRICE COMPARISON.

VALUATIONS AND PRICES ARE COMPARED TO PRICING DATA OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES (E.G., BROKER OR DEALERS, MARKIT, BLOOMBERG, IDC, TRACE). DATA OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES IS COMPARED TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY. WHEN BROKER OR DEALER

QUOTATIONS OR THIRD-PARTY PRICING VENDORS ARE USED FOR VALUATION OR PRICE VERIFICATION, GREATER PRIORITY IS GENERALLY GIVEN TO EXECUTABLE QUOTATIONS.



CALIBRATION TO MARKET

COMPARABLES.

MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE VALUATION OF POSITIONS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, RISKS AND COMPONENTS.



RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES.

MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE SIMILARITY, MEASURED IN TERMS OF RISK, LIQUIDITY AND RETURN, OF ONE INSTRUMENT RELATIVE TO ANOTHER OR, FOR A GIVEN INSTRUMENT, OF ONE MATURITY RELATIVE TO ANOTHER.



COLLATERAL ANALYSES.

MARGIN DISPUTES ON DERIVATIVES ARE EXAMINED AND INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, ON OUR VALUATIONS.



EXECUTION OF TRADES.

WHERE APPROPRIATE, TRADING DESKS ARE INSTRUCTED TO EXECUTE TRADES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.



BACKTESTING.

VALUATIONS ARE CORROBORATED BY

COMPARISON TO VALUES REALIZED UPON SALES.

SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

REVIEW OF NET REVENUES.

INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ENSURE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRICING POLICY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DAILY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE EXPLANATION AND ATTRIBUTION OF NET REVENUES BASED ON THE

UNDERLYING FACTORS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATE NET REVENUES, IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE POTENTIAL FAIR VALUE OR TRADE BOOKING ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS AND ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE BEING PROPERLY CATEGORIZED AND QUANTIFIED.

REVIEW OF VALUATION MODELS.

QUANTITATIVE PROFESSIONALS WITHIN OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT (MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT) PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT MODEL APPROVAL PROCESS. THIS PROCESS INCORPORATES A REVIEW OF A

DIVERSE SET OF MODEL AND TRADE PARAMETERS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF VALUES (INCLUDING EXTREME AND/OR IMPROBABLE CONDITIONS) IN ORDER TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE.



THE MODELS SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT TYPE;



THE MODELS ACCURACY IN REFLECTING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED PRODUCT AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS;



THE SUITABILITY AND PROPERTIES OF THE NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS INCORPORATED IN THE MODEL;



THE MODELS CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS; AND



THE MODELS SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS.

NEW OR CHANGED MODELS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED. MODELS ARE EVALUATED AND RE-APPROVED ANNUALLY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN THE

PRODUCT OR MARKET AND ANY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN PRICING THEORIES.

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. GOODWILL IS ASSESSED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR

MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST, BY FIRST ASSESSING QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING

AMOUNT. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. WE DERIVE THE FAIR VALUE

BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES WE BELIEVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE (I.E., OBSERVABLE PRICE-TO-EARNINGS MULTIPLES AND PRICE-TO-BOOK MULTIPLES). WE DERIVE THE NET BOOK VALUE BY ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT

THE ACTIVITIES OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS. CRITICAL INPUTS INCLUDE (I) PROJECTED EARNINGS, (II) ESTIMATED LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES AND (III) COST OF

EQUITY.

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011, CONSISTENT WITH THE DECLINE IN STOCK PRICES IN THE BROADER FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR,

OUR STOCK PRICE DECLINED AND THROUGHOUT MOST OF THIS PERIOD, OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION WAS BELOW BOOK VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011 AND DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH WE HOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR GOODWILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUES. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER MARKET CAPITALIZATION, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, AS AN

INDICATOR OF FAIR VALUE OVER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME.

IF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS PERSIST AND IF THERE IS A PROLONGED PERIOD OF

WEAKNESS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, OUR EARNINGS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OTHER CRITICAL INPUTS OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

TEST (E.G., COST OF EQUITY) COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS TO DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN THE FUTURE.

SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING AND NOTE 13

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE AMORTIZE OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (I) OVER THEIR ESTIMATED LIVES, (II) BASED ON ECONOMIC USAGE OR (III) IN PROPORTION TO ESTIMATED GROSS PROFITS OR PREMIUM REVENUES.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, GENERALLY CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET

GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K FOR THE CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY MAJOR ASSET CLASS AND IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

A PROLONGED PERIOD OF MARKET WEAKNESS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING (I) DECREASES IN REVENUES FROM COMMODITY-RELATED CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS, (II) DECREASES IN CASH RECEIPTS FROM TELEVISION BROADCAST ROYALTIES, (III) AN ADVERSE ACTION OR

ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR OR (IV) ADVERSE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ON THE CONTRACTS IN OUR VARIABLE ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT HAVE OCCURRED, AND TO TEST

INTANGIBLES FOR IMPAIRMENT IF REQUIRED.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR

POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY

ARISE OUT OF TAX AUDITS TO THE EXTENT THAT UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS FAIL TO MEET THE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

CODIFICATION 740. SEE NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL

ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE OR PROCEEDING, OUR

EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN SIMILAR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF LEGAL COUNSEL. SEE NOTES 18 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ON CERTAIN

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

NET REVENUES

2011 VERSUS 2010.

NET REVENUES WERE $28.81 BILLION FOR 2011, 26% LOWER THAN 2010,

REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, AS WELL AS LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING. NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

NET REVENUES WERE $39.16 BILLION FOR 2010, 13% LOWER THAN 2009, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES AND SLIGHTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING. THESE

DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING AND HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.

NET INTEREST INCOME

2011 VERSUS 2010.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $5.19 BILLION FOR 2011, 6% LOWER THAN 2010. THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND HIGHER DIVIDEND EXPENSE RELATED TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME FROM HIGHER YIELDING COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $5.50 BILLION FOR 2010, 26% LOWER THAN 2009. THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE FIXED INCOME ASSETS, MOST NOTABLY U.S. FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS,

HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND TIGHTER SECURITIES LENDING SPREADS.

NON-INTEREST REVENUES

INVESTMENT BANKING

INVESTMENT

BANKING REVENUES REFLECTED AN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN INDUSTRY-WIDE UNDERWRITING AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY LEVELS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011. THESE DECLINES REFLECTED INCREASED

CONCERNS REGARDING THE WEAKENED STATE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A SIGNIFICANT WIDENING IN CREDIT SPREADS, A SHARP INCREASE IN VOLATILITY LEVELS AND A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL

EQUITY MARKETS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011. IF THESE CONCERNS CONTINUE OR IF EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FURTHER, RESULTING IN LOWER LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY, REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2011 VERSUS 2010.

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $4.36 BILLION FOR 2011, 9% LOWER THAN 2010, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. REVENUES IN EQUITY

UNDERWRITING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN 2010, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE ACTIVITY. REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010. REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY DECREASED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH

2010.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $4.81 BILLION FOR 2010, 3% LOWER THAN 2009, REFLECTING LOWER REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY. THE DECLINE IN UNDERWRITING REFLECTED LOWER REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A DECLINE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY IN COMPARISON TO 2009, WHICH INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL-RAISING ACTIVITY BY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION CLIENTS. REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2009. REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

DURING THE

FIRST HALF OF 2011, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES REFLECTED AN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED ASSET PRICES AND A SHIFT IN INVESTOR ASSETS AWAY FROM MONEY MARKETS IN FAVOR OF ASSET CLASSES WITH POTENTIALLY HIGHER RISK AND

RETURNS. HOWEVER, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011, ASSET PRICES DECLINED, PARTICULARLY IN EQUITIES, IN PART DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. DECLINING ASSET PRICES AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY CONTRIBUTED TO

INVESTORS SHIFTING ASSETS AWAY FROM ASSET CLASSES WITH POTENTIALLY HIGHER RISK AND RETURNS TO ASSET CLASSES WITH LOWER RISK AND RETURNS. IF ASSET PRICES CONTINUE TO DECLINE OR INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FAVOR LOWER RISK ASSET CLASSES OR WITHDRAW THEIR

ASSETS, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2011 VERSUS 2010.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $4.69 BILLION FOR 2011, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED

COMPARED WITH 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES, REFLECTING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2010 VERSUS 2009.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $4.67 BILLION FOR 2010, 10% HIGHER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES ACROSS OUR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT

PRODUCTS. MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES ALSO INCREASED, REFLECTING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES

BROAD MARKET CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT EMERGED DURING

2010, INCLUDING CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND THE WEAKENED STATE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES, HEIGHTENED DURING 2011. THESE CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE VOLATILITY LEVELS AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER EQUITY

PRICES IN EUROPE AND ASIA, PARTICULARLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. THE MACRO CHALLENGES DURING THE YEAR RESULTED IN VOLATILE MARKETS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND FEES. IF THESE CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUE, BUT

WERE TO RESULT IN LOWER TRANSACTION VOLUMES, COMMISSIONS AND FEES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2011 VERSUS 2010.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $3.77 BILLION FOR 2011, 6% HIGHER THAN 2010, REFLECTING HIGHER

TRANSACTION VOLUMES, PARTICULARLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.

2010

VERSUS 2009.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $3.57 BILLION FOR 2010, 7% LOWER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS.

MARKET MAKING

DURING 2011,

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED CONCERNS REGARDING THE WEAKENED STATE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK, AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO IMPACTED EXPECTATIONS FOR ECONOMIC PROSPECTS IN THE U.S. AND WERE REFLECTED IN EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS MORE BROADLY. IN ADDITION, THE DOWNGRADE IN CREDIT RATINGS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND

MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011 CONTRIBUTED TO FURTHER UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS. THESE CONCERNS, AS WELL AS OTHER BROAD MARKET CONCERNS, SUCH AS UNCERTAINTY OVER FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM, CONTINUED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON MARKET-MAKING REVENUES DURING 2011. IF THESE CONCERNS CONTINUE, AND MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS REMAIN CHALLENGING, MARKET-MAKING REVENUES WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2011 VERSUS 2010.

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $9.29 BILLION FOR 2011, 32% LOWER THAN 2010. ALTHOUGH ACTIVITY LEVELS DURING 2011 WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH 2010 LEVELS, AND

RESULTS WERE SOLID DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2011 WAS CHARACTERIZED BY BROAD MARKET CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTY, RESULTING IN VOLATILE MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANTLY WIDER CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO

DIFFICULT MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS AND LED TO REDUCTIONS IN RISK BY US AND OUR CLIENTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE CONDITIONS, REVENUES ACROSS MOST OF OUR MAJOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES WERE LOWER DURING 2011 COMPARED WITH 2010.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

MARKET-MAKING REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS WERE $13.68 BILLION FOR 2010, 38% LOWER THAN 2009. DURING 2010, MARKET-MAKING REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LOWER

CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, WHICH REFLECTED BROAD MARKET CONCERNS INCLUDING EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND UNCERTAINTY OVER REGULATORY REFORM, AS WELL AS TIGHTER BID/OFFER SPREADS. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES COMPARED WITH A PARTICULARLY STRONG 2009

PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER RESULTS ACROSS MOST OF OUR MAJOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUES IN MORTGAGES, AS 2009 INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

DURING 2011, OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS RESULTS REFLECTED AN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS IN EUROPE AND ASIA, AND UNFAVORABLE CREDIT MARKETS THAT WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED CONCERNS REGARDING THE WEAKENED STATE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK. IF EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FURTHER AND

CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN FURTHER, OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

2011 VERSUS 2010.

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $1.51 BILLION AND $6.93 BILLION FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS FOR 2011 INCLUDED A LOSS FROM OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC AND NET GAINS FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, PRIMARILY IN PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSSES FROM PUBLIC EQUITIES. IN ADDITION, REVENUES IN OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS INCLUDED NET

LOSSES FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF HEDGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET GAINS FROM OTHER DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS.

RESULTS FOR 2011 ALSO INCLUDED REVENUES RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WERE $6.93 BILLION AND $2.62 BILLION FOR 2010

AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2010, AN INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND TIGHTER CREDIT SPREADS PROVIDED A FAVORABLE BACKDROP FOR OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUES. RESULTS FOR 2010 INCLUDED A GAIN FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES

OF ICBC, NET GAINS FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, NET GAINS FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS AND REVENUES RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. RESULTS FOR 2009 INCLUDED A GAIN FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC, NET GAINS FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS, AND REVENUES RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET LOSSES FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES. DURING 2009, CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES

OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS INCLUDES SALARIES, DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF EQUITY

AWARDS AND OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS BENEFITS. DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE LEVEL OF NET REVENUES, PREVAILING LABOR MARKETS, BUSINESS MIX, THE STRUCTURE OF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND THE

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT.

IN THE CONTEXT OF MORE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, THE FIRM LAUNCHED AN INITIATIVE

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011 TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE WE CAN OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. WE TARGETED APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION IN ANNUAL RUN RATE COMPENSATION AND NON-COMPENSATION REDUCTIONS AND WILL

CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR EXPENSE RUN RATE CLOSELY AND MAKE FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS AS NEEDED.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE $10.42 BILLION FOR 2011, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH

2010. NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES FOR 2011 INCLUDED HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, INCREASED RESERVES RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS AND HIGHER MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES COMPARED WITH 2010. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET

BY LOWER OTHER EXPENSES DURING 2011. THE DECREASE IN OTHER EXPENSES PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS (2010 INCLUDED $550 MILLION RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC). IN ADDITION, NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES DURING 2011 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $440 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS AND LITTON LOAN SERVICING LP. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $163 MILLION DURING 2011, PRIMARILY INCLUDING $78 MILLION TO

GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND, AND $25 MILLION TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION. COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED TO FUND THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES. THE $78 MILLION CONTRIBUTION IS IN ADDITION TO PRIOR YEAR

CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES. THE FIRM ASKS ITS PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POTENTIAL CHARITABLE RECIPIENTS FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $26.27 BILLION FOR 2010, 4% HIGHER THAN 2009. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES WERE $15.38 BILLION FOR 2010, A 5% DECLINE COMPARED WITH $16.19 BILLION FOR 2009,

DUE TO LOWER NET REVENUES. THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2010 WAS 39.3% (WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE $465 MILLION U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX), COMPARED WITH 35.8% FOR 2009. TOTAL STAFF INCREASED 10% DURING 2010. TOTAL

STAFF INCLUDING CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES INCREASED 7% DURING 2010.

DURING 2010, THE UNITED KINGDOM ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT IMPOSED A NON-DEDUCTIBLE 50% TAX

ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN RESPECT OF DISCRETIONARY BONUSES IN EXCESS OF £25,000 AWARDED UNDER ARRANGEMENTS MADE BETWEEN DECEMBER 9, 2009 AND APRIL 5, 2010 TO RELEVANT BANKING EMPLOYEES. OUR OPERATING EXPENSES

FOR 2010 INCLUDED $465 MILLION RELATED TO THIS TAX.

NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE $10.43 BILLION FOR 2010, 14% HIGHER THAN

2009. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS OF $682 MILLION (INCLUDING $550 MILLION RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC), AND AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS OF $305

MILLION, EACH DURING 2010. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2009 GENERALLY REFLECTED HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES, MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING 2009 RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS HIGHER CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS DURING 2009. THE REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WHICH WERE MEASURED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES, ARE INCLUDED IN OUR INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT AND REFLECTED WEAKNESS IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY $420 MILLION DURING 2010, PRIMARILY INCLUDING $25 MILLION TO THE

GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION AND $320 MILLION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND. COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED TO FUND THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES.

PROVISION FOR TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2011 WAS 28.0%, DOWN FROM 35.2% FOR

2010. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE $465 MILLION U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX AND THE $550 MILLION SEC SETTLEMENT, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS NON-DEDUCTIBLE, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2010 WAS 32.7%

1

. THE DECREASE FROM 32.7% TO 28.0% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN PERMANENT BENEFITS AS A PERCENTAGE OF EARNINGS AND THE EARNINGS MIX.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2010 OF 32.7%

1

WAS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2009

OF 32.5%.

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE RULES RELATED TO THE DEFERRAL OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN NON-REPATRIATED ACTIVE FINANCING INCOME

WERE EXTENDED RETROACTIVELY TO JANUARY 1, 2010 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2011. IF THESE RULES ARE NOT EXTENDED, THE EXPIRATION MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE BEGINNING IN 2013.

1.

WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2010 EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX AND THE SEC SETTLEMENT, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF WHICH WAS NON-DEDUCTIBLE, IS MEANINGFUL AS EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS INCREASES THE COMPARABILITY OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD RESULTS. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR

2011 VERSUS 2010.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WERE $4.36 BILLION FOR 2011, 9% LOWER THAN 2010.

NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE $1.99 BILLION, 4% LOWER THAN 2010. NET REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS WERE $2.37 BILLION,

14% LOWER THAN 2010, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE ACTIVITY. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010.

INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN INDUSTRY-WIDE UNDERWRITING AND MERGERS

AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY LEVELS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011. THESE DECLINES REFLECTED INCREASED CONCERNS REGARDING THE WEAKENED STATE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A SIGNIFICANT

WIDENING IN CREDIT SPREADS, A SHARP INCREASE IN VOLATILITY LEVELS AND A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011. IF THESE CONCERNS CONTINUE OR IF EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FURTHER, RESULTING IN LOWER LEVELS OF CLIENT

ACTIVITY, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

TRANSACTION BACKLOG INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2010. THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2010 WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN POTENTIAL EQUITY UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CLIENT MANDATES TO UNDERWRITE INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS. ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL DEBT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS DECREASED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2010. ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH THE END OF

2010.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF OUR FUTURE NET

REVENUES FROM INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTIONS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE REVENUE REALIZATION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. WE BELIEVE CHANGES IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG MAY BE A USEFUL INDICATOR OF CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS WHICH, OVER

THE LONG TERM, IMPACT OUR NET REVENUES. HOWEVER, THE TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETION AND CORRESPONDING REVENUE RECOGNITION OF TRANSACTIONS IN OUR BACKLOG VARIES BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE ASSIGNMENT, AS CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MAY REMAIN IN OUR BACKLOG FOR

LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND OTHERS MAY ENTER AND LEAVE WITHIN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, OUR TRANSACTION BACKLOG IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT INDIVIDUAL CLIENT TRANSACTIONS WILL OCCUR

IN THE FUTURE. TRANSACTIONS MAY BE CANCELLED OR MODIFIED, AND TRANSACTIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE MAY ALSO OCCUR.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.96 BILLION FOR 2011, 16% LOWER THAN 2010, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, PRIMARILY

RESULTING FROM LOWER NET REVENUES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $1.39 BILLION IN 2011, 7% HIGHER THAN 2010.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WERE $4.81 BILLION FOR 2010, 3% LOWER THAN 2009.

NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE $2.06 BILLION, 9% HIGHER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY. NET

REVENUES IN OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS WERE $2.75 BILLION, 11% LOWER THAN 2009, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A DECLINE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY IN COMPARISON TO 2009, WHICH INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL-RAISING

ACTIVITY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2009.

DURING 2010, INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY A CONTINUATION OF LOW LEVELS OF INDUSTRY-WIDE

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY, REFLECTING HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. ALTHOUGH CERTAIN ADDITIONAL UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS EMERGED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010, INCLUDING LOWER EQUITY PRICES AND WIDER

CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS, INTEREST RATES REMAINED LOW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY IMPROVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES RECOVERED AND CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS NARROWED.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG DECREASED COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2009. THE

DECREASE COMPARED WITH THE END OF 2009 REFLECTED A DECLINE IN ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CLIENT MANDATES TO UNDERWRITE LEVERAGED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS AND COMMON STOCK

OFFERINGS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.51 BILLION FOR 2010, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2009. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $1.30 BILLION IN 2010, 14% LOWER

THAN 2009.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES

OUR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF.

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION.

INCLUDES CLIENT EXECUTION ACTIVITIES RELATED TO MAKING MARKETS IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS,

CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGES, CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES.

WE GENERATE MARKET-MAKING REVENUES IN THESE ACTIVITIES, IN THREE WAYS.



IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS (SUCH AS MARKETS FOR U.S. TREASURY BILLS, LARGE CAPITALIZATION S&P 500 STOCKS OR CERTAIN MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH

CERTIFICATES), WE EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS (SUCH AS MID-CAP CORPORATE BONDS, GROWTH MARKET CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN NON-AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES), WE EXECUTE

TRANSACTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS FOR SPREADS AND FEES THAT ARE GENERALLY SOMEWHAT LARGER.



WE ALSO STRUCTURE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING CUSTOMIZED OR TAILOR-MADE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS OUR CLIENTS RISK EXPOSURES, INVESTMENT

OBJECTIVES OR OTHER COMPLEX NEEDS (SUCH AS A JET FUEL HEDGE FOR AN AIRLINE).

GIVEN THE FOCUS ON THE MORTGAGE

MARKET, OUR MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.

OUR ACTIVITIES IN MORTGAGES INCLUDE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-RELATED

SECURITIES, LOANS AND DERIVATIVES, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES, LOANS AND DERIVATIVES (INCLUDING U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY-ISSUED COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, OTHER PRIME, SUBPRIME AND ALT-A SECURITIES AND LOANS), AND OTHER

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, LOANS AND DERIVATIVES.

NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WERE $17.28 BILLION FOR 2011, 21% LOWER THAN 2010.

NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION WERE $9.02 BILLION FOR 2011, 34% LOWER THAN 2010. ALTHOUGH

ACTIVITY LEVELS DURING 2011 WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH 2010 LEVELS, AND RESULTS WERE SOLID DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2011 WAS CHARACTERIZED BY BROAD MARKET CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTY, RESULTING IN

VOLATILE MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANTLY WIDER CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO DIFFICULT MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS AND LED TO REDUCTIONS IN RISK BY US AND OUR CLIENTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE CONDITIONS, NET REVENUES ACROSS THE FRANCHISE WERE LOWER,

INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN MORTGAGES AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, COMPARED WITH 2010.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES WERE $8.26 BILLION FOR 2011, 2% HIGHER THAN 2010. DURING 2011,

AVERAGE VOLATILITY LEVELS INCREASED AND EQUITY PRICES IN EUROPE AND ASIA DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY, PARTICULARLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUES REFLECTED HIGHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES,

PARTICULARLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES IN SECURITIES SERVICES INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2010, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES. EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION NET REVENUES WERE LOWER THAN 2010,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN SHARES.

THE NET GAIN ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OUR OWN

CREDIT SPREADS ON BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS $596 MILLION AND $198 MILLION FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASED CONCERNS REGARDING THE WEAKENED STATE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK,

AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO IMPACTED EXPECTATIONS FOR ECONOMIC PROSPECTS IN THE U.S. AND WERE REFLECTED IN EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS MORE BROADLY. IN ADDITION, THE DOWNGRADE IN

CREDIT RATINGS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011 CONTRIBUTED TO FURTHER UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS. THESE CONCERNS, AS WELL AS OTHER BROAD MARKET CONCERNS, SUCH AS UNCERTAINTY

OVER FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM, CONTINUED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR NET REVENUES DURING 2011. IF THESE CONCERNS CONTINUE, AND MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS REMAIN CHALLENGING, NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT

EXECUTION AND EQUITIES WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $12.70 BILLION FOR 2011, 11%

LOWER THAN 2010, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM LOWER NET REVENUES, THE IMPACT OF THE U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX DURING 2010, AS WELL AS AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS OF $305 MILLION DURING 2010.

THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING HIGHER TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN EQUITIES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $4.58 BILLION IN 2011, 39% LOWER THAN 2010.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2010 VERSUS 2009.

NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WERE $21.80 BILLION FOR 2010, 33% LOWER THAN 2009.

NET REVENUES IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION WERE $13.71 BILLION FOR 2010, 37% LOWER THAN A PARTICULARLY STRONG 2009. DURING 2010, FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES CLIENT

EXECUTION OPERATED IN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, WHICH REFLECTED BROAD MARKET CONCERNS INCLUDING EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND UNCERTAINTY OVER REGULATORY REFORM, AS WELL AS TIGHTER BID/OFFER SPREADS.

THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUES COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RESULTS IN INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CREDIT PRODUCTS, COMMODITIES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CURRENCIES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES

IN MORTGAGES, AS 2009 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.

NET REVENUES IN

EQUITIES WERE $8.09 BILLION FOR 2010, 25% LOWER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES CLIENT EXECUTION, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RESULTS IN DERIVATIVES AND SHARES. COMMISSIONS AND FEES WERE ALSO

LOWER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. IN ADDITION, SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING TIGHTER SECURITIES LENDING SPREADS, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF

CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF CUSTOMER BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES. DURING 2010, ALTHOUGH EQUITY MARKETS WERE VOLATILE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, EQUITY PRICES GENERALLY IMPROVED AND

VOLATILITY LEVELS DECLINED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

THE NET GAIN/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OUR

OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS $198 MILLION AND $(1.10) BILLION FOR 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

RESULTS IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES FOR 2010 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A GENERAL DECREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS FROM VERY STRONG LEVELS SEEN IN 2009. CERTAIN UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS EMERGED

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 THAT MADE THE ENVIRONMENT MORE CHALLENGING FOR OUR BUSINESSES, RESULTING IN LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDED BROAD MARKET CONCERNS, SUCH AS

EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM, SHARPLY HIGHER EQUITY VOLATILITY LEVELS, LOWER GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES AND WIDER CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS. DURING

THE SECOND HALF OF 2010, SOME OF THESE CONDITIONS REVERSED AS EQUITY VOLATILITY LEVELS DECREASED, GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES RECOVERED, CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS NARROWED AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSET PRICES BEGAN TO IMPROVE. HOWEVER, LOWER CLIENT

ACTIVITY LEVELS, REFLECTING BROAD MARKET CONCERNS, INCLUDING EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT RISK AND UNCERTAINTY OVER REGULATORY REFORM, CONTINUED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS. IN ADDITION, BID/OFFER SPREADS REMAINED TIGHT RELATIVE TO 2009, AS

FINANCIAL MARKETS CONTINUED TO STABILIZE, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING IMPROVED AND VOLATILITY LEVELS IN BOTH CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS AND COMMODITY PRICES DECLINED.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $14.29 BILLION FOR 2010, 4% HIGHER THAN 2009, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX, AS WELL AS AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS OF $305 MILLION. THESE INCREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM LOWER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $7.51 BILLION IN 2010, 61% LOWER THAN 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2011 VERSUS 2010.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE $2.14 BILLION AND $7.54 BILLION FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2011, INVESTING & LENDING RESULTS REFLECTED AN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

CHARACTERIZED BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EQUITY MARKETS IN EUROPE AND ASIA, AND UNFAVORABLE CREDIT MARKETS THAT WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED CONCERNS REGARDING THE WEAKENED STATE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN

DEBT RISK. RESULTS FOR 2011 INCLUDED A LOSS OF $517 MILLION FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC AND NET GAINS OF $1.12 BILLION FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, PRIMARILY IN PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSSES FROM

PUBLIC EQUITIES. IN ADDITION, INVESTING & LENDING INCLUDED NET REVENUES OF $96 MILLION FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO RELATIONSHIP LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

THE EFFECT OF HEDGES, OFFSET BY NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET GAINS FROM OTHER DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS. RESULTS FOR 2011 ALSO INCLUDED OTHER NET REVENUES OF $1.44 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES. IF EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FURTHER AND CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN FURTHER, NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $2.67 BILLION FOR 2011, 20% LOWER THAN 2010, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM LOWER NET REVENUES. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE IMPACT OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS DURING 2011. PRE-TAX LOSS WAS $531 MILLION IN 2011, COMPARED WITH PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF $4.18 BILLION IN 2010.

2010 VERSUS 2009.

NET

REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING WERE $7.54 BILLION AND $2.86 BILLION FOR 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS FOR 2010 INCLUDED A GAIN OF $747 MILLION FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC, A NET GAIN OF $2.69 BILLION FROM

OTHER INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, A NET GAIN OF $2.60 BILLION FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS AND OTHER NET REVENUES OF $1.51 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. THE NET GAIN FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS IN

EQUITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS, WHICH RESULTED IN APPRECIATION OF BOTH OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS AND PROVIDED FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. THE NET GAINS AND NET INTEREST FROM

DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF TIGHTER CREDIT SPREADS AND FAVORABLE CREDIT MARKETS DURING THE YEAR, WHICH PROVIDED FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR BORROWERS TO REFINANCE.

RESULTS FOR 2009 INCLUDED A GAIN OF $1.58 BILLION FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC, A NET GAIN OF $1.05 BILLION FROM DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS, AND OTHER NET REVENUES OF $832 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET LOSS OF $596 MILLION FROM

OTHER INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES. DURING 2009, CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.36 BILLION FOR 2010, 5% LOWER THAN 2009, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING 2009 RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM LOWER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $4.18 BILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $660 MILLION FOR 2009.

2011 VERSUS 2010.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE $5.03 BILLION FOR 2011, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES, REFLECTING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT DECREASED $12 BILLION TO $828 BILLION, REFLECTING NET OUTFLOWS OF $17

BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $5 BILLION. NET OUTFLOWS PRIMARILY REFLECTED OUTFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INFLOWS IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS.

DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2011, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY IMPROVED ASSET PRICES AND A

SHIFT IN INVESTOR ASSETS AWAY FROM MONEY MARKETS IN FAVOR OF ASSET CLASSES WITH POTENTIALLY HIGHER RISK AND RETURNS. HOWEVER, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011, ASSET PRICES DECLINED, PARTICULARLY IN EQUITIES, IN PART DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. DECLINING ASSET PRICES AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY CONTRIBUTED TO INVESTORS SHIFTING ASSETS AWAY FROM ASSET CLASSES WITH POTENTIALLY HIGHER RISK AND RETURNS TO ASSET CLASSES WITH LOWER RISK AND RETURNS. IF ASSET

PRICES CONTINUE TO DECLINE OR INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FAVOR LOWER RISK ASSET CLASSES OR WITHDRAW THEIR ASSETS, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $4.02 BILLION FOR 2011, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH 2010. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $1.02 BILLION IN 2011, 6%

HIGHER THAN 2010.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE $5.01 BILLION FOR 2010, 9% HIGHER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER INCENTIVE FEES ACROSS OUR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES

ALSO INCREASED, REFLECTING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS. DURING 2010, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT DECREASED 4% TO $840 BILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING OUTFLOWS

IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS, CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY TRENDS.

DURING 2010, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY A CONTINUATION OF INDUSTRY TRENDS THAT EMERGED DURING 2009, AS FINANCIAL MARKETS BEGAN TO STABILIZE, ASSET PRICES IMPROVED AND INVESTORS BEGAN TO SHIFT ASSETS AWAY FROM MONEY MARKETS IN FAVOR OF ASSET CLASSES WITH

POTENTIALLY HIGHER RISK AND RETURNS. THIS TREND RESULTED IN FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF CLIENT ASSETS.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $4.05 BILLION FOR 2010, 10% HIGHER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED STAFF LEVELS AND THE IMPACT OF GROWTH INITIATIVES. PRE-TAX EARNINGS WERE $963 MILLION IN 2010, 3%

OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT FOR OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE RULES THAT WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD), THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC), THE SEC, THE

U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC) AND OTHER AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES UNDER THE REGIME ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATION AND THE IMPLEMENTING RULES. SIMILAR

REFORMS ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY OTHER REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS WORLDWIDE AND THESE REFORMS MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. WE EXPECT THAT THE PRINCIPAL AREAS OF IMPACT FROM REGULATORY REFORM FOR US WILL BE.



THE DODD-FRANK PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING AND THE LIMITATION ON THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE

EQUITY FUNDS BY BANKING ENTITIES, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, REFERRED TO AS THE VOLCKER RULE;



INCREASED REGULATION OF AND RESTRICTIONS ON OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES MARKETS AND TRANSACTIONS; AND



INCREASED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IN OCTOBER 2011, THE PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE VOLCKER RULE WERE ISSUED AND INCLUDED

AN EXTENSIVE REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL. THE PROPOSED RULES ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND MANY ASPECTS OF THE VOLCKER RULE REMAIN UNCLEAR. THE FULL IMPACT OF THE RULE WILL DEPEND UPON THE DETAILED SCOPE OF THE PROHIBITIONS, PERMITTED ACTIVITIES,

EXCEPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, AND THE FULL IMPACT ON THE FIRM WILL NOT BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY UNTIL THE RULES ARE FINALIZED.

WHILE MANY ASPECTS OF THE VOLCKER RULE REMAIN UNCLEAR, WE EVALUATED THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING AND DETERMINED THAT

BUSINESSES THAT ENGAGE IN BRIGHT LINE PROPRIETARY TRADING ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE PROHIBITED. IN 2011 AND 2010, WE LIQUIDATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES AND GLOBAL MACRO PROPRIETARY TRADING POSITIONS.

IN ADDITION, WE EVALUATED THE LIMITATIONS ON SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENTS IN, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS. THE FIRM EARNS

MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES FOR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FROM PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUNDS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SEGMENT. THE FIRM ALSO MAKES INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS AND THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM SUCH

INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT; THESE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE VOLCKER RULE. THE VOLCKER RULE LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS

INVESTMENT IN EACH PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUND TO 3% OR LESS OF NET ASSET VALUE, AND TO REDUCE THE FIRMS AGGREGATE INVESTMENT IN ALL SUCH FUNDS TO 3% OR LESS OF THE FIRMS TIER 1 CAPITAL. OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1999 THROUGH 2011, THE

FIRMS AGGREGATE NET REVENUES FROM ITS INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS AGGREGATE TOTAL NET REVENUES OVER THE SAME PERIOD. WE CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR EXISTING PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT THE TRANSITION PERIODS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE. WITH RESPECT TO OUR HEDGE FUNDS, WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO COMPLY WITH THE VOLCKER RULE BY REDEEMING CERTAIN OF OUR INTERESTS IN THE FUNDS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO REDEEM UP TO APPROXIMATELY 10%

OF CERTAIN HEDGE FUNDS TOTAL REDEEMABLE UNITS PER QUARTER OVER TEN CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS, BEGINNING MARCH 2012 AND ENDING JUNE 2014. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE LIMITED THE FIRMS INITIAL INVESTMENT TO 3% FOR CERTAIN NEW FUNDS.

AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND FDIC HAVE JOINTLY ISSUED A

RULE REQUIRING EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN ASSETS AND EACH DESIGNATED SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO PROVIDE TO REGULATORS AN ANNUAL PLAN FOR ITS RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL

DISTRESS OR FAILURE (RESOLUTION PLAN). OUR RESOLUTION PLAN MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ENSURE THAT GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA (GS BANK USA) IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER ENTITIES. THE REGULATORS JOINT RULE SETS SPECIFIC

STANDARDS FOR THE RESOLUTION PLANS, INCLUDING REQUIRING A DETAILED RESOLUTION STRATEGY AND ANALYSES OF THE COMPANYS MATERIAL ENTITIES, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, INTERCONNECTIONS AND INTERDEPENDENCIES, AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AMONG

OTHER ELEMENTS. WE HAVE COMMENCED WORK ON OUR FIRST RESOLUTION PLAN, WHICH WE MUST SUBMIT TO THE REGULATORS BY JULY 1, 2012. GS BANK USA IS ALSO REQUIRED BY THE FDIC TO SUBMIT A PLAN FOR ITS RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF

MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE BY JULY 1, 2012.

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE SEC PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE

DODD-FRANK ACTS PROHIBITION AGAINST SECURITIZATION PARTICIPANTS ENGAGING IN ANY TRANSACTION THAT WOULD INVOLVE OR RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH AN INVESTOR IN A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION. THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD

EXCEPT BONA FIDE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AND RISK-MITIGATING HEDGING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES FROM THE GENERAL PROHIBITION.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PROPOSED REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT NONBANK FINANCIAL FIRMS.

THESE PROPOSALS ADDRESS RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, STRESS TESTS, SINGLE COUNTERPARTY LIMITS AND EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL WEAKNESS AT AN EARLY STAGE. ALTHOUGH

MANY OF THE PROPOSALS MIRROR INITIATIVES TO WHICH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE ALREADY SUBJECT, THEIR FULL IMPACT ON THE FIRM WILL NOT BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY UNTIL THE RULES ARE FINALIZED.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED REVISED PROPOSALS TO MODIFY

THEIR MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TRADING ACTIVITIES. THE MODIFICATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MARKET RISK FRAMEWORK THAT WERE ANNOUNCED BY

THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN JUNE 2010 (BASEL 2.5), AS WELL AS THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF CREDIT RATINGS, AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT. WE EXPECT THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES TO PROPOSE FURTHER MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS

TO ADDRESS BOTH BASEL 3 AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS FOR GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS. ONCE IMPLEMENTED, IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE CHANGES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH THEIR FULL

IMPACT WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES PUBLISH THEIR FINAL RULES.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO

ESTABLISHES A BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION HAVING BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THIS BUREAU HAS OVERSIGHT OVER CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SEE BUSINESSREGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR MORE INFORMATION.

BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES

BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT

ONE OF

OUR MOST IMPORTANT RISK MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES IS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET. WHILE OUR ASSET BASE CHANGES DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY, MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF

OUR BALANCE SHEET REFLECT (I) OUR OVERALL RISK TOLERANCE, (II) OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS STABLE FUNDING SOURCES AND (III) THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL WE HOLD.

ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND ADJUSTED ASSETS AT QUARTERLY AND YEAR-END DATES ARE GENERALLY NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR

REPORTING PERIODS.

IN ORDER TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A LIQUID BALANCE SHEET

AND HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DYNAMICALLY MANAGE OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHICH INCLUDE.



QUARTERLY PLANNING;



BUSINESS-SPECIFIC LIMITS;



MONITORING OF KEY METRICS; AND



SCENARIO ANALYSES.

QUARTERLY PLANNING.

WE PREPARE A QUARTERLY BALANCE SHEET PLAN THAT COMBINES OUR PROJECTED

TOTAL ASSETS AND COMPOSITION OF ASSETS WITH OUR EXPECTED FUNDING SOURCES AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR THE UPCOMING QUARTER. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS QUARTERLY PLANNING PROCESS ARE.



TO DEVELOP OUR NEAR-TERM BALANCE SHEET PROJECTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERAL STATE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND EXPECTED CLIENT-DRIVEN AND

FIRM-DRIVEN ACTIVITY LEVELS;



TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROJECTED ASSETS ARE SUPPORTED BY AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT AND TENOR OF FUNDING AND THAT OUR PROJECTED CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY METRICS

ARE WITHIN MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES; AND



TO ALLOW BUSINESS RISK MANAGERS AND MANAGERS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE BALANCE SHEET LIMIT REQUESTS

FROM BUSINESS MANAGERS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRMS OVERALL BALANCE SHEET CONSTRAINTS. THESE CONSTRAINTS INCLUDE THE FIRMS LIABILITY PROFILE AND EQUITY CAPITAL LEVELS, MATURITIES AND PLANS FOR NEW DEBT AND EQUITY ISSUANCES, SHARE

REPURCHASES, DEPOSIT TRENDS AND SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS.

TO PREPARE OUR QUARTERLY BALANCE SHEET PLAN,

BUSINESS RISK MANAGERS AND MANAGERS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS MEET WITH BUSINESS MANAGERS TO REVIEW CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIOD METRICS AND DISCUSS EXPECTATIONS FOR THE UPCOMING QUARTER. THE SPECIFIC METRICS REVIEWED INCLUDE

ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, AGED INVENTORY, LIMIT UTILIZATION, RISK AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES, AND CAPITAL USAGE.

OUR CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY PLAN, INCLUDING OUR BALANCE SHEET PLANS BY BUSINESS, FUNDING AND CAPITAL PROJECTIONS, AND PROJECTED CAPITAL AND

LIQUIDITY METRICS, IS REVIEWED BY THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. SEE OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC LIMITS.

THE FINANCE COMMITTEE SETS ASSET AND LIABILITY LIMITS FOR EACH BUSINESS AND AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO HOLD INVENTORY OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. THESE

LIMITS ARE SET AT LEVELS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO ACTUAL OPERATING LEVELS IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROMPT ESCALATION AND DISCUSSION AMONG BUSINESS MANAGERS AND MANAGERS IN OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ON A ROUTINE BASIS. THE FINANCE COMMITTEE

REVIEWS AND APPROVES BALANCE SHEET LIMITS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND MAY ALSO APPROVE CHANGES IN LIMITS ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

MONITORING OF KEY

METRICS.

WE MONITOR KEY BALANCE SHEET METRICS DAILY BOTH BY BUSINESS AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, INCLUDING ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, AGED INVENTORY, LIMIT UTILIZATION,

RISK MEASURES AND CAPITAL USAGE. WE ALLOCATE ASSETS TO BUSINESSES AND REVIEW AND ANALYZE MOVEMENTS RESULTING FROM NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY AS WELL AS MARKET FLUCTUATIONS.

SCENARIO ANALYSES.

WE CONDUCT SCENARIO ANALYSES TO DETERMINE HOW WE WOULD MANAGE THE SIZE

AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE FUNDING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITIONS IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS.



THESE SCENARIOS COVER SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS USING VARIOUS MACRO-ECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS. WE USE THESE ANALYSES TO

ASSIST US IN DEVELOPING LONGER-TERM FUNDING PLANS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF UNSECURED DEBT ISSUANCES, THE SIZE OF OUR SECURED FUNDING PROGRAM AND THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL. WE ALSO CONSIDER ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE CONSTRAINTS, SUCH

AS LIMITS ON OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR ASSET BASE IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATE FUNDING.



THROUGH OUR INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS (ICAAP) AND OUR RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING, WE FURTHER ANALYZE HOW WE WOULD MANAGE

OUR BALANCE SHEET THROUGH THE DURATION OF A SEVERE CRISIS AND WE DEVELOP PLANS TO ACCESS FUNDING, GENERATE LIQUIDITY, AND/OR REDEPLOY EQUITY CAPITAL, AS APPROPRIATE.

BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION

IN ADDITION TO PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE PREPARE A BALANCE SHEET THAT GENERALLY ALLOCATES ASSETS TO OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP

PRESENTATION AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING OUR ASSETS ON THIS BASIS IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY MANAGEMENT VIEWS AND MANAGES RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE FIRMS ASSETS AND BETTER ENABLES INVESTORS TO ASSESS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FIRMS ASSETS. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THIS BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE CAPTIONS IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND CASH.

WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS AND COLLATERAL NEEDS IN THE EVENT OF A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. SEE LIQUIDITY RISK

MANAGEMENT BELOW FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPOSITION AND SIZING OF OUR EXCESS LIQUIDITY POOL OR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS (GCE). IN ADDITION TO OUR EXCESS LIQUIDITY, WE MAINTAIN OTHER OPERATING CASH BALANCES, PRIMARILY FOR USE IN SPECIFIC

CURRENCIES, ENTITIES, OR JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

SECURED CLIENT FINANCING.

WE PROVIDE COLLATERALIZED FINANCING FOR CLIENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARGIN LOANS SECURED BY CLIENT COLLATERAL, SECURITIES

BORROWED, AND RESALE AGREEMENTS PRIMARILY COLLATERALIZED BY GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT OF CLIENT ACTIVITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEGREGATE CASH AND SECURITIES TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. OUR SECURED CLIENT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE OR AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, AND INCLUDE DAILY MARGIN REQUIREMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT

SERVICES.

IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, WE MAINTAIN INVENTORY POSITIONS TO FACILITATE MARKET-MAKING IN FIXED INCOME, EQUITY, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF

CLIENT MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WE ENTER INTO RESALE OR SECURITIES BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS TO OBTAIN SECURITIES WHICH WE CAN USE TO COVER TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE OR OUR CLIENTS HAVE SOLD SECURITIES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PURCHASED. THE RECEIVABLES

IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES PRIMARILY RELATE TO SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS.

INVESTING & LENDING.

IN INVESTING & LENDING, WE MAKE INVESTMENTS AND ORIGINATE LOANS TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO CLIENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS AND LOANS ARE TYPICALLY LONGER-TERM IN NATURE. WE MAKE INVESTMENTS, DIRECTLY

AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE, IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

OTHER ASSETS.

OTHER ASSETS ARE GENERALLY LESS LIQUID, NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCOME TAX-RELATED RECEIVABLES, EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS AND MISCELLANEOUS RECEIVABLES.

LESS LIQUID INVENTORY COMPOSITION

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A LIQUID BALANCE SHEET COMPRISED OF ASSETS THAT CAN BE READILY SOLD OR FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS. HOWEVER, WE DO HOLD CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO SELL,

OR FUND ON A SECURED BASIS, ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF MARKET STRESS. WE FOCUS ON FUNDING THESE ASSETS WITH LIABILITIES THAT HAVE LONGER-TERM CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES TO REDUCE THE NEED TO REFINANCE IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THE TABLE BELOW

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS AND METRICS

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, TOTAL ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE $923.23 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $11.89 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 2010. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

(I) AN INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $16.22 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, (II) AN INCREASE IN CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES OF $10.53 BILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESERVE BALANCES HELD BY BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES RELATED TO CLIENT ACTIVITY, AND (III) AN INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE OF $7.25 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN COMMODITIES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN (I) COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS OF $13.53 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN CLIENT AND FIRM

ACTIVITY, AND (II) RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES OF $7.44 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY IN SECURED CLIENT FINANCING.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, TOTAL LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE $852.85 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $18.87 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 2010. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

(I) AN INCREASE IN DEPOSITS OF $7.54 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY AND (II) AN INCREASE IN PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES OF $7.36 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, OUR TOTAL SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS,

WERE $164.50 BILLION, WHICH WAS 7% HIGHER AND 3% HIGHER THAN THE DAILY AVERAGE AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 2011, THE INCREASE IN OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

RELATIVE TO THE DAILY AVERAGE DURING THE QUARTER AND YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AS OF DECEMBER 2010, OUR TOTAL SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED

FINANCINGS, WERE $162.35 BILLION, WHICH WAS 2% HIGHER AND 10% HIGHER THAN THE DAILY AVERAGE AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 2010, THE INCREASE IN OUR REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE DAILY AVERAGE DURING THE QUARTER AND YEAR WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND AN INCREASE IN FIRM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE LEVEL OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FLUCTUATES BETWEEN AND WITHIN

PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO PROVIDING CLIENTS WITH ACCESS TO HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL, SUCH AS U.S. GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL AGENCY AND INVESTMENT-GRADE SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS THROUGH COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

ADJUSTED LEVERAGE RATIO.

THE ADJUSTED LEVERAGE RATIO EQUALS ADJUSTED ASSETS DIVIDED BY TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADJUSTED LEVERAGE RATIO IS A MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY THAN THE

LEVERAGE RATIO BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES CERTAIN LOW-RISK COLLATERALIZED ASSETS THAT ARE GENERALLY SUPPORTED WITH LITTLE OR NO CAPITAL. THE ADJUSTED LEVERAGE RATIO IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES USED BY OTHER

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDING PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR OWN SALES FORCE TO A LARGE,

DIVERSE CREDITOR BASE IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR CREDITORS INCLUDE BANKS, GOVERNMENTS, SECURITIES LENDERS, PENSION FUNDS,

INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL GUIDELINES TO MONITOR CREDITOR CONCENTRATION ACROSS OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS.

SECURED FUNDING.

WE FUND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR INVENTORY ON A SECURED BASIS. SECURED

FUNDING IS LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT QUALITY THAN UNSECURED FUNDING DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE COLLATERAL WE POST TO OUR LENDERS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE TERMS OR AVAILABILITY OF SECURED FUNDING, PARTICULARLY SHORT-DATED FUNDING, CAN

DETERIORATE RAPIDLY IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT, WE GENERALLY DO NOT RELY ON SHORT-DATED SECURED FUNDING UNLESS IT IS COLLATERALIZED WITH HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES SUCH AS GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OTHER SECURED FUNDING IS EXECUTED FOR TENORS OF ONE MONTH OR GREATER. ADDITIONALLY, WE MONITOR COUNTERPARTY

CONCENTRATION AND HOLD A PORTION OF

OUR GCE FOR REFINANCING RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS. WE SEEK LONGER TERMS FOR SECURED FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY LOWER-QUALITY ASSETS BECAUSE THESE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS

MAY POSE GREATER REFINANCING RISK.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR SECURED FUNDING, EXCLUDING FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY

HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN OUR GCE, EXCEEDED 100 DAYS AS OF DECEMBER 2011.

A MAJORITY OF OUR SECURED

FUNDING FOR SECURITIES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN THE GCE IS EXECUTED THROUGH TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING CONTRACTS. WE ALSO RAISE FINANCING THROUGH OTHER TYPES OF COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, SUCH AS SECURED LOANS AND NOTES.

UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

WE ISSUE UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSETS AND TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR GCE. WE ISSUE IN DIFFERENT TENORS, CURRENCIES, AND PRODUCTS TO MAXIMIZE THE

DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTOR BASE. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS OUR QUARTERLY UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS MATURITY PROFILE THROUGH 2017 AS OF DECEMBER 2011.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS OF DECEMBER 2011 WAS

APPROXIMATELY EIGHT YEARS. TO MITIGATE REFINANCING RISK, WE SEEK TO LIMIT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT MATURING ON ANY ONE DAY OR DURING ANY WEEK OR YEAR. WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO CONVERT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

INTO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP).

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, WE HAD $8.53 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC UNDER THE TLGP, ALL OF WHICH WILL MATURE ON OR PRIOR TO JUNE 15, 2012. WE HAVE NOT

ISSUED LONG-TERM DEBT UNDER THE TLGP SINCE MARCH 2009 AND THE PROGRAM HAS EXPIRED FOR NEW ISSUANCES.

DEPOSITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, OUR BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES HAD $46.11 BILLION IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, INCLUDING $13.27 BILLION OF

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND OTHER TIME DEPOSITS WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF THREE YEARS, AND $32.84 BILLION OF OTHER DEPOSITS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WERE FROM CASH SWEEP PROGRAMS. WE UTILIZE DEPOSITS TO FINANCE LENDING ACTIVITIES IN OUR

BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO SUPPORT POTENTIAL OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS DRAWS ON UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS.

UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WERE ORIGINALLY LONG-TERM DEBT THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE WITHIN

ONE YEAR OF THE REPORTING DATE. WE USE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS TO FINANCE LIQUID ASSETS AND FOR OTHER CASH MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. WE PRIMARILY ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER, PROMISSORY NOTES, AND OTHER HYBRID INSTRUMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, WERE $49.04

BILLION. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

GS BANK USA HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING THROUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHILE WE DO NOT RELY ON THIS FUNDING IN OUR LIQUIDITY PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING, WE MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

NECESSARY TO ACCESS THIS FUNDING AND TEST DISCOUNT WINDOW BORROWING PROCEDURES.

EQUITY CAPITAL

CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO BE CONSERVATIVELY CAPITALIZED IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT AND

COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY BASE. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT SERVES AS A GUIDE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF EQUITY CAPITAL WE MAINTAIN.

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE DETERMINED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND ICAAP, AND MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES, SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ASSESSMENTS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES DUE TO

ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND MARKET ENVIRONMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A CAPITAL PLAN WHICH PROJECTS SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL GIVEN A RANGE OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS, AND A CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN WHICH PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR

ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO AN ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CAPITAL SHORTFALL.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 2011, AS PART OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW, U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR GREATER, ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANNUAL CAPITAL PLANS FOR REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE CAPITAL

PLANS SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO MAINTAIN ITS CAPITAL RATIOS ABOVE MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ABOVE A TIER 1 COMMON RATIO OF 5% ON A PRO FORMA BASIS UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSED SCENARIOS. THE

PURPOSE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS REVIEW IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESSES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THEIR UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMIT CONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL STRESS. AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLAN REVIEW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EVALUATES AN INSTITUTIONS PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS INCREASING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR REPURCHASING OR REDEEMING STOCK, ACROSS A RANGE OF

MACRO-ECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BEGAN THE ANNUAL CAPITAL PLAN REVIEWS IN EARLY 2012.

OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. OUR ICAAP INCORPORATES

AN INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK, IN A MANNER THAT IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES. OUR INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS.

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $67.28 BILLION AND PREFERRED STOCK OF $3.10 BILLION). AS OF DECEMBER 2010, OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $77.36 BILLION (CONSISTING OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $70.40 BILLION AND PREFERRED

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.

CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF GROUP INC., A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE U.S.

BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS CURRENTLY APPLICABLE

TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (WHICH ARE BASED ON THE BASEL 1 CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL COMMITTEE)). THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPRESSED AS CAPITAL RATIOS THAT COMPARE MEASURES OF CAPITAL TO

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS). SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS RWAS. THE FIRMS CAPITAL LEVELS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE

JUDGMENTS BY ITS REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATIONS REQUIRE

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4% AND A MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 8%. THE REQUIRED MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A WELL-CAPITALIZED BANK HOLDING

COMPANY UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES ARE 6% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING ON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. THE

MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET

RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%.

REDEMPTION OF THE FIRMS SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK AND THE REPURCHASE OF 47.0 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET EARNINGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS: ADVANCED CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK  BASEL 2, AS APPLICABLE TO US AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (BASEL 2), WHICH ARE BASED ON THE ADVANCED APPROACHES UNDER THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE

INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE INCORPORATED THE BASEL 2 FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT

INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS US, ADOPT BASEL 2, ONCE APPROVED TO DO SO BY REGULATORS. AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT

,

U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED A RULE THAT REQUIRES LARGE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, UPON

ADOPTION OF BASEL 2, TO CONTINUE TO CALCULATE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BOTH BASEL 1 AND BASEL 2. FOR EACH OF THE TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS, THE LOWER OF THE BASEL 1 AND BASEL 2 RATIOS CALCULATED WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER

THE BANK MEETS ITS MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE ISSUED REVISED

PROPOSALS TO MODIFY THEIR MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TRADING ACTIVITIES. THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE ADJUSTMENTS TO BASEL 2.5, AS WELL AS

THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF CREDIT RATINGS, AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT. ONCE IMPLEMENTED, IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE CHANGES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET RISK.

ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN DECEMBER 2010 (BASEL 3) REVISE THE DEFINITION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL, INTRODUCE

TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AS A REGULATORY METRIC, SET NEW MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS (INCLUDING A NEW CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH MUST BE COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AND WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS),

INTRODUCE A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WITHIN INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND MAKE SUBSTANTIAL REVISIONS TO THE COMPUTATION OF RWAS FOR CREDIT EXPOSURES. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT

SEVERAL YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE NOW ISSUED PROPOSED RULES THAT ARE INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE BASEL 2.5 GUIDELINES, THEY HAVE NOT YET ADDRESSED ALL ASPECTS OF THOSE GUIDELINES OR THE BASEL 3 CHANGES.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PUBLISHED ITS FINAL PROVISIONS FOR ASSESSING THE GLOBAL SYSTEMIC

IMPORTANCE OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND THE RANGE OF ADDITIONAL TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS DEEMED TO BE GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS WOULD INITIALLY RANGE

FROM 1% TO 2.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AND COULD BE AS MUCH AS 3.5% FOR A BANK THAT INCREASES ITS SYSTEMIC FOOTPRINT (E.G., BY INCREASING TOTAL ASSETS). THE FIRM WAS ONE OF 29 INSTITUTIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (ESTABLISHED AT

THE DIRECTION OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP OF 20) AS GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT UNDER THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY. THEREFORE, DEPENDING UPON THE MANNER AND TIMING OF THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL

COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY, WE EXPECT THAT THE MINIMUM TIER 1 COMMON RATIO REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO US WILL INCLUDE THIS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED AS GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT AND THE CALCULATION OF THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 2014 BASED ON DATA THROUGH THE END OF 2013.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL SUBJECT US AT A FIRMWIDE LEVEL TO THE SAME LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS AND DIRECTS BANKING REGULATORS TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS DISCLOSED ABOVE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT THE NEW LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REGULATIONS IN 2012. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CHANGES,

TIER 1 CAPITAL TREATMENT FOR OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS WILL BE PHASED OUT OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THE INTERACTION AMONG THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE BASEL COMMITTEES PROPOSED CHANGES AND

OTHER PROPOSED OR ANNOUNCED CHANGES FROM OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS ADDS FURTHER UNCERTAINTY TO OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS

WE PERFORM AN ICAAP WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRM IS APPROPRIATELY CAPITALIZED RELATIVE TO THE RISKS IN OUR BUSINESS.

AS PART OF OUR ICAAP, WE PERFORM AN INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT INCORPORATES MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND

OPERATIONAL RISK. MARKET RISK IS CALCULATED BY USING VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) CALCULATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY RISK-BASED ADD-ONS WHICH INCLUDE RISKS RELATED TO RARE EVENTS (TAIL RISKS). CREDIT RISK UTILIZES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR COUNTERPARTIES

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT, THE SIZE OF OUR LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT AND THE MATURITY OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO US. OPERATIONAL RISK IS CALCULATED BASED ON SCENARIOS INCORPORATING MULTIPLE TYPES OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURES. BACKTESTING IS USED TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MODELS AT CAPTURING AND MEASURING RELEVANT RISKS.

WE EVALUATE

CAPITAL ADEQUACY BASED ON THE RESULT OF OUR INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT, SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS WHICH MEASURE THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE UNDER VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS. OUR GOAL IS TO HOLD SUFFICIENT CAPITAL,

UNDER OUR INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, TO ENSURE WE REMAIN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AFTER EXPERIENCING A SEVERE STRESS EVENT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS VIEWED IN TANDEM WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY AND INTEGRATED

INTO THE OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND POLICY FRAMEWORK OF THE FIRM.

WE ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF

OUR BUSINESSES BASED UPON OUR INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND MANAGE THE LEVELS OF USAGE BASED UPON THE BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS ESTABLISHED.

RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE

OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., WHICH DIRECTLY ISSUES OR GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS. GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.) AND GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED LONG- AND

SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS BY CERTAIN CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. GS BANK USA HAS ALSO BEEN ASSIGNED LONG-TERM ISSUER RATINGS AS WELL AS RATINGS ON ITS LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BANK DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE ASSIGNED RATINGS TO

DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF GROUP INC.

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN

DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS OWN DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE CALCULATION. SEE

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RATINGS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT RATINGS OF GROUP INC., GS&CO., GSI AND GS BANK USA.

SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA AND OUR BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION AND CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL, GS BANK USA HAS ESTABLISHED AN ICAAP WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THAT USED BY GROUP INC. GS BANK USAS CAPITAL LEVELS AND PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION CLASSIFICATION ARE SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY ITS REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.

WE EXPECT THAT THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE IMPACTED IN THE FUTURE BY THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTS ARISING FROM THE BASEL COMMITTEE, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS.

SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT GS BANK USAS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL 1 AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AND FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF

REGULATORY REFORM.

SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY HOLD CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX

GUIDELINES, RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS (FOR ENTITIES WITH ASSIGNED CREDIT RATINGS) OR INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED ON ITS UNDERLYING LEVEL OF RISK. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, GROUP INC. MAY BE LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL HELD AT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER CONSTRAINTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, GROUP INC.S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES WAS

$67.70 BILLION AND $71.30 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $70.38 BILLION AND $77.36 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF GS&CO., GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS

BANK (EUROPE) PLC AND GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P. (GSEC) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, GROUP INC. CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES INTO GS BANK USA, AND GROUP INC. AGREED TO GUARANTEE CERTAIN LOSSES, INCLUDING

CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES, RELATING TO ASSETS HELD BY THE CONTRIBUTED ENTITIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE, GROUP INC. ALSO AGREED TO PLEDGE TO GS BANK USA CERTAIN COLLATERAL, INCLUDING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS

MANAGED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES AND NON-U.S. DENOMINATED DEBT.

CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN

OUR CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, IDENTIFICATION OF DRIVERS OF A CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, AS WELL AS MITIGANTS AND POTENTIAL ACTIONS. IT OUTLINES THE APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW DURING A CRISIS PERIOD, INCLUDING INTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION AS

WELL AS ENSURING TIMELY COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.

EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT LEVEL AND OPTIMAL COMPOSITION OF EQUITY CAPITAL. WE PRINCIPALLY MANAGE OUR CAPITAL THROUGH

ISSUANCES AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE OR REPURCHASE OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER FORMS OF CAPITAL AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT

AND SUBJECT TO ANY REGULATORY APPROVALS. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND/OR LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE BOTH AT THE CONSOLIDATED AND BUSINESS LEVELS. WE ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF

OUR BUSINESSES BASED UPON OUR INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND MANAGE THE LEVELS OF USAGE BASED UPON THE BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS ESTABLISHED.

PREFERRED STOCK

. DURING 2011, WE REDEEMED THE 50,000 SHARES OF OUR SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK HELD BY BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY FOR THE STATED REDEMPTION PRICE OF $5.50 BILLION ($110,000 PER SHARE), PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID

DIVIDENDS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS REDEMPTION, WE RECOGNIZED A PREFERRED DIVIDEND OF $1.64 BILLION (CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE REDEMPTION VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK), WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF EARNINGS FOR 2011. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CONTINUES TO HOLD A FIVE-YEAR WARRANT, ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2008, TO PURCHASE UP TO 43.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $115.00 PER SHARE.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

WE SEEK TO USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITIONS (I.E., COMPARISONS OF OUR DESIRED

LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL TO OUR ACTUAL LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL) AND THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND

TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS OF GROUP INC. (BOARD), WE CAN REPURCHASE UP TO 63.5 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, ANY SUCH REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. SEE MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON

EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES IN PART II, ITEM 5 AND NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR REPURCHASE

PROGRAM.

BECAUSE IT IS A MEASURE THAT WE AND INVESTORS USE TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE

HAVE VARIOUS TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS CAN TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING.



PURCHASING OR RETAINING RESIDUAL AND OTHER INTERESTS IN SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION

VEHICLES;



HOLDING SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT, INTERESTS IN LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK IN OTHER NONCONSOLIDATED

VEHICLES;



ENTERING INTO OPERATING LEASES; AND



PROVIDING GUARANTEES, INDEMNIFICATIONS, LOAN COMMITMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS. THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES THAT PURCHASE

MORTGAGES, CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MARKETS, SINCE THEY OFFER INVESTORS ACCESS TO

SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS AND RISKS CREATED THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS.

WE ALSO ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO UNDERWRITE

CLIENT SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDE SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS; PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH CREDIT-LINKED AND ASSET-REPACKAGED NOTES; AND RECEIVE OR

EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OFFICE SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. THIS EXCESS SPACE, THE COST OF WHICH IS CHARGED TO EARNINGS AS

CURRENT AND PROJECTED STAFFING LEVELS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011, TOTAL OCCUPANCY EXPENSES FOR SPACE HELD IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS WERE $85 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES COSTS RELATED TO THE TRANSITION TO OUR NEW HEADQUARTERS IN

NEW YORK CITY. IN ADDITION, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011, WE INCURRED EXIT COSTS OF $14 MILLION RELATED TO OUR OFFICE SPACE. WE MAY INCUR EXIT COSTS IN THE FUTURE TO THE EXTENT WE (I) REDUCE OUR SPACE CAPACITY OR (II) COMMIT TO, OR

OCCUPY, NEW PROPERTIES IN THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, DISPOSE OF EXISTING SPACE THAT HAD BEEN HELD FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH. THESE EXIT COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.

OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

WE BELIEVE THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE

SUCCESS OF THE FIRM. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH WE MONITOR, EVALUATE AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR ACTIVITIES. THESE INCLUDE MARKET, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY

AND REPUTATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS BUILT AROUND THREE CORE COMPONENTS: GOVERNANCE, PROCESSES AND PEOPLE.

GOVERNANCE.

RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STARTS WITH OUR BOARD, WHICH PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE

IN REVIEWING AND APPROVING RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS RISK COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSISTS OF ALL OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS. THE BOARD ALSO RECEIVES PERIODIC UPDATES ON FIRMWIDE RISKS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT

CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. NEXT, AT THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS OF THE FIRM, OUR LEADERS ARE EXPERIENCED RISK MANAGERS, WITH A SOPHISTICATED AND DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WE TAKE. OUR SENIOR MANAGERS LEAD AND PARTICIPATE IN RISK-ORIENTED

COMMITTEES, AS DO THE LEADERS OF OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS  INCLUDING THOSE IN INTERNAL AUDIT, COMPLIANCE, CONTROLLERS, CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LEGAL, MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS,

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT, TAX, TECHNOLOGY AND TREASURY.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FIRMS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE PROTOCOL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR

DECISION-MAKING ON RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND ENSURES IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE DECISIONS. WE MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF RISK-RELATED COMMITTEES THAT MEET REGULARLY AND SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO FACILITATE AND FOSTER ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO IDENTIFY,

MANAGE AND MITIGATE RISKS.

WE MAINTAIN STRONG COMMUNICATION ABOUT RISK AND WE HAVE A CULTURE OF COLLABORATION IN

DECISION-MAKING AMONG THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IN MANAGING RISK RESTS WITH THE MANAGERS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS,

WE DEDICATE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES TO INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE A STRONG OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE AND AN APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES.

PROCESSES.

WE MAINTAIN VARIOUS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS OUR DAILY DISCIPLINE OF MARKING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS INVENTORY TO CURRENT MARKET LEVELS. GOLDMAN SACHS CARRIES ITS INVENTORY AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN VALUATION REFLECTED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND IN NET REVENUES. WE DO SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS DISCIPLINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISK AND THAT IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENT AND REALISTIC INSIGHT INTO OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURES.

WE ALSO APPLY A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK OF LIMITS TO CONTROL RISK ACROSS MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS, PRODUCTS, BUSINESSES AND MARKETS.

THIS INCLUDES SETTING CREDIT AND MARKET RISK LIMITS AT A VARIETY OF LEVELS AND MONITORING THESE LIMITS ON A DAILY BASIS. LIMITS ARE TYPICALLY SET AT LEVELS THAT WILL BE PERIODICALLY EXCEEDED, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK

APPETITE. THIS FOSTERS AN ONGOING DIALOGUE ON RISK AMONG REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS RAPID ESCALATION OF RISK-RELATED MATTERS. SEE MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT AND CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR RISK LIMITS.

ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR

POSITIONS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROCESS. PROACTIVE MITIGATION OF OUR MARKET AND CREDIT EXPOSURES MINIMIZES THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO TAKE OUTSIZED ACTIONS DURING PERIODS OF STRESS.

WE ALSO FOCUS ON THE RIGOR AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS RISK SYSTEMS. THE GOAL OF

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY IS TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME, WHICH REQUIRES SYSTEMS THAT ARE COMPREHENSIVE, RELIABLE AND TIMELY. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY TO

ENSURE THAT IT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES US WITH COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION.

PEOPLE.

EVEN THE BEST TECHNOLOGY SERVES ONLY AS A TOOL FOR HELPING TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN REAL TIME ABOUT THE RISKS WE ARE TAKING. ULTIMATELY,

EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES OUR PEOPLE TO INTERPRET OUR RISK DATA ON AN ONGOING AND TIMELY BASIS AND ADJUST RISK POSITIONS ACCORDINGLY. IN BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, THE EXPERIENCE OF

OUR PROFESSIONALS, AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NUANCES AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH RISK MEASURE, GUIDE THE FIRM IN ASSESSING EXPOSURES AND MAINTAINING THEM WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS.

STRUCTURE

ULTIMATE OVERSIGHT OF RISK IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FIRMS BOARD.

THE BOARD OVERSEES RISK BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS RISK COMMITTEE. WITHIN THE FIRM, A SERIES OF COMMITTEES WITH SPECIFIC RISK MANAGEMENT MANDATES HAVE OVERSIGHT OR DECISION-MAKING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. COMMITTEE

MEMBERSHIP GENERALLY CONSISTS OF SENIOR MANAGERS FROM BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR THESE COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BARRIERS ARE IN

PLACE. OUR PRIMARY RISK COMMITTEES, MOST OF WHICH ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL SUB-COMMITTEES OR WORKING GROUPS, ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THESE COMMITTEES, WE HAVE OTHER RISK-ORIENTED COMMITTEES WHICH PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

FOR DIFFERENT BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES, PRODUCTS, REGIONS AND LEGAL ENTITIES.

MEMBERSHIP OF THE FIRMS RISK COMMITTEES IS

REVIEWED REGULARLY AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT MEMBERS SERVE ON THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES VARIES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND BASED ON THE

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MEMBERS WITHIN THE FIRM.

IN ADDITION, INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, WHICH REPORT TO THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, GENERAL COUNSEL, CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, OR IN THE CASE OF INTERNAL AUDIT, TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAY-TO-DAY OVERSIGHT OF RISK, AS DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING

SECTIONS.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MOST OF THE RECENT FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS IN

PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSERVATIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES TO ADDRESS BOTH FIRM-SPECIFIC AND BROADER INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO FUND THE FIRM AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO

CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING

PRINCIPLES.

EXCESS LIQUIDITY.

WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS AND COLLATERAL NEEDS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT.

WE ASSESS ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIODS FOR OUR ASSETS AND THEIR EXPECTED LIQUIDITY IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. WE MANAGE THE MATURITIES AND DIVERSITY OF OUR FUNDING ACROSS MARKETS, PRODUCTS

AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND SEEK TO MAINTAIN LIABILITIES OF APPROPRIATE TENOR RELATIVE TO OUR ASSET BASE.

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.

WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A LIQUIDITY CRISIS SITUATION OR PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THIS FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH THE PLAN OF ACTION TO FUND

NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN EMERGENCY AND STRESS SITUATIONS. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.

EXCESS LIQUIDITY

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO PRE-FUND OUR ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CASH NEEDS DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD THIS EXCESS

LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES AND CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS WOULD BE READILY CONVERTIBLE TO CASH IN A MATTER OF DAYS, THROUGH LIQUIDATION, BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS OR FROM MATURITIES OF REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND THAT THIS CASH WOULD ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES AND CERTAIN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS INCLUDED IN OUR GCE TOTALED

$171.58 BILLION AND $174.78 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNAL LIQUIDITY RISK MODEL, DISCUSSED BELOW, AS WELL AS OUR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF

THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE FIRM, WE BELIEVE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 WAS APPROPRIATE.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED EXCESS IS COMPOSED OF (I) UNENCUMBERED U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING HIGHLY LIQUID U.S. FEDERAL AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED OBLIGATIONS), ALL OF WHICH ARE ELIGIBLE AS COLLATERAL IN FEDERAL RESERVE OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS AND (II) CERTAIN OVERNIGHT U.S. DOLLAR CASH DEPOSITS. THE

NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED EXCESS IS COMPOSED OF ONLY UNENCUMBERED GERMAN, FRENCH, JAPANESE AND UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN OVERNIGHT CASH DEPOSITS IN HIGHLY LIQUID CURRENCIES. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR EXCESS LIQUIDITY TO THIS

NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES AND CASH BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY, SUCH AS LOWER-QUALITY UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT

FACILITIES, IN OUR GCE.

OUR GCE REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS SURVIVAL.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. OUR BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND OUR

LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE,

AND THE TERMS (E.G., INTEREST RATES, COLLATERAL PROVISIONS AND TENOR) OR AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO PRE-FUND LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER

DEBT BALANCES THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND OUR FUNDING COSTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GCE PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ADVANCE OF

POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE SIZE OF OUR GCE, WE USE AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW,

WHICH CAPTURES AND QUANTIFIES THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISKS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE FIRM.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR GCE ACROSS SUBSIDIARIES, ASSET TYPES, AND CLEARING AGENTS TO PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT OPERATING LIQUIDITY TO ENSURE

TIMELY SETTLEMENT IN ALL MAJOR MARKETS, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

WE MAINTAIN OUR GCE TO ENABLE US TO MEET

CURRENT AND POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND OUR MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW INCORPORATES A CONSOLIDATED REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS A STANDALONE REQUIREMENT FOR EACH OF

OUR MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES. LIQUIDITY HELD DIRECTLY IN EACH OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES IS INTENDED FOR USE ONLY BY THAT SUBSIDIARY TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND IS ASSUMED NOT TO BE AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. UNLESS

(I) LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR AND (II) THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS. WE HOLD A PORTION OF OUR GCE DIRECTLY AT GROUP INC. TO SUPPORT CONSOLIDATED REQUIREMENTS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES. IN

ADDITION TO THE GCE, WE MAINTAIN OPERATING CASH BALANCES IN SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES, PRIMARILY FOR USE IN SPECIFIC CURRENCIES, ENTITIES, OR JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IN ADDITION TO OUR GCE, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED CASH AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTHER GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS, MARGINABLE EQUITIES, LOANS AND CASH DEPOSITS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR GCE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AVERAGED $83.32 BILLION

AND $72.98 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THESE ASSETS LIQUID ENOUGH TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR GCE LIQUIDITY POOL AND THEREFORE CONSERVATIVELY DO NOT ASSUME WE WILL GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM

THESE ASSETS IN OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.

MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.

OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW IS BASED ON A SCENARIO THAT INCLUDES BOTH A MARKET-WIDE STRESS AND A FIRM-SPECIFIC STRESS, CHARACTERIZED BY SOME OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING QUALITATIVE

ELEMENTS.



GLOBAL RECESSION, DEFAULT BY A MEDIUM-SIZED SOVEREIGN, LOW CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CONFIDENCE, AND GENERAL FINANCIAL INSTABILITY.



SEVERELY CHALLENGED MARKET ENVIRONMENT WITH MATERIAL DECLINES IN EQUITY MARKETS AND WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS.



DAMAGING FOLLOW-ON IMPACTS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LEADING TO THE FAILURE OF A LARGE BANK.



A FIRM-SPECIFIC CRISIS POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED BY MATERIAL LOSSES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, LITIGATION, EXECUTIVE DEPARTURE, AND/OR A RATINGS DOWNGRADE.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE CRITICAL MODELING PARAMETERS OF THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.



LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A 30-DAY SCENARIO.



A TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF THE FIRMS LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT RATINGS.



A COMBINATION OF CONTRACTUAL OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT, AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS (E.G., ACTIONS THOUGH NOT

CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED, WE MAY DEEM NECESSARY IN A CRISIS). WE ASSUME THAT MOST CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS WILL OCCUR WITHIN THE INITIAL DAYS AND WEEKS OF A CRISIS.



NO ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR UNSECURED DEBT.



NO SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENT FUNDING FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACCESS TO VARIOUS CENTRAL BANK FUNDING PROGRAMS, WE DO NOT ASSUME RELIANCE ON THEM

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS.



NO DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT ACROSS LIQUIDITY RISKS. WE ASSUME THAT LIQUIDITY RISKS ARE ADDITIVE.



MAINTENANCE OF OUR NORMAL BUSINESS LEVELS. WE DO NOT ASSUME ASSET LIQUIDATION, OTHER THAN THE GCE.

THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW IS CALCULATED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY BASIS. WE REGULARLY REFINE OUR MODEL TO REFLECT

CHANGES IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE FIRMS BUSINESS MIX.

THE POTENTIAL CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT CASH AND

COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS COVERED IN OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW INCLUDE.

UNSECURED FUNDING



CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, PROMISSORY NOTES AND OTHER UNSECURED FUNDING PRODUCTS. WE ASSUME

THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT OR ROLLOVER ANY MATURING DEBT.



CONTINGENT: REPURCHASES OF OUR OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A

MARKET MAKER.

DEPOSITS



CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF TERM DEPOSITS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW TERM DEPOSITS OR ROLLOVER ANY MATURING TERM

DEPOSITS.



CONTINGENT: WITHDRAWALS OF BANK DEPOSITS THAT HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE WITHDRAWAL ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE TYPE OF

DEPOSIT, WHETHER THE DEPOSIT IS INSURED OR UNINSURED, AND THE FIRMS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPOSITOR.

SECURED FUNDING



CONTRACTUAL: A PORTION OF UPCOMING CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF SECURED FUNDING DUE TO EITHER THE INABILITY TO REFINANCE OR THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE

ONLY AT WIDER HAIRCUTS (I.E., ON TERMS WHICH REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL). OUR ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION.



CONTINGENT: A DECLINE IN VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

POSTINGS UNDER THOSE TRANSACTIONS.

OTC DERIVATIVES



CONTINGENT: COLLATERAL POSTINGS TO COUNTERPARTIES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES.



CONTINGENT: AN INCREASE IN INITIAL MARGIN AND GUARANTY FUND REQUIREMENTS BY DERIVATIVE CLEARING HOUSES.

CUSTOMER CASH AND SECURITIES



CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRIME BROKERAGE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WITHDRAWALS OF CUSTOMER CREDIT BALANCES, AND A REDUCTION IN

CUSTOMER SHORT POSITIONS, WHICH SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS



CONTINGENT: DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. DRAW ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE OF COMMITMENT AND COUNTERPARTY.

OTHER



OTHER UPCOMING LARGE CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS TAX PAYMENTS.

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO

ENSURE WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FINANCING, EVEN WHEN FUNDING MARKETS EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT STRESS. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A LONG-DATED AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR

ASSETS.

OUR APPROACH TO ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT INCLUDES.



CONSERVATIVELY MANAGING THE OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR FUNDING BOOK, WITH A FOCUS ON MAINTAINING LONG-TERM, DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDING IN

EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. SEE BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  FUNDING SOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.



ACTIVELY MANAGING AND MONITORING OUR ASSET BASE, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE LIQUIDITY, HOLDING PERIOD AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A SECURED

BASIS. THIS ENABLES US TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FUNDING PRODUCTS AND TENORS. LESS LIQUID ASSETS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO FUND AND THEREFORE REQUIRE FUNDING OF LONGER TENOR. SEE BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  BALANCE SHEET

MANAGEMENT FOR MORE DETAIL ON OUR BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS.



RAISING SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING THAT HAS A SUFFICIENTLY LONGER TERM THAN THE ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIOD OF OUR ASSETS. THIS REDUCES THE RISK

THAT OUR LIABILITIES WILL COME DUE IN ADVANCE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS. BECAUSE WE MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET, THE HOLDING PERIOD OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS MAY BE MATERIALLY SHORTER THAN THEIR

CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES.

OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL CAPITAL (UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) SO THAT WE CAN AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES (OTHER THAN OUR GCE). HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ORDERLY ASSET SALES MAY BE PRUDENT OR NECESSARY IN A SEVERE OR PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS. THE TARGET AMOUNT OF OUR

TOTAL CAPITAL IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL FUNDING MODEL WHICH INCORPORATES THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM FINANCING REQUIREMENTS.



THE PORTION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE, THAT ARE NOT FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS.



GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS.



DERIVATIVE AND OTHER MARGIN AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS.



ANTICIPATED DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS.



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO HOLD CAPITAL OR OTHER FORMS OF FINANCING IN EXCESS OF WHAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE HOLD IN REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY GROUP INC. WHICH LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET FINANCING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING ARE ENHANCED CONTROL AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IS ALSO RAISED AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL THROUGH A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SECURED FUNDING, UNSECURED BORROWINGS AND DEPOSITS.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ASSUME THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR, A SUBSIDIARYS FUNDS OR SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY

AVAILABLE TO ITS PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT

KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ASSUME THAT THE CAPITAL PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY OTHER FINANCING

PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THE MATURITY OF SUCH FINANCING.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DECEMBER 2011, GROUP INC. HAD $28.16 BILLION OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GS&CO., ITS

PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; $28.43 BILLION INVESTED IN GSI, A REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER; $2.67 BILLION INVESTED IN GSEC, A U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; $4.28 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD., A REGULATED JAPANESE

BROKER-DEALER; AND $19.23 BILLION INVESTED IN GS BANK USA, A REGULATED NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK. GROUP INC. ALSO PROVIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, $84.83 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS AND $6.12 BILLION OF COLLATERAL TO THESE ENTITIES,

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS TO GS&CO. AND GSI, AS OF DECEMBER 2011. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 2011, GROUP INC. HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN

THE GOLDMAN SACHS CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN SETS OUT THE PLAN OF ACTION WE WOULD USE TO FUND BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN CRISIS SITUATIONS AND PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN OUTLINES A

LIST OF POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS, KEY REPORTS AND METRICS THAT ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ASSIST IN ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF, AND MANAGING THROUGH, A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND/OR MARKET DISLOCATION. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DESCRIBES IN

DETAIL THE FIRMS POTENTIAL RESPONSES IF OUR ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THAT THE FIRM HAS ENTERED A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WHICH INCLUDE PRE-FUNDING FOR WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS AS WELL AS UTILIZING SECONDARY

SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. MITIGANTS AND ACTION ITEMS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC RISKS WHICH MAY ARISE ARE ALSO DESCRIBED AND ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTION.

THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN IDENTIFIES KEY GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS TO FOSTER EFFECTIVE COORDINATION, CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION, ALL OF WHICH ARE CRITICAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A CRISIS OR

PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DETAILS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, WHICH INCLUDE MAKING AND DISSEMINATING KEY DECISIONS, COORDINATING ALL CONTINGENCY ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE

CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS, IMPLEMENTING LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND MANAGING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISIONS INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MEASUREMENT,

STANDARDS AND MONITORING CALLS FOR IMPOSITION OF A LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE BANKING ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS BASED ON EXPECTED CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER AN ACUTE LIQUIDITY

STRESS SCENARIO, AND A NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO, DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF BANKING ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE INTRODUCED AS A

REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2015, AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE INTRODUCED AS A REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2018. WHILE THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE NEW FRAMEWORK ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STANDARDS COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES.

CASH FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL

IN EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESSES.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $16.22 BILLION TO $56.01 BILLION AT THE END OF 2011. WE GENERATED $23.13 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES. WE USED NET CASH OF $6.91

BILLION FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK AND COMMON STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN BANK DEPOSITS.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2010.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $1.50 BILLION TO

$39.79 BILLION AT THE END OF 2010. WE GENERATED $7.84 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY FROM NET PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF SHORT-TERM SECURED FINANCINGS. WE USED NET CASH OF $6.34 BILLION FOR OPERATING AND INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY TO FUND AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND AN INCREASE IN CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH GENERATED FROM A DECREASE IN SECURITIES

BORROWED.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES. WE HOLD INVENTORY PRIMARILY FOR MARKET MAKING FOR OUR CLIENTS AND FOR OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES.

OUR INVENTORY THEREFORE CHANGES BASED ON CLIENT DEMANDS AND OUR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OUR INVENTORY IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATES ON A DAILY BASIS. CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



INTEREST RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF YIELD CURVES, THE VOLATILITIES OF INTEREST RATES,

MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, BASKETS OF EQUITIES AND EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, NATURAL

GAS, CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

WE MANAGE OUR MARKET RISK BY DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES, CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING ECONOMIC HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR

DERIVATIVES. THIS INCLUDES.



ACCURATE AND TIMELY EXPOSURE INFORMATION INCORPORATING MULTIPLE RISK METRICS;



A DYNAMIC LIMIT SETTING FRAMEWORK; AND



CONSTANT COMMUNICATION AMONG REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, RISK MANAGERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY

RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING MARKET RISK AT THE FIRM. WE MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS THROUGH STRONG FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ACROSS THE FIRMS GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANAGING RISK WITHIN PRESCRIBED

LIMITS. THESE MANAGERS HAVE IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR POSITIONS, OF MARKETS AND THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO HEDGE THEIR EXPOSURES.

MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSS MARKET INFORMATION, POSITIONS AND ESTIMATED RISK AND LOSS SCENARIOS ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

RISK MEASURES

MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT PRODUCES RISK MEASURES AND MONITORS THEM AGAINST MARKET RISK LIMITS SET BY OUR FIRMS RISK COMMITTEES. THESE MEASURES REFLECT AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SCENARIOS AND THE RESULTS ARE AGGREGATED AT TRADING DESK, BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE

LEVELS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET

MOVES OVER BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS. RISK MEASURES USED FOR SHORTER-TERM PERIODS INCLUDE VAR AND SENSITIVITY METRICS. FOR LONGER-TERM HORIZONS, OUR PRIMARY RISK MEASURES ARE STRESS TESTS. OUR RISK REPORTS DETAIL KEY RISKS, DRIVERS

AND CHANGES FOR EACH DESK AND BUSINESS, AND ARE DISTRIBUTED DAILY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS.

SYSTEMS

WE HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY TO MONITOR MARKET RISK

INCLUDING.



AN INDEPENDENT CALCULATION OF VAR AND STRESS MEASURES;



RISK MEASURES CALCULATED AT INDIVIDUAL POSITION LEVELS;



ATTRIBUTION OF RISK MEASURES TO INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS OF EACH POSITION;



THE ABILITY TO REPORT MANY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE RISK MEASURES (E.G., BY DESK, BUSINESS, PRODUCT TYPE OR LEGAL ENTITY); AND



THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE AD HOC ANALYSES IN A TIMELY MANNER.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VALUE-AT-RISK

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF INVENTORY POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. WE TYPICALLY EMPLOY A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON WITH A

95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE VAR MODEL CAPTURES RISKS INCLUDING INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS SUCH, VAR FACILITATES COMPARISON ACROSS PORTFOLIOS OF DIFFERENT RISK CHARACTERISTICS. VAR ALSO CAPTURES THE

DIVERSIFICATION OF AGGREGATED RISK AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL.

WE ARE AWARE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR AND THEREFORE USE A

VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES IN OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR INCLUDE.



VAR DOES NOT ESTIMATE POTENTIAL LOSSES OVER LONGER TIME HORIZONS WHERE MOVES MAY BE EXTREME.



VAR DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIVE LIQUIDITY OF DIFFERENT RISK POSITIONS.



PREVIOUS MOVES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF ALL FUTURE MARKET MOVES.

WHEN CALCULATING VAR, WE USE HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS WITH FULL VALUATION OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000 MARKET FACTORS. THE HISTORICAL DATA USED

IN OUR VAR CALCULATION IS WEIGHTED TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECT CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES. THIS IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL LOSS. AS A RESULT, EVEN IF OUR INVENTORY POSITIONS WERE

UNCHANGED, OUR VAR WOULD INCREASE WITH INCREASING MARKET VOLATILITY AND VICE VERSA.

GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR

IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS.

WE EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF OUR VAR MODEL THROUGH DAILY BACKTESTING (I.E., COMPARING DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES TO THE VAR MEASURE CALCULATED AS OF THE PRIOR BUSINESS DAY) AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL AND FOR

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND MAJOR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

OUR VAR MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE.



POSITIONS THAT ARE BEST MEASURED AND MONITORED USING SENSITIVITY MEASURES; AND



THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON UNSECURED BORROWINGS

FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED.

STRESS TESTING

WE USE STRESS TESTING TO EXAMINE RISKS OF SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES ACROSS THE FIRM. WE USE A VARIETY OF SCENARIOS TO CALCULATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS

FROM A WIDE RANGE OF MARKET MOVES ON THE FIRMS PORTFOLIOS. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE THE DEFAULT OF SINGLE CORPORATE OR SOVEREIGN ENTITIES, THE IMPACT OF A MOVE IN A SINGLE RISK FACTOR ACROSS ALL POSITIONS (E.G., EQUITY PRICES OR CREDIT SPREADS)

OR A COMBINATION OF TWO OR MORE RISK FACTORS.

UNLIKE VAR MEASURES, WHICH HAVE AN IMPLIED PROBABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE

CALCULATED AT A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THERE IS GENERALLY NO IMPLIED PROBABILITY THAT OUR STRESS TEST SCENARIOS WILL OCCUR. INSTEAD, STRESS TESTS ARE USED TO MODEL BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MOVES IN UNDERLYING MARKET FACTORS. WHEN

ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS, WE GENERALLY ASSUME THAT OUR POSITIONS CANNOT BE REDUCED OR HEDGED (ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO DO SO).

STRESS TEST SCENARIOS ARE CONDUCTED ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF THE FIRMS ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET EVENTS OR CONCERNS. STRESS TESTING IS AN

IMPORTANT PART OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, UNDERTAKE RISK/REWARD ANALYSIS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR RISK POSITIONS.

LIMITS

WE USE RISK LIMITS AT

VARIOUS LEVELS IN THE FIRM (INCLUDING FIRMWIDE, PRODUCT AND BUSINESS) TO GOVERN RISK APPETITE BY CONTROLLING THE SIZE OF OUR EXPOSURES TO MARKET RISK. LIMITS ARE REVIEWED FREQUENTLY AND AMENDED ON A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BASIS TO REFLECT CHANGING

MARKET CONDITIONS, BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR TOLERANCE FOR RISK.

THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE SETS MARKET RISK LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE

AND PRODUCT LEVELS AND OUR SECURITIES DIVISION RISK COMMITTEE SETS SUB-LIMITS FOR MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES AT A BUSINESS LEVEL. THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRMWIDE LIMITS IS TO ASSIST SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN CONTROLLING THE FIRMS OVERALL

RISK PROFILE. SUB-LIMITS SET THE DESIRED MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE THAT MAY BE MANAGED BY ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, EFFECTIVELY LEAVING DAY-TO-DAY TRADING DECISIONS TO

INDIVIDUAL DESK MANAGERS AND TRADERS. ACCORDINGLY, SUB-LIMITS ARE A MANAGEMENT TOOL DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE ESCALATION RATHER THAN TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM RISK TOLERANCE. SUB-LIMITS ALSO DISTRIBUTE RISK AMONG VARIOUS BUSINESSES IN A MANNER THAT

IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR LEVEL OF ACTIVITY AND CLIENT DEMAND, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF EACH AREA.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OUR MARKET RISK LIMITS ARE MONITORED DAILY BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED. THE BUSINESS-LEVEL LIMITS THAT ARE SET BY THE SECURITIES DIVISION RISK COMMITTEE ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME SCRUTINY AND LIMIT ESCALATION POLICY AS THE

FIRMWIDE LIMITS.

WHEN A RISK LIMIT HAS BEEN EXCEEDED (E.G., DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED

VOLATILITIES OR CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS), IT IS REPORTED TO THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE AND A DISCUSSION TAKES PLACE WITH THE RELEVANT DESK MANAGERS, AFTER WHICH EITHER THE RISK POSITION IS REDUCED OR THE RISK LIMIT IS TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY

INCREASED.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DURING PERIODS IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE NET REVENUE DAYS THAN NET

REVENUE LOSS DAYS, WE EXPECT TO HAVE FEWER VAR EXCEPTIONS BECAUSE, UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY PRODUCES POSITIVE NET REVENUES. IN PERIODS IN WHICH OUR FRANCHISE REVENUES ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WE GENERALLY HAVE MORE LOSS

DAYS, RESULTING IN MORE VAR EXCEPTIONS. IN ADDITION, VAR BACKTESTING IS PERFORMED AGAINST TOTAL DAILY MARKET-MAKING REVENUES, INCLUDING BID/OFFER NET REVENUES WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE POSITIVE BY THEIR NATURE.

SENSITIVITY MEASURES

CERTAIN

PORTFOLIOS AND INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN VAR BECAUSE VAR IS NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE RISK MEASURE. THE MARKET RISK OF THESE POSITIONS IS DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES OF A 10% DECLINE IN THE

OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON UNSECURED BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS A $7 MILLION GAIN (INCLUDING HEDGES) AS OF DECEMBER 2011. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL NET IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS IS ALSO AFFECTED

BY THE LIQUIDITY, DURATION AND CONVEXITY (AS THE SENSITIVITY IS NOT LINEAR TO CHANGES IN YIELDS) OF THOSE UNSECURED BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED, AS WELL AS THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF ANY HEDGES UNDERTAKEN.

THE FIRM ENGAGES IN INSURANCE ACTIVITIES WHERE WE REINSURE AND PURCHASE PORTFOLIOS OF

INSURANCE RISK AND PENSION LIABILITIES. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: EQUITY, INTEREST RATE, REINVESTMENT AND MORTALITY RISK. THE FIRM MITIGATES RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE USE

OF REINSURANCE AND HEDGING. CERTAIN OF THE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ARE INCLUDED IN VAR. IN ADDITION TO THE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR WE HELD $4.86 BILLION OF SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AS OF

DECEMBER 2011, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH SUPPORT THE FIRMS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2011, OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF $1.81 BILLION OF CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES WITH AN AVERAGE YIELD OF 5%, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL MATURE AFTER FIVE YEARS, $1.42 BILLION OF MORTGAGE AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED LOANS AND SECURITIES WITH AN AVERAGE YIELD OF 10%, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL MATURE AFTER TEN YEARS, AND $662 MILLION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL

AGENCY OBLIGATIONS WITH AN AVERAGE YIELD OF 3%, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL MATURE AFTER TEN YEARS. AS OF DECEMBER 2010, WE HELD $3.67 BILLION OF SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF $1.69 BILLION OF CORPORATE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY OF A COUNTERPARTY (E.G., AN OTC DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY OR A BORROWER) OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR

OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK COMES MOSTLY FROM CLIENT TRANSACTIONS IN OTC DERIVATIVES AND LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. CREDIT RISK ALSO COMES FROM CASH PLACED WITH BANKS, SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS (I.E., RESALE

AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES) AND RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS, CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK

AT THE FIRM. THE CREDIT POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE ESTABLISH AND REVIEW CREDIT POLICIES AND PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD OTHER POSITIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK (E.G., BONDS HELD IN OUR INVENTORY AND SECONDARY BANK

LOANS). THESE CREDIT RISKS ARE CAPTURED AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK MEASURES, WHICH ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, CONSISTENT WITH OTHER INVENTORY POSITIONS.

POLICIES AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE CREDIT POLICY COMMITTEE PRESCRIBE THE LEVEL OF FORMAL APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR THE

FIRM TO ASSUME CREDIT EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY ACROSS ALL PRODUCT AREAS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY ENFORCEABLE NETTING PROVISIONS, COLLATERAL OR OTHER CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK REQUIRES ACCURATE

AND TIMELY INFORMATION, A HIGH LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF CUSTOMERS, COUNTRIES, INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS. OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING CREDIT RISK INCLUDES.



APPROVING TRANSACTIONS AND SETTING AND COMMUNICATING CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;



MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;



ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A COUNTERPARTY WILL DEFAULT ON ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS;



MEASURING THE FIRMS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT;



REPORTING OF CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD AND REGULATORS;



USE OF CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS, INCLUDING COLLATERAL AND HEDGING; AND



COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION WITH OTHER INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS SUCH AS OPERATIONS, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE.

AS PART OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS, CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PERFORMS CREDIT REVIEWS WHICH INCLUDE INITIAL

AND ONGOING ANALYSES OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES. A CREDIT REVIEW IS AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT ABOUT THE CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS OF A COUNTERPARTY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, THE CORE OF OUR PROCESS IS

AN ANNUAL COUNTERPARTY REVIEW. A COUNTERPARTY REVIEW IS A WRITTEN ANALYSIS OF A COUNTERPARTYS BUSINESS PROFILE AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RESULTING IN AN INTERNAL CREDIT RATING WHICH REPRESENTS THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ON FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS

TO THE FIRM. THE DETERMINATION OF INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS INCORPORATES ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COUNTERPARTYS FUTURE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, THE NATURE AND OUTLOOK FOR THE COUNTERPARTYS INDUSTRY, AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. SENIOR

PERSONNEL WITHIN CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, WITH EXPERTISE IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, INSPECT AND APPROVE CREDIT REVIEWS AND INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS.

OUR GLOBAL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CAPTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES (ECONOMIC GROUPS). THESE SYSTEMS ALSO

PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON OUR AGGREGATE CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT, INTERNAL CREDIT RATING, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND REGION.

RISK

MEASURES AND LIMITS

WE MEASURE OUR CREDIT RISK BASED ON THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN AN EVENT OF NON-PAYMENT BY A COUNTERPARTY.

FOR DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, THE PRIMARY MEASURE IS POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, WHICH IS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, THE PRIMARY MEASURE IS A FUNCTION OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE POSITION. WE ALSO MONITOR CREDIT RISK IN TERMS OF CURRENT EXPOSURE,

WHICH IS THE AMOUNT PRESENTLY OWED TO THE FIRM AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT APPLICABLE NETTING AND COLLATERAL.

GOLDMAN SACHS 2011 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WE USE CREDIT LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS (COUNTERPARTY, ECONOMIC GROUP, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY) TO

CONTROL THE SIZE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES. LIMITS FOR COUNTERPARTIES AND ECONOMIC GROUPS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND REVISED TO REFLECT CHANGING APPETITES FOR A GIVEN COUNTERPARTY OR GROUP OF COUNTERPARTIES. LIMITS FOR INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES ARE

BASED ON THE FIRMS RISK TOLERANCE AND ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR REGULAR MONITORING, REVIEW, ESCALATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS.

STRESS TESTS/SCENARIO ANALYSIS

WE

USE REGULAR STRESS TESTS TO CALCULATE THE CREDIT EXPOSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING SHOCKS TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS OR CREDIT RISK FACTORS (E.G., CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES). THESE

SHOCKS INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVEMENTS. SOME OF OUR STRESS TESTS INCLUDE SHOCKS TO MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS, CONSISTENT WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF A SEVERE MARKET OR ECONOMIC EVENT (E.G., SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULT). UNLIKE

POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, WHICH IS CALCULATED WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, WITH A STRESS TEST THERE IS GENERALLY NO ASSUMED PROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING.

WE RUN STRESS TESTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET DEVELOPMENTS. STRESS TESTS ARE REGULARLY

CONDUCTED JOINTLY WITH THE FIRMS MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK FUNCTIONS.

RISK MITIGANTS

TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY ENTER INTO NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH

COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. WE MAY ALSO REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH COUNTERPARTIES BY ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM THEM ON AN UPFRONT OR CONTINGENT BASIS

AND/OR TO TERMINATE TRANSACTIONS IF THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT RATING FALLS BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL.

FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, WE TYPICALLY EMPLOY A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL RISK

MITIGANTS, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE BORROWER AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION. RISK MITIGANTS INCLUDE: COLLATERAL PROVISIONS, GUARANTEES, COVENANTS, STRUCTURAL SENIORITY OF THE BANK LOAN CLAIMS AND, FOR CERTAIN LENDING

COMMITMENTS, PROVISIONS IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION THAT ALLOW THE FIRM TO ADJUST LOAN AMOUNTS, PRICING, STRUCTURE AND OTHER TERMS AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE TYPE AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MITIGANTS EMPLOYED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE DEGREE

OF CREDIT RISK INVOLVED IN A LOAN.

WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT VISIBILITY INTO A COUNTERPARTYS FINANCIAL STRENGTH OR

WHEN WE BELIEVE A COUNTERPARTY REQUIRES SUPPORT FROM ITS PARENT COMPANY, WE MAY OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS. WE MAY ALSO MITIGATE OUR CREDIT RISK USING CREDIT DERIVATIVES OR PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.

CREDIT EXPOSURES

THE

FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE BOTH INTEREST-BEARING AND NON-INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS. TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CREDIT LOSS, WE PLACE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DEPOSITS

WITH HIGHLY RATED BANKS AND CENTRAL BANKS.

OTC DERIVATIVES.

DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR A GIVEN COUNTERPARTY) WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN

ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT.

DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED OR POSTED UNDER

CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS. AS CREDIT RISK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM INCLUDES A CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA) IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. CVA IS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED EXPOSURE, THE PROBABILITY OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT AND THE ASSUMED RECOVERY UPON DEFAULT.

LENDING ACTIVITIES.

WE MANAGE THE FIRMS TRADITIONAL CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FUNDED LOANS, LENDING COMMITMENTS AND THE WILLIAM STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM, USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES

AND LIMITS DESCRIBED ABOVE. OTHER LENDING POSITIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY TRADING POSITIONS, ARE RISK-MANAGED AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK.

OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES.

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK FROM ITS RECEIVABLES FROM

BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF INITIAL MARGIN PLACED WITH CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SALES

OF SECURITIES WHICH HAVE TRADED, BUT NOT YET SETTLED. THESE RECEIVABLES HAVE MINIMAL CREDIT RISK DUE TO THE LOW PROBABILITY OF CLEARING ORGANIZATION DEFAULT AND THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SECURITIES SETTLEMENTS. RECEIVABLES FROM

CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF COLLATERALIZED RECEIVABLES RELATED TO CUSTOMER SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE MINIMAL CREDIT RISK DUE TO BOTH THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE

RECEIVABLES.

CREDIT EXPOSURES

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011, OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES INCREASED, REFLECTING GROWTH IN LENDING ACTIVITY AND OTC DERIVATIVES, AND INCREASED CASH BALANCES. WHILE CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED DURING THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 2011, THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ARISING FROM NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE COUNTERPARTIES (BASED ON OUR INTERNALLY DETERMINED PUBLIC RATING AGENCY EQUIVALENTS) WAS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 2010. COUNTERPARTY

DEFAULTS AND THE ASSOCIATED CREDIT LOSSES HAVE REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011 AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SELECTED COUNTRY EXPOSURES

DURING 2011 AND CONTINUING INTO 2012, THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN

DEBT RISK AND ITS IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM AND A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT CREDIT DETERIORATION. THE MOST PRONOUNCED MARKET CONCERNS RELATE TO GREECE, IRELAND, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN. THE

TABLE BELOW PRESENTS OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE (BOTH GROSS AND NET OF HEDGES) TO ALL SOVEREIGNS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CORPORATE COUNTERPARTIES OR BORROWERS IN THESE COUNTRIES. IN

ADDITION, THE TABLE INCLUDES THE MARKET EXPOSURE OF OUR LONG AND SHORT INVENTORY IN WHICH THE ISSUER OR UNDERLIER IS LOCATED IN THESE COUNTRIES.

THE COUNTRY OF RISK IS DETERMINED BY THE LOCATION OF THE COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR UNDERLIERS ASSETS, WHERE THEY GENERATE REVENUE, THE

COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE HEADQUARTERED, AND/OR THE GOVERNMENT WHOSE POLICIES AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED

INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK ARISES FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS AS WELL AS EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENTS, SUCH AS MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILURES. POTENTIAL TYPES OF LOSS EVENTS RELATED TO

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDE.



CLIENTS, PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES;



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT;



BUSINESS DISRUPTION AND SYSTEM FAILURES;



EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND WORKPLACE SAFETY;



DAMAGE TO PHYSICAL ASSETS;



INTERNAL FRAUD; AND



EXTERNAL FRAUD.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS A COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A WELL-CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL RISKS. THE FIRMWIDE OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE, ALONG WITH THE SUPPORT OF

REGIONAL OR ENTITY-SPECIFIC WORKING GROUPS OR COMMITTEES, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK POLICIES AND FRAMEWORK. OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

DEPARTMENT (OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT) IS A RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, REPORTS TO THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING

AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES, METHODOLOGIES AND A FORMALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT WITH THE GOAL OF MINIMIZING OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES TIMELY AND

ACCURATE INFORMATION AS WELL AS A STRONG CONTROL CULTURE. WE SEEK TO MANAGE OUR OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH.



THE TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE;



THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS ACROSS THE FIRM;



INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS THAT MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK ON A DAILY BASIS AND HAVE INSTITUTED EXTENSIVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

IMPLEMENTED CONTROLS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS;



PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS; AND



A NETWORK OF SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM TO FACILITATE THE COLLECTION OF DATA USED TO ANALYZE AND ASSESS OUR OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE.

WE COMBINE TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES TO MANAGE AND MEASURE OPERATIONAL RISK. FROM A TOP-DOWN

PERSPECTIVE, THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT ASSESSES FIRMWIDE AND BUSINESS LEVEL OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILES. FROM A BOTTOM-UP PERSPECTIVE, REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ON

A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING, MITIGATING, AND ESCALATING OPERATIONAL RISKS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

OUR OPERATIONAL

RISK FRAMEWORK IS IN PART DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER BASEL 2 AND HAS EVOLVED BASED ON THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE. OUR FRAMEWORK INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PRACTICES.



RISK IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING;



RISK MEASUREMENT; AND



RISK MONITORING.

INTERNAL AUDIT PERFORMS A REVIEW OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING OUR KEY CONTROLS, PROCESSES AND APPLICATIONS, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FRAMEWORK.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING

THE CORE OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS RISK IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING. WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, INCLUDING FIRMWIDE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, FOR OPERATIONAL

RISK EVENTS.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MANAGERS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND

SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO ESCALATE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WHEN OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS ARE IDENTIFIED, OUR POLICIES REQUIRE THAT THE EVENTS BE DOCUMENTED AND ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES ARE REQUIRED IN THE FIRMS SYSTEMS AND/OR PROCESSES

TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE RISK OF FUTURE EVENTS.

IN ADDITION, OUR FIRMWIDE SYSTEMS CAPTURE INTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA,

KEY METRICS SUCH AS TRANSACTION VOLUMES, AND STATISTICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS PERFORMANCE TRENDS. WE USE AN INTERNALLY-DEVELOPED OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION TO AGGREGATE AND ORGANIZE THIS INFORMATION. MANAGERS FROM BOTH REVENUE-PRODUCING

UNITS AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ANALYZE THE INFORMATION TO EVALUATE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES AND IDENTIFY BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES OR PRODUCTS WITH HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL RISK. WE ALSO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL RISK REPORTS

TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RISK COMMITTEES AND THE BOARD PERIODICALLY.

RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MEASURE THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE OVER A TWELVE-MONTH TIME HORIZON USING BOTH STATISTICAL MODELING AND SCENARIO

ANALYSES, WHICH INVOLVE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE POTENTIAL FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF POTENTIAL OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES, FOR EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT INCORPORATES QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF

FACTORS INCLUDING.



INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA;



ASSESSMENTS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROLS;



EVALUATIONS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;



THE DEGREE OF AND POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION IN THE FIRMS PROCESSES;



NEW PRODUCT INFORMATION;



THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT;



CHANGES IN THE MARKETS FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THE DIVERSITY AND SOPHISTICATION OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS AND

COUNTERPARTIES; AND



THE LIQUIDITY OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE RELIABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE RESULTS FROM THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES ARE USED TO MONITOR CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RISK

AND TO DETERMINE BUSINESS LINES THAT MAY HAVE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK. THESE ANALYSES ULTIMATELY ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL TO HOLD.

RISK MONITORING

WE EVALUATE

CHANGES IN THE OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX OR JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES, BY MONITORING THESE FACTORS AT A FIRMWIDE, ENTITY AND BUSINESS LEVEL. THE FIRM HAS BOTH DETECTIVE

AND PREVENTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES AND THE PROBABILITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WE MONITOR THE RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS AND INDEPENDENT INTERNAL AUDITS OF THESE

INTERNAL CONTROLS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.



NET LONG POSITIONS, RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED, OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL.



OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER COSTS OF

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

(THE FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL

EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT

HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN

THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON PAGE 109, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011.

MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

CONSOLIDATION

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE

ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY OR A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE).

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE TOTAL EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE

EQUITY HOLDERS HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE LOSSES OF THE ENTITY AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE ENTITY. THE USUAL

CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. IF THE FIRM HAS A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, THE ENTITY IS CONSOLIDATED.

VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES.

A VIE IS AN ENTITY THAT LACKS ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY. THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE WHEN THE FIRM HAS A VARIABLE

INTEREST OR INTERESTS THAT PROVIDE IT WITH (I) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND (II) THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. SEE NOTE 11 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT VIES.

EQUITY-METHOD

INVESTMENTS

. WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT CAN EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, THE

INVESTMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR EITHER (I) UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING OR (II) AT FAIR VALUE BY ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AVAILABLE UNDER U.S. GAAP. SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE GENERALLY EXISTS WHEN THE FIRM OWNS 20% TO 50% OF THE

ENTITYS COMMON STOCK OR IN-SUBSTANCE COMMON STOCK.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN GENERAL, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 24,

2006, WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OPTION BECAME AVAILABLE, AT FAIR VALUE. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM APPLIES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO NEW INVESTMENTS THAT ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR CLOSELY RELATED TO THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES,

WHEN THE FIRM HAS A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH FLOWS OR OPERATIONS OF THE INVESTEE OR WHEN COST-BENEFIT CONSIDERATIONS ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT. SEE NOTE 12 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENT FUNDS.

THE

FIRM HAS FORMED NUMEROUS INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THESE FUNDS ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM ACTS AS GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGER. GENERALLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT HOLD

A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THESE FUNDS. THESE FUNDS ARE USUALLY VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES AND GENERALLY ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS TYPICALLY HAVE RIGHTS TO TERMINATE THE FUNDS OR TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS GENERAL

PARTNER OR MANAGER. INVESTMENTS IN THESE FUNDS ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTES 6, 18 AND 22 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH RELATE TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL

AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX AUDITS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION BUT ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT

FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE EITHER UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER U.S. GAAP. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN OF ITS

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE BY ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO

TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS. FAIR VALUE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING FOR POSITIONS IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS FOR POSITIONS IN

INVESTING & LENDING. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

INVESTMENT BANKING.

FEES FROM

FINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS AND UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE SERVICES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION ARE COMPLETED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ASSIGNMENT. EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE DEFERRED

UNTIL THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OR THE ASSIGNMENT IS OTHERWISE CONCLUDED. EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS ARE RECORDED AS NON-COMPENSATION EXPENSES, NET OF CLIENT REIMBURSEMENTS. UNDERWRITING REVENUES ARE PRESENTED

NET OF RELATED EXPENSES.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM EARNS MANAGEMENT FEES AND INCENTIVE FEES FOR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES. MANAGEMENT FEES ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSET VALUE, INVESTED CAPITAL OR COMMITMENTS, AND ARE RECOGNIZED

OVER THE PERIOD THAT THE RELATED SERVICE IS PROVIDED. INCENTIVE FEES ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS OR SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS RETURN, OR EXCESS RETURN ABOVE A SPECIFIED BENCHMARK OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGET. INCENTIVE

FEES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD OR OVER THE LIFE OF A FUND. FEES THAT ARE BASED ON PERFORMANCE OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. FOR FEES THAT ARE

BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE LIFE OF THE FUND, FUTURE INVESTMENT UNDERPERFORMANCE MAY REQUIRE FEES PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM TO BE RETURNED TO THE FUND. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN ALL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES HAVE

BEEN RESOLVED. MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEE REVENUES ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES.

THE FIRM EARNS COMMISSIONS AND FEES FROM EXECUTING AND CLEARING CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES

MARKETS. COMMISSIONS AND FEES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE DAY THE TRADE IS EXECUTED.

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES WHEN THE FIRM HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED. FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, ANY RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUES. ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM THE FIRMS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, THE ASSETS REMAIN IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND THE TRANSFER IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A COLLATERALIZED FINANCING, WITH THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION. SEE

NOTE 9 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS AND NOTE 10 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES.

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES GENERALLY RELATE TO COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS. SUCH RECEIVABLES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF

CUSTOMER MARGIN LOANS, TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED LOANS RATHER THAN PURCHASES AND COLLATERAL POSTED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING REVENUES. SEE NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE RECEIVABLES. RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS

AND COUNTERPARTIES NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT AMORTIZED COST NET OF ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS, WHICH GENERALLY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. INTEREST ON RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE

LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION AND INCLUDED IN INTEREST INCOME.

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING REVENUES. SEE

NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS.

REVENUES FROM VARIABLE ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS NOT ACCOUNTED

FOR AT FAIR VALUE GENERALLY CONSIST OF FEES ASSESSED ON CONTRACT HOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES FOR MORTALITY CHARGES, POLICY ADMINISTRATION FEES AND SURRENDER CHARGES. THESE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS OVER THE PERIOD THAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED

AND ARE INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING REVENUES. CHANGES IN RESERVES, INCLUDING INTEREST CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES, ARE RECOGNIZED IN INSURANCE RESERVES.

PREMIUMS EARNED FOR UNDERWRITING PROPERTY CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD, NET OF PREMIUMS

CEDED FOR THE COST OF REINSURANCE, AND ARE INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING REVENUES. EXPENSES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO PROPERTY CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE CLAIMS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED, ARE

INCLUDED IN INSURANCE RESERVES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING ON THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE PERIOD. FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS IN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS OR

LOSSES ON TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A NON-U.S. OPERATION, WHEN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE INCLUDED, NET OF HEDGES AND TAXES, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE FIRM DEFINES CASH EQUIVALENTS AS HIGHLY LIQUID OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS HELD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCLUDED $7.95

BILLION AND $5.75 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, AND $48.05 BILLION AND $34.04 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH BANKS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

IMPROVING DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS (FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 820).

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-06, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES (TOPIC 820) 

IMPROVING DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ASU NO. 2010-06 PROVIDES AMENDED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. CERTAIN OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM BEGINNING IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, WHILE OTHERS BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. SINCE THESE AMENDED PRINCIPLES REQUIRE ONLY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES CONCERNING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, ADOPTION DID NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS

FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

RECONSIDERATION

OF EFFECTIVE CONTROL FOR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (ASC 860)

. IN APRIL 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-03, TRANSFERS AND SERVICING (TOPIC 860)  RECONSIDERATION OF

EFFECTIVE CONTROL FOR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. ASU NO. 2011-03 CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVE CONTROL BY REMOVING (I) THE CRITERION THAT REQUIRES THE TRANSFEROR TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPURCHASE OR REDEEM FINANCIAL ASSETS ON

SUBSTANTIALLY THE AGREED TERMS, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE TRANSFEREE, AND (II) THE COLLATERAL MAINTENANCE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE RELATED TO THAT CRITERION. ASU NO. 2011-03 IS EFFECTIVE FOR PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU NO. 2011-03 WILL NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

AMENDMENTS TO ACHIEVE COMMON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN U.S. GAAP AND IFRSS (ASC 820).

IN MAY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-04, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES (TOPIC 820)  AMENDMENTS TO ACHIEVE COMMON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN U.S.

GAAP AND IFRSS. ASU NO. 2011-04 CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF EXISTING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES CERTAIN PRINCIPLES RELATED TO MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. ASU NO. 2011-04 IS EFFECTIVE FOR PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. ADOPTION OF ASU NO. 2011-04 WILL NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT (ASC

350).

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-08, INTANGIBLES  GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350)  TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. ASU NO. 2011-08

SIMPLIFIES HOW ENTITIES TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY PERMITTING AN ENTITY TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AS A BASIS FOR

DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE QUANTITATIVE, TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. ASU NO. 2011-08 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011.

EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE FIRM ADOPTED THESE AMENDED PRINCIPLES IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU NO. 2011-08 DID NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

DERECOGNITION OF IN SUBSTANCE REAL

ESTATE (ASC 360).

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-10, PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT (TOPIC 360)  DERECOGNITION OF IN SUBSTANCE REAL ESTATE  A SCOPE

CLARIFICATION. ASU NO. 2011-10 CLARIFIES THAT IN ORDER TO DECONSOLIDATE A SUBSIDIARY (THAT IS IN SUBSTANCE REAL ESTATE) AS A RESULT OF A PARENT NO LONGER CONTROLLING THE SUBSIDIARY DUE TO A DEFAULT ON THE SUBSIDIARYS NONRECOURSE

DEBT, THE PARENT ALSO MUST SATISFY THE SALE CRITERIA IN ASC 360-20, PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT  REAL ESTATE SALES. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JUNE 15, 2012. THE FIRM WILL APPLY THE

PROVISIONS OF THE ASU TO SUCH EVENTS OCCURRING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2013. ADOPTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (ASC 210).

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-11, BALANCE SHEET (TOPIC 210)  DISCLOSURES ABOUT OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ASU NO. 2011-11 WILL REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF

THE EFFECT OR POTENTIAL EFFECT OF OFFSETTING ARRANGEMENTS ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL POSITION AS WELL AS ENHANCED DISCLOSURE OF THE RIGHTS OF SETOFF ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND RECOGNIZED LIABILITIES. ASU NO. 2011-11

IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2013, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. SINCE THESE AMENDED PRINCIPLES REQUIRE ONLY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES CONCERNING OFFSETTING AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS,

ADOPTION WILL NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS, BY MAJOR PRODUCT TYPE, THE FIRMS MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUES. THESE GAINS/(LOSSES) ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING BOTH DERIVATIVE AND NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. THESE GAINS/(LOSSES) EXCLUDE RELATED INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE. SEE NOTE 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE GAINS/(LOSSES) IN THE TABLE ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRM MANAGES ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES BECAUSE MANY OF THE FIRMS MARKET-MAKING, CLIENT FACILITATION, AND INVESTING AND

LENDING STRATEGIES UTILIZE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACROSS VARIOUS PRODUCT TYPES. ACCORDINGLY, GAINS OR LOSSES IN ONE PRODUCT TYPE FREQUENTLY OFFSET GAINS OR LOSSES IN OTHER PRODUCT TYPES. FOR EXAMPLE, MOST OF THE FIRMS LONGER-TERM DERIVATIVES

ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND MAY BE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS. SIMILARLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS CASH INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES HAS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND MAY BE ECONOMICALLY

HEDGED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

NOTE 5.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FAIR

VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS.

THE BEST EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE IS A QUOTED PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. IF LISTED PRICES OR

QUOTATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, QUOTED PRICES OR RECENT TRANSACTIONS IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS, OR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR

INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED PARAMETERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITIES PRICES, CREDIT CURVES AND FUNDING RATES.

U.S. GAAP HAS A THREE-LEVEL FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY PRIORITIZES INPUTS TO

THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, GIVING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO LEVEL 1 INPUTS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO LEVEL 3 INPUTS. A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT

IS SIGNIFICANT TO ITS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1.

INPUTS ARE

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS TO WHICH THE FIRM HAD ACCESS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2.

INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.

LEVEL 3.

ONE

OR MORE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND UNOBSERVABLE.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE FOR FACTORS SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE. SEE NOTES 6, 7 AND 8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS.

SEE NOTES 6 AND

7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CASH INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR

LEVEL 1 CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND MOST NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVELY TRADED LISTED EQUITIES AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED

USING QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL UNRESTRICTED INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME BOTH IN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND RELATIVE TO THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION FOR THE INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS BASED ON BOTH THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME AND THE

NUMBER OF DAYS WITH TRADING ACTIVITY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENT IS CALCULATED AS QUANTITY HELD MULTIPLIED BY

QUOTED MARKET PRICE. U.S. GAAP PROHIBITS VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS BEING APPLIED TO LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE FIRM HOLDS A LARGE POSITION AND A SALE COULD IMPACT THE QUOTED PRICE.

LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, MOST GOVERNMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, MOST CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED LOANS

AND SECURITIES, CERTAIN BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS, RESTRICTED OR LESS LIQUID PUBLICLY LISTED EQUITIES, MOST STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS.

VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS CAN BE VERIFIED TO QUOTED PRICES, RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS,

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES

PROVIDED FROM ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE TO LEVEL 2 CASH INSTRUMENTS (I) IF

THE CASH INSTRUMENT IS SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND/OR (II) FOR OTHER PREMIUMS AND LIQUIDITY DISCOUNTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE.

LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS

LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENTS HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT VALUATION INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, LEVEL 3

CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRM USES OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT.

VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING VALUES REALIZED ON SALES OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND THE NATURE OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS GENERALLY USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH CLASS OF LEVEL 3 CASH INSTRUMENT.

INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT CALCULATE NET ASSET

VALUE PER SHARE

CASH INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE VALUED BASED ON THE

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE (NAV) OF THE INVESTMENT FUND. THE FIRM USES NAV AS ITS MEASURE OF FAIR VALUE FOR FUND INVESTMENTS WHEN (I) THE FUND INVESTMENT DOES NOT HAVE A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE AND (II) THE NAV OF THE INVESTMENT

FUND IS CALCULATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING MEASUREMENT OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT CALCULATE NAV PRIMARILY CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN FIRM-SPONSORED FUNDS WHERE THE FIRM CO-INVESTS WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIVATE EQUITY, PRIVATE DEBT AND

REAL ESTATE FUNDS ARE PRIMARILY CLOSED-END FUNDS IN WHICH THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REDEMPTION. DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE RECEIVED FROM THESE FUNDS AS THE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE

LIQUIDATED AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OF EXISTING FUNDS WILL BE LIQUIDATED OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MANAGE ITS EXISTING PRIVATE

EQUITY FUNDS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TRANSITION PERIODS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE OF THE U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT), ALTHOUGH THE RULES HAVE NOT YET BEEN FINALIZED.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS ARE GENERALLY REDEEMABLE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WITH 91 DAYS NOTICE, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM

REDEMPTION LEVEL OF 25% OF THE FIRMS INITIAL INVESTMENTS AT ANY QUARTER-END. THE FIRM CURRENTLY PLANS TO COMPLY WITH THE VOLCKER RULE BY REDEEMING CERTAIN OF ITS INTERESTS IN HEDGE FUNDS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

NOTE 7.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVES ARE INSTRUMENTS THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSET PRICES, INDICES,

REFERENCE RATES AND OTHER INPUTS, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVES MAY BE PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY REFERRED TO AS OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE

(EXCHANGE-TRADED).

MARKET-MAKING.

AS A MARKET MAKER, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER AND HEDGING OF RISK. IN THIS CAPACITY, THE

FIRM TYPICALLY ACTS AS PRINCIPAL AND IS CONSEQUENTLY REQUIRED TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO PROVIDE EXECUTION. AS A MARKET MAKER, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN AN INVENTORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET EXPECTED CLIENT AND MARKET DEMANDS.

RISK

MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE RISK EXPOSURES THAT ARISE FROM MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES IN DERIVATIVE AND CASH INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRMS HOLDINGS AND EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, IN MANY CASES, ON EITHER A PORTFOLIO OR RISK-SPECIFIC BASIS, AS OPPOSED TO AN INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT BASIS. THE OFFSETTING IMPACT OF THIS ECONOMIC HEDGING IS REFLECTED IN THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENT

AS THE RELATED REVENUES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON THE NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS AND TO MANAGE

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN FIXED-RATE UNSECURED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING.



FUTURES AND FORWARDS.

CONTRACTS

THAT COMMIT COUNTERPARTIES TO PURCHASE OR SELL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES OR CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE.



SWAPS.

CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE

COUNTERPARTIES TO EXCHANGE CASH FLOWS SUCH AS CURRENCY OR INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED RATES, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.



OPTIONS.

CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE

OPTION PURCHASER HAS THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE FROM OR SELL TO THE OPTION WRITER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMODITIES OR CURRENCIES WITHIN A DEFINED TIME PERIOD FOR A SPECIFIED PRICE.

DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, NET OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED OR POSTED UNDER CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS. DERIVATIVES ARE

REPORTED ON A NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS (I.E., THE NET PAYABLE OR RECEIVABLE FOR DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR A GIVEN COUNTERPARTY) WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT. DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, RESPECTIVELY.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 ARE INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING AND

OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

VALUATION TECHNIQUES FOR DERIVATIVES

SEE NOTE 5 FOR AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIRMS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT POLICIES.

LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVES

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES FALL WITHIN LEVEL 1 IF THEY ARE

ACTIVELY TRADED AND ARE VALUED AT THEIR QUOTED MARKET PRICE.

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES INCLUDE EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT ACTIVELY TRADED AND OTC DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT

VALUATION INPUTS ARE CORROBORATED BY MARKET EVIDENCE.

LEVEL 2 EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MODELS THAT

CALIBRATE TO MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS OF OTC DERIVATIVES. INPUTS TO THE VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 2 OTC DERIVATIVES CAN BE VERIFIED TO MARKET-CLEARING TRANSACTIONS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF

PRICE TRANSPARENCY. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES.

WHERE MODELS ARE USED, THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF AND SPECIFIC

RISKS INHERENT IN THE INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF VOLATILITY,

PREPAYMENT RATES, LOSS SEVERITY RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT BECAUSE OUTPUTS OF MODELS CAN BE CALIBRATED TO MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS.

PRICE TRANSPARENCY OF OTC DERIVATIVES CAN GENERALLY BE CHARACTERIZED BY PRODUCT TYPE.

INTEREST RATE.

IN GENERAL, THE PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS USED TO VALUE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES ARE TRANSPARENT, EVEN FOR LONG-DATED CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND OPTIONS DENOMINATED IN THE CURRENCIES OF LEADING

INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH TRADING VOLUMES AND TIGHT BID/OFFER SPREADS. INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES THAT REFERENCE INDICES, SUCH AS AN INFLATION INDEX, OR THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE (E.G., 10-YEAR SWAP RATE VS. 2-YEAR SWAP

RATE), ARE MORE COMPLEX AND ARE THEREFORE LESS TRANSPARENT, BUT THE PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS ARE GENERALLY OBSERVABLE.

CREDIT.

PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, INCLUDING BOTH SINGLE NAMES AND BASKETS OF CREDITS, VARIES BY MARKET AND UNDERLYING REFERENCE

ENTITY OR OBLIGATION. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT REFERENCE INDICES, LARGE CORPORATES AND MAJOR SOVEREIGNS GENERALLY EXHIBIT THE MOST PRICE TRANSPARENCY. FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS WITH OTHER UNDERLIERS, PRICE TRANSPARENCY VARIES BASED ON CREDIT RATING,

THE COST OF BORROWING THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS FOR DELIVERY UPON THE DEFAULT OF THE ISSUER. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT REFERENCE LOANS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND EMERGING

MARKET DEBT INSTRUMENTS TEND TO BE LESS TRANSPARENT THAN THOSE THAT REFERENCE CORPORATE BONDS. IN ADDITION, MORE COMPLEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, GENERALLY

HAVE LESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

CURRENCY.

PRICES FOR CURRENCY DERIVATIVES BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATES OF LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH LONGER TENORS, ARE GENERALLY TRANSPARENT. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

TRANSPARENCY OF DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKET CURRENCY DERIVATIVES IS THAT EMERGING MARKETS TEND TO BE OBSERVABLE FOR CONTRACTS WITH SHORTER TENORS.

COMMODITY.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS REFERENCED TO ENERGY (E.G., OIL AND

NATURAL GAS), METALS (E.G., PRECIOUS AND BASE) AND SOFT COMMODITIES (E.G., AGRICULTURAL). PRICE TRANSPARENCY VARIES BASED ON THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY, DELIVERY LOCATION, TENOR AND PRODUCT QUALITY (E.G., DIESEL FUEL COMPARED TO UNLEADED GASOLINE). IN

GENERAL, PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR COMMODITY DERIVATIVES IS GREATER FOR CONTRACTS WITH SHORTER TENORS AND CONTRACTS THAT ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH MAJOR AND/OR BENCHMARK COMMODITY INDICES.

132

GOLDMAN SACHS 2011 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

EQUITY.

PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR EQUITY DERIVATIVES VARIES BY MARKET AND UNDERLIER. OPTIONS ON INDICES AND THE COMMON STOCK OF CORPORATES INCLUDED IN MAJOR EQUITY INDICES EXHIBIT THE MOST PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OTC EQUITY DERIVATIVES GENERALLY HAVE OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES, EXCEPT FOR CONTRACTS WITH LONG TENORS OR REFERENCE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES. MORE COMPLEX EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS THOSE

SENSITIVE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, GENERALLY HAVE LESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

LIQUIDITY IS

ESSENTIAL TO OBSERVABILITY OF ALL PRODUCT TYPES. IF TRANSACTION VOLUMES DECLINE, PREVIOUSLY TRANSPARENT PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS MAY BECOME UNOBSERVABLE. CONVERSELY, EVEN HIGHLY STRUCTURED PRODUCTS MAY AT TIMES HAVE TRADING VOLUMES LARGE ENOUGH TO

PROVIDE OBSERVABILITY OF PRICES AND OTHER INPUTS.

LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES

LEVEL 3 OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MODELS WHICH UTILIZE OBSERVABLE LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS, AS WELL AS UNOBSERVABLE LEVEL 3 INPUTS.



FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE

CORRELATIONS OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (E.G., THE CORRELATION OF JAPANESE YEN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES TO U.S. DOLLAR INTEREST RATES).



FOR CREDIT DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3, SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUTS INCLUDE LONG-DATED CREDIT AND FUNDING SPREADS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN

CORRELATION INPUTS REQUIRED TO VALUE CREDIT AND MORTGAGE DERIVATIVES (E.G., THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER).



FOR LEVEL 3 EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUTS GENERALLY INCLUDE EQUITY VOLATILITY INPUTS FOR OPTIONS THAT ARE VERY LONG-DATED AND/OR

HAVE STRIKE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICES. IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED TRADES REQUIRES THE USE OF LEVEL 3 INPUTS FOR THE CORRELATION OF THE PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS.



FOR LEVEL 3 COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUTS INCLUDE VOLATILITIES FOR OPTIONS WITH STRIKE PRICES THAT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

CURRENT MARKET PRICES AND PRICES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE PRODUCT QUALITY IS NOT ALIGNED WITH BENCHMARK INDICES.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL VALUATION OF A LEVEL 3 OTC DERIVATIVE, THE FIRM UPDATES THE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 INPUTS TO REFLECT OBSERVABLE MARKET CHANGES AND ANY RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN

LEVEL 3. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE

MODEL VALUE BY REFERENCE TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO DETERMINING THE FAIR

VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND ARE USED TO ADJUST THE MID-MARKET VALUATIONS, PRODUCED BY DERIVATIVE PRICING MODELS, TO THE APPROPRIATE EXIT PRICE VALUATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCORPORATE BID/OFFER SPREADS, THE COST OF LIQUIDITY ON ILLIQUID POSITIONS,

CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (CVA) AND FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE CREDIT AND FUNDING RISK INHERENT IN DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIOS. MARKET-BASED INPUTS ARE GENERALLY USED WHEN CALIBRATING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS.

IN ADDITION, FOR DERIVATIVES THAT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THE FIRM MAKES MODEL OR EXIT PRICE

ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VALUATION UNCERTAINTY PRESENT IN THE TRANSACTION.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO A BROAD ARRAY OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS AND TO MANAGE THE

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED BASED ON THE FIRMS NET RISK POSITION.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS AND CAN HAVE VARIOUS SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT CONVENTIONS. CREDIT EVENTS INCLUDE FAILURE TO PAY, BANKRUPTCY, ACCELERATION OF INDEBTEDNESS,

RESTRUCTURING, REPUDIATION AND DISSOLUTION OF THE REFERENCE ENTITY.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS PROTECT THE BUYER AGAINST THE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL ON ONE OR MORE BONDS, LOANS OR MORTGAGES (REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS) IN THE EVENT THE ISSUER (REFERENCE ENTITY) OF THE

REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS SUFFERS A CREDIT EVENT. THE BUYER OF PROTECTION PAYS AN INITIAL OR PERIODIC PREMIUM TO THE SELLER AND RECEIVES PROTECTION FOR THE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. IF THERE IS NO CREDIT EVENT, AS DEFINED IN THE CONTRACT, THE SELLER OF

PROTECTION MAKES NO PAYMENTS TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION. HOWEVER, IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS, THE SELLER OF PROTECTION IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION, WHICH IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT.

CREDIT INDICES, BASKETS AND TRANCHES.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE A BASKET OF SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS OR A BROAD-BASED INDEX. IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS IN ONE OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, THE PROTECTION SELLER PAYS

THE PROTECTION BUYER. THE PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY A PRO-RATA PORTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT BASED ON THE UNDERLYING DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION. IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, THE CREDIT RISK OF A BASKET OR INDEX IS SEPARATED INTO

VARIOUS PORTIONS (TRANCHES), EACH HAVING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. THE MOST JUNIOR TRANCHES COVER INITIAL DEFAULTS AND ONCE LOSSES EXCEED THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE JUNIOR TRANCHES, ANY EXCESS LOSS IS COVERED BY THE NEXT MOST SENIOR

TRANCHE IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

TOTAL RETURN SWAPS.

A TOTAL RETURN SWAP TRANSFERS THE RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF A REFERENCE OBLIGATION FROM THE PROTECTION BUYER TO THE PROTECTION SELLER. TYPICALLY, THE PROTECTION BUYER RECEIVES FROM THE

PROTECTION SELLER A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST AND PROTECTION AGAINST ANY REDUCTION IN FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, AND IN RETURN THE PROTECTION SELLER RECEIVES THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, PLUS ANY INCREASE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.

CREDIT OPTIONS.

IN A CREDIT OPTION, THE OPTION WRITER ASSUMES THE OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OR SELL A REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT A SPECIFIED PRICE OR CREDIT SPREAD. THE OPTION PURCHASER BUYS THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION,

TO SELL THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION TO, OR PURCHASE IT FROM, THE OPTION WRITER. THE PAYMENTS ON CREDIT OPTIONS DEPEND EITHER ON A PARTICULAR CREDIT SPREAD OR THE PRICE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.

THE FIRM ECONOMICALLY HEDGES ITS EXPOSURE TO WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVES PRIMARILY BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES

WITH IDENTICAL UNDERLYINGS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO STRINGENT COLLATERAL THRESHOLDS. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A SPECIFIED TRIGGER

EVENT, THE FIRM MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS UNDERLYING A PARTICULAR WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVE, AND CONSEQUENTLY MAY, UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, RECOVER AMOUNTS ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE

EVENT OF DEFAULT.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011, WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES HAD TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF $1.96 TRILLION AND $2.08 TRILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TOTAL NET NOTIONAL PURCHASED PROTECTION OF $116.93 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 2010, WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES HAD TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

$2.05 TRILLION AND $2.19 TRILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TOTAL NET NOTIONAL PURCHASED PROTECTION OF $140.63 BILLION.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HEDGE ACCOUNTING

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR (I) CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS USED TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE UNSECURED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN

FIXED-RATE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND (II) CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT USED TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ON THE FIRMS NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.

TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE DERIVATIVE HEDGE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK FROM THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MUST FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AT INCEPTION AND TEST THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THE DERIVATIVE HEDGE CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE OVER THE LIFE OF THE HEDGING

RELATIONSHIP.

INTEREST RATE HEDGES

THE FIRM DESIGNATES CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS HEDGE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE (E.G., LONDON INTERBANK

OFFERED RATE (LIBOR)), EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS INTO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM APPLIES THE LONG-HAUL METHOD IN ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS IN ACHIEVING

OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE RISK BEING HEDGED (I.E., INTEREST RATE RISK).

DURING

THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2010, THE FIRM CHANGED ITS METHOD OF PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OF ITS FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS FROM A DOLLAR-OFFSET METHOD, WHICH IS A NON-STATISTICAL METHOD, TO

REGRESSION ANALYSIS, WHICH IS A STATISTICAL METHOD.

AN INTEREST RATE SWAP IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE HEDGED RISK WHEN THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS RESULTS IN A COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION OF 80% OR GREATER AND A SLOPE BETWEEN 80% AND 125%.

THE DOLLAR-OFFSET METHOD COMPARED THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT TO

THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME. THE PROSPECTIVE DOLLAR-OFFSET ASSESSMENT USED SCENARIO ANALYSES TO TEST HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH SIMULATIONS OF NUMEROUS PARALLEL AND SLOPE SHIFTS OF

THE RELEVANT YIELD CURVE. PARALLEL SHIFTS CHANGED THE INTEREST RATE OF ALL MATURITIES BY IDENTICAL AMOUNTS. SLOPE SHIFTS CHANGED THE CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE. FOR BOTH THE PROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, IN RESPONSE TO EACH OF THE SIMULATED YIELD CURVE

SHIFTS, AND THE RETROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP WAS CONSIDERED EFFECTIVE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM CHANGED INVERSELY WITHIN A RANGE OF 80% TO 125%.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE

CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED IS REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER ITS REMAINING LIFE. GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. WHEN A DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, ANY REMAINING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND PAR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM IS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING LIFE OF THE HEDGED ITEM USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. SEE NOTE 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2011, DECEMBER 2010 AND DECEMBER 2009, THE GAIN/(LOSS) RECOGNIZED ON INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES WAS $4.68 BILLION,

$1.62 BILLION AND $(10.07) BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE RELATED GAIN/(LOSS) RECOGNIZED ON THE HEDGED BORROWINGS AND BANK DEPOSITS WAS $(6.30) BILLION, $(3.45) BILLION AND $9.95 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS RECOGNIZED ON THESE DERIVATIVES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010 WAS A LOSS OF $1.62 BILLION AND $1.84 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2009. THESE LOSSES

CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE AMORTIZATION OF PREPAID CREDIT SPREADS. THE GAIN/(LOSS) EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, AND WAS A LOSS OF

$1.23 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2009.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE FIRM SEEKS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON ITS NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE OVERALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS (I.E., BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD RATES). FOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE IS ASSESSED BASED ON CHANGES IN SPOT RATES.

FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT, INCLUDED IN UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AS HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.

NOTE 8.

FAIR VALUE OPTION

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE

IN ADDITION TO ALL CASH AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE TO.



REFLECT ECONOMIC EVENTS IN EARNINGS ON A TIMELY BASIS;



MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS FROM USING DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES (E.G., TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED ACCOUNTED FOR AS

FINANCINGS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WHEREAS THE RELATED SECURED FINANCING WOULD BE RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS ABSENT ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION); AND



ADDRESS SIMPLIFICATION AND COST-BENEFIT CONSIDERATIONS (E.G., ACCOUNTING FOR HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN THEIR ENTIRETY VERSUS

BIFURCATION OF EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DEBT HOSTS).

HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN BIFURCATABLE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND DO NOT REQUIRE SETTLEMENT BY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS (E.G., PHYSICAL COMMODITIES). IF THE FIRM ELECTS TO BIFURCATE THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE FROM THE ASSOCIATED DEBT, THE

DERIVATIVE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THE HOST CONTRACT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT AMORTIZED COST, ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY FAIR VALUE HEDGES. IF THE FIRM DOES NOT ELECT TO BIFURCATE, THE ENTIRE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AT

FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION INCLUDE.

THESE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE ARE GENERALLY VALUED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

TECHNIQUES, WHICH INCORPORATE INPUTS WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY, AND ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 BECAUSE THE INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE FOR LIQUIDITY AND FOR COUNTERPARTY AND THE FIRMS

CREDIT QUALITY.

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS FOR EACH CATEGORY OF OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE ARE AS

FOLLOWS.

RESALE AND

THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED ARE THE AMOUNT AND

TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INTEREST RATES AND COLLATERAL FUNDING SPREADS. SEE NOTE 9 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS.

THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS AT FAIR VALUE ARE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INTEREST RATES, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DELIVERED BY

THE FIRM (WHICH IS DETERMINED USING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, MARKET YIELDS AND RECOVERY ASSUMPTIONS), THE FREQUENCY OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL CALLS AND THE CREDIT SPREADS OF THE FIRM. SEE NOTE 9 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS.

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE ARE INCLUDED IN RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. THE INSURANCE AND

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE CONTRACTS THAT CAN BE SETTLED ONLY IN CASH AND THAT QUALIFY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OPTION BECAUSE THEY ARE RECOGNIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THESE CONTRACTS ARE VALUED USING

MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET EVIDENCE WHERE POSSIBLE, INCLUDING MARKET-BASED INPUTS TO MODELS, CALIBRATION TO MARKET-CLEARING TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 2

INPUTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION RISK. SIGNIFICANT LEVEL 3 INPUTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE MORTALITY OR FUNDING BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS. WHEN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO A VALUATION MODEL ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF AN

INSTRUMENT, THE INSTRUMENT IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3.

NOTE 9.

COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND FINANCINGS

COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS ARE SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL (RESALE

AGREEMENTS OR REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS) AND SECURITIES BORROWED. COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS ARE SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS), SECURITIES LOANED AND OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS. THE FIRM ENTERS INTO THESE

TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATE CLIENT ACTIVITIES, INVEST EXCESS CASH, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND FINANCE CERTAIN FIRM ACTIVITIES.

COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND FINANCINGS ARE PRESENTED ON A

NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY BASIS WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS. INTEREST ON COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION AND INCLUDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST

EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE.

AT FAIR VALUE, RESPECTIVELY.

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

A RESALE AGREEMENT IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM PURCHASES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM A SELLER, TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO RESELL THE SAME OR

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO THE SELLER AT A STATED PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST AT A FUTURE DATE.

A

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM SELLS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO A BUYER, TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM

THE BUYER AT A STATED PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST AT A FUTURE DATE.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED OR SOLD IN RESALE AND

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY, AND INVESTMENT-GRADE SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS.

THE

FIRM RECEIVES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, MAKES DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON A DAILY BASIS, AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR RESALE AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM TYPICALLY REQUIRES DELIVERY OF COLLATERAL WITH A FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

RELEVANT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

EVEN THOUGH REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS INVOLVE THE LEGAL

TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO BE REPURCHASED OR RESOLD AT THE MATURITY OF THE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, REPOS TO MATURITY ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES. A REPO TO MATURITY IS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE FIRM TRANSFERS A SECURITY UNDER AN AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE THE SECURITY WHERE THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT MATCHES THE MATURITY DATE OF THE UNDERLYING

SECURITY. THEREFORE, THE FIRM EFFECTIVELY NO LONGER HAS A REPURCHASE OBLIGATION AND HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE UNDERLYING SECURITY AND, ACCORDINGLY, ACCOUNTS FOR THE TRANSACTION AS A SALE. THE FIRM HAD NO REPOS TO MATURITY OUTSTANDING AS OF

DECEMBER 2011 OR DECEMBER 2010.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED TRANSACTIONS

IN A SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTION, THE FIRM BORROWS SECURITIES FROM A COUNTERPARTY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH. WHEN THE FIRM RETURNS THE

SECURITIES, THE COUNTERPARTY RETURNS THE CASH. INTEREST IS GENERALLY PAID PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION.

IN A

SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTION, THE FIRM LENDS SECURITIES TO A COUNTERPARTY TYPICALLY IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH OR SECURITIES, OR A LETTER OF CREDIT. WHEN THE COUNTERPARTY RETURNS THE SECURITIES, THE FIRM RETURNS THE CASH OR SECURITIES POSTED AS

COLLATERAL. INTEREST IS GENERALLY PAID PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE FIRM RECEIVES SECURITIES BORROWED,

MAKES DELIVERY OF SECURITIES LOANED, MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES ON A DAILY BASIS, AND DELIVERS OR OBTAINS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR SECURITIES BORROWED

TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM TYPICALLY REQUIRES DELIVERY OF COLLATERAL WITH A FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTION.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND

COMMODITIES CLIENT EXECUTION ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED WITHIN

SECURITIES SERVICES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. AS THESE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY CAN BE TERMINATED ON DEMAND, THEY EXHIBIT LITTLE, IF ANY, SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, THE FIRM HAD $20.22 BILLION AND $12.86 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES

RECEIVED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE SEGREGATED TO SATISFY CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES.

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS

IN ADDITION TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM FUNDS CERTAIN ASSETS THROUGH THE USE OF OTHER SECURED

FINANCINGS AND PLEDGES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS AS COLLATERAL IN THESE TRANSACTIONS. THESE OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS CONSIST OF.



LIABILITIES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES;



TRANSFERS OF ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCINGS RATHER THAN SALES (PRIMARILY COLLATERALIZED CENTRAL BANK FINANCINGS, PLEDGED COMMODITIES, BANK LOANS

AND MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS);



OTHER STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS; AND



DEBT RAISED THROUGH THE FIRMS WILLIAM STREET CREDIT EXTENSION PROGRAM OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 2010.

OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS INCLUDE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE NONRECOURSE. AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, NONRECOURSE OTHER SECURED

FINANCINGS WERE $3.14 BILLION AND $8.42 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO THE

FOLLOWING OTHER SECURED FINANCINGS BECAUSE THE USE OF FAIR VALUE ELIMINATES NON-ECONOMIC VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS THAT WOULD ARISE FROM USING DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES.

NOTE 10.

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM

SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CORPORATE BONDS, LOANS AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS BY SELLING THESE ASSETS TO SECURITIZATION VEHICLES (E.G., TRUSTS, CORPORATE ENTITIES, AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES) AND ACTS AS

UNDERWRITER OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INVESTORS. THE FIRMS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IN CONNECTION WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIZATIONS.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION ENTITIES ARE DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES THAT GIVE THE INVESTORS RIGHTS TO RECEIVE ALL OR

PORTIONS OF SPECIFIED CASH INFLOWS TO A SECURITIZATION VEHICLE AND INCLUDE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED SHARES OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND/OR OTHER CASH INFLOWS. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE USED TO PAY THE TRANSFEROR FOR THE

FINANCIAL ASSETS SOLD TO THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLE OR TO PURCHASE SECURITIES WHICH SERVE AS COLLATERAL.

THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR

A SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN IT HAS RELINQUISHED CONTROL OVER THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. PRIOR TO SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ASSETS PENDING TRANSFER AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE DOES NOT TYPICALLY RECOGNIZE SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES UPON

THE TRANSFER OF ASSETS. NET REVENUES FROM UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF THE UNDERLYING BENEFICIAL INTERESTS TO INVESTORS.

FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES, THE ASSETS REMAIN IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, AT FAIR VALUE AND THE TRANSFER IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A COLLATERALIZED FINANCING,

WITH THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION. SEE NOTES 9 AND 23 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM GENERALLY RECEIVES CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BUT MAY ALSO HAVE CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH

TRANSFERRED ASSETS, INCLUDING OWNERSHIP OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS, PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED SECURITIES, AND SERVICING RIGHTS THAT THE FIRM RETAINS AT THE TIME OF SECURITIZATION. THE FIRM MAY ALSO

PURCHASE SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED SECURITIES ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION VEHICLES (WHICH ARE TYPICALLY VIES) IN CONNECTION WITH SECONDARY MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES.

DUE TO THE NATURE AND CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS FOR CONSTANT PREPAYMENT AND DISCOUNT RATES

AND THE RELATED SENSITIVITY TO ADVERSE CHANGES ARE NOT MEANINGFUL AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010. THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THESE INTERESTS IS THE CARRYING VALUE OF $32 MILLION AND $62 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

2.

CONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATE IS INCLUDED ONLY FOR POSITIONS FOR WHICH CONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATE IS A KEY ASSUMPTION IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE.

3.

THE MAJORITY OF MORTGAGE-BACKED RETAINED INTERESTS ARE U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY-ISSUED COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, FOR WHICH THERE IS NO ANTICIPATED

CREDIT LOSS. FOR THE REMAINDER OF RETAINED INTERESTS, THE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS ASSUMPTIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE DISCOUNT RATE.

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO THE OFFSETTING BENEFIT OF OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE HELD TO MITIGATE RISKS INHERENT IN THESE RETAINED INTERESTS. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON AN ADVERSE VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE

IN FAIR VALUE IS

NOT USUALLY LINEAR. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS CALCULATED INDEPENDENTLY OF CHANGES IN ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN PRACTICE, SIMULTANEOUS

CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES DISCLOSED ABOVE.

NOTE 11.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

VIES GENERALLY FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF ASSETS BY ISSUING DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES THAT

ARE EITHER COLLATERALIZED BY OR INDEXED TO THE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE. THE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ISSUED BY A VIE MAY INCLUDE TRANCHES OF VARYING LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES INCLUDES SECURITIZATION OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10, AND INVESTMENTS IN AND LOANS TO OTHER TYPES OF VIES, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. SEE NOTE 10 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. SEE NOTE 3

FOR THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATION POLICIES, INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF A VIE.

THE FIRM IS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED WITH VIES

THROUGH THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

MORTGAGE-BACKED VIES AND

CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES.

THE FIRM SELLS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES TO MORTGAGE-BACKED VIES AND CORPORATE BONDS AND LOANS TO CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES AND

MAY RETAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS SOLD TO THESE VIES. THE FIRM PURCHASES AND SELLS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY MORTGAGE-BACKED AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES IN CONNECTION WITH MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ENTER

INTO DERIVATIVES WITH CERTAIN OF THESE VIES, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS. THE FIRM GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK FROM DERIVATIVES WITH THESE VIES.

CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND CORPORATE CDO AND CLO VIES, USUALLY REFERRED TO AS SYNTHETIC CDOS OR CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VIES,

SYNTHETICALLY CREATE THE EXPOSURE FOR THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THEY ISSUE BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVES, RATHER THAN PURCHASING THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE A SINGLE ASSET, AN INDEX, OR A PORTFOLIO/BASKET OF

ASSETS OR INDICES. SEE NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES. THESE VIES USE THE FUNDS FROM THE SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND THE PREMIUMS RECEIVED FROM CREDIT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES TO PURCHASE SECURITIES WHICH SERVE TO

COLLATERALIZE THE BENEFICIAL INTEREST HOLDERS AND/OR THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THESE VIES MAY ENTER INTO OTHER DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS. THE FIRM MAY BE A COUNTERPARTY TO

DERIVATIVES WITH THESE VIES AND GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK.

REAL ESTATE, CREDIT-RELATED AND OTHER

INVESTING VIES.

THE FIRM PURCHASES EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY AND MAKES LOANS TO VIES THAT HOLD REAL ESTATE, PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, DISTRESSED LOANS AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES.

THE FIRM STRUCTURES VIES THAT ISSUE NOTES TO CLIENTS AND PURCHASES AND SELLS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES IN CONNECTION WITH MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY

ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES WITH CERTAIN OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES, PRIMARILY TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ON THE COLLATERAL ASSETS HELD BY THESE VIES UNDER WHICH THE FIRM PAYS THE VIE THE RETURN DUE TO THE NOTE HOLDERS AND RECEIVES THE RETURN ON THE COLLATERAL

ASSETS OWNED BY THE VIE. THE FIRM GENERALLY CAN BE REMOVED AS THE TOTAL RETURN SWAP COUNTERPARTY. THE FIRM GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE ITS RISK FROM DERIVATIVES WITH THESE VIES. THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT

SELL ASSETS TO THE OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES IT STRUCTURES.

VIE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

A VARIABLE INTEREST IN A VIE IS AN INVESTMENT (E.G., DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES) OR OTHER INTEREST (E.G., DERIVATIVES OR LOANS AND LENDING

COMMITMENTS) IN A VIE THAT WILL ABSORB PORTIONS OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES OR RECEIVE PORTIONS OF THE VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS.

THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES INCLUDE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, CDOS AND CLOS; LOANS AND

LENDING COMMITMENTS; LIMITED AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY; DERIVATIVES THAT MAY INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY AND/OR CREDIT RISK; GUARANTEES; AND CERTAIN OF THE FEES THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS.

CERTAIN INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES THE FIRM ENTERS INTO WITH VIES ARE NOT VARIABLE INTERESTS BECAUSE THEY CREATE RATHER THAN ABSORB RISK.

THE ENTERPRISE WITH A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE IS

KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE BY PERFORMING AN ANALYSIS THAT PRINCIPALLY CONSIDERS.



WHICH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE;



WHICH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE;



THE VIES PURPOSE AND DESIGN, INCLUDING THE RISKS THE VIE WAS DESIGNED TO CREATE AND PASS THROUGH TO ITS VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS;



THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE;



THE TERMS BETWEEN THE VIE AND ITS VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS AND OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED WITH THE VIE; AND



RELATED-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS.

THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS INITIAL EVALUATION OF WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A VIE WHEN CERTAIN

RECONSIDERATION EVENTS OCCUR. THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE ON AN ONGOING BASIS BASED ON CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

NONCONSOLIDATED VIES

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF VIES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE FIRM PROVIDES GUARANTEES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES, TO VIES OR

HOLDERS OF VARIABLE INTERESTS IN VIES.

THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT NONCONSOLIDATED VIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HOLDS

VARIABLE INTERESTS. NONCONSOLIDATED VIES ARE AGGREGATED BASED ON PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS CAN TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS, AS DESCRIBED IN THE ROWS UNDER MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS. IN THE TABLES BELOW.



THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS EXCLUDES THE BENEFIT OF OFFSETTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE HELD TO MITIGATE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

VARIABLE INTERESTS.



FOR RETAINED AND PURCHASED INTERESTS AND LOANS AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INTERESTS.



FOR COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, AND DERIVATIVES, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT ANTICIPATED LOSSES

AND ALSO HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED BY UNREALIZED LOSSES ALREADY RECORDED. AS A RESULT, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS EXCEEDS LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, AND DERIVATIVES PROVIDED TO VIES.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE FIRMS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED VIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AS FOLLOWS.



SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM RELATED TO MORTGAGE-BACKED, CORPORATE CDO AND CLO AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED VIES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS ARE

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDED $6.48 BILLION AND $6.44 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010,

RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT THAT THE FIRM USES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS OPERATIONS. THE REMAINDER IS HELD BY INVESTMENT ENTITIES, INCLUDING VIES, CONSOLIDATED BY THE FIRM.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET.

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT OR THE TERM OF THE LEASE, WHICHEVER

IS SHORTER.

CERTAIN COSTS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE.

PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. THE FIRMS POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT IS THE SAME AS IS USED

FOR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES. SEE NOTE 13 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

IMPAIRMENTS

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE FIRM CLASSIFIED CERTAIN ASSETS AS HELD FOR SALE, PRIMARILY RELATED TO LITTON LOAN SERVICING LP (LITTON) AND RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY

$220 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY IN THE FIRMS INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT. THESE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, REPRESENT THE EXCESS OF (I) THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS

OVER (II) THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS ESTIMATED COST TO SELL. THESE ASSETS WERE SOLD IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. THE FIRM RECEIVED TOTAL CONSIDERATION THAT APPROXIMATED THE FIRMS ADJUSTED CARRYING VALUE FOR LITTON. SEE NOTE 18 FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE SALE OF LITTON.

AS A RESULT OF A DECLINE IN THE MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH CERTAIN OF THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS OPERATE, DURING 2011 THE FIRM TESTED CERTAIN COMMODITY-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360. THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS EXCEEDED THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS; AS SUCH, THE FIRM DETERMINED THE ASSETS WERE IMPAIRED AND RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $220

MILLION ($120 MILLION RELATED TO COMMODITY-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND $100 MILLION RELATED TO PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT), WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN THE FIRMS

INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT. THIS IMPAIRMENT LOSS REPRESENTED THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENT, USING A COMBINATION OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND

RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED FROM THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN OF THESE ASSETS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING WEAK OPERATING RESULTS IN THE

FIRMS NYSE DMM BUSINESS, THE FIRM TESTED ITS NYSE DMM RIGHTS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360. BECAUSE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FIRMS NYSE DMM RIGHTS EXCEEDED THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING

USEFUL LIFE OF THE FIRMS NYSE DMM RIGHTS, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THE RIGHTS WERE IMPAIRED. THE FIRM RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $305 MILLION, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN THE FIRMS INSTITUTIONAL

CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. THIS IMPAIRMENT LOSS REPRESENTED THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FIRMS NYSE DMM RIGHTS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ESTIMATED THIS FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3

MEASUREMENT, USING A RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSIS WHICH INCORPORATED A COMPARISON TO ANOTHER DMM PORTFOLIO THAT WAS TRANSACTED BETWEEN THIRD PARTIES.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE SALE OF LITTON.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL IS ASSESSED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT MAY

EXIST. QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE ASSESSED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED. SEE NOTE 3 FOR INFORMATION ABOUT AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING.

THE QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS.



THE FIRST STEP COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS). IF THE REPORTING UNITS FAIR VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED.



IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS

PERFORMED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

GOODWILL WAS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT, USING A QUANTITATIVE TEST, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011 AND GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED.

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT, BOTH RELATIVE VALUE AND RESIDUAL INCOME VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE USED BECAUSE THE FIRM BELIEVES MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE THESE TECHNIQUES TO VALUE

THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS.

RELATIVE VALUE TECHNIQUES APPLY AVERAGE OBSERVABLE PRICE-TO-EARNINGS MULTIPLES OF COMPARABLE

COMPETITORS TO CERTAIN REPORTING UNITS NET EARNINGS. FOR OTHER REPORTING UNITS, FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING PRICE-TO-BOOK MULTIPLES BASED ON RESIDUAL INCOME TECHNIQUES, WHICH CONSIDER A REPORTING UNITS RETURN ON EQUITY IN EXCESS OF THE

FIRMS COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR RECOVERABILITY WHENEVER EVENTS

OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

IF A RECOVERABILITY TEST IS NECESSARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS

COMPARED TO THE TOTAL OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE AND FROM THE DISPOSITION OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP.



IF THE TOTAL OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE, THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS NOT IMPAIRED.



IF THE TOTAL OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS NOT FULLY RECOVERABLE AND AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO APEX

TRUSTS.

HELD BY THE APEX TRUSTS.

THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFER PAYMENTS ON THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT AND THE STOCK PURCHASE

CONTRACTS, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, AND THEREFORE CAUSE PAYMENT ON THE APEX TO BE DEFERRED. DURING ANY SUCH EXTENSION PERIOD, THE FIRM WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR MAKE CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON OR

PREFERRED STOCK.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE APEX ISSUANCE, THE FIRM COVENANTED IN FAVOR OF CERTAIN OF ITS DEBTHOLDERS, WHO WERE

INITIALLY AND ARE CURRENTLY THE HOLDERS OF GROUP INC.S 6.345% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2034, THAT, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, THE FIRM WOULD NOT REDEEM OR PURCHASE (I) GROUP INC.S JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES.

THERE ARE MULTIPLE AREAS OF FOCUS BY REGULATORS,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

THE

FIRM HAS NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ORIGINATOR OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. THE FIRM DID PURCHASE LOANS ORIGINATED BY OTHERS AND GENERALLY RECEIVED LOAN-LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED BELOW FROM THE ORIGINATORS. DURING THE PERIOD 2005

THROUGH 2008, THE FIRM SOLD APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION OF LOANS TO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES AND APPROXIMATELY $11 BILLION OF LOANS TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED LOANS TO TRUSTS AND OTHER MORTGAGE

SECURITIZATION VEHICLES. AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES DURING THE PERIOD 2005 THROUGH 2008 WAS APPROXIMATELY $42 BILLION AND

$49 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT REFLECTS PAYDOWNS AND CUMULATIVE LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $83 BILLION ($17 BILLION OF WHICH ARE CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND APPROXIMATELY $76 BILLION ($14 BILLION OF WHICH ARE

CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2010. A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE GOLDMAN SACHS-ISSUED SECURITIZATIONS WITH AN OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF $635 MILLION AND TOTAL PAYDOWNS AND CUMULATIVE LOSSES OF $1.42 BILLION ($465 MILLION OF WHICH ARE

CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2011, AND AN OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF $739 MILLION AND TOTAL PAYDOWNS AND CUMULATIVE LOSSES OF $1.32 BILLION ($410 MILLION OF WHICH ARE CUMULATIVE LOSSES) AS OF DECEMBER 2010, WERE STRUCTURED WITH

CREDIT PROTECTION OBTAINED FROM MONOLINE INSURERS. IN CONNECTION WITH BOTH SALES OF LOANS AND SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM PROVIDED LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED BELOW AND/OR ASSIGNED THE LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE PARTY

FROM WHOM THE FIRM PURCHASED THE LOANS.

THE LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF

MORTGAGE LOANS VARIED AMONG TRANSACTIONS BUT WERE GENERALLY DETAILED REPRESENTATIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH LOAN IN THE PORTFOLIO AND ADDRESSED MATTERS RELATING TO THE PROPERTY, THE BORROWER AND THE NOTE. THESE REPRESENTATIONS GENERALLY INCLUDED, BUT

WERE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: (I) CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE BORROWERS FINANCIAL STATUS; (II) LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, OWNER OCCUPANCY STATUS AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPERTY; (III) THE LIEN POSITION;

(IV) THE FACT THAT THE LOAN WAS ORIGINATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; AND (V) COMPLETENESS OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTATION.

TO DATE, REPURCHASE CLAIMS AND ACTUAL REPURCHASES OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BASED UPON ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS HAVE NOT

BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND HAVE MAINLY INVOLVED GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2011, THE FIRM REPURCHASED LOANS WITH AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF LESS THAN $10 MILLION. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2010, THE FIRM

REPURCHASED LOANS WITH AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF LESS THAN $50 MILLION. THE LOSS RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF THESE LOANS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010.

ULTIMATELY, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS FOR REPURCHASE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BASED ON ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS

WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: (I) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CLAIMS ARE ACTUALLY MADE; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE ARE UNDERLYING BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO VALID CLAIMS FOR REPURCHASE;

(III) IN THE CASE OF LOANS ORIGINATED BY OTHERS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FIRM COULD BE HELD LIABLE AND, IF IT IS, THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PURSUE AND COLLECT ON ANY CLAIMS AGAINST THE PARTIES WHO MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE FIRM;

(IV) MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET; AND (V) LEGAL AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.

BASED UPON THE LARGE NUMBER OF DEFAULTS IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, INCLUDING THOSE SOLD OR SECURITIZED BY THE FIRM, THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR INCREASING CLAIMS FOR REPURCHASES. HOWEVER, THE FIRM IS NOT IN A

POSITION TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THAT EXPOSURE AT THIS TIME.

FORECLOSURE AND OTHER MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES.

THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED A NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM REGULATORS AND OTHER AGENCIES, INCLUDING STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND BANKING REGULATORS, AS PART OF AN INDUSTRY-WIDE FOCUS ON THE PRACTICES

OF LENDERS AND SERVICERS IN CONNECTION WITH FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES. THE REQUESTS SOUGHT INFORMATION ABOUT THE FORECLOSURE AND SERVICING PROTOCOLS AND ACTIVITIES OF LITTON, A

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING SUBSIDIARY SOLD BY THE FIRM TO A THIRD-PARTY PURCHASER IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. THE FIRM IS COOPERATING WITH THE REQUESTS AND THESE INQUIRIES MAY RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF FINES OR OTHER REGULATORY ACTION. IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, PRIOR TO THE FIRMS SALE OF LITTON, LITTON HAD TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED EVICTIONS AND FORECLOSURE AND REAL ESTATE OWNED SALES IN A NUMBER OF STATES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES. LITTON RESUMED

THESE ACTIVITIES BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF LITTON, THE FIRM AGREED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AND SPECIFIC INDEMNITIES RELATED TO LITTONS SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE PRACTICES

PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF THE SALE. THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THESE INDEMNITIES HAS BEEN CAPPED. FOR INDEMNITIES NOT SUBJECT TO A CAP, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS BECAUSE

NO AMOUNTS HAVE YET BEEN SPECIFIED OR CLAIMED. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2011, GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA ENTERED INTO A CONSENT ORDER (THE ORDER) WITH THE

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) RELATING TO THE SERVICING OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. THE TERMS OF THE ORDER ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AND, IN MANY RESPECTS, IDENTICAL TO THE ORDERS ENTERED INTO WITH

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BY OTHER LARGE U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE ORDER SETS FORTH VARIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF

IMPROPER CONDUCT IN SERVICING BY LITTON, REQUIRES THAT GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA CEASE AND DESIST SUCH CONDUCT, AND REQUIRES THAT GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA, AND THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS, TAKE

VARIOUS AFFIRMATIVE STEPS. THE ORDER REQUIRES (I) GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA TO ENGAGE A THIRD-PARTY CONSULTANT TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF CERTAIN FORECLOSURE ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS THAT OCCURRED OR WERE PENDING BETWEEN

JANUARY 1, 2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010; (II) THE ADOPTION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO MANAGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES USED TO OUTSOURCE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, LOSS MITIGATION OR FORECLOSURE; (III) A

VALIDATION REPORT FROM AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY CONSULTANT REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER FOR THE FIRST YEAR; AND (IV) SUBMISSION OF QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORTS AS TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (OR

COMMITTEES THEREOF) OF GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA.

IN ADDITION, ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2011, GS BANK USA ENTERED INTO AN

AGREEMENT ON MORTGAGE SERVICING PRACTICES WITH THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT, LITTON AND THE ACQUIRER OF LITTON RELATING TO THE SERVICING OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, AND, IN A RELATED AGREEMENT WITH THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING

DEPARTMENT, GROUP INC. AGREED TO FORGIVE 25% OF THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE ON CERTAIN DELINQUENT FIRST LIEN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS OWNED BY GROUP INC. OR A SUBSIDIARY, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS.

GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH AND INCOME BENEFITS.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE FIRM IS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE TO PROVIDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH AND INCOME BENEFITS TO CERTAIN CONTRACT HOLDERS AND HAS ESTABLISHED A RESERVE RELATED TO

$5.52 BILLION AND $6.11 BILLION OF CONTRACT HOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY, FOR SUCH BENEFITS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ATTAINED AGE OF THESE CONTRACT HOLDERS WAS 69 YEARS FOR BOTH

DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010.

THE NET AMOUNT AT RISK, REPRESENTING GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH AND INCOME BENEFITS

IN EXCESS OF CONTRACT HOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES, WAS $1.51 BILLION AND $1.60 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 17 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INSURANCE LIABILITIES.

GUARANTEES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS DERIVATIVES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S.

GAAP, INCLUDING WRITTEN EQUITY AND COMMODITY PUT OPTIONS, WRITTEN CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS, FLOORS AND SWAPTIONS. DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVES ARE NOT REQUIRED IF THEY MAY BE CASH SETTLED AND THE FIRM HAS NO BASIS TO CONCLUDE IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES HELD THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS AT INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET FOR CERTAIN LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANK COUNTERPARTIES AND

CERTAIN OTHER COUNTERPARTIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT INCLUDED SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE TABLE BELOW.

THE FIRM, IN ITS

CAPACITY AS AN AGENCY LENDER, INDEMNIFIES MOST OF ITS SECURITIES LENDING CUSTOMERS AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED IN THE EVENT THAT BORROWERS DO NOT RETURN SECURITIES AND THE COLLATERAL HELD IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES

BORROWED.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM PROVIDES OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES

(E.G., STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER GUARANTEES TO ENABLE

CLIENTS TO COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS AND FUND-RELATED GUARANTEES). THESE GUARANTEES REPRESENT OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES IF THE GUARANTEED PARTY FAILS TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION

UNDER A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THAT BENEFICIARY.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT DERIVATIVES THAT

MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE AND CERTAIN OTHER GUARANTEES. THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT IN THE TABLE BELOW IS BASED ON THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE CONTRACT AND THEREFORE DOES NOT REPRESENT ANTICIPATED LOSSES. SEE NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW.

BECAUSE DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AT FAIR VALUE, THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED THE BEST INDICATION OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK FOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE CARRYING VALUES BELOW EXCLUDE THE EFFECT OF A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF THAT MAY EXIST UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING

AGREEMENT AND THE EFFECT OF NETTING OF CASH COLLATERAL POSTED UNDER CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS.

THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RISK MANAGED TOGETHER WITH DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE, AND THEREFORE THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT REFLECT THE

FIRMS OVERALL RISK RELATED TO ITS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2010, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET LIABILITY RELATED TO DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES WAS $8.26 BILLION.

2.

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS WAS $28.58 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011. BECAUSE THE CONTRACTUAL NATURE

OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE THAT EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES LENT TO THE BORROWER, THERE IS MINIMAL PERFORMANCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES.

OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES EXCLUDES CERTAIN COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT ARE INCLUDED IN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT. SEE

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED TRUSTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL I, II AND III, AND OTHER ENTITIES FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF ISSUING SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, LENDING THE

PROCEEDS TO THE FIRM AND ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FIRM AND THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO THIS PURPOSE. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES. SEE NOTE 16 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING GOLDMAN SACHS

THE FIRM EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES FOR THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY

THESE ENTITIES. TIMELY PAYMENT BY THE FIRM OF AMOUNTS DUE TO THESE ENTITIES UNDER THE BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER PAYMENTS DUE ON THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WILL OCCUR, SUCH AS NONPERFORMANCE ON THE PART OF PAYING AGENTS OR OTHER

SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR THE FIRM TO MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE ENTITIES OTHER THAN THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN

EXPENSES INCURRED BY THESE ENTITIES.

INDEMNITIES AND GUARANTEES OF SERVICE

SUB-CUSTODIANS AND THIRD-PARTY BROKERS, IMPROPERLY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF PAYMENT, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT NETWORKS AS WELL AS SECURITIES EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MEET THE

OBLIGATIONS OF SUCH NETWORKS AND EXCHANGES IN THE EVENT OF MEMBER DEFAULTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PRIME BROKERAGE AND

CLEARING BUSINESSES, THE FIRM AGREES TO CLEAR AND SETTLE ON BEHALF OF ITS CLIENTS THE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY THEM WITH OTHER

BROKERAGE FIRMS. THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE SECURED BY THE ASSETS IN THE CLIENTS ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ANY PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE TRANSACTIONS CLEARED

AND SETTLED BY THE FIRM ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT. IN CONNECTION WITH JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS, THE FIRM MAY ISSUE LOAN GUARANTEES UNDER WHICH IT MAY BE LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF FRAUD, MISAPPROPRIATION, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OTHER

MATTERS INVOLVING THE BORROWER.

THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE GUARANTEES AND

INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO MATERIAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010.

OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS.

THE FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TO COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH A

VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND OCCASIONALLY INDEMNIFIES THEM AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY THE BREACH OF THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN OR ADVERSE

APPLICATION OF CERTAIN U.S. TAX LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH ORDINARY-COURSE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS SECURITIES ISSUANCES, BORROWINGS OR DERIVATIVES.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS TO SOME COUNTERPARTIES TO PROTECT THEM IN THE EVENT ADDITIONAL TAXES ARE OWED OR PAYMENTS ARE WITHHELD, DUE EITHER TO A CHANGE IN OR AN ADVERSE

APPLICATION OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.

THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS GENERALLY ARE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND ARE ENTERED INTO

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. GENERALLY, THERE ARE NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND THE CONTINGENCIES TRIGGERING THE OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR. THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

COMMON EQUITY

DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE WERE $1.40 IN 2011, $1.40 IN 2010 AND $1.05 IN 2009. ON JANUARY 17, 2012, GROUP INC. DECLARED A

DIVIDEND OF $0.35 PER COMMON SHARE TO BE PAID ON MARCH 29, 2012 TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MARCH 1, 2012.

ON JULY 1, 2011, THE FIRM ISSUED $103 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK (774,823 SHARES) IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF GS AUSTRALIA.

THE FIRMS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY AND TO

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY

THE FIRMS CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITIONS (I.E., COMPARISONS OF THE FIRMS DESIRED LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL TO ITS ACTUAL LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL) AND THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION, BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK. ANY REPURCHASE OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

DURING 2011, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 47.0 MILLION, 25.3 MILLION AND 19,578 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT

AN AVERAGE COST PER SHARE OF $128.33, $164.48 AND $80.83, FOR A TOTAL COST OF $6.04 BILLION, $4.16 BILLION AND $2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF CERTAIN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

164,172 SHARES AND 4,506 SHARES WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF $12 MILLION, $25 MILLION AND $342,153 AND THE FIRM CANCELLED 12.0 MILLION, 6.2 MILLION AND 11.2 MILLION OF RSUS WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF $1.91 BILLION, $972 MILLION AND $863

REGULATION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

NOTE 20.

REGULATION AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF GROUP INC., A BANK HOLDING COMPANY

AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (WHICH ARE BASED ON THE BASEL 1 CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL COMMITTEE)). THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPRESSED AS

CAPITAL RATIOS THAT COMPARE MEASURES OF CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS). THE FIRMS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA, ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT IS

APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA, THE FIRM AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY

REPORTING PRACTICES. THE FIRM AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES CAPITAL AMOUNTS, AS WELL AS GS BANK USAS PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT

COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.

MANY OF THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS&CO. AND THE FIRMS

OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

GROUP INC.

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATIONS REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4% AND A MINIMUM TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIO OF 8%. THE REQUIRED MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A WELL-CAPITALIZED BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES ARE 6% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY. BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING ON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE

AND GROWTH PLANS. THE MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR THAT HAVE

IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%.

RWAS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF MARKET

RISK AND CREDIT RISK. RWAS FOR MARKET RISK ARE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE FIRMS VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODELS, SUPPLEMENTED BY OTHER MEASURES TO CAPTURE RISKS NOT REFLECTED IN VAR MODELS. CREDIT RISK FOR ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS IS BASED ON

THE BALANCE SHEET VALUE. FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES AND COMMITMENTS, A CREDIT EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF EACH TRADE. ALL SUCH ASSETS AND AMOUNTS ARE THEN ASSIGNED A RISK WEIGHT

DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK OR QUALIFYING SECURITIES FIRM OR OTHER ENTITY (OR IF COLLATERAL IS HELD, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE COLLATERAL).

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL UNDER BASEL 1 DIVIDED BY AVERAGE ADJUSTED TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR

DISALLOWED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN NON-FINANCIAL COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REGULATORY REFORM

THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS: ADVANCED CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK  BASEL 2, AS APPLICABLE TO GROUP INC. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (BASEL 2), WHICH ARE BASED ON THE ADVANCED APPROACHES UNDER THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE

INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE INCORPORATED THE BASEL 2 FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT INTERNATIONALLY

ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS GROUP INC., ADOPT BASEL 2, ONCE APPROVED TO DO SO BY REGULATORS. AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED A RULE THAT REQUIRES LARGE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, UPON ADOPTION OF

BASEL 2, TO CONTINUE TO CALCULATE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BOTH BASEL 1 AND BASEL 2. FOR EACH OF THE TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS, THE LOWER OF THE BASEL 1 AND BASEL 2 RATIOS CALCULATED WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE BANK MEETS

ITS MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED REVISED

PROPOSALS TO MODIFY THEIR MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TRADING ACTIVITIES. THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MARKET RISK FRAMEWORK

THAT WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN JUNE 2010 (BASEL 2.5), AS WELL AS THE PROHIBITION IN THE USE OF CREDIT RATINGS, AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT. ONCE IMPLEMENTED, IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE CHANGES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET RISK.

ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN DECEMBER 2010 (BASEL 3)

REVISE THE DEFINITION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL, INTRODUCE TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AS A REGULATORY METRIC, SET NEW MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS (INCLUDING A NEW CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH MUST BE COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AND

WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS), INTRODUCE A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WITHIN INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND MAKE SUBSTANTIAL REVISIONS TO THE COMPUTATION OF RWAS FOR CREDIT EXPOSURES. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW

REQUIREMENTS IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL 3 GUIDELINES IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PUBLISHED ITS FINAL PROVISIONS FOR ASSESSING THE GLOBAL SYSTEMIC

IMPORTANCE OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND THE RANGE OF ADDITIONAL TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS DEEMED TO BE GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS WOULD INITIALLY

RANGE FROM 1% TO 2.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY AND COULD BE AS MUCH AS 3.5% FOR A BANK THAT INCREASES ITS SYSTEMIC FOOTPRINT (E.G., BY INCREASING TOTAL ASSETS). THE FIRM WAS ONE OF 29 INSTITUTIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD

(ESTABLISHED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP OF 20) AS GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT UNDER THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY. THEREFORE, DEPENDING UPON THE MANNER AND TIMING OF THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS IMPLEMENTATION OF

THE BASEL COMMITTEES METHODOLOGY, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT THE MINIMUM TIER 1 COMMON RATIO REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM WILL INCLUDE THIS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED AS

GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND THE CALCULATION OF THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 2014 BASED ON DATA THROUGH THE END OF 2013.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS PROPOSED REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

AND SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT NONBANK FINANCIAL FIRMS. THESE PROPOSALS ADDRESS RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, STRESS TESTS, SINGLE COUNTERPARTY LIMITS AND EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

ADDRESS FINANCIAL WEAKNESS AT AN EARLY STAGE. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE PROPOSALS MIRROR INITIATIVES TO WHICH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE ALREADY SUBJECT, THEIR FULL IMPACT ON THE FIRM WILL NOT BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY UNTIL THE RULES ARE FINALIZED.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL SUBJECT THE FIRM AT A FIRMWIDE LEVEL TO THE SAME LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT

APPLY TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND DIRECTS BANKING REGULATORS TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS DISCLOSED ABOVE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT THE NEW LEVERAGE AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REGULATIONS IN 2012. AS A

CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CHANGES, TIER 1 CAPITAL TREATMENT FOR THE FIRMS JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS WILL BE PHASED OUT OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THE INTERACTION AMONG THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE

BASEL COMMITTEES PROPOSED CHANGES AND OTHER PROPOSED OR ANNOUNCED CHANGES FROM OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS ADDS FURTHER UNCERTAINTY TO THE FIRMS FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND THOSE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

A NUMBER OF OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)

AND THE U.K.S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA), HAVE ALSO PROPOSED OR ANNOUNCED CHANGES THAT WILL RESULT IN INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THE FIRM EXPECTS MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATIONS WILL BE INCREASED AND CHANGES IN THE PRESCRIBED

CALCULATION METHODOLOGY ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN HIGHER RWAS AND LOWER CAPITAL RATIOS THAN THOSE CURRENTLY COMPUTED.

THE

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF SEVERAL OF THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES WILL ALSO BE IMPACTED IN THE FUTURE BY THE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENTS ARISING FROM THE BASEL COMMITTEE, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND REGULATORS.

GS

BANK USA, AN FDIC-INSURED, NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, IS SUPERVISED AND REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC AND THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES (FORMERLY THE NEW YORK

STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT) AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (DESCRIBED BELOW) THAT ARE CALCULATED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. GS BANK USA COMPUTES ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH ARE BASED ON BASEL 1 AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL. UNDER THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT IS APPLICABLE TO GS BANK USA, IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A WELL-CAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, GS BANK USA MUST MAINTAIN A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10% AND A

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. GS BANK USA HAS AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THESE WELL-CAPITALIZED LEVELS. ACCORDINGLY, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, GS BANK USA IS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 11% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%. AS NOTED IN THE TABLE BELOW, GS BANK USA WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND

$1.00 BILLION DIVIDEND TO GROUP INC. DURING 2011.

GS BANK USA IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL 2 FRAMEWORK, AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

SIMILAR TO THE FIRMS REQUIREMENT AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, GS BANK USA IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT BASEL 2, ONCE APPROVED TO DO SO BY REGULATORS. IN ADDITION, THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GS BANK USA ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES TO THE

BASEL COMMITTEES CAPITAL GUIDELINES, AS OUTLINED ABOVE. FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT GS BANK USA WILL BE IMPACTED BY ASPECTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, INCLUDING STRESS TEST AND RESOLUTION PLAN REQUIREMENTS.

THE DEPOSITS OF GS BANK USA ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AMOUNT DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION HELD AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK WAS APPROXIMATELY $40.06 BILLION AND $28.12 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER

2010, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNTS BY $39.51 BILLION AND $27.45 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM HAS RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $213 MILLION AND $250 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY, IN CONNECTION WITH U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. THE FIRM ALSO RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $59 MILLION AND $42 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010,

RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. AS OF DECEMBER 2011, THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WERE $96 MILLION, $1.65 BILLION AND $378 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IF NOT

UTILIZED, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN 2017 AND THE STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN 2012. THE FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS CAN BE CARRIED FORWARD

INDEFINITELY. THE FIRM HAD FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $12 MILLION AND $11 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM RECORDED A RELATED NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET OF $6 MILLION AND

$5 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THESE CARRYFORWARDS WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN 2013.

THE FIRM HAD CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS OF $6 MILLION AND $12 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE

FIRM RECORDED A RELATED NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET OF $2 MILLION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010. THESE CARRYFORWARDS EXPIRE IN 2013.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCREASED BY $15 MILLION AND DECREASED BY $24 MILLION DURING 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO LOSSES CONSIDERED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO EXPIRE UNUSED. THE

DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UTILIZATION OF LOSSES PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO EXPIRE UNUSED.

THE FIRM PERMANENTLY REINVESTS ELIGIBLE EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND,

ACCORDINGLY, DOES NOT ACCRUE ANY U.S. INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD ARISE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED. AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, THIS POLICY RESULTED IN AN UNRECOGNIZED NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $3.32 BILLION AND $2.67 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO REINVESTED EARNINGS OF $20.63 BILLION AND $17.70 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

THE FIRM RECOGNIZES TAX POSITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON

EXAMINATION BY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. A POSITION THAT MEETS THIS STANDARD IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REALIZED ON SETTLEMENT. A LIABILITY IS

ESTABLISHED FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, THE ACCRUED LIABILITY FOR INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS AND

INCOME TAX PENALTIES WAS $233 MILLION AND $213 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED $21 MILLION, $28 MILLION AND $62 MILLION OF INTEREST AND INCOME TAX PENALTIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2011, DECEMBER 2010 AND

DECEMBER 2009, RESPECTIVELY. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 2011 DUE TO POTENTIAL AUDIT SETTLEMENTS. AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

ESTIMATE THE CHANGE OR ITS IMPACT ON THE FIRMS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM REORGANIZED ITS THREE PREVIOUS REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS INTO FOUR NEW REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INVESTMENT BANKING, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, INVESTING & LENDING AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. PRIOR

PERIODS ARE PRESENTED ON A COMPARABLE BASIS.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS LINES HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS: (I) THE NATURE

OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, (II) THEIR METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF CLIENTS THEY SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS A WHOLE  COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY  ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN

EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES IN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AS WELL AS THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES. CONSEQUENTLY, PRE-TAX

MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES REVENUES AND EXPENSES AMONG THE FOUR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF THESE SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE MADE IN ALLOCATING CERTAIN REVENUE AND

EXPENSE ITEMS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE THIRD-PARTY RATES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS

BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE BUSINESS OF THE FIRM.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS MAY ARISE FROM MARKET MAKING, CLIENT FACILITATION, INVESTING,

UNDERWRITING, LENDING AND COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL FACTORS. THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK BY ACTIVELY MONITORING EXPOSURES AND OBTAINING COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES AS

DEEMED APPROPRIATE.

WHILE THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES EXPOSE IT TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, THE FIRM

ROUTINELY EXECUTES A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSET MANAGERS, INVESTMENT FUNDS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, BROKERS AND DEALERS, CLEARING HOUSES AND EXCHANGES, WHICH RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER

OR ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, OR TO A PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSE OR EXCHANGE.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE CREDIT

CONCENTRATIONS IN ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM. AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER COUNTERPARTY THAT EXCEEDED 2% OF TOTAL ASSETS.

TO REDUCE CREDIT EXPOSURES, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT

PERMIT THE FIRM TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES AND/OR ENABLE THE FIRM TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL ON AN UPFRONT OR CONTINGENT BASIS. COLLATERAL OBTAINED BY THE FIRM RELATED TO DERIVATIVE ASSETS IS PRINCIPALLY CASH AND IS HELD

BY THE FIRM OR A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN. COLLATERAL OBTAINED BY THE FIRM RELATED TO RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS IS PRIMARILY U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 9 FOR

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

(INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW) CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE IN EARLY STAGES, AND MANY OF THESE CASES SEEK AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES.

UNDER ASC 450 AN EVENT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IF THE CHANCE OF THE FUTURE EVENT OR EVENTS OCCURRING IS MORE THAN REMOTE

BUT LESS THAN LIKELY AND AN EVENT IS REMOTE IF THE CHANCE OF THE FUTURE EVENT OR EVENTS OCCURRING IS SLIGHT. THUS, REFERENCES TO THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FOR CASES IN WHICH THE FIRM IS ABLE

TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS MEAN THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF LOSS FOR CASES FOR WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES THE RISK OF LOSS IS MORE THAN SLIGHT. THE AMOUNTS RESERVED AGAINST SUCH MATTERS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT AS COMPARED TO THE

UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS.

WITH RESPECT TO PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN

ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS WHERE (I) PLAINTIFFS HAVE CLAIMED AN AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES, (II) THE FIRM IS BEING SUED BY PURCHASERS IN AN UNDERWRITING AND IS NOT BEING INDEMNIFIED BY A PARTY THAT THE FIRM BELIEVES

WILL PAY ANY JUDGMENT, OR (III) THE PURCHASERS ARE DEMANDING THAT THE FIRM REPURCHASE SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT HAS ESTIMATED THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS AS BEING EQUAL TO (A) IN THE CASE OF (I), THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

DAMAGES CLAIMED, (B) IN THE CASE OF (II), THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM SOLD IN THE UNDERWRITINGS AND (C) IN THE CASE OF (III), THE PRICE THAT PURCHASERS PAID FOR THE SECURITIES LESS THE ESTIMATED VALUE, IF ANY, AS OF DECEMBER

2011 OF THE RELEVANT SECURITIES, IN EACH OF CASES (I), (II) AND (III), TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY FACTORS BELIEVED TO BE RELEVANT TO THE PARTICULAR PROCEEDING. AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, THE FIRM HAS ESTIMATED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF REASONABLY

POSSIBLE LOSSES FOR SUCH PROCEEDINGS AND FOR ANY OTHER PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED BELOW WHERE MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION.

MANAGEMENT IS GENERALLY UNABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FOR

PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN THOSE INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE ABOVE, INCLUDING WHERE (I) PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT CLAIMED AN AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES, UNLESS MANAGEMENT CAN OTHERWISE DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT, (II) THE PROCEEDINGS ARE IN EARLY

STAGES, (III) THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CLASS BEING CERTIFIED OR THE ULTIMATE SIZE OF THE CLASS, (IV) THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE OUTCOME OF PENDING APPEALS OR MOTIONS, (V) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTUAL ISSUES

TO BE RESOLVED, AND/OR (VI) THERE ARE NOVEL LEGAL ISSUES PRESENTED. HOWEVER, FOR THESE CASES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, THOUGH THE OUTCOMES COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH PERIOD.

IPO PROCESS MATTERS.

GROUP INC. AND GS&CO. ARE AMONG THE NUMEROUS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A VARIETY OF LAWSUITS ALLEGING IMPROPRIETIES IN THE PROCESS BY WHICH

OTHER THINGS, THAT THE PROSPECTUSES FOR THE OFFERINGS VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF ALLEGED ARRANGEMENTS TYING ALLOCATIONS IN CERTAIN OFFERINGS TO HIGHER CUSTOMER BROKERAGE COMMISSION RATES AS WELL AS

PURCHASE ORDERS IN THE AFTERMARKET, AND THAT THE ALLEGED ARRANGEMENTS RESULTED IN MARKET MANIPULATION. ON OCTOBER 5, 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT APPROVED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY THE PARTIES. THE FIRM HAS PAID INTO A SETTLEMENT FUND

THE FULL AMOUNT THAT GS&CO. WOULD CONTRIBUTE IN THE SETTLEMENT. CERTAIN OBJECTORS APPEALED CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE SETTLEMENTS APPROVAL, BUT ALL SUCH APPEALS HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN OR FINALLY DISMISSED, THEREBY CONCLUDING THE MATTER.

NOTE 29.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

THE COST OF EMPLOYEE SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR A

SHARE-BASED AWARD IS GENERALLY MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD. SHARE-BASED AWARDS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE (I.E., VESTED AWARDS, INCLUDING AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES) ARE EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY.

SHARE-BASED AWARDS THAT REQUIRE FUTURE SERVICE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE RELEVANT SERVICE PERIOD. EXPECTED FORFEITURES ARE INCLUDED IN DETERMINING SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

THE FIRM PAYS CASH DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS ON OUTSTANDING RSUS. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RSUS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RSUS EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED ARE INCLUDED IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RSUS AS AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL.

IN CERTAIN CASES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CONFLICTED EMPLOYMENT (AS OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENTS), THE FIRM MAY CASH SETTLE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS. FOR AWARDS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL IS ADJUSTED TO THE EXTENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE AWARD AND THE GRANT-DATE VALUE OF THE AWARD.

COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE SIP THROUGH THE END OF THE 2008 FISCAL YEAR COULD NOT EXCEED 250 MILLION SHARES. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE DELIVERED FOR AWARDS GRANTED UNDER

THE SIP IN THE 2009 FISCAL YEAR AND EACH FISCAL YEAR THEREAFTER CANNOT EXCEED 5% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, DETERMINED AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR, INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES

AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS IN PREVIOUS YEARS BUT NOT COVERED BY AWARDS GRANTED IN SUCH YEARS. AS OF DECEMBER 2011 AND DECEMBER 2010, 161.0 MILLION AND 139.2 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE SIP.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

THE FIRM

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS ARE BASED ON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

COUNCILS (FFIEC) REGULATORY GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING CROSS-BORDER INFORMATION AND REPRESENT THE AMOUNTS THAT THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY DUE TO COUNTRY-SPECIFIC EVENTS, INCLUDING UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INSTABILITY, AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES.

CREDIT EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL FOR

LOSS DUE TO THE DEFAULT OR DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY OF A COUNTERPARTY OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS THE FIRM HOLDS AND IS MEASURED BASED ON THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN AN EVENT OF NON-PAYMENT BY A COUNTERPARTY. CREDIT EXPOSURE IS

REDUCED THROUGH THE EFFECT OF RISK MITIGANTS, SUCH AS NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT THE FIRM TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES OR OBTAINING COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES. THE TABLES BELOW DO NOT

INCLUDE ALL THE EFFECTS OF SUCH RISK MITIGANTS AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE.

CLAIMS IN THE TABLES BELOW INCLUDE CASH, RECEIVABLES, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS

TO RESELL, SECURITIES BORROWED AND CASH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, BUT EXCLUDE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND COMMITMENTS. SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED ARE PRESENTED GROSS, WITHOUT REDUCTION FOR RELATED SECURITIES

COLLATERAL HELD, BASED ON THE DOMICILE OF THE COUNTERPARTY. MARGIN LOANS (INCLUDED IN RECEIVABLES) ARE PRESENTED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL ADVANCED BY THE COUNTERPARTY.

THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS FOR EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED 0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FFIEC GUIDELINES.
