COMPETITORS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.

OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT IS DIVIDED INTO

THREE COMPONENTS: FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES;

EQUITIES; AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

FIXED INCOME,

CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC) AND EQUITIES ARE

LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED OPERATIONS THROUGH WHICH WE ASSIST CLIENTS

WITH THEIR INVESTING AND TRADING STRATEGIES AND ALSO ENGAGE IN

PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

IN OUR CLIENT-DRIVEN BUSINESSES, FICC AND EQUITIES STRIVE TO

DELIVER

HIGH-QUALITY

SERVICE BY OFFERING BROAD

MARKET-MAKING

AND MARKET KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CLIENTS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. IN

ADDITION, WE USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TAKE POSITIONS IN MARKETS, BY

COMMITTING CAPITAL AND TAKING RISK, TO FACILITATE CLIENT

TRANSACTIONS AND TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. OUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE

MARKETS, COMMIT CAPITAL AND TAKE RISK IN A BROAD RANGE OF FIXED

INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRODUCTS AND THEIR

DERIVATIVES IS CRUCIAL TO OUR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND TO

SUPPORT OUR UNDERWRITING BUSINESS BY PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET

LIQUIDITY.

WE GENERATE TRADING NET REVENUES FROM OUR CLIENT-DRIVEN

BUSINESSES IN THREE WAYS.



FIRST, IN LARGE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKETS, WE UNDERTAKE A HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR MODEST SPREADS AND FEES.



SECOND, BY CAPITALIZING ON OUR STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPITAL

POSITION, WE UNDERTAKE TRANSACTIONS IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WHERE

SPREADS AND FEES ARE GENERALLY LARGER.



FINALLY, WE STRUCTURE AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS THAT ADDRESS

COMPLEX CLIENT NEEDS.

OUR FICC AND EQUITIES BUSINESSES OPERATE IN CLOSE COORDINATION

TO PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH SERVICES AND CROSS-MARKET KNOWLEDGE AND

EXPERTISE.

IN OUR PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES IN BOTH FICC AND EQUITIES, WE

ASSUME A VARIETY OF RISKS AND DEVOTE RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY,

ANALYZE AND BENEFIT FROM THESE EXPOSURES. WE CAPITALIZE ON OUR

ANALYTICAL MODELS TO ANALYZE INFORMATION AND MAKE INFORMED

TRADING JUDGMENTS, AND WE SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM PERCEIVED

DISPARITIES IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN THE TRADING MARKETS AND

FROM MACROECONOMIC AND ISSUER-SPECIFIC TRENDS.

FICC

WE MAKE MARKETS IN AND TRADE INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS,

MORTGAGE-RELATED

SECURITIES AND LOAN PRODUCTS AND OTHER

BUSINESSES: COMMODITIES; CREDIT PRODUCTS; CURRENCIES; INTEREST

RATE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS; AND

MORTGAGE-RELATED

SECURITIES AND LOAN PRODUCTS AND OTHER

ASSET-BACKED

INSTRUMENTS.

TRANSACTIONS DESIGNED TO MEET CLIENT NEEDS.

IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CREDIT THROUGH BRIDGE AND OTHER LOAN

FACILITIES TO A BROAD RANGE OF CLIENTS. COMMITMENTS THAT ARE

EXTENDED FOR CONTINGENT ACQUISITION FINANCING ARE OFTEN INTENDED

TO BE

SHORT-TERM

IN NATURE, AS BORROWERS OFTEN SEEK TO REPLACE THEM WITH OTHER

FUNDING SOURCES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING CREDIT ORIGINATION

ACTIVITIES, WE MAY SEEK TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK ON COMMITMENTS

BY SYNDICATING ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF COMMITMENTS TO

OTHER INVESTORS OR, UPON FUNDING, BY SECURITIZING THE POSITIONS

THROUGH INVESTMENT VEHICLES SOLD TO OTHER INVESTORS.

UNDERWRITING FEES FROM SYNDICATIONS OF THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

RECORDED IN DEBT UNDERWRITING IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING SEGMENT.

HOWEVER, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RECOGNIZE LOSSES ON THESE

COMMITMENTS, SUCH LOSSES ARE RECORDED WITHIN OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT, NET OF ANY RELATED UNDERWRITING

FEES. SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INVESTMENT FUNDS. AS OF DECEMBER 2009, THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT (AUM) IN THESE FUNDS (INCLUDING BOTH FUNDED

AMOUNTS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ON WHICH WE EARN FEES) WAS

$93 BILLION.

OUR STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO THESE FUNDS GENERALLY IS TO INVEST

OPPORTUNISTICALLY TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS THAT IS

DIVERSIFIED BY INDUSTRY, PRODUCT TYPE, GEOGRAPHIC REGION, AND

TRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND TYPE. OUR CORPORATE INVESTMENT FUNDS

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES IN PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, LEVERAGED BUYOUTS, ACQUISITIONS AND

INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL PARTIES. OUR REAL

COMPANIES, DEBT AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, AND

OTHER REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR MERCHANT

BANKING FUNDS INCLUDE FUNDS THAT INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND

INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED ASSETS AND COMPANIES ON A GLOBAL BASIS.

MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES GENERATE THREE PRIMARY REVENUE

STREAMS. FIRST, WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS GENERALLY A

PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS COMMITTED CAPITAL, INVESTED CAPITAL,

TOTAL GROSS ACQUISITION COST OR ASSET VALUE. THESE ANNUAL

MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT NET

REVENUES. SECOND, GOLDMAN SACHS, AS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTOR IN

SOME OF THESE FUNDS, IS ALLOCATED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

FUNDS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ARISING FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES UPON

REALIZATION. THIRD, AFTER A FUND HAS ACHIEVED A MINIMUM RETURN

FOR FUND INVESTORS, WE RECEIVE AN INCREASED SHARE OF THE

FUNDS INCOME AND GAINS THAT IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME

AND GAINS FROM THE FUNDS INVESTMENTS. THE SECOND AND THIRD

OF THESE REVENUE STREAMS ARE INCLUDED IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

WITHIN OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.

AUM TYPICALLY

GENERATES FEES AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSET VALUE, WHICH IS AFFECTED

BY INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND BY INFLOWS AND REDEMPTIONS. THE

FEES THAT WE CHARGE VARY BY ASSET CLASS, AS DO OUR RELATED

EXPENSES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO

RETURN OR WHEN THE RETURN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT EXCEEDS

SPECIFIED BENCHMARK RETURNS OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGETS.

INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDS

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT.

CLIENTS BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY

GENERATE FEES BASED ON THE ASSETS IN THE ACCOUNTS RATHER THAN

CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY ARE HIGH PRIORITIES

FOR GOLDMAN SACHS. OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN

DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY

IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTIONS AT THE FIRMS CRITICAL

FACILITIES AND TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY. BECAUSE WE ARE A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY, OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM IS ALSO SUBJECT

TO REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE

PROGRAM ARE CRISIS MANAGEMENT, PEOPLE RECOVERY FACILITIES,

BUSINESS RECOVERY, SYSTEMS AND DATA RECOVERY, AND PROCESS

IMPROVEMENT. IN THE AREA OF INFORMATION SECURITY, WE HAVE

DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES, POLICIES

AND TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION ASSETS OF THE FIRM AND

OUR CLIENTS. SAFEGUARDS ARE APPLIED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION

RESOURCES.

EMPLOYEES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A MAJOR STRENGTH AND PRINCIPAL REASON

FOR THE SUCCESS OF GOLDMAN SACHS IS THE QUALITY AND DEDICATION

PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, DIVERSITY, COOPERATION AMONG OUR

EMPLOYEES THEY SUPERVISE IN A

360-DEGREE

REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS INTEGRAL TO OUR TEAM APPROACH.

COMPETITION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. OUR COMPETITORS ARE OTHER ENTITIES THAT

PROVIDE INVESTMENT BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

SERVICES, AS WELL AS THOSE ENTITIES THAT MAKE INVESTMENTS IN

SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, DERIVATIVES, REAL ESTATE, LOANS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS. THESE ENTITIES INCLUDE BROKERS AND

DEALERS, INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND MERCHANT BANKS. WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS GLOBALLY AND WITH OTHERS ON A REGIONAL, PRODUCT

OR NICHE BASIS. OUR COMPETITION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING

EMPLOYEES AND TO CONTINUE TO COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES COMPETITIVELY

AMID INTENSE PUBLIC AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY ON THE COMPENSATION

PRACTICES OF LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR PAY PRACTICES AND

THOSE OF OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND

THE STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND REGULATORS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AUTHORITY (FSA) IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. SEE

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE REGULATION OF OUR COMPENSATION

PRACTICES.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THIS TREND ACCELERATED IN RECENT YEARS AS THE CREDIT CRISIS

CAUSED NUMEROUS MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS. MANY COMMERCIAL BANKS AND OTHER

BROAD-BASED

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE HAD THE ABILITY FOR SOME TIME TO

OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS, FROM LOANS, DEPOSIT-TAKING AND

INSURANCE TO BROKERAGE, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT BANKING

SERVICES, WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THEY

ALSO HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT BANKING AND

SECURITIES PRODUCTS WITH COMMERCIAL BANKING, INSURANCE AND OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUES IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE,

WHICH HAS RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURE IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING

AND TRADING BUSINESSES AND COULD RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURE IN

OTHER OF OUR BUSINESSES.

MOREOVER, WE HAVE FACED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FACE,

PRESSURE TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE BY COMMITTING CAPITAL TO

BUSINESSES OR TRANSACTIONS ON TERMS THAT OFFER RETURNS THAT MAY

NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS (SUCH AS AGREEMENTS TO PARTICIPATE

IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKSTOP OR OTHER LOAN FACILITIES)

FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT

BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

WE PROVIDE THESE COMMITMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH GS BANK USA AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES (INCLUDING THE WILLIAM STREET ENTITIES) AND

THROUGH GOLDMAN SACHS LENDING PARTNERS LLC. WITH RESPECT TO MOST

OF THESE COMMITMENTS, SMFG PROVIDES US WITH CREDIT LOSS

PROTECTION THAT IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO 95% OF THE FIRST LOSS WE

REALIZE ON APPROVED LOAN COMMITMENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF

APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO THE

SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS, UPON OUR REQUEST, SMFG WILL

PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR 70% OF ADDITIONAL LOSSES ON SUCH

COMMITMENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.13 BILLION, OF WHICH

$375 MILLION OF PROTECTION HAS BEEN PROVIDED AS OF

DECEMBER 2009. WE ALSO USE OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO

MITIGATE CREDIT RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN OF THESE COMMITMENTS

THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY SMFG. SEE NOTE 8 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8

SMFG. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF OUR COMMITMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH

INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS ARE MADE THROUGH GS

BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (OTHER THAN THE WILLIAM STREET

NUMBER OF THESE COMMITMENTS DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THE SMFG LOSS

PROTECTION.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE CAPITAL BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF

THE SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A

RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL

TRANSACTIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND

BETTER CAPITALIZED AND THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE

AND LONGER OPERATING HISTORY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION IN SOME OF OUR

BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS THE INCREASING VOLUME OF TRADES EXECUTED ELECTRONICALLY,

THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THROUGH ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS,

HAS INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON TRADING COMMISSIONS, IN THAT

COMMISSIONS FOR

LOW-TOUCH

ELECTRONIC TRADING ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOR

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HIGH-TOUCH

NON-ELECTRONIC

TRADING. IT APPEARS THAT THIS TREND TOWARD ELECTRONIC AND OTHER

LOW-TOUCH,

LOW-COMMISSION

TRADING WILL CONTINUE. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER

AREAS IN THE FUTURE AS SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS SEEK TO OBTAIN

MARKET SHARE BY FURTHER REDUCING PRICES.

BANKING

REGULATION

ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2008, GROUP INC. BECAME A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS OF THAT DATE, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD BECAME THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATOR OF

GROUP INC., AS A CONSOLIDATED ENTITY. AS OF

AUGUST 14, 2009, GROUP INC. ELECTED TO BECOME A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE

U.S. GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY

ACT OF 1999 (GLB ACT), AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

SUPERVISION

AND REGULATION

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER

THE BHC ACT, GROUP INC. IS SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND

EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF

FUNCTIONAL REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SUPERVISES GROUP INC., INCLUDING

ALL OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS AN UMBRELLA

REGULATOR OF THE CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION AND GENERALLY

DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATORS OF

GROUP INC.S U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARY, AS APPLICABLE, AND TO THE OTHER U.S. REGULATORS

OF GROUP INC.S

U.S. NON-DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES THAT REGULATE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF

THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. SUCH FUNCTIONALLY REGULATED

NON-DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE

BROKER-DEALERS

REGISTERED WITH THE SEC, SUCH AS OUR PRINCIPAL

U.S. BROKER-DEALER,

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.), INSURANCE

COMPANIES REGULATED BY STATE INSURANCE AUTHORITIES, INVESTMENT

ADVISORS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THEIR

INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES AND ENTITIES REGULATED BY THE

U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC) WITH

RESPECT TO CERTAIN FUTURES-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT GENERALLY RESTRICTS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES FROM

ENGAGING IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THE BUSINESS OF

BANKING AND CERTAIN CLOSELY RELATED ACTIVITIES. AS A FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE GLB ACT, WE MAY ENGAGE IN A BROADER

RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND RELATED ACTIVITIES THAN ARE PERMISSIBLE

FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO MEET THE

ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. THESE

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND MAKING MARKETS IN

SECURITIES, INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND MAKING MERCHANT BANKING

INVESTMENTS IN NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE

PERMITTED UNDER THE GLB ACT TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WERE

IMPERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 1997, IF THE ASSETS HELD PURSUANT TO

THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT EQUAL 5% OR MORE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS

IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR

U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES CONTINUING TO

QUALIFY AS WELL CAPITALIZED AND

WELL-MANAGED AS DESCRIBED UNDER

 PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION BELOW.

ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE MATERIAL

TO OUR CURRENT OR CURRENTLY PROPOSED BUSINESS ARE IMPERMISSIBLE

ACTIVITIES FOR US AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, THE BHC ACT

ALSO GRANTS A NEW BANK HOLDING COMPANY, SUCH AS GROUP INC.,

TWO YEARS FROM THE DATE THE ENTITY BECOMES A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH THE RESTRICTIONS ON ITS ACTIVITIES

IMPOSED BY THE BHC ACT WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTIVITIES IN WHICH

IT WAS ENGAGED WHEN IT BECAME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, UNDER THE BHC ACT, WE CAN APPLY TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD FOR UP TO THREE

ONE-YEAR

EXTENSIONS.

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, GROUP INC. IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN

PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD APPROVAL BEFORE DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY ACQUIRING MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SHARES

OF ANY UNAFFILIATED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. IN ADDITION, AS A

BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE MAY GENERALLY ENGAGE IN BANKING AND

OTHER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES ABROAD, INCLUDING INVESTING IN AND

OWNING

NON-U.S. BANKS,

IF THOSE ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS DO NOT EXCEED CERTAIN LIMITS

AND, IN SOME CASES, IF WE HAVE OBTAINED THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED

BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES. OUR BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA, ARE SUBJECT TO

SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND THE REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA) THAT IS APPLICABLE

TO GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

CERTAIN

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY REPORTING PRACTICES.

GOLDMAN SACHS AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES CAPITAL AMOUNTS, AS WELL AS GS BANK

USAS PCA CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE

JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS

AND OTHER FACTORS.

WE REPORT CAPITAL RATIOS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE

BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL I). THESE RATIOS

ARE USED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND OTHER

U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES IN THE SUPERVISORY REVIEW

PROCESS, INCLUDING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS CAPITAL

ADEQUACY.

OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY, QUALIFYING PREFERRED STOCK AND OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS, LESS DEDUCTIONS FOR GOODWILL, DISALLOWED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER ITEMS. OUR TOTAL CAPITAL CONSISTS OF

OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL AND OUR QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT,

LESS CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS. OUR TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO IS EQUAL TO

TOTAL CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF

RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS (RWAS), WHICH ARE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO IS EQUAL

TO TIER 1 CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF RWAS. THE CALCULATION

OF RWAS IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE FIRMS MARKET RISK

AND CREDIT RISK. CERTAIN MEASURES INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF

THE FIRMS RWAS FOR MARKET RISK ARE UNDER REVIEW BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE CALCULATION

OF OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL, TOTAL CAPITAL AND RWAS IS SET FORTH

IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  EQUITY

CAPITAL  CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND

IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH

ARE IN PART II, ITEMS 7 AND 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

AS OF DECEMBER 2009, OUR TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO WAS 18.2%, AND

OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 15.0%.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT

IN THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF

CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL II) AS APPLICABLE

TO US AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS

HAVE INCORPORATED THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS GROUP INC., TRANSITION TO

BASEL II OVER SEVERAL YEARS. DURING A PARALLEL PERIOD, WE

ANTICIPATE THAT GROUP INC.S CAPITAL CALCULATIONS

COMPUTED UNDER BOTH THE BASEL I RULES AND THE BASEL II RULES

WILL BE REPORTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FOR EXAMINATION

AND COMPLIANCE FOR AT LEAST FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY PERIODS.

ONCE THE PARALLEL PERIOD AND SUBSEQUENT THREE-YEAR TRANSITION

PERIOD ARE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, GROUP INC. WILL UTILIZE

THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK AS ITS MEANS OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY

ASSESSMENT, MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING AND WILL DISCONTINUE USE

OF BASEL I. THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK WAS IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL

COUNTRIES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 AND IN 2008, WHILE

OTHERS BEGAN IMPLEMENTATION IN 2009. THE BASEL II RULES

THEREFORE ALREADY APPLY TO CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS IN

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO HAS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIO REQUIREMENTS. THE TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS

TIER 1 CAPITAL UNDER BASEL I DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE

TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR DISALLOWED GOODWILL

AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE

RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED THE

HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

GUIDELINES OR THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

MUST HAVE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE

THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION,

RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. AS OF DECEMBER 2009, OUR

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO UNDER BASEL I WAS 7.6%.

PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS

FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS BY OUR BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. THE

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A STATE-CHARTERED BANK

THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, SUCH AS GS BANK

USA OR OUR NATIONAL BANK TRUST COMPANY SUBSIDIARY, IS LIMITED TO

THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT

EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST.

UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF

THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR

YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED

WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS

THE BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF ITS CHARTERING AUTHORITY. UNDER

THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS

OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. NEW YORK LAW

IMPOSES SIMILAR LIMITATIONS ON NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANKS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2009, GS BANK USA COULD HAVE DECLARED

DIVIDENDS OF $3.30 BILLION TO GROUP INC. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THESE LIMITATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE BANKING REGULATORS HAVE AUTHORITY TO

PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS

OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

BANKING ORGANIZATION.

IT IS ALSO THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD THAT A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY GENERALLY ONLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK OUT

OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE PAST

YEAR AND ONLY IF THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS RETENTION

APPEARS CONSISTENT WITH THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL

NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE

CURRENT FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD HAS INDICATED THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD CAREFULLY

REVIEW THEIR DIVIDEND POLICY AND HAS DISCOURAGED DIVIDEND

PAY-OUT RATIOS THAT ARE AT THE 100% LEVEL UNLESS BOTH ASSET

QUALITY AND CAPITAL ARE VERY STRONG. A BANK HOLDING COMPANY ALSO

SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN A DIVIDEND LEVEL THAT PLACES UNDUE PRESSURE

ON THE CAPITAL OF BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, OR

THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO

SERVE AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR SUCH BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER TEMPORARY GUIDELINES IN EFFECT

FOR THE NEAR- TO

MEDIUM-TERM,

CERTAIN LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (INCLUDING GROUP INC.)

ARE REQUIRED TO

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSULT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BEFORE INCREASING

DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF GROUP INC.S

NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATORY

LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING OUR

BROKER-DEALER

AND OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

SOURCE OF

STRENGTH

UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, GROUP INC. IS EXPECTED

TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO GS BANK USA AND TO COMMIT

CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS SUBSIDIARY. SUCH

SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AT TIMES

WHEN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT. CAPITAL

LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS

ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN

OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A

BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE

BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE

CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY

TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE BHC ACT PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION

OF BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, THE

BHC ACT PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING

PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO

SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD

INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

CROSS-GUARANTEE

PROVISIONS

EACH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED (AS

DEFINED IN THE BHC ACT) BY THE SAME BANK HOLDING COMPANY CAN BE

HELD LIABLE TO THE U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED, OR REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE

INCURRED, BY THE FDIC DUE TO THE DEFAULT OF ANY OTHER INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY THAT HOLDING COMPANY AND

FOR ANY ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE FDIC TO ANY OF THOSE BANKS

THAT IS IN DANGER OF DEFAULT. SUCH A CROSS-GUARANTEE

CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES AGAINST THAT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. AT THIS TIME, WE

CONTROL ONLY ONE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR THIS

PURPOSE, NAMELY GS BANK USA. HOWEVER, IF, IN THE FUTURE, WE WERE

TO CONTROL OTHER INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH

CROSS-GUARANTEE WOULD APPLY TO ALL SUCH INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS.

COMPENSATION

PRACTICES

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD ISSUED A COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

POLICIES THAT APPLIES TO ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISED BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH

AS GROUP INC. THE PROPOSAL SETS FORTH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES

FOR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

HELP ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DO NOT ENCOURAGE

EXCESSIVE

RISK-TAKING

AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS. THE THREE PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT A BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD

PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT DO NOT ENCOURAGE

RISK-TAKING

BEYOND THE ORGANIZATIONS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY

AND MANAGE RISKS, BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS

AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AND BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE. THE PROPOSAL ALSO CONTEMPLATES A DETAILED REVIEW BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OF THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES

AND PRACTICES OF A NUMBER OF LARGE, COMPLEX BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING US. ANY DEFICIENCIES IN

COMPENSATION PRACTICES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED MAY BE INCORPORATED

INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS, WHICH CAN

AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER

ACTIONS. THE PROPOSAL PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE

TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS INCENTIVE

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED

RISK-MANAGEMENT

CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE

ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS

NOT TAKING PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CORRECT THE

DEFICIENCIES. THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS POLICIES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE CONTINUING

TO DEVELOP, AND WE EXPECT THAT THESE POLICIES WILL EVOLVE OVER A

NUMBER OF YEARS.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD,

ESTABLISHED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEADERS OF THE GROUP OF 20,

RELEASED STANDARDS FOR IMPLEMENTING CERTAIN COMPENSATION

PRINCIPLES FOR BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES DESIGNED TO

ENCOURAGE SOUND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THESE STANDARDS ARE TO

BE IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL REGULATORS. THUS FAR, REGULATORS IN A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE AND

GERMANY, HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED POLICIES RELATED TO

COMPENSATION AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE POLICIES ARE IN

ADDITION TO THE PROPOSALS MADE BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN

OCTOBER 2009. THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS PROPOSED A

NON-DEDUCTIBLE 50% TAX ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

RESPECT OF DISCRETIONARY BONUSES IN EXCESS OF £25,000

AWARDED UNDER ARRANGEMENTS MADE BETWEEN

DECEMBER 9, 2009 AND APRIL 5, 2010 TO

RELEVANT BANKING EMPLOYEES. SEPARATELY, THE FDIC HAS

SOLICITED COMMENTS ON WHETHER TO AMEND ITS

RISK-BASED

DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM TO POTENTIALLY INCREASE

ASSESSMENT RATES ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH COMPENSATION

PROGRAMS THAT PUT THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AT RISK.

FDIC TEMPORARY

LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM

GROUP INC. AND GS BANK USA PARTICIPATED IN THE FDICS

TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP), WHICH APPLIED TO,

AMONG OTHERS, ALL U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS INSURED BY

THE FDIC AND ALL U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, UNLESS THEY

OPTED OUT OF THE TLGP OR THE FDIC TERMINATED THEIR

PARTICIPATION. UNDER THE TLGP, THE FDIC GUARANTEES CERTAIN

SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT OF GROUP INC., AND, UNTIL

DECEMBER 31, 2009, GUARANTEED NONINTEREST-BEARING

TRANSACTION ACCOUNT DEPOSITS AT GS BANK USA, AND IN RETURN FOR

THESE GUARANTEES THE FDIC WAS PAID A FEE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF

THE DEPOSIT OR THE AMOUNT AND MATURITY OF THE DEBT. UNDER THE

DEBT GUARANTEE COMPONENT OF THE TLGP, THE FDIC WILL PAY THE

UNPAID PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON AN FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT

INSTRUMENT UPON THE UNCURED FAILURE OF THE PARTICIPATING ENTITY

TO MAKE A TIMELY PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE TERMS OF THE INSTRUMENT. WE HAVE NOT ISSUED

LONG-TERM

DEBT UNDER THE TLGP SINCE MARCH 2009, AND ALL OF OUR

PREVIOUSLY ISSUED DEBT UNDER THE TLGP WILL MATURE ON OR PRIOR TO

JUNE 15, 2012. THE DEBT GUARANTEE COMPONENT EXPIRED

WITH RESPECT TO NEW ISSUANCES BY US ON

OCTOBER 31, 2009. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010,

GS BANK USA IS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE TRANSACTION ACCOUNT

GUARANTEE COMPONENT OF THE TLGP. SEE MANAGEMENTS

GS BANK

USA

OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY, GS BANK USA, A

NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM AND THE FDIC, IS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD AND THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AND IS SUBJECT

TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS) ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES. A NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED PARTIALLY OR

ENTIRELY THROUGH GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING.

BANK LOAN TRADING AND ORIGINATION; INTEREST RATE, CREDIT,

CURRENCY AND OTHER DERIVATIVES; LEVERAGED FINANCE; COMMERCIAL

AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATION, TRADING AND SERVICING;

STRUCTURED FINANCE; AND AGENCY LENDING, CUSTODY AND HEDGE FUND

ADMINISTRATION SERVICES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE NEW YORK STATE

BANKING DEPARTMENT AND THE FDIC.

DEPOSIT

INSURANCE

GS BANK USA ACCEPTS DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS HAVE THE

BENEFIT OF FDIC INSURANCE UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE

FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, WHICH DEPEND ON THE RISK

CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION AND THE AMOUNT OF INSURED DEPOSITS

THAT IT HOLDS. THE FDIC REQUIRED US TO PREPAY OUR ESTIMATED

ASSESSMENTS FOR ALL OF 2010, 2011 AND 2012 ON

DECEMBER 30, 2009. THE FDIC MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE

THE ASSESSMENT RATE SCHEDULE ON A

SEMI-ANNUAL

BASIS. WE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE TLGP AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER

 FDIC TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE

PROGRAM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE U.S. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT

ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA), AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES THE FEDERAL

BANKING AGENCIES TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN

RESPECT OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET SPECIFIED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FDICIA ESTABLISHES FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES

FOR FDIC-INSURED BANKS: WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY

CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED

AND CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

GENERALLY DEEMED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED, THE HIGHEST

CATEGORY, IF IT HAS A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10% OR GREATER, A

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 6% OR GREATER AND A TIER 1

LEVERAGE RATIO OF 5% OR GREATER. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

NOVEMBER 2008 ASSET TRANSFER DESCRIBED UNDER

 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES BELOW, GS

BANK USA AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO MINIMUM

CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THESE WELL CAPITALIZED

LEVELS. ACCORDINGLY, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, GS BANK USA IS

EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8%,

A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 11% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE

RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%. AS OF DECEMBER 2009, GS BANK

USAS TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 14.9%, ITS TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIO WAS 19.3% AND ITS TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS

15.4%. GS BANK USA COMPUTES ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO

STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH ARE BASED ON BASEL I AS IMPLEMENTED BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AN INSTITUTION MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO,

OR DEEMED TO BE IN, A CAPITAL CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS

INDICATED BY ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IF IT IS DETERMINED TO BE IN AN

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY

EXAMINATION RATING WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS. FDICIA

IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON

OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, AS THE CAPITAL

CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION DECLINES. FAILURE TO MEET THE CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS COULD ALSO SUBJECT A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO

CAPITAL RAISING REQUIREMENTS. ULTIMATELY, CRITICALLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPOINTMENT OF

A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.

THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH

AS GROUP INC. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS

AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY

LEVEL, BASED UPON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING

COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES RELATING TO AN UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARY, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED

SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE

FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS

ON THAT GUARANTEE. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF THE BANKRUPTCY

OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, THE GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY

OVER THE PARENTS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS.

INSOLVENCY OF

AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUCH AS GS BANK USA, UPON ITS

INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER.



TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS;



TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR



TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS

DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMANCE OR

REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE

ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF DEPOSIT

LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A

PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST SUCH AN

INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE

INSTITUTION, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION

OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION BY ANY RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR

NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF GS

BANK USA, THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM,

AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE

DEPOSITORS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

TRANSACTIONS

WITH AFFILIATES

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND GROUP INC. AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD. THESE REGULATIONS LIMIT THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF

TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS TO AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM GS

BANK USA) THAT MAY TAKE PLACE AND GENERALLY REQUIRE THOSE

TRANSACTIONS TO BE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE REGULATIONS

GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IN NOVEMBER 2008, GROUP INC.

TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND OPERATIONS TO GS BANK USA. IN CONNECTION

WITH THIS TRANSFER, GROUP INC. ENTERED INTO A GUARANTEE

AGREEMENT WITH GS BANK USA WHEREBY GROUP INC. AGREED TO

(I) PURCHASE FROM GS BANK USA CERTAIN TRANSFERRED ASSETS

(OTHER THAN DERIVATIVES AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS) OR

REIMBURSE GS BANK USA FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATING TO THOSE

ASSETS; (II) REIMBURSE GS BANK USA FOR

CREDIT-RELATED

LOSSES FROM ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO GS BANK USA; AND

(III) PROTECT GS BANK USA OR REIMBURSE IT FOR CERTAIN

LOSSES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVES AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

TRANSFERRED TO GS BANK USA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

GUARANTEE AGREEMENT, AS OF DECEMBER 2009, GROUP INC.

IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PLEDGE APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION OF

COLLATERAL TO GS BANK USA.

TRUST COMPANIES

GROUP INC.S TWO LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST COMPANY

SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. THEY ARE NOT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. THE

FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESSES, BY THEIR NATURE, DO NOT PRODUCE PREDICTABLE

EARNINGS, AND ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THESE

CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, VERY

NEGATIVELY.

IN 2008 AND THROUGH EARLY 2009, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF

NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY.

THIS WAS INITIALLY TRIGGERED BY DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF

SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, BUT SPREAD TO ALL MORTGAGE AND REAL ESTATE

ASSET CLASSES, TO LEVERAGED BANK LOANS AND TO NEARLY ALL ASSET

CLASSES, INCLUDING EQUITIES. THE GLOBAL MARKETS DURING THIS

PERIOD WERE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED VOLATILITY

AND

SHORT-SELLING

AND AN OVERALL LOSS OF INVESTOR AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. THE

DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES CAUSED INCREASES IN MARGIN CALLS FOR

INVESTORS, REQUIREMENTS THAT DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTIES POST

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AND REDEMPTIONS BY MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUND

INVESTORS, ALL OF WHICH INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ASSET

VALUES AND OUTFLOWS OF CLIENT FUNDS ACROSS THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. WHILE THE MARKETS HAVE GENERALLY STABILIZED

AND IMPROVED SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, ASSET VALUES FOR

MANY ASSET CLASSES HAVE NOT RETURNED TO PREVIOUS LEVELS.

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY

UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, LENDING ACTIVITIES AND THE HOUSING MARKETS,

CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE EVENTS OF RECENT YEARS.

MARKET CONDITIONS LED TO THE FAILURE OR MERGER OF A NUMBER OF

PROMINENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FAILURES

OR NEAR-FAILURES RESULTED IN FURTHER LOSSES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF

DEFAULTS ON SECURITIES ISSUED BY THEM AND DEFAULTS UNDER

BILATERAL DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO WITH SUCH

ENTITIES AS COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHERMORE, DECLINING ASSET VALUES,

DEFAULTS ON MORTGAGES AND CONSUMER LOANS, AND THE LACK OF MARKET

AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS, COMBINED TO

INCREASE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP SPREADS, TO CAUSE RATING AGENCIES

TO LOWER CREDIT RATINGS, AND TO OTHERWISE INCREASE THE COST AND

DECREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY, DESPITE VERY SIGNIFICANT

DECLINES IN CENTRAL BANK BORROWING RATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT

ACTIONS.

BANKS AND OTHER LENDERS HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND

SOME HAVE BECOME RELUCTANT TO LEND, EVEN ON A SECURED BASIS, DUE

TO THE INCREASED RISK OF DEFAULT, THE IMPACT OF DECLINING ASSET

VALUES ON THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL AND THE IMPACT OF

RISKY ASSETS AND TRANSACTIONS ON CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, SOME FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

UNWILLING TO SELL ASSETS WHERE THE VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS ARE NOT

MARKED-TO-MARKET

AND WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD AT A LOSS BECAUSE THEY ARE WORTH

SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THEIR CURRENT BOOK VALUE. THE MARKETS

FOR SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS,

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS, WHICH FOR THE MOST

PART WERE CLOSED DURING 2008 AND THE BEGINNING OF 2009, HAVE

VERY RECENTLY BEGUN TO REOPEN.

SINCE 2008, GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE HAVE TAKEN NUMEROUS STEPS TO

INCREASE LIQUIDITY AND TO RESTORE INVESTOR AND PUBLIC

CONFIDENCE. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OR PROPOSED TO DEAL WITH

WHAT REGULATORS, POLITICIANS AND OTHERS BELIEVE TO BE THE ROOT

CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMPENSATION

PRACTICES, PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF

ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO

ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS

WELL AS PROPOSALS CALLING FOR INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND

COORDINATION WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND

MARKETS. IT IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR WHICH OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL

BE ADOPTED AND IN WHAT FORM AND WHETHER THE NET EFFECT OF SUCH

PROPOSALS WILL IN FACT BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE FOR THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS OVER EITHER THE SHORT OR

LONG-TERM.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2009, THE ECONOMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND

JAPAN EXPERIENCED A RECESSION. BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS A WIDE

RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED AND

MANY COMPANIES WERE, AND SOME CONTINUE TO BE, IN SERIOUS

DIFFICULTY DUE TO REDUCED CONSUMER SPENDING AND LOW LEVELS OF

LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

ARE FACING DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS DUE TO SIGNIFICANT

REDUCTIONS IN TAX REVENUES, PARTICULARLY FROM CORPORATE AND

PERSONAL INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS INCREASED OUTLAYS FOR

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DUE TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE

COST OF STIMULUS PROGRAMS.

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY, GENERAL

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMIC AND MARKET ACTIVITIES AND A LACK OF

CONSUMER, INVESTOR AND CEO CONFIDENCE HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT BANKING,

MERCHANT BANKING, ASSET MANAGEMENT, LEVERAGED LENDING AND EQUITY

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESSES.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

HIGH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID

AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS, LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND STRONG

BUSINESS EARNINGS. UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS CAN BE CAUSED BY: DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH,

BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE;

LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF

CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES,

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC

COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL

INSTABILITY; CORPORATE, POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR

PANDEMICS; OR A COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS.

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT BECAME GENERALLY MORE FAVORABLE AFTER

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THESE CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEAR OR LONG TERM. IF THEY

DO NOT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET

VALUES.

MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES,

OUR MORTGAGES, LEVERAGED LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS BUSINESSES IN

OUR FICC SEGMENT, AND OUR EQUITY PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESS,

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS,

DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY) AND

MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO

FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR

EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES, COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN TRADING

POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS

CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES. BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF

THESE INVESTING AND TRADING POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND

IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY

HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND

PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY

TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY

NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY

REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE

ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING

MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR

EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY REQUIRE

US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.

IN OUR EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES, WE ARE OBLIGATED BY STOCK EXCHANGE RULES TO MAINTAIN

AN ORDERLY MARKET, INCLUDING BY PURCHASING SHARES IN A DECLINING

MARKET. IN MARKETS WHERE ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING AND IN

VOLATILE MARKETS, THIS RESULTS IN TRADING LOSSES AND AN

INCREASED NEED FOR LIQUIDITY.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RECEIVE

ASSET-BASED

MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME

CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN

TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS.

WE POST COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT OUR OBLIGATIONS AND RECEIVE

COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. WHEN

THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS POSTED AS COLLATERAL DECLINES, THE PARTY

POSTING THE COLLATERAL MAY NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

OR, IF POSSIBLE, REDUCE ITS TRADING POSITION. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

OF SUCH A SITUATION IS A MARGIN CALL IN CONNECTION

WITH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THEREFORE, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF

ASSET CLASSES USED AS COLLATERAL MEAN THAT EITHER THE COST OF

FUNDING TRADING POSITIONS IS INCREASED OR THE SIZE OF TRADING

POSITIONS IS DECREASED. IF WE ARE THE PARTY PROVIDING COLLATERAL

THIS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND IF

WE ARE THE PARTY RECEIVING COLLATERAL THIS CAN ALSO REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY BY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS DONE WITH OUR

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION, VOLATILE OR LESS LIQUID

MARKETS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF VALUING ASSETS WHICH CAN LEAD

TO COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING DISPUTES OVER ASSET VALUES AND THE

LEVEL OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS INCREASED CREDIT RISK

TO THE RECIPIENT OF THE COLLATERAL DUE TO DELAYS IN RECEIVING

ADEQUATE COLLATERAL.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND HIGHER

COSTS OF OBTAINING CREDIT.

WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR

ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO

IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY

ISSUING

LONG-TERM

DEBT, PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER, BY ACCEPTING

DEPOSITS AT OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR

LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A

SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND

MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR

AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF

FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING

AND TAKING PRINCIPAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET MAKING.

OUR CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON

ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE

THEIR TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED

COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING

OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION

TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE

TRANSACTIONS  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

DUE SOLELY TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, AS THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WE HOLD OR

ISSUE.

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF MARKET

VOLATILITY.

CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED

VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS,

ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY VAR AND MAY EXPOSE US TO

INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

THESE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING

THE SIZE OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS AND INVESTING BUSINESSES CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY, EVEN THOUGH SPREADS ARE WIDENING AND WE MAY EARN

MORE ON EACH TRADE. IN PERIODS WHEN VOLATILITY IS INCREASING,

BUT ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MAY NOT BE

POSSIBLE TO SELL ASSETS AT ALL OR IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO DO

SO AT STEEP DISCOUNTS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY BE FORCED TO

EITHER TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RISK OR TO INCUR LOSSES IN ORDER TO

DECREASE OUR VAR. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN VOLATILITY INCREASE

THE LEVEL OF OUR RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS AND INCREASE OUR CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS WHICH IN TURN INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS.

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG

INVESTORS AND CEOS DUE TO GENERAL DECLINES IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL OR MARKET

CONDITIONS.

OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO

CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN PARTICULAR,

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR GENERAL DECLINES

IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY AFFECT OUR TRADING BUSINESSES

BY DECREASING LEVELS OF OVERALL ACTIVITY OR BY DECREASING

VOLATILITY, BUT AT OTHER TIMES MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN

DECLINING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TRADING VOLUMES

OR HIGHER SPREADS OR BOTH.

MARKET UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

AS WELL AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO

TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR

THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED NET REVENUES,

PRINCIPALLY IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT

CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY INVEST THEM IN

PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.

OUR INVESTING

BUSINESSES MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF

OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

POOR INVESTMENT RETURNS IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, DUE TO

EITHER GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (AGAINST

THE PERFORMANCE OF BENCHMARKS OR OF OUR COMPETITORS) BY FUNDS OR

ACCOUNTS THAT WE MANAGE OR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN OR

SELL, AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS.

THIS COULD AFFECT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES THAT

WE EARN ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE

EARN FOR SELLING OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED

NOTES OR DERIVATIVES.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO CERTAIN OF OUR

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN DIFFICULT MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND, AT

OUR DISCRETION, WE MAY DECIDE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE FOR

REPUTATIONAL OR BUSINESS REASONS, INCLUDING THROUGH EQUITY

INVESTMENTS OR CASH INFUSIONS.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND

STRATEGIES.

WE SEEK TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH A RISK

AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF SEPARATE BUT

COMPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND

LEGAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, MANAGEMENT REVIEW

PROCESSES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS SEEKS TO BALANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM TRADING

POSITIONS WITH OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WHILE WE EMPLOY

A BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED SET OF RISK MONITORING AND RISK

MITIGATION TECHNIQUES, THOSE TECHNIQUES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT

ACCOMPANY THEIR APPLICATION CANNOT ANTICIPATE EVERY ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFICS AND TIMING OF SUCH OUTCOMES.

THUS, WE MAY, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCUR LOSSES.

CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008 AND EARLY 2009,

PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR

CONVERSELY PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MOVE IN

DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THESE TYPES OF MARKET MOVEMENTS HAVE AT

TIMES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND

HAVE CAUSED US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, AND THEY MAY DO SO

IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES IN CORRELATION CAN BE EXACERBATED

WHERE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE USING RISK OR TRADING MODELS

WITH ASSUMPTIONS OR ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. IN

THESE AND OTHER CASES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE OUR RISK

POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR

WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS, INCLUDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

ASSET VALUES ARE DECLINING SIGNIFICANTLY OR NO MARKET EXISTS FOR

CERTAIN ASSETS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAKE INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY

THROUGH VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SECURITIES, INCLUDING

PRIVATE EQUITY, THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED LIQUID TRADING

MARKET OR ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR

HEDGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS AND

THEREFORE REDUCE OUR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS. IN

ADDITION, WE INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL IN OUR MERCHANT BANKING,

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS, AND LIMITATIONS

ON OUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN

THESE FUNDS, WHETHER FOR LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER REASONS,

MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTROL THE RISK EXPOSURES

RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RISK MANAGEMENT IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON

OUR LIQUIDITY,

PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN

INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS OR TO SELL ASSETS

OR BY A REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR BY AN INCREASE IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE

IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR

INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY

THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO

WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED

PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS

TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES

MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD

RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE

SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO

OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION,

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE

SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL,

INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER

IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR COST OF OBTAINING

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES) OF THE SAME MATURITY

THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR

CREDIT SPREADS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COST OF THIS

FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS,

MARKET-DRIVEN,

AND SUBJECT AT TIMES TO UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE

MOVEMENTS. CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS

OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CREDIT SPREADS MAY BE

INFLUENCED BY MOVEMENTS IN THE COSTS TO PURCHASERS OF CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO OUR

LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE MARKET FOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS IS RELATIVELY NEW,

ALTHOUGH VERY LARGE, AND IT HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE

AND CURRENTLY LACKS A HIGH DEGREE OF STRUCTURE OR TRANSPARENCY.

GROUP INC.

IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND IS DEPENDENT FOR LIQUIDITY ON PAYMENTS

FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS.

GROUP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PAYMENTS FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND TO FUND ALL PAYMENTS

ON ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR

BROKER-DEALER,

BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT

RESTRICT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO

BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO

GROUP INC. IN ADDITION, OUR

BROKER-DEALER,

BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON

THEIR ABILITY TO LEND OR TRANSACT WITH AFFILIATES AND TO MINIMUM

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS RESTRICTIONS ON

THEIR ABILITY TO USE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THEM IN BROKERAGE OR

BANK ACCOUNTS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS

ON RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

AND ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS ON DEPOSIT IN

BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS LOWER EARNINGS, CAN

REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF

GROUP INC. AND EVEN REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. RESTRICTIONS OR

REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT

GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION,

GROUP INC.S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A DISTRIBUTION OF

ASSETS UPON A SUBSIDIARYS LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION IS

SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF THE SUBSIDIARYS CREDITORS.

FURTHERMORE, GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT

OBLIGATIONS OF GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED SIGNIFICANT

ASSETS TO GS BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS BANK USA. IN

ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF

ITS OTHER CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A

TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION

BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY

REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS

TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A

TIME WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS

OWN OBLIGATIONS. SEE BUSINESS  REGULATION

IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OUR

BUSINESSES, PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, OR DEFAULTS

BY, THIRD PARTIES WHO OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS

OR WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY,

SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER

REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN

CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD

PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN

ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSETS. THE TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND THE FORECLOSURE ON

COLLATERAL MAY SUBJECT US TO CLAIMS FOR THE IMPROPER EXERCISE OF

OUR RIGHTS. DEFAULT RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH

COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE

SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

AS PART OF OUR CLEARING BUSINESS, WE FINANCE OUR CLIENT

POSITIONS, AND WE COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFAULTS OR

MISCONDUCT OF OUR CLIENTS. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT

EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC

INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT

CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT OR FORESEE.

CONCENTRATION

OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO

THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

TRADING, INVESTING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND SIZE

OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

GIVEN PERIOD. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION OF RISK, WE MAY

SUFFER LOSSES EVEN WHEN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR OUR COMPETITORS. DISRUPTIONS IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HEDGE THESE CREDIT

EXPOSURES EFFECTIVELY OR ECONOMICALLY. IN ADDITION, WE EXTEND

LARGE COMMITMENTS AS PART OF OUR CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES.

OUR INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK BY SELLING, SYNDICATING

OR SECURITIZING THESE POSITIONS, INCLUDING DURING PERIODS OF

MARKET STRESS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POSITIONS, INCLUDING

DUE TO THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER, AS WELL AS

THE LOSS OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING SUCH SECURITIES OR

LOANS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY,

BORROWER OR ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, AND A FAILURE

OR DOWNGRADE OF, OR DEFAULT BY, SUCH ENTITY COULD NEGATIVELY

IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND THE SYSTEMS BY

WHICH WE SET LIMITS AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE

TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES MAY NOT

FUNCTION AS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED. WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US

TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY

EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS,

COMMERCIAL BANKS, CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT

FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION

WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY. TO THE EXTENT REGULATORY OR

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS LEAD TO AN INCREASED CENTRALIZATION OF

TRADING ACTIVITY THROUGH PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL

AGENTS OR EXCHANGES, THIS MAY INCREASE OUR CONCENTRATION OF RISK

WITH RESPECT TO THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY  AND ALL OF OUR

BUSINESSES  ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO REMAIN SO. WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION EXECUTION, OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, CREDITWORTHINESS AND PRICE.

OVER TIME, THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CONSOLIDATION AND

CONVERGENCE AMONG COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THIS TREND ACCELERATED OVER RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS

MERGERS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AMONG INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS. THIS

TREND HAS ALSO HASTENED THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE SECURITIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD TO

COMMIT CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO

EXECUTE LARGE GLOBAL TRANSACTIONS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO

NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE WILL FACE

COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

IN THE RELEVANT MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO EXPAND. GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD

VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CERTAIN

OF OUR BUSINESSES IN A

COST-EFFECTIVE

MANNER OR AT ALL, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS

ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND

PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT

APPLY TO ALL OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN OUR INVESTMENT

BANKING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, HAVE

CONTINUED TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS MAY SEEK TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING

PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND

OTHER ASSIGNMENTS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRESSURE TO EXTEND AND

PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY COMPENSATE US

FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE.

WE FACE

ENHANCED RISKS AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES LEAD US TO TRANSACT

WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND EXPOSE US

TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

A NUMBER OF OUR RECENT AND PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESSES MAY BRING US INTO CONTACT,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE

NOT WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY BASE AND

EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS. THESE BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO NEW AND ENHANCED RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, REPUTATIONAL

CONCERNS ARISING FROM DEALING WITH LESS SOPHISTICATED

COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS, GREATER REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, INCREASED

CREDIT-RELATED,

SOVEREIGN AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, RISKS ARISING FROM ACCIDENTS OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS WITH THE MANNER IN

WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE BEING OPERATED OR HELD.

DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS AND DELAYED SETTLEMENTS MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED

RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVES. MANY OF THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND

NON-STANDARDIZED,

WHICH CAN MAKE EXITING, TRANSFERRING OR SETTLING POSITIONS

DIFFICULT. MANY CREDIT DERIVATIVES REQUIRE THAT WE DELIVER TO

THE COUNTERPARTY THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER

OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, WE

DO NOT HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR OTHER OBLIGATION

AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN, THE UNDERLYING SECURITY, LOAN OR

OTHER OBLIGATION. THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT THE PAYMENTS

DUE TO US UNDER THESE CONTRACTS OR RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS

WITH THE ATTENDANT CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AS WELL AS

INCREASED COSTS TO THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING SECONDARY

BANK LOAN PURCHASES AND SALES, ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES

ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES OR SETTLED ON A

TIMELY BASIS. WHILE THE TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED OR

DURING ANY DELAY IN SETTLEMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT MAY

FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, AS

NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, COVERING A

WIDER ARRAY OF UNDERLYING CREDIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS, DISPUTES

ABOUT THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH

COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK

EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS.

ANY REGULATORY EFFORT TO CREATE AN EXCHANGE OR TRADING PLATFORM

FOR CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, OR A

MARKET SHIFT TOWARD STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES, COULD REDUCE THE

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS, BUT UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP

DERIVATIVES THAT BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS AND

OURSELVES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SUCH PLATFORM.

OUR BUSINESSES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS AND EFFORTS

OF HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY

TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES, TO MANAGE OUR

BUSINESSES EFFECTIVELY AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESSES AND

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES

AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. COMPETITION

FROM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES

OUTSIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES

HAS OFTEN BEEN INTENSE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN

EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE WE ARE OFTEN COMPETING FOR QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

PRESENCE OR MORE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE REGION.

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN BUSINESS 

REGULATION  BANKING REGULATION 

COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K,

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY, AND THE

STANDARDS OF, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL

AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON

COMPENSATION PRACTICES (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR

COMPETITORS) BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC OR OTHER

REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPOSED

BY OR AS A RESULT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION OR THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS PROPOSAL ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

POLICIES, MAY REQUIRE US TO ALTER OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES IN

WAYS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPENSATION OF

EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING

NON-EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS, IN A MANNER THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTS IN THE

IDENTITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES AND THEIR COMPENSATION BEING MADE

PUBLIC. ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EMPLOYEE

COMPENSATION MAY ALSO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESSES

AND THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND PERVASIVE

REGULATION AROUND THE WORLD.

AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE FACE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERVENTION BY REGULATORY AND TAXING AUTHORITIES IN ALL

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES. AMONG OTHER

THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME

OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS

ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY

HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH

THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. IN

ADDITION, RECENT MARKET DISRUPTIONS HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS

PROPOSALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FOR CHANGES

IN THE REGULATION AND TAXATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING INCREASED CAPITAL OR NEW LIQUIDITY OR

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES

IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESSES OR THOSE OF OUR CLIENTS, INCLUDING TAX BURDENS AND

COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS, COULD BE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET

OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (EITHER BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES,

GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY.

THE IMPACT OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY

IN THE AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT UNECONOMIC FOR US

TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS, OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING

OUR BUSINESSES, MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR

EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING

CAPITAL IN A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS

OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENSIVE REGULATION TO WHICH OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, SEE BUSINESS 

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

WE MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY

SCRUTINY OR NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS, LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO

COMPENSATION, OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OUR PAST ACTIONS AND OTHER

MATTERS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND PUBLIC

SENTIMENT REGARDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS RESULTED IN A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE, AS WELL AS ADVERSE

STATEMENTS OR CHARGES BY REGULATORS OR ELECTED OFFICIALS. PRESS

COVERAGE AND OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT ASSERT SOME FORM OF

WRONGDOING, REGARDLESS OF THE FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE ASSERTIONS

BEING MADE, OFTEN RESULTS IN SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BY

REGULATORS,

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGISLATORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OR IN LAWSUITS.

RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, REGARDLESS OF

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE PROCEEDING, IS TIME CONSUMING AND

EXPENSIVE AND CAN DIVERT THE TIME AND EFFORT OF OUR SENIOR

MANAGEMENT FROM OUR BUSINESS. PENALTIES AND FINES SOUGHT BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY

IN RECENT YEARS TO COMMENCE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR TO ADVANCE OR

SUPPORT LEGISLATION TARGETED AT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY AND LEGAL AND

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR

REPUTATION AND ON THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

A FAILURE IN

OUR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THOSE OF THIRD

PARTIES, COULD IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPT OUR BUSINESSES,

RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND CAUSE LOSSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS

AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS

AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO

CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS

WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. AS OUR CLIENT BASE AND

OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REACH EXPANDS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING OUR

OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY

CHALLENGING. OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING OR OTHER

OPERATING SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES MAY FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY OR

BECOME DISABLED AS A RESULT OF EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS A SPIKE IN TRANSACTION

VOLUME, ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE

TRANSACTIONS OR PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY

UPDATE THESE SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND GROWTH. THIS

UPDATING ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND CREATES RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING THEM WITH EXISTING

ONES.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE,

TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF ANY OF THE CLEARING

AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES WE USE TO FACILITATE OUR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS,

AND AS OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CLIENTS GROWS, WE

INCREASINGLY FACE THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT

TO OUR CLIENTS SYSTEMS. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN

SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION AMONG CLEARING AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND

CLEARING HOUSES, WHICH HAS INCREASED OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL

FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PARTICULAR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT WE USE AND COULD AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO FIND ADEQUATE AND

COST-EFFECTIVE

ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR

CONSTRAINT. INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET

PARTICIPANTS OR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF

OPERATIONAL FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE

INTEGRATED, OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES,

AND THE INCREASED CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES UNDER PROPOSED

AND POTENTIAL REGULATION, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL

FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS. ANY SUCH FAILURE, TERMINATION OR CONSTRAINT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT TRANSACTIONS,

SERVICE OUR CLIENTS, MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO RISK OR EXPAND OUR

BUSINESSES OR RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR LIABILITY TO OUR

CLIENTS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, DISRUPTION OF OUR

BUSINESSES, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE,

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A

DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESSES

AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY INCLUDE A

DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET,

TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD PARTIES

WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY OCCUR AS A

RESULT OF EVENTS THAT AFFECT ONLY OUR BUILDINGS OR THE BUILDINGS

OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, OR AS A RESULT OF EVENTS WITH A BROADER

IMPACT GLOBALLY, REGIONALLY OR IN THE CITIES WHERE THOSE

BUILDINGS ARE LOCATED.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEARLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS, INCLUDING

THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA, LONDON, FRANKFURT, HONG KONG,

TOKYO AND BANGALORE, WORK IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, IN

ONE OR MORE BUILDINGS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN

BUSINESS CONTINUITY, GIVEN THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE LARGEST

CONCENTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN

AREA, DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY AND LONGEVITY OF THE EVENT, A

CATASTROPHIC EVENT IMPACTING OUR NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA

OFFICES COULD VERY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IF A

DISRUPTION OCCURS IN ONE LOCATION AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT

LOCATION ARE UNABLE TO OCCUPY OUR OFFICES OR COMMUNICATE WITH OR

TRAVEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AND INTERACT

WITH OUR CLIENTS MAY SUFFER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT DEPEND ON

COMMUNICATION OR TRAVEL.

OUR OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE

MEASURES AND ENDEAVOR TO MODIFY THEM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MISUSE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS

CODE AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT. IF ONE

OR MORE OF SUCH EVENTS OCCUR, THIS POTENTIALLY COULD JEOPARDIZE

OUR OR OUR CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES CONFIDENTIAL

AND OTHER INFORMATION PROCESSED AND STORED IN, AND TRANSMITTED

THROUGH, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE

INTERRUPTIONS OR MALFUNCTIONS IN OUR, OUR CLIENTS, OUR

COUNTERPARTIES OR THIRD PARTIES OPERATIONS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MODIFY OUR PROTECTIVE MEASURES OR TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE

VULNERABILITIES OR OTHER EXPOSURES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION AND FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE EITHER NOT INSURED

AGAINST OR NOT FULLY COVERED THROUGH ANY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY

US.

WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WE

HAVE DISCUSSED AND WORKED WITH CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE

PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP

SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND MAY BE

UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE, SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF OUR

CLIENTS, VENDORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER

THIRD PARTIES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THESE THIRD

PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION. AN INTERCEPTION, MISUSE OR

MISHANDLING OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

BEING SENT TO OR RECEIVED FROM A CLIENT, VENDOR, SERVICE

PROVIDER, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY COULD RESULT IN

LEGAL LIABILITY, REGULATORY ACTION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST ARE INCREASING AND A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY

AND DEAL WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

AS WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR CLIENT

BASE, WE INCREASINGLY MUST ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SERVICES TO A

PARTICULAR CLIENT OR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS OR OTHER INTERESTS

CONFLICT, OR ARE PERCEIVED TO CONFLICT, WITH THE INTERESTS OF

ANOTHER CLIENT, AS WELL AS SITUATIONS WHERE ONE OR MORE OF OUR

BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC

INFORMATION THAT MAY NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN

THE FIRM AND SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY BE A CREDITOR OF AN ENTITY

WITH WHICH WE ALSO HAVE AN ADVISORY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP. IN

ADDITION, OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBJECTS US TO

HEIGHTENED REGULATION AND INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS

BANK USA AND ENTITIES THAT ARE OR COULD BE SEEN AS AFFILIATES OF

OURS.

WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THOSE

DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IMPROPER SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG

OUR BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING AND DEALING

WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT, AND OUR

REPUTATION, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS, COULD BE

DAMAGED AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SUCH A CONFLICT MIGHT ARISE MAY BE

AFFECTED IF WE FAIL, OR APPEAR TO FAIL, TO IDENTIFY AND DEAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBSTANTIAL

LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US

COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OR CAUSE US

SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY

HARM OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HIGH. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS

AND CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS INCREASE IN PERIODS WHEN WE HAVE

REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.

THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CASES INVOLVING

FRAUD OR OTHER MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WE RUN THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT COULD OCCUR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DETER OR

PREVENT EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND THE PRECAUTIONS WE TAKE TO

PREVENT AND DETECT THIS ACTIVITY HAVE NOT BEEN AND MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE IN ALL CASES.

THE GROWTH OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TRADING

TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND MAY INCREASE

COMPETITION.

TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY. THE

GROWTH OF ELECTRONIC TRADING AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESSES AND PRESENTING US WITH

NEW CHALLENGES. SECURITIES, FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY OCCURRING ELECTRONICALLY, BOTH ON OUR OWN SYSTEMS

AND THROUGH OTHER ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS, AND IT APPEARS

THAT THE TREND TOWARD ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE

AND PROBABLY ACCELERATE. SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE TRADING

SYSTEMS COMPETE WITH OUR TRADING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONTINUED COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED

USE BY OUR CLIENTS OF

LOW-COST

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND DIRECT ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO

TRADING MARKETS COULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS AND

SPREADS. AS OUR CLIENTS INCREASINGLY USE OUR SYSTEMS TO TRADE

DIRECTLY IN THE MARKETS, WE MAY INCUR LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF

THEIR USE OF OUR ORDER ROUTING AND EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE

HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THESE

SYSTEMS WILL YIELD AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT,

PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOWER COMMISSIONS ARISING FROM

ELECTRONIC TRADES.

OUR

COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY OUR POWER GENERATION

INTERESTS AND OUR PHYSICAL COMMODITIES BUSINESSES, SUBJECT US TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL, REPUTATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT MAY EXPOSE US

TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

WE ENGAGE IN, OR INVEST IN ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN, THE

PRODUCTION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING AND TRADING OF

NUMEROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL

GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, METALS

(BASE AND PRECIOUS), MINERALS (INCLUDING URANIUM), EMISSION

CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND RELATED

PRODUCTS AND INDICES. THESE ACTIVITIES SUBJECT US TO EXTENSIVE

AND EVOLVING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHERS,

AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY, WASTE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION OF

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, NATURAL RESOURCES, SITE REMEDIATION AND

HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, RISING CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS

CAN LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THAT MAY INCREASE THE

OPERATING COSTS AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR

FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED

BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES

AND WHOLESALE SALES AND TRADING OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE US TO

COMMIT SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,

INSTALLATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, RENOVATION OF

STORAGE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACILITIES OR TRANSPORT VESSELS, PAYMENT OF EMISSION FEES AND

CARBON OR OTHER TAXES, AND APPLICATION FOR, AND HOLDING OF,

PERMITS AND LICENSES. OUR COMMODITIES-RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE

ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING BREAKDOWN OR

FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES,

TRANSPORT VESSELS, STORAGE FACILITIES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR

PROCESSES OR OTHER MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS, FIRES, LEAKS, SPILLS

OR RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, PERFORMANCE BELOW EXPECTED

LEVELS OF OUTPUT OR EFFICIENCY, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL

DISASTERS OR OTHER HOSTILE OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION,

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM

THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ANY FAILURE ON THEIR PART,

INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT REASONABLE

PRICES OR TO SAFELY TRANSPORT OR STORE COMMODITIES COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE

TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO COVER SOME OF THESE RISKS AND THE

INSURANCE THAT WE HAVE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LOSSES.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF SUCH EVENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM

PERFORMING UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS, MAY IMPAIR OUR

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION,

REGULATORY ACTION, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY OR OTHER REPUTATIONAL HARM.

IN CONDUCTING

OUR BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT

IN OPERATING IN MANY COUNTRIES.

IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES AND MAINTAINING AND SUPPORTING OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF POSSIBLE

NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL

CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO THE SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES

AND MANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED ARE

UNCERTAIN AND EVOLVING, AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAWS IN EVERY MARKET.

ANY DETERMINATION BY LOCAL REGULATORS THAT WE HAVE NOT ACTED IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET OR OUR FAILURE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

WITH LOCAL REGULATORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE

EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR

REPUTATION GENERALLY. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ENHANCED RISK

THAT TRANSACTIONS WE STRUCTURE MIGHT NOT BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

IN ALL CASES.

OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPANDING INTO

NEW REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS,

AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. VARIOUS EMERGING MARKET

COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR

CURRENCIES, DEFAULTS OR THREATENED DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT,

CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND LOW OR NEGATIVE

GROWTH RATES IN THEIR ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS MILITARY ACTIVITY OR

ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE

CONDITIONS INCLUDE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND

INCREASED VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

WE MAY INCUR

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR

NATURAL DISASTERS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING

THE EMERGENCE OF A PANDEMIC OR OTHER WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY

(OR CONCERNS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY),

TERRORIST ATTACKS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD CREATE ECONOMIC

AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, COULD LEAD TO OPERATIONAL

DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL LIMITATIONS) THAT COULD IMPAIR

OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES, AND COULD EXPOSE OUR

INSURANCE BUSINESSES TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

ON MARCH 21, 2000, WE

ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A REPURCHASE

PROGRAM, PURSUANT TO WHICH UP TO 15 MILLION SHARES OF OUR

COMMON STOCK MAY BE REPURCHASED. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS

INCREASED BY AN AGGREGATE OF 280 MILLION SHARES BY

USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET

INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION.

THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR

OPEN-MARKET

PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED

PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITIONS

(I.E., COMPARISONS OF OUR DESIRED LEVEL OF CAPITAL TO OUR

ACTUAL LEVEL OF CAPITAL) BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING

VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS. THE

TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS

60,837,406 SHARES AS OF FEBRUARY 12, 2010; THE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO SET EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION DATE.

SINCE JULY 2008, WE HAVE NOT REPURCHASED SHARES OF OUR

COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET OTHER THAN REPURCHASES OF THE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXECUTIVE

OVERVIEW

OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $22.13 FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $4.47 FOR THE

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 28, 2008. RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

(ROE)

(1)

WAS 22.5% FOR 2009. NET REVENUES FOR 2009 WERE

$45.17 BILLION, MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT IN 2008. OUR

RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES FOR 2009 WAS

35.8% AND REPRESENTED OUR LOWEST ANNUAL RATIO OF COMPENSATION

AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES. IN ADDITION, COMPENSATION WAS

REDUCED BY $500 MILLION TO FUND A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION

TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND. THIS

CONTRIBUTION OF $500 MILLION WAS PART OF TOTAL COMMITMENTS

TO CHARITABLE AND SMALL BUSINESS INITIATIVES DURING THE YEAR IN

EXCESS OF $1 BILLION. DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009, BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE

INCREASED 23% TO $117.48 AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON

SHARE

(2)

INCREASED 27% TO $108.42. DURING THE YEAR, THE FIRM REPURCHASED

THE PREFERRED STOCK AND ASSOCIATED WARRANT THAT WERE ISSUED TO

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (U.S. TREASURY)

PURSUANT TO THE U.S. TREASURYS TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE

PROGRAM. THE FIRMS CUMULATIVE PAYMENTS TO THE

U.S. TREASURY RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM TOTALED

$11.42 BILLION, INCLUDING THE RETURN OF THE

U.S. TREASURYS $10.0 BILLION INVESTMENT,

$318 MILLION IN PREFERRED DIVIDENDS AND $1.1 BILLION

RELATED TO THE WARRANT REPURCHASE. IN ADDITION, IN 2009 THE FIRM

COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK FOR PROCEEDS OF

$5.75 BILLION. OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO UNDER BASEL

I

(3)

WAS 15.0% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND OUR TIER 1

COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL

I

(3)

WAS 12.2% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

NET REVENUES IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS WERE

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2008, REFLECTING A VERY

STRONG PERFORMANCE IN FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES

(FICC) AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS HIGHER NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES. DURING

2009, FICC OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN MORE LIQUID PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, ASSET VALUES GENERALLY IMPROVED AND CORPORATE CREDIT

SPREADS TIGHTENED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR MOST OF THE YEAR. NET

REVENUES IN FICC WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2008,

REFLECTING PARTICULARLY STRONG PERFORMANCES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS,

MORTGAGES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, WHICH WERE EACH

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN 2008. NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES WERE

ALSO PARTICULARLY STRONG AND WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 2008,

WHILE NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES WERE STRONG, BUT LOWER THAN A

PARTICULARLY STRONG 2008. DURING 2009, MORTGAGES INCLUDED A LOSS

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION (EXCLUDING HEDGES) ON

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. RESULTS IN 2008 WERE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY ASSET WRITEDOWNS ACROSS

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE DEBT, PRIVATE AND

PUBLIC EQUITIES, AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

AND SECURITIES. THE INCREASE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED

GAINS ON CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND OUR INVESTMENT IN

THE ORDINARY SHARES OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA

LIMITED (ICBC) COMPARED WITH NET LOSSES IN 2008. IN 2009,

RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDED A GAIN OF

$1.58 BILLION RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC, A GAIN OF $1.31 BILLION FROM CORPORATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND A LOSS OF $1.76 BILLION FROM REAL

ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES FOR 2009

REFLECTED STRONG RESULTS IN THE CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES.

HOWEVER,

(1)

ROE

IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS BY AVERAGE MONTHLY COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY. SEE

 RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW BELOW FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CALCULATION OF ROE.

(2)

TANGIBLE

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY EQUALS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY LESS PREFERRED STOCK, GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE IS

COMPUTED BY DIVIDING TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

BY THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, INCLUDING RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS (RSUS) GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WITH NO FUTURE SERVICE

REQUIREMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE MEASURES THAT WE

AND INVESTORS USE TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. SEE

AS

A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED

WE ARE REPORTING OUR TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIOS CALCULATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY

APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION

(BASEL I). THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO EQUALS TIER 1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTS IN THE CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES WERE LOWER THAN A

STRONG 2008 AND INCLUDED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMMISSIONS.

RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES WERE POSITIVE COMPARED WITH

LOSSES IN 2008. DURING 2009, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

CHARACTERIZED BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES,

FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

VOLATILITY LEVELS.

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2008, REFLECTING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN SECURITIES SERVICES, AS WELL

AS LOWER NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT. THE DECREASE IN

SECURITIES SERVICES PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF LOWER

CUSTOMER BALANCES, REFLECTING LOWER HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY ASSETS

AND REDUCED LEVERAGE. THE DECREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF ASSETS

MANAGED, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO EQUITY MARKET DEPRECIATION DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, AS WELL AS LOWER INCENTIVE FEES.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT INCREASED $73 BILLION TO $871 BILLION, DUE

TO $76 BILLION OF MARKET APPRECIATION, PRIMARILY IN FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3 BILLION OF

NET OUTFLOWS. OUTFLOWS IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS WERE OFFSET BY

INFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME ASSETS.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2008,

REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL

ADVISORY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY

REFLECTED A DECLINE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING

REFLECTED HIGHER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED

OFFERINGS. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER

THAN IN 2008. OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. DURING 2009, THE ECONOMIES OF

THE U.S., EUROPE AND JAPAN EXPERIENCED A RECESSION. BUSINESS

ACTIVITY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS WAS

GREATLY REDUCED, REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN CONSUMER SPENDING AND

LOW LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY ACROSS CREDIT MARKETS. IN ADDITION,

UNEMPLOYMENT CONTINUED TO RISE IN 2009. HOWEVER, ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS BECAME GENERALLY MORE FAVORABLE DURING THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR AS REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH

TURNED POSITIVE IN MOST MAJOR ECONOMIES AND GROWTH IN EMERGING

MARKETS IMPROVED. IN ADDITION, EQUITY AND CREDIT MARKETS WERE

CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASING ASSET PRICES, LOWER VOLATILITY AND

IMPROVED LIQUIDITY DURING THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF THE YEAR. FOR

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES, SEE

 CERTAIN

RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES BELOW AS WELL

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2009 IS SET

FORTH BELOW.

GLOBAL.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WEAKENED DURING

2009, AS EVIDENCED BY DECLINES IN REAL GDP IN THE MAJOR

ECONOMIES. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS

SLOWED DURING THE YEAR, ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE ECONOMIES MOST

RELIANT UPON INTERNATIONAL TRADE. VOLATILITY LEVELS ACROSS FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS DECLINED DURING THE YEAR AND CORPORATE

CREDIT SPREADS GENERALLY TIGHTENED, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. THE U.S. FEDERAL

RESERVE, THE BANK OF JAPAN AND THE PEOPLES BANK OF CHINA

LEFT INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED DURING 2009, WHILE CENTRAL BANKS

IN THE EUROZONE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM LOWERED INTEREST RATES

DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. AFTER A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE

IN THE SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2008, THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING 2009. THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENED AGAINST THE BRITISH POUND AND THE EURO, BUT

STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN. IN INVESTMENT BANKING,

INDUSTRY-WIDE

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY REMAINED WEAK, WHILE

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DEBT OFFERINGS AND EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED

OFFERINGS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2008.

UNITED STATES.

REAL GDP IN THE

U.S. DECLINED BY AN ESTIMATED 2.4% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2009,

COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 0.4% IN 2008. THE RECESSION IN THE

U.S., WHICH STARTED NEAR THE BEGINNING OF OUR 2008 FISCAL YEAR,

APPEARED TO END IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, AS REAL GDP

INCREASED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. EXPORTS DECLINED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, BUT IMPROVED DURING

THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. CONSUMER EXPENDITURE DECLINED

DURING 2009, DESPITE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENTS FISCAL STIMULUS PACKAGE. BUSINESS AND CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE IMPROVED DURING THE YEAR, BUT REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS.

THE RATE OF INFLATION DECREASED DURING THE YEAR, REFLECTING AN

INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND SIGNIFICANT EXCESS PRODUCTION

CAPACITY, WHICH CAUSED DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON WAGES AND PRICES.

THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE MAINTAINED ITS FEDERAL FUNDS RATE

AT A TARGET RANGE OF ZERO TO 0.25% DURING THE YEAR. IN ADDITION,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE PURCHASED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES, AS WELL AS U.S. TREASURY AND FEDERAL AGENCY

DEBT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE LIQUIDITY AND EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY

OF CREDIT. THE YIELD ON THE

10-YEAR

U.S. TREASURY NOTE INCREASED BY 169 BASIS POINTS TO 3.85%

DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX, THE S&P

500 INDEX AND THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ENDED OUR FISCAL

YEAR HIGHER BY 48%, 28% AND 22%, RESPECTIVELY.

EUROPE.

REAL GDP IN THE EUROZONE ECONOMIES

DECLINED BY AN ESTIMATED 4.0% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2009, COMPARED

WITH AN INCREASE OF 0.5% IN 2008. FIXED INVESTMENT, CONSUMER

EXPENDITURE AND EXPORTS DECLINED DURING 2009. HOWEVER, SURVEYS

OF BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IMPROVED DURING THE YEAR.

ALTHOUGH EMPLOYMENT LEVELS DECLINED IN MANY ECONOMIES, THE

LARGEST DECREASES WERE IN THE COUNTRIES THAT WERE MOST AFFECTED

BY THE HOUSING MARKET DECLINE. THE RATE OF INFLATION DECLINED

DURING THE YEAR. IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC WEAKNESS AND CONCERNS

ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL

BANK LOWERED ITS MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS RATE BY 150 BASIS

POINTS TO 1.00%. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, REAL GDP DECLINED BY AN

ESTIMATED 4.8% FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2009, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE

OF 0.5% IN 2008. ALTHOUGH REAL GDP DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE

FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, IT APPEARED TO INCREASE DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009. THE BANK OF ENGLAND LOWERED ITS OFFICIAL

BANK RATE DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR BY A TOTAL OF 150 BASIS POINTS

TO 0.50%.

LONG-TERM

GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS IN BOTH THE EUROZONE AND THE U.K.

INCREASED DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND

APPRECIATED BY 2% AND 11%, RESPECTIVELY, AGAINST THE

U.S. DOLLAR DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. MAJOR EUROPEAN EQUITY

MARKETS ENDED OUR FISCAL YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.

ASIA.

IN JAPAN, REAL GDP DECREASED BY AN

ESTIMATED 5.0% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2009, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE

OF 1.2% IN 2008. MEASURES OF BUSINESS INVESTMENT, CONSUMER

EXPENDITURES AND EXPORTS DECLINED. MEASURES OF INFLATION ALSO

DECLINED DURING 2009. THE BANK OF JAPAN MAINTAINED ITS TARGET

OVERNIGHT CALL RATE AT 0.10% DURING THE YEAR, WHILE THE YIELD ON

10-YEAR

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BOND INCREASED DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR. THE

YEN DEPRECIATED BY 2% AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE

NIKKEI 225 INCREASED 21% DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR.

IN CHINA, REAL GDP GROWTH WAS AN ESTIMATED 8.7% IN CALENDAR YEAR

2009, DOWN FROM 9.6% IN 2008. WHILE EXPORTS DECLINED DURING

2009, THE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WAS MITIGATED BY AN

INCREASE IN FIXED INVESTMENT AND CONSUMER SPENDING, PARTIALLY

DUE TO FISCAL STIMULUS AND STRONG CREDIT EXPANSION. MEASURES OF

INFLATION DECLINED FOR MOST OF 2009, BUT BEGAN TO INCREASE

TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR. THE PEOPLES BANK OF CHINA LEFT

ITS

ONE-YEAR

BENCHMARK LENDING RATE UNCHANGED AT 5.31% DURING THE YEAR AND

MAINTAINED A BROADLY STABLE EXCHANGE RATE AGAINST THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX INCREASED 77%

OUR FISCAL YEAR.

OTHER MARKETS.

REAL GDP IN BRAZIL DECLINED BY

AN ESTIMATED 0.1% IN CALENDAR YEAR 2009 COMPARED WITH AN

INCREASE OF 5.1% IN 2008. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENT SPENDING DECLINED,

AN INCREASE IN COMMODITY PRICES CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT

CAPITAL INFLOWS, WHICH HELPED SUPPORT CONSUMER SPENDING. THE

BRAZILIAN REAL STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN

RUSSIA, REAL GDP DECLINED BY AN ESTIMATED 7.9% IN CALENDAR YEAR

2009, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 5.6% IN 2008. LOW OIL PRICES

EARLIER IN THE YEAR, AS WELL AS A TIGHTENING IN CREDIT

AVAILABILITY, LED TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INVESTMENT,

CONSUMPTION AND EXPORTS. IN ADDITION, THE RUSSIAN RUBLE

DEPRECIATED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. BRAZILIAN AND RUSSIAN

EQUITY PRICES ENDED OUR FISCAL YEAR SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN RISK

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES

WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND INHERENT IN

OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MARKET, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

OPERATIONAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF HOW MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE

RISKS, SEE

 RISK

MANAGEMENT BELOW. A SUMMARY OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS

THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES FOLLOWS BELOW. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE RISK FACTORS IN

PART I, ITEM 1A OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MARKET RISK.

OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH OUR BUSINESSES OPERATE. A FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, HIGH GLOBAL

GDP GROWTH, TRANSPARENT, LIQUID AND EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS,

LOW INFLATION, HIGH BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, STABLE

GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND STRONG BUSINESS EARNINGS.

UNFAVORABLE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN BE

CAUSED BY: DECLINES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUSINESS ACTIVITY OR

INVESTOR OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE; LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY

OR INCREASES IN THE COST OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL; INCREASES IN

INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, DEFAULT

RATES OR THE PRICE OF BASIC COMMODITIES; OUTBREAKS OF

HOSTILITIES OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY; CORPORATE,

POLITICAL OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN

CAPITAL MARKETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR PANDEMICS; OR A

COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS. OUR BUSINESSES AND

PROFITABILITY HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE

FOLLOWING.



MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESSES,

OUR MORTGAGES, LEVERAGED LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS BUSINESSES IN

OUR FICC SEGMENT, AND OUR EQUITY PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BUSINESS,

HAVE NET LONG POSITIONS IN DEBT SECURITIES, LOANS,

DERIVATIVES, MORTGAGES, EQUITIES (INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY) AND

MOST OTHER ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL TO

FACILITATE OUR CLIENTS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR

EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES, COMMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN TRADING

POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS

CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES AND EQUITIES. BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF

THESE INVESTING AND TRADING POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS, DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES DIRECTLY AND

IMMEDIATELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY

HEDGED OUR EXPOSURES TO SUCH DECLINES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES (PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND

PRIVATE EQUITIES OR OTHER SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT FREELY

TRADABLE OR LACK ESTABLISHED AND LIQUID TRADING MARKETS), IT MAY

NOT BE POSSIBLE OR ECONOMIC TO HEDGE SUCH EXPOSURES AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT WE DO SO THE HEDGE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR MAY GREATLY

REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROFIT FROM INCREASES IN THE VALUES OF THE

ASSETS. SUDDEN DECLINES AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES

OF ASSETS MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CURTAIL OR ELIMINATE THE TRADING

MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS, WHICH MAY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

SELL, HEDGE OR VALUE SUCH ASSETS. THE INABILITY TO SELL OR

EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ASSETS REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LOSSES IN

SUCH POSITIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN VALUING ASSETS MAY REQUIRE

US TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COSTS.



OUR COST OF OBTAINING

LONG-TERM

UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS.

CREDIT SPREADS ARE INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR

CREDITWORTHINESS. WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS, AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HAVE IN THE

PAST ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO BORROW ON A SECURED AND

UNSECURED BASIS AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. WE FUND OURSELVES

ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY ISSUING

LONG-TERM

DEBT, PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER, BY ACCEPTING

DEPOSITS AT OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES OR BY OBTAINING BANK LOANS OR

LINES OF CREDIT. WE SEEK TO FINANCE MANY OF OUR ASSETS ON A

SECURED BASIS, INCLUDING BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MAKE IT HARDER AND

MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR OUR BUSINESSES. IF OUR

AVAILABLE FUNDING IS LIMITED OR WE ARE FORCED TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AT A HIGHER COST, THESE CONDITIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO

CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE OUR COST OF

FUNDING, BOTH OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESSES THAT INVOLVE INVESTING, LENDING

AND TAKING PRINCIPAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET MAKING.

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS



OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS. POOR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED INVESTOR AND CEO

CONFIDENCE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY-WIDE

DECLINES IN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF UNDERWRITINGS AND OF

FINANCIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, OUR

CLIENTS ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OFTEN RELY ON

ACCESS TO THE SECURED AND UNSECURED CREDIT MARKETS TO FINANCE

THEIR TRANSACTIONS. A LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT OR AN INCREASED

COST OF CREDIT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SIZE, VOLUME AND TIMING

OF OUR CLIENTS MERGER AND ACQUISITION

TRANSACTIONS  PARTICULARLY LARGE TRANSACTIONS.

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

IS DERIVED FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN LARGE TRANSACTIONS, A

DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE TRANSACTIONS WOULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS.



CERTAIN OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MARKET VOLATILITY TO

PROVIDE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, AND DECREASES IN

VOLATILITY MAY REDUCE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED

VOLATILITY, WHILE IT CAN INCREASE TRADING VOLUMES AND SPREADS,

ALSO INCREASES RISK AS MEASURED BY VAR AND MAY EXPOSE US TO

INCREASED RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

MARKET-MAKING

AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES OR CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

THESE BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASING OUR VAR. LIMITING

THE SIZE OF OUR

MARKET-MAKING

POSITIONS AND INVESTING BUSINESSES CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY.



WE RECEIVE

ASSET-BASED

MANAGEMENT FEES BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS

PORTFOLIOS OR INVESTMENT IN FUNDS MANAGED BY US AND, IN SOME

CASES, WE ALSO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR CLIENTS PORTFOLIOS OR FUND ASSETS, WHICH IN

TURN REDUCE THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING SUCH ASSETS. MARKET

UNCERTAINTY, VOLATILITY AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL

AS DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, MAY CAUSE OUR CLIENTS TO TRANSFER

THEIR ASSETS OUT OF OUR FUNDS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR THEIR

BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS

OR ADDITIONAL ASSETS FROM EXISTING CLIENTS AND RESULT IN REDUCED

NET REVENUES, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. TO

THE EXTENT THAT CLIENTS DO NOT WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS, THEY MAY

INVEST THEM IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LESS FEE INCOME.



CONCENTRATION OF RISK INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES IN OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, INVESTING, BLOCK TRADING, MERCHANT BANKING,

UNDERWRITING AND LENDING BUSINESSES. THIS RISK MAY INCREASE TO

THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR

MARKET-MAKING,

TRADING, INVESTING AND LENDING BUSINESSES.

LIQUIDITY RISK.

LIQUIDITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR

BUSINESSES. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE IMPAIRED BY AN INABILITY TO

ACCESS SECURED

AND/OR

UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS, AN INABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS OR REDEEM OUR

INVESTMENTS, OR UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL. THIS

SITUATION MAY ARISE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE

TO CONTROL, SUCH AS A GENERAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN

OPERATIONAL PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS THIRD PARTIES OR US, OR EVEN BY

THE PERCEPTION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WE, OR OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER LIQUIDITY RISK.

THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND THE CONTRACTS TO

WHICH WE ARE A PARTY ARE COMPLEX, AS WE EMPLOY STRUCTURED

PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS AND OURSELVES, AND THESE COMPLEX

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE MARKETS

TO ACCESS IN TIMES OF LIQUIDITY STRESS. OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES

MAY LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE HOLDINGS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPECIFIC MARKETS, WHICH COULD

RESTRICT LIQUIDITY FOR OUR POSITIONS. FURTHER, OUR ABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE

SEEKING TO SELL SIMILAR ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME, AS IS LIKELY TO

OCCUR IN A LIQUIDITY OR OTHER MARKET CRISIS. IN ADDITION,

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE INTERACT MAY EXERCISE

SET-OFF RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL,

INCLUDING IN DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER

IMPAIR OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY.

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION

IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT OUR

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR TRIGGER OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

CERTAIN BILATERAL PROVISIONS IN SOME OF OUR TRADING AND

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING CONTRACTS. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS,

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BE PERMITTED TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS WITH

GOLDMAN SACHS OR REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

TERMINATION OF OUR TRADING AND COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

CONTRACTS COULD CAUSE US TO SUSTAIN LOSSES AND IMPAIR OUR

LIQUIDITY BY REQUIRING US TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING OR

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENTS OR SECURITIES MOVEMENTS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GOLDMAN SACHS OF A

REDUCTION IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SEE

 LIQUIDITY

AND FUNDING RISK  CREDIT RATINGS BELOW.

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. (GS&CO.), GOLDMAN SACHS BANK

USA (GS BANK USA) AND GOLDMAN SACHS BANK (EUROPE) PLC (GS BANK

EUROPE), SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, AND HAS PLEDGED

SIGNIFICANT ASSETS TO GS BANK USA TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO GS

BANK USA. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. GUARANTEES MANY OF THE

OBLIGATIONS OF ITS OTHER CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ON A

TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION

BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH COUNTERPARTIES. THESE GUARANTEES MAY

REQUIRE GROUP INC. TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS OR ASSETS

TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR CREDITORS OR COUNTERPARTIES AT A

TIME WHEN GROUP INC. IS IN NEED OF LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS

OWN OBLIGATIONS.

CREDIT RISK.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT

THIRD PARTIES THAT OWE US MONEY, SECURITIES OR OTHER ASSETS WILL

NOT PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON

THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. A FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT

MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN

INSTITUTION, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS,

LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT US. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT OUR

RIGHTS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN ALL

CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF THIRD PARTIES WHOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE HOLD COULD

RESULT IN LOSSES

AND/OR

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REHYPOTHECATE OR OTHERWISE USE

THOSE SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS FOR LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. A

SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS.

WHILE IN MANY CASES WE ARE PERMITTED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY, DISPUTES MAY ARISE AS TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL WE

ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE VALUE OF PLEDGED ASSETS. DEFAULT

RATES, DOWNGRADES AND DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE

VALUATION OF COLLATERAL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN TIMES OF

MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY.

ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW CREDIT EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES

AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT

TO DETECT OR FORESEE, PARTICULARLY AS NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES

AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS LEAD US TO TRANSACT WITH A BROADER ARRAY

OF CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AS WELL AS CLEARING HOUSES AND

EXCHANGES, AND EXPOSE US TO NEW ASSET CLASSES AND NEW MARKETS.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, PRESSURE TO

EXTEND AND PRICE CREDIT AT LEVELS THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS FULLY

COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS WE TAKE. IN PARTICULAR, CORPORATE

CLIENTS SEEK SUCH COMMITMENTS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN

CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY

DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND MONITOR, ON A DAILY

BASIS, A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

HIGHLY COMPLEX, ACROSS NUMEROUS AND DIVERSE MARKETS IN MANY

CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO CLIENTS, OFTEN MUST ADHERE TO

CLIENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY

STANDARDS. DESPITE THE RESILIENCY PLANS AND FACILITIES WE HAVE

IN PLACE, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED BY A DISRUPTION IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR

BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED. THIS MAY

INCLUDE A DISRUPTION INVOLVING ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATIONS,

INTERNET, TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES USED BY US OR THIRD

PARTIES WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, WHETHER AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, INCREASES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL

FAILURE AS DISPARATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED,

OFTEN ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS. FURTHERMORE, THE

INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH

CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, AND THE INCREASED

CENTRALITY OF THESE ENTITIES UNDER PROPOSED AND POTENTIAL

REGULATION, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT

ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS.

LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISK.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING REGULATION IN

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND, AS A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS AND

A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.

OUR STATUS AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE OPERATION OF OUR

LENDING AND OTHER BUSINESSES THROUGH GS BANK USA

SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION AND LIMITATIONS ON OUR

ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN REGULATION  BANKING

REGULATION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF OUR ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

NEW REGULATIONS COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE AFFECTED

JURISDICTIONS, OR EVEN MAKE IT UNECONOMIC FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

CONDUCT ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS,

OR COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

CHANGING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, RESTRUCTURING OUR BUSINESSES,

MOVING ALL OR CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR EMPLOYEES TO

OTHER LOCATIONS OR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING LIQUIDATING ASSETS OR RAISING CAPITAL IN

A MANNER THAT ADVERSELY INCREASES OUR FUNDING COSTS OR OTHERWISE

ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS. TO THE EXTENT

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING

LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, THIS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED IN THE

SAME WAY.

A FINANCIAL CRISIS RESPONSIBILITY FEE TO BE ASSESSED ON THE

LARGEST FINANCIAL FIRMS BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS PROPOSED

ON JANUARY 14, 2010. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS IS STILL IN

THE PROPOSAL STAGE AND HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY CONGRESS,

DETAILS SURROUNDING THE FEE HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED. WE ARE

CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL ON OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL, IF ANY, WILL BE

RECORDED WHEN IT IS ULTIMATELY ENACTED.

SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR A SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION

AGAINST US, OR ADVERSE PUBLICITY, GOVERNMENTAL SCRUTINY OR LEGAL

AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS REGARDLESS OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME,

COULD HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS, CAUSE SIGNIFICANT

REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US OR ADVERSELY IMPACT THE MORALE AND

PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WHICH IN TURN COULD SERIOUSLY HARM

OUR BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN

HIGH. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LEGAL CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND

CLIENTS INCREASE IN A MARKET DOWNTURN AND THAT

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS INCREASE IN PERIODS WHEN WE HAVE

REDUCED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW

WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY EXPOSURES, SEE

 USE

CRITICAL

FAIR

VALUE

THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WITH

RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF EARNINGS, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICY. THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT

THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (I.E., THE EXIT PRICE). FINANCIAL

ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE

MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE

TRANSACTION COSTS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES ARE

REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AT FAIR VALUE. IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE SEPARATE OUR

TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE AND TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR

CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS, PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND

PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.



CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS.

OUR CASH TRADING

INSTRUMENTS (E.G., EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES) ARE

GENERALLY VALUED USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER

QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE

LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDE MOST

GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVE LISTED EQUITIES AND CERTAIN MONEY

MARKET SECURITIES.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS THAT TRADE IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE, BUT ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING

SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY INCLUDE

MOST GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, MOST CORPORATE BONDS, CERTAIN

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, CERTAIN BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS

LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, CERTAIN STATE, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL

OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET SECURITIES AND LOAN

COMMITMENTS.

CERTAIN CASH TRADING INSTRUMENTS TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND

THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND REAL ESTATE FUND

INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS (INCLUDING

CERTAIN MEZZANINE FINANCING, LEVERAGED LOANS ARISING FROM

CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER CORPORATE BANK DEBT), LESS

LIQUID CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS

(INCLUDING LESS LIQUID CORPORATE BONDS, DISTRESSED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS) BACKED BY

CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS), LESS LIQUID MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND

SECURITIES (BACKED BY EITHER COMMERCIAL OR RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE), AND ACQUIRED PORTFOLIOS OF DISTRESSED LOANS. THE

TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH

AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT

INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION PRICE. THIS VALUATION IS

ADJUSTED ONLY WHEN CHANGES TO INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED OR PENDING

THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OR COMPARABLE

ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN

THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL

RATIOS OR CASH FLOWS.

FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS OR ARE

SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT ILLIQUIDITY

AND/OR

NON-TRANSFERABILITY.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE WHERE

AVAILABLE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

PUBLIC PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OUR PUBLIC

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS HELD WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC IS VALUED USING

THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE ADJUSTED FOR TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.

UNDER THE ORIGINAL TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, THE ICBC SHARES WE

HELD WOULD HAVE BECOME FREE FROM TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS IN EQUAL

INSTALLMENTS ON APRIL 28, 2009 AND

OCTOBER 20, 2009. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED

MARCH 2009, THE SHARES BECAME SUBJECT TO NEW SUPPLEMENTAL

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. UNDER THESE NEW SUPPLEMENTAL TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS, ON APRIL 28, 2009, 20% OF THE ICBC

SHARES THAT WE HELD BECAME FREE FROM TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND

WE COMPLETED THE DISPOSITION OF THESE SHARES DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2009. OUR REMAINING ICBC SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, WHICH PROHIBIT LIQUIDATION AT ANY TIME

PRIOR TO APRIL 28, 2010.

PRIVATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

OUR PRIVATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS HELD WITHIN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

COMPONENT OF OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT

INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY, DEBT AND REAL ESTATE,

PRIMARILY HELD THROUGH INVESTMENT FUNDS. BY THEIR NATURE, THESE

INVESTMENTS HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. WE VALUE SUCH

INSTRUMENTS INITIALLY AT TRANSACTION PRICE AND ADJUST VALUATIONS

WHEN EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. SUCH

EVIDENCE INCLUDES RECENT

THIRD-PARTY

INVESTMENTS OR PENDING TRANSACTIONS,

THIRD-PARTY

INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS,

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES, VALUATION MULTIPLES AND PUBLIC

COMPARABLES.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CAN

BE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

OR

OVER-THE-COUNTER

(OTC). WE GENERALLY VALUE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES USING MODELS WHICH CALIBRATE TO

MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS AND ELIMINATE TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CLOSING

PRICE OF THE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES AND THEIR UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS.

OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

MARKET EVIDENCE WHENEVER POSSIBLE, INCLUDING

MARKET-BASED

INPUTS TO MODELS, MODEL CALIBRATION TO

MARKET-CLEARING

TRANSACTIONS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

WHERE MODELS ARE USED, THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO

VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF,

AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. WE GENERALLY

USE SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. VALUATION

MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL TERMS,

MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES, MEASURES OF

VOLATILITY, VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT RATES, LOSS

SEVERITY RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. FOR OTC

DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS GENERIC

FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL INPUTS CAN GENERALLY BE

VERIFIED AND MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WITH

LIMITED PRICING INFORMATION, AND THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

FOR THESE DERIVATIVES IS INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT. WHERE WE DO

NOT HAVE CORROBORATING MARKET EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT

MODEL INPUTS AND CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF

FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE

SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL

VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION PRICE. SUBSEQUENT TO

INITIAL RECOGNITION, WE ONLY UPDATE VALUATION INPUTS WHEN

CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THIRD-PARTY

PRICING SERVICES

AND/OR

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL VALUE TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION MODEL

COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SEE

 DERIVATIVES BELOW FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON OUR OTC DERIVATIVES.

WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED FOR VARIOUS FACTORS

SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE WHERE

AVAILABLE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

A CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE,

INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, IS

FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

APPROPRIATELY VALUED AT

MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS (I.E., EXIT PRICES) AND THAT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ARE RELIABLE AND CONSISTENTLY DETERMINED.

WE EMPLOY AN OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES APPROPRIATE

SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INDEPENDENT OF THE

TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

OVERSIGHT OF CONTROL AND VALUATION POLICIES AND FOR REPORTING

THE RESULTS OF THESE POLICIES TO OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE SEEK TO

MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT CONTROL

FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED APPROPRIATELY. WE EMPLOY PROCEDURES FOR

THE APPROVAL OF NEW TRANSACTION TYPES AND MARKETS, PRICE

VERIFICATION, REVIEW OF DAILY PROFIT AND LOSS, AND REVIEW OF

VALUATION MODELS BY PERSONNEL WITH APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL

KNOWLEDGE OF RELEVANT PRODUCTS AND MARKETS. THESE PROCEDURES ARE

PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL INDEPENDENT OF THE TRADING AND INVESTING

FUNCTIONS. FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE PRICES OR VALUATIONS

THAT REQUIRE INPUTS ARE LESS OBSERVABLE, WE EMPLOY, WHERE

POSSIBLE, PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE COMPARISONS WITH SIMILAR

OBSERVABLE POSITIONS, ANALYSIS OF ACTUAL TO PROJECTED CASH

FLOWS, COMPARISONS WITH SUBSEQUENT SALES, REVIEWS OF VALUATIONS

USED FOR COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES AND DISCUSSIONS WITH

SENIOR BUSINESS LEADERS. SEE

 MARKET

RISK AND

 CREDIT

RISK BELOW FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE THE

RISKS INHERENT IN OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTING BUSINESSES.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY 

LEVEL 3.

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY UNDER

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

CODIFICATION (ASC) 820 PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION

TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE OBJECTIVE OF A FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT IS TO DETERMINE THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE

RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE (I.E., THE EXIT PRICE). THE HIERARCHY

GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE

MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1

MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

(LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT

THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

INSTRUMENTS THAT TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR

NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. WE DETERMINE WHICH INSTRUMENTS ARE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR PRICE

VERIFICATION PROCESS. THIS PROCESS IS PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL

INDEPENDENT OF OUR TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS WHO

CORROBORATE VALUATIONS TO EXTERNAL MARKET DATA

(E.G., QUOTED MARKET PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS,

THIRD-PARTY

PRICING VENDORS, RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY AND COMPARATIVE

ANALYSES TO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS). INSTRUMENTS WITH VALUATIONS

WHICH CANNOT BE CORROBORATED TO EXTERNAL MARKET DATA ARE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

WHEN BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR

THIRD-PARTY

PRICING VENDORS ARE USED FOR VALUATION OR PRICE VERIFICATION,

GREATER PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO EXECUTABLE QUOTES. AS PART OF OUR

PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS, VALUATIONS BASED ON QUOTES ARE

CORROBORATED BY COMPARISON BOTH TO OTHER QUOTES AND TO RECENT

TRADING ACTIVITY IN THE SAME OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. THE NUMBER

OF QUOTES OBTAINED VARIES BY INSTRUMENT AND DEPENDS ON THE

LIQUIDITY OF THE PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT. SEE NOTES 2 AND 3

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES FOR LEVEL 3

ASSETS.

INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT

TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL

ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. AS TIME PASSES, TRANSACTION PRICE

BECOMES LESS RELIABLE AS AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AND

ACCORDINGLY, WE USE OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE,

WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

REGARDLESS OF THE METHODOLOGY, VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE.

SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN CONTROL FUNCTIONS, INDEPENDENT OF THE

TRADING AND INVESTING FUNCTIONS, REVIEWS ALL SIGNIFICANT

UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES, INCLUDING THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE

CHANGE IN VALUE. VALUATIONS ARE FURTHER CORROBORATED

SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION DATE IS AS FOLLOWS.



EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE

DEBENTURES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR LEVEL 3

EQUITIES AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES CONSIST OF PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS AND REAL ESTATE FUND INVESTMENTS. FOR PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, RECENT

THIRD-PARTY

INVESTMENTS OR PENDING TRANSACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE

BEST EVIDENCE FOR ANY CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE. IN THE ABSENCE OF

SUCH EVIDENCE, VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON ONE OR MORE OF THE

FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES, AS APPROPRIATE AND AVAILABLE.

TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

TECHNIQUES,

THIRD-PARTY

INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, VALUATION MULTIPLES AND PUBLIC

COMPARABLES. SUCH EVIDENCE INCLUDES PENDING REORGANIZATIONS

(E.G., MERGER PROPOSALS, TENDER OFFERS OR DEBT

RESTRUCTURINGS); AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL METRICS

(E.G., OPERATING RESULTS AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS

PROJECTIONS, INDUSTRY MULTIPLES, CREDIT RATINGS AND BALANCE

SHEET RATIOS). REAL ESTATE FUND INVESTMENTS ARE CARRIED AT NET

ASSET VALUE PER SHARE. THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS

ARE GENERALLY VALUED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES, FOR

WHICH THE KEY INPUTS ARE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS, CAPITALIZATION RATES AND VALUATION MULTIPLES.



BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND

OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

VALUATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES, FOR WHICH THE KEY INPUTS ARE

THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, MARKET

YIELDS FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS AND RECOVERY ASSUMPTIONS. INPUTS ARE

GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES, WHICH

INCORPORATE COMPARISONS BOTH TO CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS THAT

REFERENCE THE SAME UNDERLYING CREDIT RISK AND TO OTHER DEBT

INSTRUMENTS FOR THE SAME ISSUER FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE PRICES OR

BROKER QUOTES ARE AVAILABLE.



LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY SPECIFIC ASSETS AND MAY BE TRANCHED INTO

VARYING LEVELS OF SUBORDINATION. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS, VALUATION TECHNIQUES VARY BY INSTRUMENT.

METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES ACROSS DIFFERENT

TRANCHES, COMPARISONS TO TRANSACTIONS IN BOTH THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL AND INSTRUMENTS WITH THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE

SAME UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, MARKET INDICES (SUCH AS THE CMBX

(1)

), AND

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, AS WELL AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES.



LOANS AND SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE.

VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON BOTH PROPRIETARY AND INDUSTRY RECOGNIZED

MODELS (INCLUDING INTEX AND BLOOMBERG), AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

TECHNIQUES. IN THE RECENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE

RATES AND TIMING OF DELINQUENCY, DEFAULT AND LOSS EXPECTATIONS,

WHICH ARE DRIVEN IN PART BY HOUSING PRICES. INPUTS ARE

DETERMINED BASED ON RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES, WHICH INCORPORATE

COMPARISONS TO INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR COLLATERAL AND RISK

PROFILES, INCLUDING RELEVANT INDICES SUCH AS THE ABX

(1).



LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES, FOR WHICH THE KEY INPUTS ARE

THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND MARKET

YIELDS FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS. INPUTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON

RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES WHICH INCORPORATE COMPARISONS TO RECENT

AUCTION DATA FOR OTHER SIMILAR LOAN PORTFOLIOS.



DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

VALUATION MODELS ARE

CALIBRATED TO INITIAL TRANSACTION PRICE. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN

VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION

MODELS (E.G., INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILITIES,

ETC.). INPUTS ARE CHANGED ONLY WHEN CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.

VALUATIONS OF LESS LIQUID OTC DERIVATIVES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON

LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE

MARKET, AS WELL AS UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, SUCH AS CORRELATIONS AND

VOLATILITIES.

WE TEST THE GOODWILL IN EACH OF OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE COMPONENTS ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR

THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, BY

COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT

WITH ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE. WE DERIVE THE FAIR VALUE OF

EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES WE

BELIEVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE FOR EACH SEGMENT

(OBSERVABLE AVERAGE

PRICE-TO-EARNINGS

MULTIPLES OF OUR COMPETITORS IN THESE BUSINESSES AND

PRICE-TO-BOOK

MULTIPLES). WE DERIVE THE NET BOOK VALUE OF OUR OPERATING

SEGMENTS BY ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT.

OUR LAST ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS PERFORMED DURING OUR 2009

FOURTH QUARTER AND NO IMPAIRMENT WAS IDENTIFIED.

DURING 2008 (PARTICULARLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER) AND EARLY

2009, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE SECURITIES MARKETS

GENERALLY WERE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT

DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF NEARLY ALL ASSET CLASSES AND BY A

SERIOUS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. IF THERE WAS A PROLONGED PERIOD OF

WEAKNESS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, OUR

BUSINESSES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN

MARKETING-RELATED ASSETS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS.

A PROLONGED PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS

COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING (I) CHANGES IN TRADING VOLUMES

OR MARKET STRUCTURE THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

BUSINESSES (SEE DISCUSSION BELOW), (II) AN ADVERSE ACTION

OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR OR (III) ADVERSE ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE ON THE CONTRACTS IN OUR VARIABLE ANNUITY AND LIFE

INSURANCE BUSINESS.

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE SEC APPROVED THE NYSES PROPOSAL

TO CREATE A NEW MARKET MODEL AND REDEFINE THE ROLE OF NYSE DMMS.

IN JUNE 2009, THE NYSE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE ROLLOUT

OF NEW SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE THAT FURTHER REDUCES ORDER

COMPLETION TIME, WHICH ENABLES THE NYSE TO OFFER COMPETITIVE

EXECUTION SPEEDS, WHILE CONTINUING TO INCORPORATE THE PRICE

DISCOVERY PROVIDED BY DMMS. FOLLOWING SOLID PERFORMANCE DURING

THE FIRST HALF OF 2009, IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, OUR DMM

BUSINESS WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE LACK OF TIMELY

MARKET DATA IN THE INTERNAL ORDER/EXECUTION SYSTEM OF THE NYSE

(WHICH, AT TIMES, RESULTS IN DMMS MAKING MARKETS WITHOUT

REAL-TIME PRICE INFORMATION) AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY LOWER

TRADING VOLUMES AND LOWER VOLATILITY. IN 2010, THE NYSE IS

EXPECTED TO ADDRESS THIS MARKET DATA ISSUE. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WILL RESULT IN

SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO AVOID IMPAIRMENT OF OUR NYSE DMM RIGHTS

IN THE FUTURE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 360,

WE WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DMM

BUSINESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS REQUIRED IN

THE FUTURE. AS OF DECEMBER 2009, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

NYSE DMM RIGHTS WAS $420 MILLION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

WERE TO BE AN IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE, IT WOULD RESULT IN A

SIGNIFICANT WRITEDOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE DMM RIGHTS.

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE USE OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN

ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO

IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT

MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND TAX

AUDITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT

OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH

LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR

POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF TAX AUDITS TO THE

EXTENT THAT UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS FAIL TO MEET THE RECOGNITION

STANDARD UNDER ASC 740. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF OUR ANNUAL

REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND

OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT.

OUR TOTAL ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A

CASE-BY-CASE

BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER

CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE OR

PROCEEDING, OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN

SIMILAR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF

LEGAL COUNSEL. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE

OUTCOME OF OUR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY

IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE

DAMAGES OR FINES ARE SOUGHT, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES

OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS WHERE THERE IS ONLY A

REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED. SEE

PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF OUR ANNUAL

REPORT ON

NET

REVENUES

2009 VERSUS 2008.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$45.17 BILLION IN 2009, MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT IN

2008, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN TRADING

AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. THE INCREASE IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS REFLECTED A VERY STRONG PERFORMANCE IN FICC AND

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, AS WELL

AS HIGHER NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES. DURING 2009, FICC OPERATED

IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CLIENT-DRIVEN

ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN MORE LIQUID PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION,

ASSET VALUES GENERALLY IMPROVED AND CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS

TIGHTENED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR MOST OF THE YEAR. NET REVENUES IN

FICC WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2008, REFLECTING

PARTICULARLY STRONG PERFORMANCES IN CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGES

AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, WHICH WERE EACH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

THAN 2008. NET REVENUES IN COMMODITIES WERE ALSO PARTICULARLY

STRONG AND WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 2008, WHILE NET REVENUES IN

CURRENCIES WERE STRONG, BUT LOWER THAN A PARTICULARLY STRONG

2008. DURING 2009, MORTGAGES INCLUDED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.5 BILLION (EXCLUDING HEDGES) ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE

LOANS. RESULTS IN 2008 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ASSET

WRITEDOWNS ACROSS

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE DEBT, PRIVATE AND

PUBLIC EQUITIES, AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

AND SECURITIES. THE INCREASE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS REFLECTED

GAINS ON CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND OUR INVESTMENT IN

THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC COMPARED WITH NET LOSSES IN 2008. IN

2009, RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDED A GAIN OF

$1.58 BILLION RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC, A GAIN OF $1.31 BILLION FROM CORPORATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND A LOSS OF $1.76 BILLION FROM REAL

ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS. NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES FOR 2009

REFLECTED STRONG RESULTS IN THE CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES.

HOWEVER, RESULTS IN THE CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES WERE LOWER

THAN A STRONG 2008 AND INCLUDED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMMISSIONS.

RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES WERE POSITIVE COMPARED WITH

LOSSES IN 2008. DURING 2009, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT

CHARACTERIZED BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES,

FAVORABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

VOLATILITY LEVELS.

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2008, REFLECTING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN SECURITIES SERVICES, AS WELL

AS LOWER NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT. THE DECREASE IN

SECURITIES SERVICES PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF LOWER

CUSTOMER BALANCES, REFLECTING LOWER HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY ASSETS

AND REDUCED LEVERAGE. THE DECREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF ASSETS

MANAGED, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO EQUITY MARKET DEPRECIATION DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, AS WELL AS LOWER INCENTIVE FEES.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT INCREASED $73 BILLION TO $871 BILLION, DUE

TO $76 BILLION OF MARKET APPRECIATION, PRIMARILY IN FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3 BILLION OF

NET OUTFLOWS. OUTFLOWS IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS WERE OFFSET BY

INFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME ASSETS.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2008,

REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL

ADVISORY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY

REFLECTED A DECLINE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING

REFLECTED HIGHER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED

OFFERINGS. NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER

THAN IN 2008.

2008 VERSUS 2007.

OUR NET REVENUES WERE

$22.22 BILLION IN 2008, A DECREASE OF 52% COMPARED WITH

2007, REFLECTING A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT,

INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ASSET PRICE DECLINES, HIGH LEVELS OF

VOLATILITY AND REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, CREDIT MARKETS EXPERIENCED

SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATION BETWEEN PRICES FOR CASH INSTRUMENTS AND

THE RELATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND BETWEEN CREDIT INDICES AND

UNDERLYING SINGLE NAMES. NET REVENUES IN TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2007,

REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN FICC, PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

AND EQUITIES. THE DECREASE IN FICC PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOSSES IN

CREDIT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$3.1 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES) RELATED TO

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES AND LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS,

INCLUDING CORPORATE DEBT AND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EQUITIES.

RESULTS IN MORTGAGES INCLUDED NET LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$1.7 BILLION ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES

AND APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

AND SECURITIES. INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND

COMMODITIES EACH PRODUCED PARTICULARLY STRONG RESULTS AND NET

REVENUES WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING 2008, ALTHOUGH

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY SOLID, FICC OPERATED IN A

CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

BROAD-BASED

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, WIDER MORTGAGE AND CORPORATE CREDIT

SPREADS, REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR. THE DECLINE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED

NET LOSSES OF $2.53 BILLION FROM CORPORATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS AND $949 MILLION FROM REAL ESTATE PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS A $446 MILLION LOSS FROM OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC. IN EQUITIES, THE

DECREASE COMPARED WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG NET REVENUES IN 2007

REFLECTED LOSSES IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES.

COMMISSIONS WERE PARTICULARLY STRONG AND WERE HIGHER THAN 2007.

DURING 2008, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES,

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING AND VERY HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING ALSO DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY

COMPARED WITH 2007, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES

IN BOTH FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND UNDERWRITING. IN FINANCIAL

ADVISORY, THE DECREASE COMPARED WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG NET

REVENUES IN 2007 REFLECTED A DECLINE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN UNDERWRITING

PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN DEBT

UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN LEVERAGED FINANCE

AND

MORTGAGE-RELATED

ACTIVITY, REFLECTING DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. NET REVENUES

IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH 2007,

REFLECTING A DECREASE IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED

OFFERINGS.

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES

INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2007. SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUES

WERE HIGHER, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION

OF SECURITIES LENDING CUSTOMER BALANCES, AS WELL AS HIGHER TOTAL

AVERAGE CUSTOMER BALANCES. ASSET MANAGEMENT NET REVENUES

INCREASED SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING THE YEAR, ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT DECREASED $89 BILLION TO

$779 BILLION, DUE TO $123 BILLION OF MARKET

DEPRECIATION, PRIMARILY IN EQUITY ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$34 BILLION OF NET INFLOWS.

ONE MONTH ENDED DECEMBER 2008.

OUR NET

REVENUES WERE $183 MILLION FOR THE MONTH OF

DECEMBER 2008. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED A CONTINUATION OF

THE DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT EXPERIENCED DURING OUR

FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, PARTICULARLY ACROSS GLOBAL EQUITY

AND CREDIT MARKETS. TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED

NEGATIVE NET REVENUES OF $507 MILLION. RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS REFLECTED NET LOSSES OF $529 MILLION FROM REAL

ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND $501 MILLION FROM

CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN OF

$228 MILLION RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC. RESULTS IN FICC INCLUDED A LOSS IN CREDIT

PRODUCTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES)

RELATED TO

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A WRITEDOWN

OF APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION RELATED TO THE BRIDGE AND

BANK LOAN FACILITIES HELD IN LYONDELLBASELL FINANCE COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, RESULTS IN MORTGAGES INCLUDED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$625 MILLION (EXCLUDING HEDGES) ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE

LOANS AND SECURITIES. INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND

COMMODITIES EACH PRODUCED STRONG RESULTS FOR THE MONTH OF

DECEMBER 2008. DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, ALTHOUGH

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WERE FAVORABLE FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES, FICC

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY CONTINUED

WEAKNESS IN THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS. RESULTS IN EQUITIES

REFLECTED LOWER COMMISSION VOLUMES AND LOWER NET REVENUES FROM

DERIVATIVES COMPARED WITH AVERAGE MONTHLY LEVELS IN 2008, AS

WELL AS WEAK RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES. DURING THE MONTH

OF DECEMBER, EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED

BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND CONTINUED

HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY.

NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WERE $135 MILLION FOR

THE MONTH OF DECEMBER AND REFLECTED VERY LOW LEVELS OF ACTIVITY

IN

INDUSTRY-WIDE

COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS CONTINUED

CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS ACROSS EQUITY AND LEVERAGED

FINANCE MARKETS, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET REVENUES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES WERE

$555 MILLION FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, REFLECTING ASSET

MANAGEMENT NET REVENUES OF $319 MILLION AND SECURITIES

SERVICES NET REVENUES OF $236 MILLION. DURING THE CALENDAR

MONTH OF DECEMBER, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT INCREASED

$19 BILLION TO $798 BILLION DUE TO $13 BILLION OF

MARKET APPRECIATION, PRIMARILY IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY

ASSETS, AND $6 BILLION OF NET INFLOWS. NET INFLOWS

REFLECTED INFLOWS IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

OUTFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME, EQUITY AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT

ASSETS. NET REVENUES IN SECURITIES SERVICES REFLECTED FAVORABLE

CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF SECURITIES LENDING BALANCES, BUT

WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A DECLINE IN TOTAL AVERAGE CUSTOMER

BALANCES.

OPERATING

EXPENSES

OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY COMPENSATION,

HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS EXPENSES INCLUDES SALARIES, DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION,

AMORTIZATION OF EQUITY AWARDS AND OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL

TAXES, SEVERANCE COSTS AND BENEFITS. DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION

IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE LEVEL OF

NET REVENUES, PREVAILING LABOR MARKETS, BUSINESS MIX AND THE

STRUCTURE OF OUR

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. OUR RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO

NET REVENUES WAS 35.8% FOR 2009 AND REPRESENTED OUR LOWEST

ANNUAL RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO NET REVENUES. WHILE

NET REVENUES FOR 2009 WERE ONLY 2% LOWER THAN OUR RECORD NET

REVENUES IN 2007, TOTAL COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES FOR

2009 WERE 20% LOWER THAN 2007. FOR 2008, OUR RATIO OF

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS (EXCLUDING SEVERANCE COSTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008) TO NET REVENUES WAS 48.0%. OUR COMPENSATION EXPENSE

CAN VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND IS BASED ON OUR PERFORMANCE,

PREVAILING LABOR MARKETS AND OTHER FACTORS. OUR RECORD LOW

COMPENSATION RATIO FOR 2009 REFLECTS BOTH VERY STRONG NET

REVENUES AND THE BROADER ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY

OPERATE.

ON DECEMBER 9, 2009, THE UNITED KINGDOM PROPOSED

LEGISLATION THAT WOULD IMPOSE A

NON-DEDUCTIBLE

50% TAX ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN RESPECT OF

DISCRETIONARY BONUSES IN EXCESS OF £25,000 AWARDED UNDER

ARRANGEMENTS MADE BETWEEN DECEMBER 9, 2009 AND

APRIL 5, 2010 TO RELEVANT BANKING

EMPLOYEES. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE

DRAFT LEGISLATION ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SINCE

THIS LEGISLATION IS IN DRAFT FORM, CERTAIN DETAILS SURROUNDING

THE TAX HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED. THE IMPACT OF THE TAX WILL BE

RECORDED WHEN THE LEGISLATION IS ENACTED, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010.

PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

2009 VERSUS 2008.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF

$25.34 BILLION FOR 2009 INCREASED 27% COMPARED WITH 2008.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES (INCLUDING SALARIES,

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF EQUITY AWARDS AND

OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL TAXES, SEVERANCE COSTS AND BENEFITS)

OF $16.19 BILLION WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2008, DUE TO

HIGHER NET REVENUES. OUR RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO

NET REVENUES FOR 2009 WAS 35.8%, DOWN FROM 48.0% (EXCLUDING

SEVERANCE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008) FOR 2008. IN 2009, COMPENSATION WAS

REDUCED BY $500 MILLION TO FUND A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION

TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES, OUR DONOR-ADVISED FUND. TOTAL STAFF

DECREASED 2% DURING 2009. TOTAL STAFF INCLUDING CONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES DECREASED 5% DURING 2009.

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES OF $9.15 BILLION FOR 2009 INCREASED 2% COMPARED

WITH 2008. THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2008 REFLECTED THE IMPACT

OF CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION

(INCLUDED IN OTHER EXPENSES) DURING 2009, PRIMARILY INCLUDING

$310 MILLION TO THE GOLDMAN SACHS FOUNDATION AND

$500 MILLION TO GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES. COMPENSATION WAS

REDUCED TO FUND THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GOLDMAN SACHS

GIVES. THE FOCUS FOR THIS $500 MILLION CONTRIBUTION TO

GOLDMAN SACHS GIVES IS ON THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE

FUNDAMENTAL TO CREATING JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUILDING AND

STABILIZING COMMUNITIES, HONORING SERVICE AND VETERANS AND

INCREASING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WE WILL ASK OUR

PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS

REGARDING POTENTIAL CHARITABLE RECIPIENTS FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED COMPARED

WITH 2008 AND INCLUDED REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION RELATED TO

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES DURING 2009.

THE REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WHICH WERE MEASURED BASED ON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS, ARE INCLUDED IN OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT AND REFLECTED WEAKNESS IN THE

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA. THESE

INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF LOWER

BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRINCIPALLY

REFLECTING LOWER TRANSACTION VOLUMES IN EQUITIES, AND THE IMPACT

OF REDUCED STAFF LEVELS AND EXPENSE REDUCTION INITIATIVES DURING

2009.

2008 VERSUS 2007.

OPERATING EXPENSES OF

$19.89 BILLION FOR 2008 DECREASED 30% COMPARED WITH 2007.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES (INCLUDING SALARIES,

DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF EQUITY AWARDS AND

OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL TAXES, SEVERANCE COSTS AND BENEFITS)

OF $10.93 BILLION DECREASED 46% COMPARED WITH 2007,

REFLECTING LOWER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION DUE TO

LOWER NET REVENUES. FOR 2008, OUR RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS (EXCLUDING SEVERANCE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$275 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008) TO NET

REVENUES WAS 48.0%. OUR RATIO OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS TO

NET REVENUES WAS 43.9% FOR 2007. TOTAL STAFF DECREASED 3% DURING

2008. TOTAL STAFF INCLUDING CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES DECREASED 2% DURING 2008.

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES OF $8.95 BILLION FOR 2008 INCREASED 9% COMPARED

WITH 2007. THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2007 WAS PRINCIPALLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES DURING 2008, AND HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE

AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY

LEVELS IN EQUITIES AND FICC.

ONE MONTH ENDED DECEMBER 2008.

OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE $1.44 BILLION FOR THE MONTH OF

DECEMBER 2008. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES

(INCLUDING SALARIES, AMORTIZATION OF EQUITY AWARDS AND OTHER

ITEMS SUCH AS PAYROLL TAXES, SEVERANCE COSTS AND BENEFITS) WERE

$744 MILLION. NO DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION WAS ACCRUED FOR

THE MONTH OF DECEMBER. TOTAL STAFF DECREASED 3% COMPARED WITH

THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. TOTAL STAFF INCLUDING CONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES DECREASED 3% COMPARED WITH

THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2008.

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES OF $697 MILLION FOR THE MONTH OF

DECEMBER 2008 WERE GENERALLY LOWER THAN AVERAGE MONTHLY

LEVELS IN 2008, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY. TOTAL

NON-COMPENSATION

EXPENSES INCLUDED $68 MILLION OF NET PROVISIONS FOR A

NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

PROVISION FOR

TAXES

DURING 2009, THE FIRM INCURRED $6.44 BILLION OF CORPORATE

TAXES, RESULTING IN AN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 32.5%. THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2008 WAS APPROXIMATELY 1% AND THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2007 WAS 34.1%. THE INCREASE IN

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC EARNINGS MIX AND A

DECREASE IN PERMANENT BENEFITS AS A PERCENTAGE OF HIGHER

EARNINGS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2009 REPRESENTS A RETURN TO

A GEOGRAPHIC EARNINGS MIX THAT IS MORE IN LINE WITH OUR HISTORIC

EARNINGS MIX. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN

PERMANENT BENEFITS AS A PERCENTAGE OF LOWER EARNINGS AND CHANGES

IN GEOGRAPHIC EARNINGS MIX. DURING 2008, WE INCURRED LOSSES IN

VARIOUS U.S. AND

NON-U.S. ENTITIES

WHOSE INCOME/(LOSSES) ARE SUBJECT TO TAX IN THE U.S. WE

ALSO HAD PROFITABLE OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN

NON-U.S. ENTITIES

THAT ARE TAXED AT THEIR APPLICABLE LOCAL TAX RATES, WHICH ARE

GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME

TAX RATE FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 2008 WAS 38.0%.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE RULES RELATED TO THE

DEFERRAL OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN

NON-REPATRIATED

ACTIVE FINANCING INCOME EXPIRED. WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE

ASSET-BACKED

INSTRUMENTS, CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES, STRUCTURE AND ENTER

INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND ENGAGE IN



EQUITIES.

WE MAKE MARKETS IN AND TRADE

EQUITIES AND

ENGAGE IN EXCHANGE-BASED

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES AND IN INSURANCE ACTIVITIES.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE REAL ESTATE AND

CORPORATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC. WE GENERATE NET REVENUES FROM RETURNS

ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND FROM THE INCREASED SHARE OF THE INCOME

AND GAINS DERIVED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS WHEN THE

RETURN ON A FUNDS INVESTMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE FUND

EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLD RETURNS (TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS AN

OVERRIDE).

MARKED-TO-MARKET

DAILY AND, THEREFORE, ITS VALUE AND OUR NET REVENUES ARE SUBJECT

TO FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS. IN ADDITION, NET

REVENUES DERIVED FROM OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE

IN PRIVATELY HELD CONCERNS AND IN REAL ESTATE, MAY FLUCTUATE

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE REVALUATION OF THESE INVESTMENTS

IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. WE ALSO REGULARLY ENTER INTO LARGE

TRANSACTIONS AS PART OF OUR TRADING BUSINESSES. THE NUMBER AND

SIZE OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN A GIVEN PERIOD.

NET REVENUES FROM PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE

MANAGEMENT FEES GENERATED FROM OUR MERCHANT BANKING FUNDS. THESE

MANAGEMENT FEES ARE INCLUDED IN THE NET REVENUES OF THE ASSET

SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2008.

NET REVENUES IN FICC OF $23.32 BILLION FOR 2009 INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2008. DURING 2009, FICC OPERATED IN

AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY,

PARTICULARLY IN MORE LIQUID PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, ASSET VALUES

GENERALLY IMPROVED AND CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED

SIGNIFICANTLY FOR MOST OF THE YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUES

COMPARED WITH 2008 REFLECTED PARTICULARLY STRONG PERFORMANCES IN

CREDIT PRODUCTS, MORTGAGES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, WHICH

WERE EACH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN 2008. NET REVENUES IN

COMMODITIES WERE ALSO PARTICULARLY STRONG AND WERE SLIGHTLY

HIGHER THAN 2008, WHILE NET REVENUES IN CURRENCIES WERE STRONG,

BUT LOWER THAN A PARTICULARLY STRONG 2008. DURING 2009,

MORTGAGES INCLUDED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION

(EXCLUDING HEDGES) ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. RESULTS IN 2008

WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ASSET WRITEDOWNS ACROSS

NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE DEBT, PRIVATE AND

PUBLIC EQUITIES, AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

AND SECURITIES.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $9.89 BILLION FOR 2009

INCREASED 7% COMPARED WITH 2008. NET REVENUES FOR 2009 REFLECTED

STRONG RESULTS IN THE CLIENT FRANCHISE BUSINESSES. HOWEVER,

THESE RESULTS WERE LOWER THAN A STRONG 2008 AND INCLUDED

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMMISSIONS. RESULTS IN PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES

WERE POSITIVE COMPARED WITH LOSSES IN 2008. DURING 2009,

EQUITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN GLOBAL EQUITY PRICES, FAVORABLE MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES AND A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN VOLATILITY LEVELS.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS RECORDED NET REVENUES OF

$1.17 BILLION FOR 2009. THESE RESULTS INCLUDED A GAIN OF

$1.58 BILLION RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ORDINARY

SHARES OF ICBC, A GAIN OF $1.31 BILLION FROM CORPORATE

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS AND A LOSS OF $1.76 BILLION FROM REAL

ESTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATING EXPENSES OF $17.05 BILLION FOR 2009 INCREASED 44%

COMPARED WITH 2008, DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM HIGHER NET REVENUES. IN ADDITION,

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WERE HIGHER THAN 2008,

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES DURING 2009, WHILE BROKERAGE,

CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES WERE LOWER THAN 2008,

$1.7 BILLION ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SECURITIES

AND APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

AND SECURITIES. INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES AND

COMMODITIES EACH PRODUCED PARTICULARLY STRONG RESULTS AND NET

REVENUES WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2007. DURING 2008, ALTHOUGH

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY SOLID, FICC OPERATED IN A

CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY

BROAD-BASED

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, WIDER MORTGAGE AND CORPORATE CREDIT

SPREADS, REDUCED LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND

BROAD-BASED

INVESTOR DELEVERAGING, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES OF $9.21 BILLION FOR 2008

DECREASED 19% COMPARED WITH A PARTICULARLY STRONG 2007,

COMPARED WITH 2007, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM LOWER LEVELS OF DISCRETIONARY

COMPENSATION. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE

IMPACT OF REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES DURING 2008, AND HIGHER

BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING INCREASED ACTIVITY LEVELS IN EQUITIES AND FICC.

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY CONTINUED

WEAKNESS IN THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS.

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS

IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND CONTINUED HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY.

ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES



ASSET MANAGEMENT.

ASSET MANAGEMENT PROVIDES

COMMINGLED VEHICLES, SUCH AS MUTUAL FUNDS AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT

FUNDS) ACROSS ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF

FORM OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS OR FEES.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY GENERATE FEES AS A PERCENTAGE

OF ASSET VALUE, WHICH IS AFFECTED BY INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND

BY INFLOWS AND REDEMPTIONS. THE FEES THAT WE CHARGE VARY BY

ASSET CLASS, AS DO OUR RELATED EXPENSES. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FEES

BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF A FUNDS RETURN OR WHEN THE RETURN

ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT EXCEEDS SPECIFIED BENCHMARK RETURNS

OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TARGETS. INCENTIVE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN

THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDS (IN MOST CASES, ON DECEMBER

WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS

PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE SECURITIZATION OF COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CORPORATE BONDS, AND OTHER TYPES OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS. OTHER REASONS FOR ENTERING INTO THESE

ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE UNDERWRITING CLIENT SECURITIZATION

TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY; MAKING

INVESTMENTS IN PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING DEBT, EQUITY, REAL

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM (ASF)

ISSUED THE STREAMLINED FORECLOSURE AND LOSS AVOIDANCE

FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE

LOANS (ASF FRAMEWORK). THE ASF FRAMEWORK PROVIDES GUIDANCE

FOR SERVICERS TO STREAMLINE BORROWER EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND

TO FACILITATE THE USE OF FORECLOSURE AND LOSS PREVENTION

MEASURES FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES THAT

MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA. FOR CERTAIN ELIGIBLE LOANS AS DEFINED IN

THE ASF FRAMEWORK, SERVICERS MAY PRESUME DEFAULT IS REASONABLY

FORESEEABLE AND APPLY A

FAST-TRACK

LOAN MODIFICATION PLAN, UNDER WHICH THE LOAN INTEREST RATE WILL

BE KEPT AT THE THEN CURRENT RATE FOR A PERIOD UP TO FIVE YEARS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUITY

CAPITAL

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE DETERMINED

BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND AN INTERNAL

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL ASSESSMENT, AND MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY RATING AGENCY

GUIDELINES, SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT, CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ASSESSMENTS

OF POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR

BUSINESS AND MARKET ENVIRONMENTS.

OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE DETERMINED

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. OUR INTERNAL

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL ASSESSMENT IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MATERIAL

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MARKET

RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK, IN A MANNER THAT IS

CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

AS OF DECEMBER 2009, OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

WAS $70.71 BILLION (CONSISTING OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY OF $63.76 BILLION AND PREFERRED STOCK OF

$6.96 BILLION). AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, OUR TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $64.37 BILLION (CONSISTING OF

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF $47.90 BILLION AND

PREFERRED STOCK OF $16.47 BILLION). IN ADDITION TO TOTAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WE CONSIDER OUR $5.00 BILLION OF

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS TO BE PART OF OUR

EQUITY CAPITAL, AS IT QUALIFIES AS CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY AND

CERTAIN RATING AGENCY PURPOSES.

CONSOLIDATED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATOR OF

GROUP INC., A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT IN AUGUST 2009

ALSO BECAME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE

U.S. GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT OF 1999. AS A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. UNDER

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES, GOLDMAN

SACHS MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT INVOLVE

QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY REPORTING PRACTICES. THE

FIRMS CAPITAL LEVELS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE

JUDGMENTS BY ITS REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS

AND OTHER FACTORS.

RWAS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL GUIDELINES ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF MARKET

RISK AND CREDIT RISK. RWAS FOR MARKET RISK INCLUDE CERTAIN

MEASURES THAT ARE UNDER REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

CREDIT RISK FOR ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS IS BASED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET VALUE. FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, INCLUDING OTC

DERIVATIVES AND COMMITMENTS, A CREDIT EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IS

CALCULATED BASED ON THE NOTIONAL OF EACH TRADE. ALL SUCH ASSETS

AND AMOUNTS ARE THEN ASSIGNED A RISK WEIGHT DEPENDING ON, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK OR

QUALIFYING SECURITIES FIRM, OR OTHER ENTITY (OR IF COLLATERAL IS

HELD, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE COLLATERAL).

OUR TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL

UNDER BASEL I DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH

INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR DISALLOWED GOODWILL AND CERTAIN

INTANGIBLE ASSETS).

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATIONS REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4% AND A

MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 8%. THE REQUIRED MINIMUM

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO IN ORDER TO BE

CONSIDERED A WELL CAPITALIZED BANK HOLDING COMPANY

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES ARE 6% AND 10%,

RESPECTIVELY. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN

RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR

PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. THE MINIMUM

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

HAVE RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

MUST HAVE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%.

DURING 2009, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION PROPOSED

SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE METHOD OF COMPUTING CAPITAL RATIOS. IN

ADDITION, THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROPOSALS WHICH COULD

POTENTIALLY IMPACT CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED

UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATIONS COULD BE INCREASED. IT

IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES IN THE PRESCRIBED CALCULATION

METHODOLOGY COULD RESULT IN HIGHER RWAS AND LOWER CAPITAL RATIOS

THAN ARE CURRENTLY COMPUTED.

SUBSIDIARY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION AND

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. GS

BANK USA, A NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION (FDIC), IS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

AND THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS) ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES. GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA). GS BANK

USA COMPUTES ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO STATE

MEMBER BANKS, WHICH ARE BASED ON BASEL I AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF

ITS CAPITAL. GS BANK USAS CAPITAL LEVELS AND PCA

CLASSIFICATION ARE SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY ITS

REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.

GS&CO. AND GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTION & CLEARING,

L.P. ARE REGISTERED

U.S. BROKER-DEALERS

AND FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY THE SEC, THE

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE CHICAGO BOARD OF

TRADE, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, INC. AND THE

NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI)

AND GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD., OUR PRINCIPAL

NON-U.S. REGULATED

BROKER-DEALER

SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE

U.K.S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY AND JAPANS

SUBSIDIARIES NOT SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATORY CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS MAY HOLD CAPITAL TO SATISFY LOCAL TAX GUIDELINES,

RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS (FOR ENTITIES WITH ASSIGNED CREDIT

RATINGS) OR INTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES CONCERNING THE

MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CAPITAL A SUBSIDIARY SHOULD HOLD BASED ON ITS

UNDERLYING LEVEL OF RISK. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, GROUP INC.

MAY BE LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL HELD AT CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER

CONSTRAINTS. AS OF DECEMBER 2009, GROUP INC.S

EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES WAS $65.74 BILLION

COMPARED WITH ITS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF

$70.71 BILLION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF

GS&CO., GS BANK USA AND GS BANK EUROPE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, WE CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES

INTO GS BANK USA, AND GROUP INC. AGREED TO GUARANTEE

CERTAIN LOSSES, INCLUDING

CREDIT-RELATED

LOSSES, RELATING TO ASSETS HELD BY THE CONTRIBUTED ENTITIES. IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE, GROUP INC. ALSO AGREED TO

PLEDGE TO GS BANK USA CERTAIN COLLATERAL, INCLUDING INTERESTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS.

OUR CAPITAL INVESTED IN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF WHICH IS MANAGED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AND

NON-U.S.

DENOMINATED DEBT.

RATING AGENCY

GUIDELINES

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE

OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., WHICH DIRECTLY ISSUES OR

GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SENIOR UNSECURED

OBLIGATIONS. GS BANK USA HAS ALSO BEEN ASSIGNED A

LONG-TERM

ISSUER RATING AS WELL AS RATINGS ON ITS

LONG-TERM

AND

SHORT-TERM

BANK DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE ASSIGNED

RATINGS TO DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF

GROUP INC.

THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE

MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH

AGENCY HAS ITS OWN DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND

METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE

CALCULATION. SEE

 LIQUIDITY

AND FUNDING RISK  CREDIT RATINGS BELOW FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CREDIT RATINGS.

EQUITY CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT LEVEL AND OPTIMAL

COMPOSITION OF EQUITY CAPITAL. WE PRINCIPALLY MANAGE OUR CAPITAL

THROUGH ISSUANCES AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY

ALSO, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE OR REPURCHASE OUR PREFERRED

STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER

SUBORDINATED DEBT AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT. WE MANAGE OUR

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE

SHEET ASSETS

AND/OR

LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE AT BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED AND

BUSINESS UNIT LEVELS. WE ATTRIBUTE CAPITAL USAGE TO EACH OF OUR

BUSINESS UNITS BASED UPON OUR INTERNAL

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND MANAGE THE LEVELS OF USAGE BASED UPON THE

BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS ESTABLISHED.

STOCK OFFERING.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2009, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 46.7 MILLION COMMON

SHARES AT $123.00 PER SHARE FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF

$5.75 BILLION.

PREFERRED STOCK.

IN JUNE 2009, WE

REPURCHASED FROM THE U.S. TREASURY THE 10.0 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR FIXED RATE CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK,

SERIES H (SERIES H PREFERRED STOCK), THAT WERE ISSUED

TO THE U.S. TREASURY PURSUANT TO THE

U.S. TREASURYS TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. THE

REPURCHASE RESULTED IN A

ONE-TIME

PREFERRED DIVIDEND OF $426 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 2009. THIS

ONE-TIME

PREFERRED DIVIDEND REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

CARRYING VALUE AND THE REDEMPTION VALUE OF THE SERIES H

PREFERRED STOCK. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE

SERIES H PREFERRED STOCK IN OCTOBER 2008, WE ISSUED A

10-YEAR

WARRANT TO THE U.S. TREASURY TO PURCHASE UP TO

12.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$122.90 PER SHARE. WE REPURCHASED THIS WARRANT IN FULL IN

JULY 2009 FOR $1.1 BILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS A

REDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL

PAID-IN

CAPITAL. OUR CUMULATIVE PAYMENTS TO THE U.S. TREASURY

RELATED TO THE U.S. TREASURYS TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE

PROGRAM TOTALED $11.42 BILLION, INCLUDING THE RETURN OF THE

U.S. TREASURYS $10.0 BILLION INVESTMENT

(INCLUSIVE OF THE $426 MILLION DESCRIBED ABOVE),

$318 MILLION IN PREFERRED DIVIDENDS AND $1.1 BILLION

RELATED TO THE WARRANT REPURCHASE.

96

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN OCTOBER 2008, WE ISSUED TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY AND

CERTAIN AFFILIATES 50,000 SHARES OF 10% CUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES G (SERIES G

PREFERRED STOCK), AND A FIVE-YEAR WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO

43.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$115.00 PER SHARE, FOR AGGREGATE PROCEEDS OF $5.00 BILLION.

THE ALLOCATED CARRYING VALUES OF THE WARRANT AND THE

SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK (BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR

VALUES ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE) WERE $1.14 BILLION AND

$3.86 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE SERIES G PREFERRED

STOCK IS REDEEMABLE AT THE FIRMS OPTION, SUBJECT TO THE

APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AT A REDEMPTION VALUE OF

$5.50 BILLION, PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS.

ACCORDINGLY, UPON A REDEMPTION IN FULL AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE

OF THE SERIES G PREFERRED STOCK, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE A

ONE-TIME

PREFERRED DIVIDEND OF $1.64 BILLION (CALCULATED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND REDEMPTION VALUE OF

THE PREFERRED STOCK), WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO

OUR EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND TO OUR COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD OF REDEMPTION.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

WE SEEK TO USE OUR

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL

OF COMMON EQUITY AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE

COUNT OVER TIME RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY

THROUGH REGULAR

OPEN-MARKET

PURCHASES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED

PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITIONS

(I.E., COMPARISONS OF OUR DESIRED LEVEL OF CAPITAL TO OUR

ACTUAL LEVEL OF CAPITAL) BUT WHICH MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING

VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ANY REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

AS OF DECEMBER 2009, WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO

60.8 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO

OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD. SEE MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET

RISK

THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR TRADING AND

INVESTING POSITIONS IS REFERRED TO AS MARKET RISK. SUCH

POSITIONS RESULT FROM

MARKET-MAKING,

PROPRIETARY TRADING, UNDERWRITING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY POSITIONS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET

ON A DAILY BASIS AND CHANGES ARE RECORDED IN NET REVENUES.

CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATES,

EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. A

DESCRIPTION OF EACH MARKET RISK CATEGORY IS SET FORTH BELOW.



INTEREST RATE RISKS PRIMARILY RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES

IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE, THE

VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND

CREDIT SPREADS.



EQUITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES

AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, EQUITY BASKETS AND

EQUITY INDICES.



CURRENCY RATE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES.



COMMODITY PRICE RISKS RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT

PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS

ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND

PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.

WE SEEK TO MANAGE THESE RISKS BY DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES,

CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND ESTABLISHING ECONOMIC HEDGES IN

RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY SEEK TO

HEDGE A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCKS BY TAKING AN OFFSETTING

POSITION IN A RELATED

EQUITY-INDEX

FUTURES CONTRACT. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AN EXPOSURE MAY,

HOWEVER, BE LIMITED BY ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE LIQUIDITY OF THE

SECURITY OR THE RELATED HEDGE INSTRUMENT AND IN THE CORRELATION

OF PRICE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND RELATED HEDGE

INSTRUMENT.

IN ADDITION TO APPLYING BUSINESS JUDGMENT, SENIOR MANAGEMENT

USES A NUMBER OF QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO

MARKET RISK FOR TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE AND

TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE TOOLS

INCLUDE.



RISK LIMITS BASED ON A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE

REFERRED TO AS VAR;



SCENARIO ANALYSES, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT

MEASURE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON OUR TRADING NET REVENUES OF

VARIOUS MARKET EVENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A LARGE

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN EQUITY

MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT MOVES IN SELECTED EMERGING MARKETS; AND



INVENTORY POSITION LIMITS FOR SELECTED BUSINESS UNITS.

VAR

VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF TRADING POSITIONS DUE TO

ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A

SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

FOR THE VAR NUMBERS REPORTED BELOW, A

ONE-DAY

TIME

HORIZON AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL WERE USED. THIS MEANS THAT

THERE IS A 1 IN 20 CHANCE THAT DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES WILL

FALL BELOW THE EXPECTED DAILY TRADING NET REVENUES BY AN AMOUNT

AT LEAST AS LARGE AS THE REPORTED VAR. THUS, SHORTFALLS FROM

EXPECTED TRADING NET REVENUES ON A SINGLE TRADING DAY GREATER

THAN THE REPORTED VAR WOULD BE ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR, ON AVERAGE,

ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. SHORTFALLS ON A SINGLE DAY CAN EXCEED

REPORTED VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. SHORTFALLS CAN ALSO OCCUR

MORE FREQUENTLY OR ACCUMULATE OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON SUCH AS

A NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS.

103

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MODELING OF THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR TRADING

POSITIONS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS.

WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROXIMATIONS ARE

REASONABLE, THERE IS NO STANDARD METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING VAR,

AND DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS

AND/OR

APPROXIMATIONS COULD PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR ESTIMATES.

WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OUR VAR AND, TO BETTER

REFLECT CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WE GENERALLY WEIGHT

HISTORICAL DATA TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT

OBSERVATIONS. GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST

EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE

ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION OF VAR IS THAT THE

DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT

PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK. DIFFERENT

VAR METHODOLOGIES AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS COULD PRODUCE A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT VAR. MOREOVER, VAR CALCULATED FOR A

ONE-DAY

TIME

HORIZON DOES NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE MARKET RISK OF POSITIONS THAT

CANNOT BE LIQUIDATED OR OFFSET WITH HEDGES WITHIN ONE DAY.

OUR AVERAGE DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $218 MILLION IN 2009

FROM $180 MILLION IN 2008, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN INCREASE

IN THE INTEREST RATES CATEGORY AND A REDUCTION IN THE

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT ACROSS RISK CATEGORIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A DECREASE IN THE COMMODITY PRICES CATEGORY. THE INCREASE IN

INTEREST RATES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO WIDER SPREADS. THE DECREASE

IN COMMODITY PRICES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ENERGY PRICES.

OUR AVERAGE DAILY VAR INCREASED TO $180 MILLION IN 2008

FROM $138 MILLION IN 2007, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASES IN

THE INTEREST RATE, COMMODITY PRICE AND CURRENCY RATE CATEGORIES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE EQUITY PRICES CATEGORY.

THE INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

LEVELS OF VOLATILITY AND WIDER SPREADS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

POSITION REDUCTIONS, AND THE INCREASES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND

CURRENCY RATES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF

VOLATILITY. THE DECREASE IN EQUITY PRICES WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO

POSITION REDUCTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LEVELS OF

VOLATILITY.

VAR EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN

CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR OWN

CREDIT SPREADS ON UNSECURED BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION WAS ELECTED. THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY OF OUR NET

REVENUES TO A ONE BASIS POINT INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS

(COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN) ON DERIVATIVES WAS A $1 MILLION

LOSS AS OF DECEMBER 2009. IN ADDITION, THE ESTIMATED

SENSITIVITY OF OUR NET REVENUES TO A ONE BASIS POINT INCREASE IN

OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON UNSECURED BORROWINGS FOR WHICH THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS AN $8 MILLION GAIN

(INCLUDING HEDGES) AS OF DECEMBER 2009.

CURRENCY RATE CATEGORIES AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT ACROSS RISK CATEGORIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY AN INCREASE IN THE EQUITY PRICES CATEGORY. THE DECREASE IN

INTEREST RATES WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LOWER MARKET VOLATILITIES,

RISK MEASURES

CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS AND INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

(E.G., DUE TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

AND/OR

ILLIQUIDITY). THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN THE

ORDINARY SHARES OF ICBC, EXCLUDING INTERESTS HELD BY INVESTMENT

FUNDS MANAGED BY GOLDMAN SACHS, IS MEASURED BY ESTIMATING THE

POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10%

DECLINE IN THE ICBC ORDINARY SHARE PRICE. THE MARKET RISK

RELATED TO THE REMAINING POSITIONS IS MEASURED BY ESTIMATING THE

POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN NET REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH A 10%

DECLINE IN ASSET VALUES.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSITIONS IN

THESE PORTFOLIOS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, WE MAKE

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD AND WE ALSO

MAKE DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN REAL

ESTATE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION.

FUNDS TYPICALLY EMPLOY LEVERAGE AS PART OF THE INVESTMENT

STRATEGY. THIS SENSITIVITY MEASURE IS BASED ON OUR PERCENTAGE

OWNERSHIP OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET VALUES IN THE FUNDS AND

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO THE FUNDS.

THE DECREASE IN OUR 10% SENSITIVITY MEASURES AS OF

DECEMBER 2009 FROM NOVEMBER 2008 FOR DEBT AND EQUITY

POSITIONS IN THE FICC AND EQUITIES COMPONENTS OF OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS SEGMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS DUE TO DISPOSITIONS.

THE DECREASE IN OUR 10% SENSITIVITY MEASURE FOR EQUITY POSITIONS

IN OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

DISPOSITIONS. THE INCREASE IN OUR 10% SENSITIVITY MEASURE FOR

DEBT POSITIONS IN OUR PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW INVESTMENT ACTIVITY. THE DECREASE IN OUR

10% SENSITIVITY MEASURE FOR REAL ESTATE POSITIONS IN OUR

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COMPONENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR AND THE OTHER RISK

MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS OF DECEMBER 2009, WE HELD

APPROXIMATELY $10.70 BILLION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN

OUR BANK AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF

$5.12 BILLION OF MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS,

$1.25 BILLION OF GOVERNMENT AND U.S. FEDERAL AGENCY

OBLIGATIONS, $2.78 BILLION OF CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND

OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND $1.31 BILLION OF MORTGAGE AND

CREDIT

RISK

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS THAT WE WOULD INCUR IF A

COUNTERPARTY OR AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS WE

HOLD FAILS TO PERFORM UNDER ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO US,

OR UPON A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIRD PARTIES

WHOSE SECURITIES OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTC

DERIVATIVES, WE HOLD. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY

ARISES THROUGH OUR TRADING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE SEEK TO ENTER INTO NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. IN ADDITION,

WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES BY (I) ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE

US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM A COUNTERPARTY ON AN UPFRONT OR

CONTINGENT BASIS, (II) SEEKING

THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS,

AND/OR

(III) TRANSFERRING OUR CREDIT RISK TO THIRD PARTIES USING

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

AND/OR

OTHER

STRUCTURES AND TECHNIQUES.

TO MEASURE AND MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, WE USE A VARIETY OF

TOOLS, INCLUDING CREDIT LIMITS REFERENCED TO CURRENT EXPOSURE

AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE IS AN ESTIMATE OF

EXPOSURE, WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THAT COULD BE

OUTSTANDING OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION BASED ON MARKET

MOVEMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS, FOR POSITIONS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS, WE

USE VAR AND OTHER SENSITIVITY MEASURES. TO SUPPLEMENT OUR

PRIMARY CREDIT EXPOSURE MEASURES, WE ALSO USE SCENARIO ANALYSES,

SUCH AS CREDIT SPREAD WIDENING SCENARIOS, STRESS TESTS AND OTHER

QUANTITATIVE TOOLS.

OUR GLOBAL CREDIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MONITOR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO

COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. THESE SYSTEMS ALSO

PROVIDE MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRMWIDE RISK AND CREDIT

POLICY COMMITTEES, WITH INFORMATION REGARDING CREDIT RISK BY

PRODUCT, INDUSTRY SECTOR, COUNTRY AND REGION.

WHILE OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND

COUNTERPARTIES, WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE A HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS,

CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. THIS HAS

RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO

THIS INDUSTRY. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY ALSO

BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR

COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER OR ISSUER, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS,

OR TO A PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSE OR EXCHANGE.

AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, WE HELD

$83.83 BILLION (10% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND

$53.98 BILLION (6% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDED IN

TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE AND CASH AND

SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER PURPOSES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS OF

DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, WE HELD

$38.61 BILLION (5% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND $21.13 BILLION

(2% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF OTHER SOVEREIGN

OBLIGATIONS, PRINCIPALLY CONSISTING OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE

GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN. IN ADDITION, AS OF

DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, $87.63 BILLION

AND $126.27 BILLION OF OUR SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED (INCLUDING THOSE IN

CASH AND SECURITIES SEGREGATED FOR REGULATORY AND OTHER

PURPOSES), RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLATERALIZED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS. AS OF

DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, $77.99 BILLION

AND $65.37 BILLION OF OUR SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

COLLATERALIZED BY OTHER SOVEREIGN OBLIGATIONS, PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTING OF SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANY,

THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN. AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND

NOVEMBER 2008, WE DID NOT HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY OTHER

COUNTERPARTY THAT EXCEEDED 2% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED

INTO TO FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY

POSITIONS OR AS A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES, WE

ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON

OUR NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

AND TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON OUR

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND WE BELIEVE

THAT THE ASSOCIATED MARKET RISK CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD RELATIVE

TO ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OR RISKS BEING HEDGED, OR AS

PART OF A BROADER TRADING STRATEGY. ACCORDINGLY, THE MARKET RISK

OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS IS MANAGED TOGETHER WITH OUR

NONDERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IS REFLECTED NET OF

CASH PAID OR RECEIVED PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND

IS REPORTED ON A

NET-BY-COUNTERPARTY

BASIS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WHEN

WE BELIEVE A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF EXISTS UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE

NETTING AGREEMENT. FOR AN OTC DERIVATIVE, OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE IS

DIRECTLY WITH OUR COUNTERPARTY AND CONTINUES UNTIL THE MATURITY

OR TERMINATION OF SUCH CONTRACT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SET FORTH THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR OTC

DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY TENOR AND BY PRODUCT TYPE

OR CREDIT RATING. TENOR IS BASED ON EXPECTED DURATION FOR

MORTGAGE-RELATED

CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND GENERALLY ON REMAINING CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY FOR OTHER DERIVATIVES. FOR OPTION CONTRACTS THAT

REQUIRE SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF AN UNDERLYING DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT, THE TENOR IS GENERALLY CLASSIFIED BASED UPON THE

MATURITY DATE OF THE UNDERLYING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. IN THOSE

INSTANCES WHERE THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT DOES NOT HAVE A

MATURITY DATE OR EITHER COUNTERPARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO SETTLE IN

CASH, THE TENOR IS GENERALLY BASED UPON THE OPTION EXPIRATION

DATE.

THE RISK THAT THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATE FOR A

OR THAT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE

COUNTERPARTY. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS BY OBTAINING

ADVICE OF COUNSEL ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS

ON THE AUTHORITY OF A COUNTERPARTY TO EFFECT THE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

(E.G., CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS) INVOLVE THE RISK THAT

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING, OR BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY OR OBLIGATION IN ORDER TO SATISFY ANY

PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING RISK

LIQUIDITY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO COMPANIES IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOST FAILURES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN LARGE PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT

LIQUIDITY. ACCORDINGLY, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS IN PLACE A

COMPREHENSIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES THAT ARE

INTENDED TO MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS BOTH

GOLDMAN SACHS-SPECIFIC AND BROADER INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY

EVENTS. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO

FUND GOLDMAN SACHS AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO

CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING FRAMEWORK.



EXCESS LIQUIDITY  WE MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL EXCESS

LIQUIDITY TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS IN A

STRESSED ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FINANCING OBLIGATIONS. THE

AMOUNT OF OUR EXCESS LIQUIDITY IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY

MODEL TOGETHER WITH A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF

THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OF GOLDMAN SACHS.



ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT  OUR FUNDING STRATEGY INCLUDES AN

ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR ASSETS WITH

RESPECT TO THEIR ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIODS AND POTENTIAL

ILLIQUIDITY IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, WE MANAGE

THE MATURITIES AND DIVERSITY OF OUR SECURED AND UNSECURED

FUNDING LIABILITIES ACROSS MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES,

AND WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN LIABILITIES OF APPROPRIATE TERM RELATIVE

TO OUR ASSET BASE.



CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN (CFP)  WE MAINTAIN A CFP TO

HELP IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND MITIGATE LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING RISK. THE CFP CONSIDERS VARIOUS RISK FACTORS THAT COULD

OCCUR DURING A CRISIS AND PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND

RESPONDING TO A LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

EXCESS

LIQUIDITY

OUR MOST IMPORTANT LIQUIDITY POLICY IS TO

PRE-FUND

WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR POTENTIAL CASH NEEDS DURING A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD SUCH EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF

UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT MAY BE SOLD OR

PLEDGED TO PROVIDE

SAME-DAY

LIQUIDITY. THIS GLOBAL CORE EXCESS IS INTENDED TO

ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL

OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POOL OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY PROVIDES

US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.

OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.



THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST

CRITICAL TO A COMPANYS SURVIVAL.



FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL

OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. OUR

BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND OUR CASH NEEDS ARE DRIVEN BY MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND

CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A

DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.



DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS,

CREDIT-SENSITIVE

FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED

FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE, AND THE TERMS OR

AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE.



AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO

PRE-FUND

LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD

MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER DEBT BALANCES THAN

OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID

UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR TOTAL

ASSETS, AND OUR FUNDING COSTS.

NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

KINGDOM AND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS AND CERTAIN OVERNIGHT CASH

DEPOSITS IN HIGHLY LIQUID CURRENCIES. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR

GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO THIS NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES

AND CASH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A

DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OTHER

POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY, SUCH AS LOWER-QUALITY

UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, ARE AS

RELIABLE IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAINTAIN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS TO ENABLE US TO MEET CURRENT

AND POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY,

GROUP INC., AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS IS HELD AT GROUP INC. AND OUR MAJOR

BROKER-DEALER

AND BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. EACH OF THESE

ENTITIES HAS ITS OWN LIQUIDITY MODEL AND FUNDING RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK WITH SEPARATE EXCESS LIQUIDITY POOLS INTENDED TO MEET

POTENTIAL OUTFLOWS IN EACH ENTITY IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

LIQUIDITY HELD IN EACH OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES IS ASSUMED TO BE

USABLE ONLY BY THAT ENTITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING ITS

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. SUBSIDIARY LIQUIDITY IS NOT AVAILABLE TO

GROUP INC. UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR AND ASSUMING NO

ADDITIONAL REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS.

IN ADDITION TO OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AS A RESULT OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THESE ASSETS INCLUDE OTHER GOVERNMENT

BONDS,

HIGH-GRADE

MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND MARGINABLE

EQUITIES. WE DO NOT INCLUDE THESE SECURITIES IN OUR GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS.

IN REPORTING OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS AND OTHER UNENCUMBERED

ASSETS, WE USE LOAN VALUES THAT ARE BASED ON

STRESS-SCENARIO

BORROWING CAPACITY AND WE REGULARLY REVIEW THESE ASSUMPTIONS

ASSET CLASS BY ASSET CLASS. THE ESTIMATED AGGREGATE LOAN VALUE

OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS, CASH DEPOSITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A LIQUID BALANCE

UTILIZE AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AS A DISINCENTIVE TO OUR BUSINESSES TO HOLD INVENTORY OVER

LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES

DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY, MARKET CONVENTIONS AND PERIODIC MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND

ADJUSTED ASSETS AT FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATES ARE TYPICALLY NOT

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR REPORTING

PERIODS.

LIABILITIES.

WE SEEK TO STRUCTURE OUR

LIABILITIES TO MEET THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



TERM STRUCTURE  WE SEEK TO STRUCTURE OUR LIABILITIES

TO HAVE

LONG-DATED

MATURITIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE REFINANCING RISK. WE MANAGE

MATURITY CONCENTRATIONS FOR BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING

TO ENSURE WE ARE ABLE TO MITIGATE ANY CONCENTRATED FUNDING

OUTFLOWS.



DIVERSITY OF FUNDING SOURCES  WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN

BROAD AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES GLOBALLY FOR BOTH SECURED

AND UNSECURED FUNDING. WE MAKE USE OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT

AND SECURITIES LENDING MARKETS, AS WELL AS OTHER SECURED FUNDING

MARKETS. WE ISSUE

LONG-TERM

DEBT THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS,

U.S. REGISTERED AND 144A

MEDIUM-TERM

NOTE OFFERINGS AND OTHER DEBT OFFERINGS. WE ISSUE

PAPER AND PROMISSORY NOTE ISSUANCES AND OTHER METHODS. WE RAISE

DEMAND AND SAVINGS DEPOSITS THROUGH CASH SWEEP PROGRAMS AND TIME

DEPOSITS THROUGH INTERNAL AND

THIRD-PARTY

BROKER NETWORKS. WE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDING PRODUCTS

THROUGH OUR OWN SALES FORCE TO A LARGE, DIVERSE GLOBAL CREDITOR

BASE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE

CRITICAL TO OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR CREDITORS INCLUDE BANKS,

GOVERNMENTS, SECURITIES LENDERS, PENSION FUNDS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUALS. WE ACCESS FUNDING IN A

VARIETY OF MARKETS IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE AND ASIA. WE HAVE

IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL GUIDELINES ON CREDITOR CONCENTRATION,

INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND PROMISSORY

NOTES THAT CAN BE OWNED BY ANY SINGLE CREDITOR OR GROUP OF

CREDITORS.



STRUCTURAL PROTECTION  WE STRUCTURE OUR LIABILITIES

TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDEEM OR

REPURCHASE CERTAIN OF OUR BORROWINGS PRIOR TO THEIR CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY. WE ISSUE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT

WITHOUT PUT PROVISIONS OR OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WOULD, BASED

SOLELY UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL

RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR STOCK PRICE, TRIGGER A

REQUIREMENT FOR AN EARLY PAYMENT, COLLATERAL SUPPORT, CHANGE IN

TERMS, ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OR THE CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL

FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURED FUNDING.

WE FUND A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION

OF OUR INVENTORY ON A SECURED BASIS, WHICH WE BELIEVE PROVIDES

US WITH A MORE STABLE SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY THAN UNSECURED

FINANCING, AS IT IS LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT

QUALITY DUE TO THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE

THAT THE TERMS OR AVAILABILITY OF SECURED FUNDING, PARTICULARLY

OVERNIGHT FUNDING, CAN DETERIORATE RAPIDLY IN A DIFFICULT

ENVIRONMENT. TO HELP MITIGATE THIS RISK, WE GENERALLY DO NOT

RELY ON OVERNIGHT SECURED FUNDING, UNLESS COLLATERALIZED WITH

HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES SUCH AS SECURITIES ELIGIBLE FOR

INCLUSION IN OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

OTHER SECURED FUNDING IS EXECUTED FOR TENORS OF ONE MONTH OR

GREATER. ADDITIONALLY, WE MONITOR COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION AND

HOLD A PORTION OF OUR GLOBAL CORE EXCESS FOR REFINANCING RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH ALL SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS. WE SEEK LONGER

TERMS FOR SECURED FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY LOWER-QUALITY

ASSETS, AS WE BELIEVE THESE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS MAY POSE

GREATER REFINANCING RISK. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF OUR

SECURED FUNDING, EXCLUDING FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY HIGHLY

LIQUID SECURITIES ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN OUR GLOBAL CORE

EXCESS, EXCEEDED 100 DAYS AS OF DECEMBER 2009.

UNSECURED

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS.

OUR LIQUIDITY ALSO DEPENDS ON THE

STABILITY OF OUR UNSECURED

SHORT-TERM

FINANCING BASE. ACCORDINGLY, WE PREFER ISSUING PROMISSORY NOTES,

IN WHICH WE DO NOT MAKE A MARKET, OVER COMMERCIAL PAPER, WHICH

WE MAY REPURCHASE PRIOR TO MATURITY THROUGH THE ORDINARY COURSE

OF BUSINESS AS A MARKET MAKER. AS OF DECEMBER 2009, OUR

UNSECURED

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION OF UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS, WERE $37.52 BILLION. SEE NOTE 6 TO THE

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR UNSECURED

YEARS. TO MITIGATE REFINANCING RISK, WE SEEK TO LIMIT THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT MATURING ON ANY ONE DAY OR DURING ANY

WEEK OR YEAR. WE SWAP A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS INTO

SHORT-TERM

FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATES.

DEPOSITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 2009, OUR BANK

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES HAD $39.42 BILLION IN

CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, INCLUDING $9.30 BILLION OF CERTIFICATES

OF DEPOSIT AND OTHER TIME DEPOSITS WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE

MATURITY OF FOUR YEARS, AND $30.12 BILLION OF OTHER

DEPOSITS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WERE FROM CASH SWEEP

PROGRAMS. GS BANK USA HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING THROUGH THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHILE WE DO NOT RELY ON FUNDING

THROUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW IN OUR

LIQUIDITY MODELING AND STRESS TESTING, WE MAINTAIN POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES NECESSARY TO ACCESS THIS FUNDING.

GOVERNMENT FACILITIES.

AS A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY, WE HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES

ESTABLISHED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS BY A NUMBER OF

U.S. REGULATORY AGENCIES. AS OF DECEMBER 2009, WE HAD

(COMPRISED OF $1.73 BILLION OF

SHORT-TERM

AND $19.03 BILLION OF

LONG-TERM)

GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC UNDER THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE

PROGRAM (TLGP), ALL OF WHICH WILL MATURE ON OR PRIOR TO

WE SEEK TO MANAGE OUR ASSETS

AND THE MATURITY PROFILE OF OUR SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING

BASE SUCH THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS PRIOR

TO OUR LIABILITIES COMING DUE, EVEN IN TIMES OF PROLONGED OR

SEVERE LIQUIDITY STRESS.

IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES (OTHER THAN OUR GLOBAL

CORE EXCESS), OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT

TOTAL CAPITAL (UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) TO FUND OUR

BALANCE SHEET FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT

ORDERLY ASSET SALES MAY BE PRUDENT OR NECESSARY IN A SEVERE OR

PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS. THE TARGET AMOUNT OF OUR TOTAL

CAPITAL IS BASED ON AN INTERNAL FUNDING MODEL WHICH

INCORPORATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING

LONG-TERM

FINANCING REQUIREMENTS.



THE PORTION OF TRADING ASSETS THAT WE BELIEVE COULD NOT BE

FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS IN PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS, ASSUMING

STRESSED LOAN VALUES;



GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER ILLIQUID ASSETS;

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO FUND ON A

SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES.

THE MAJORITY OF

OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY GROUP INC.

GROUP INC. THEN LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET

FINANCING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION,

GROUP INC. PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE

NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE

BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING INCLUDE ENHANCED

CONTROL AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IS ALSO RAISED AT THE SUBSIDIARY

LEVEL THROUGH A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SECURED FUNDING,

UNSECURED BORROWINGS AND DEPOSITS.

OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ARE PREDICATED ON AN

ASSUMPTION THAT, UNLESS LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR, FUNDS OR

SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE FROM A SUBSIDIARY TO ITS

PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY

BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND

COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE

PAYMENTS ON OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. AS SUCH, WE

ASSUME THAT CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES UNTIL THE MATURITY OF SUCH FINANCING.

GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DECEMBER 2009,

GROUP INC. HAD $25.45 BILLION OF SUCH EQUITY AND

SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GS&CO., ITS PRINCIPAL

U.S. REGISTERED

BROKER-DEALER;

$21.90 BILLION INVESTED IN GSI, A REGULATED U.K.

BROKER-DEALER;

$2.64 BILLION INVESTED IN GOLDMAN SACHS

EXECUTION & CLEARING, L.P., A U.S. REGISTERED

$22.32 BILLION INVESTED IN GS BANK USA, A REGULATED NEW

OF DECEMBER 2009, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL

INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CONTINGENCY

FUNDING PLAN

THE GOLDMAN SACHS CFP SETS OUT THE PLAN OF ACTION TO FUND

BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

AND/OR

PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THE CFP OUTLINES THE APPROPRIATE

COMMUNICATION CHANNELS TO BE FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT A CRISIS PERIOD

AND ALSO PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A

LIQUIDITY CRISIS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE POTENTIAL

RISK FACTORS, IDENTIFICATION OF LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS, MITIGANTS

AND POTENTIAL ACTIONS.

CREDIT

RATINGS

WE RELY UPON THE

SHORT-TERM

AND

LONG-TERM

DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

DAY-TO-DAY

OPERATIONS. THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING IS

INFLUENCED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT

WHEN WE ARE COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND WHEN WE SEEK TO

ENGAGE IN LONGER-TERM TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING OTC DERIVATIVES.

WE BELIEVE OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT

RATING AGENCIES ASSESSMENT OF OUR LIQUIDITY, MARKET,

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THE LEVEL AND

VARIABILITY OF OUR EARNINGS, OUR CAPITAL BASE, OUR FRANCHISE,

REPUTATION AND MANAGEMENT, OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE

EXTERNAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE PERCEIVED LEVEL OF

GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. SEE

BY COUNTERPARTIES IN THE EVENT OF A

CONSIDER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT MAY

BE REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A

REDUCTION IN OUR

LONG-TERM

CREDIT RATINGS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED

BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

CASH

FLOWS

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX

AND INTERRELATED AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS

AND NET ASSETS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN EVALUATING OUR

LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AND

ASSET-LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY,

HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESSES.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2009.

OUR CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $24.49 BILLION TO

$38.29 BILLION AT THE END OF 2009. WE GENERATED

$48.88 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. WE

USED NET CASH OF $24.39 BILLION FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FOR NET REPAYMENTS IN UNSECURED AND

SECURED

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS AND THE REPURCHASES OF SERIES H PREFERRED STOCK

AND THE RELATED COMMON STOCK WARRANT FROM THE

U.S. TREASURY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN BANK

DEPOSITS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2008.

OUR CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $5.46 BILLION TO

$15.74 BILLION AT THE END OF 2008. WE RAISED

$9.80 BILLION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING AND OPERATING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FROM COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK ISSUANCES

AND DEPOSITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REPAYMENTS OF

SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS. WE USED NET CASH OF $4.34 BILLION IN OUR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

OPERATIONAL

RISK

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

SHORTCOMINGS OR FAILURES IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR

SYSTEMS, OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN ARISE

FROM MANY FACTORS RANGING FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS TO

POTENTIALLY COSTLY INCIDENTS RELATED TO, FOR EXAMPLE, MAJOR

SYSTEMS FAILURES. OPERATIONAL RISK MAY ALSO CAUSE REPUTATIONAL

HARM. THUS, EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY, MANAGE AND MITIGATE OPERATIONAL

RISK MUST BE EQUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE RISK OF REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AS WELL AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS.

WE MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF

LONG-STANDING,

BUT CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING, FIRMWIDE CONTROL STANDARDS WHICH ARE

SUPPORTED BY THE TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

PEOPLE; THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND COMMITMENT OF SENIOR

MANAGEMENT IN A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING

KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS ACROSS GOLDMAN SACHS; AND A FRAMEWORK OF

STRONG AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL DEPARTMENTS THAT MONITOR

OPERATIONAL RISK ON A DAILY BASIS. TOGETHER, THESE ELEMENTS FORM

A STRONG FIRMWIDE CONTROL CULTURE THAT SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION

OF OUR EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT & ANALYSIS, A RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS,

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A FORMALIZED

FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, AND REPORT OPERATIONAL

RISKS TO SUPPORT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT ACROSS GOLDMAN SACHS.

THIS FRAMEWORK, WHICH EVOLVES WITH THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR

BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE, INCORPORATES ANALYSIS OF

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS, BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL FACTORS, AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS.

THE FRAMEWORK ALSO PROVIDES REGULAR REPORTING OF OUR OPERATIONAL

RISK EXPOSURES TO OUR BOARD, RISK COMMITTEES AND SENIOR

MANAGEMENT. FOR

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (THE FIRM), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED UNDER THE SUPERVISION

OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

OFFICERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.

AS OF THE END OF THE FIRMS 2009 FISCAL YEAR, MANAGEMENT

CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS

DETERMINED THAT THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS EFFECTIVE.

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES THAT PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT,

IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS

AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS; PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND THE DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM; AND

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE

FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT APPEARING ON

PAGE 124, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC..

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

NOVEMBER 28, 2008, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS

AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009, NOVEMBER 28, 2008 AND

NOVEMBER 30, 2007 AND FOR THE

ONE-MONTH

PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 26, 2008 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING APPEARING ON PAGE 123. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED

ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (GROUP INC.), A DELAWARE

CORPORATION, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

(COLLECTIVELY, THE FIRM), IS A LEADING GLOBAL INVESTMENT

BANKING, SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM THAT PROVIDES

A WIDE RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO A SUBSTANTIAL AND

DIVERSIFIED CLIENT BASE THAT INCLUDES CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH

INDIVIDUALS. FOUNDED IN 1869, THE FIRM IS HEADQUARTERED IN NEW

YORK AND MAINTAINS OFFICES IN LONDON, FRANKFURT, TOKYO, HONG

KONG AND OTHER MAJOR FINANCIAL CENTERS AROUND THE WORLD.

THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANKING.

THE FIRM PROVIDES A BROAD

RANGE OF INVESTMENT BANKING SERVICES TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF

CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTMENT FUNDS,

GOVERNMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS.



TRADING AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM

FACILITATES CLIENT TRANSACTIONS WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF

CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTMENT FUNDS,

GOVERNMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH MARKET MAKING IN, TRADING OF

AND INVESTING IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, CURRENCIES,

COMMODITIES AND DERIVATIVES ON THESE PRODUCTS. THE FIRM ALSO

TAKES PROPRIETARY POSITIONS ON CERTAIN OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM ENGAGES IN

MARKET-MAKING

ACTIVITIES ON EQUITIES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES, AND THE FIRM

CLEARS CLIENT TRANSACTIONS ON MAJOR STOCK, OPTIONS AND FUTURES

EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS MERCHANT

BANKING AND OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM MAKES PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FUNDS THAT THE FIRM RAISES AND

MANAGES.



ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

THE

FIRM PROVIDES INVESTMENT AND WEALTH ADVISORY SERVICES AND OFFERS

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS (PRIMARILY THROUGH SEPARATELY MANAGED

ACCOUNTS AND COMMINGLED VEHICLES, SUCH AS MUTUAL FUNDS AND

PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS) ACROSS ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES TO A

DIVERSE GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE AND

PROVIDES PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES, FINANCING SERVICES AND

SECURITIES LENDING SERVICES TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING

HEDGE FUNDS, MUTUAL FUNDS, PENSION FUNDS AND FOUNDATIONS, AND TO

HIGH-NET-WORTH

NOTE 2.

SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

GROUP INC. AND ALL OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS

A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY, A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) OR A

QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITY (QSPE) UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP).



VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES.

VOTING INTEREST

ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES IN WHICH (I) THE TOTAL EQUITY

INVESTMENT AT RISK IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE ENTITY TO FINANCE

ITS ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENTLY AND (II) THE EQUITY HOLDERS

HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES, THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

RESIDUAL RETURNS AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE

ENTITYS ACTIVITIES. THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY IS OWNERSHIP OF A

MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS A MAJORITY VOTING

INTEREST.

131

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

VIES ARE ENTITIES

THAT LACK ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VOTING

INTEREST ENTITY. A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE IS

PRESENT WHEN AN ENTERPRISE HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST, OR A

COMBINATION OF VARIABLE INTERESTS, THAT WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY

OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES, RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE

VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. THE ENTERPRISE

WITH A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY, CONSOLIDATES THE VIE. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER

IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE BY FIRST PERFORMING A

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND

EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS. THIS ANALYSIS INCLUDES A REVIEW OF,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

CONTRACTUAL TERMS, WHICH INTERESTS CREATE OR ABSORB VARIABILITY,

RELATED PARTY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DESIGN OF THE VIE. WHERE

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE FIRM PERFORMS A

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING A VIES

EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS TO ITS VARIABLE

INTEREST HOLDERS, THE FIRM UTILIZES THE TOP DOWN

METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, THE FIRM CALCULATES ITS SHARE OF THE

VIES EXPECTED LOSSES AND EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS USING

THE SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO IT, BASED ON

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

AND/OR

THE

FIRMS POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE VIE, UNDER

VARIOUS PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED SCENARIOS. THE FIRM REASSESSES ITS

INITIAL EVALUATION OF AN ENTITY AS A VIE AND ITS INITIAL

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE FIRM IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF

A VIE UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN RECONSIDERATION EVENTS. SEE

 RECENT

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS BELOW FOR INFORMATION REGARDING

AMENDMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR VIES.



QSPES.

QSPES ARE PASSIVE ENTITIES THAT ARE

COMMONLY USED IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS.

TO BE CONSIDERED A QSPE, AN ENTITY MUST SATISFY CERTAIN

CRITERIA. THESE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE TYPES OF ASSETS A QSPE MAY

HOLD, LIMITS ON ASSET SALES, THE USE OF DERIVATIVES AND

FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, AND THE LEVEL OF DISCRETION A SERVICER MAY

EXERCISE IN ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT RECEIVABLES. THESE CRITERIA

MAY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT COMPLEX MATTERS,

SUCH AS WHETHER A DERIVATIVE IS CONSIDERED PASSIVE AND THE LEVEL

OF DISCRETION A SERVICER MAY EXERCISE, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE,

DETERMINING WHEN DEFAULT IS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. THE FIRM

DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE QSPES. SEE

 RECENT

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS BELOW FOR INFORMATION REGARDING

AMENDMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR QSPES.



EQUITY-METHOD

INVESTMENTS.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BUT EXERTS

SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ENTITYS OPERATING AND

FINANCIAL POLICIES (GENERALLY DEFINED AS OWNING A VOTING

INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%) AND HAS AN INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OR

IN-SUBSTANCE

COMMON STOCK, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT EITHER UNDER

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING OR AT FAIR VALUE PURSUANT TO THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION AVAILABLE UNDER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION

(ASC) 825-10.

IN GENERAL, THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED

SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 24, 2006, WHEN THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION BECAME AVAILABLE, AT FAIR VALUE. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE

FIRM APPLIES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO NEW INVESTMENTS

THAT ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE OR CLOSELY RELATED TO THE

FIRMS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WHERE THE FIRM HAS A

SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASH FLOWS OR

OPERATIONS OF THE INVESTEE, OR WHERE

COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS ARE LESS SIGNIFICANT. SEE

LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

FIRMS APPLICATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.



OTHER.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE AN

ENTITY OR APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE FIRM

ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ALSO HAS

FORMED NUMEROUS NONCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT FUNDS WITH

THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS THAT ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.

THE FIRM ACTS AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR THESE FUNDS AND GENERALLY

DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THESE

FUNDS. THE FIRM HAS GENERALLY PROVIDED THE

THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS WITH RIGHTS TO TERMINATE THE FUNDS OR TO REMOVE THE

FIRM AS THE GENERAL PARTNER. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE THESE FUNDS. THESE FUND INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN

TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN CONNECTION WITH BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM WAS

REQUIRED TO CHANGE ITS FISCAL YEAR-END FROM NOVEMBER TO

DECEMBER. THIS CHANGE IN THE FIRMS FISCAL YEAR-END

RESULTED IN A

ONE-MONTH

TRANSITION PERIOD THAT BEGAN ON NOVEMBER 29, 2008 AND

ENDED ON DECEMBER 26, 2008. IN APRIL 2009, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GROUP INC. (THE BOARD) APPROVED A

CHANGE IN THE FIRMS FISCAL YEAR-END FROM THE LAST FRIDAY

OF DECEMBER TO DECEMBER 31. FISCAL 2009 BEGAN ON

DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND ENDED ON

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

NOVEMBER 30, 2007, RESPECTIVELY, AND ANY REFERENCE TO

A FUTURE YEAR REFERS TO A FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON DECEMBER 31 OF

THAT YEAR. ALL REFERENCES TO DECEMBER 2008, UNLESS

SPECIFICALLY STATED OTHERWISE, REFER TO THE FIRMS FISCAL

ONE MONTH ENDED, OR THE DATE, AS THE CONTEXT REQUIRES,

MADE TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT

REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATE TO

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL

LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

AND TAX AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE AND OTHER ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR

VALUE.

IN ADDITION TO TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR

VALUE AND TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM HAS

ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE UNDER ASC

815-15

AND

825-10

(I.E., THE FAIR VALUE OPTION). THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR

ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE TO REFLECT ECONOMIC EVENTS IN

EARNINGS ON A TIMELY BASIS, TO MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS

FROM USING DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES AND TO ADDRESS

SIMPLIFICATION AND

COST-BENEFIT

CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR AT

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO

SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE

(I.E., THE EXIT PRICE). FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID

PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS.

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY UNDER ASC 820 PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO

VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY

GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE

MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1

MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

(LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). THE THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

BASIS OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT

LEVEL 1

UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2

QUOTED PRICES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE OR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE

OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY;

LEVEL 3

PRICES OR VALUATIONS THAT REQUIRE INPUTS THAT ARE BOTH

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND UNOBSERVABLE.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BASED ON

THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME BOTH IN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND

RELATIVE TO THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION FOR THE INSTRUMENT. THE

FIRM DEFINES ACTIVE MARKETS FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS BASED ON BOTH

THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS WITH

TRADING ACTIVITY.

134

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CREDIT RISK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF FAIR VALUE. CASH

PRODUCTS (E.G., BONDS AND LOANS) AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

(PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT FUTURE PROJECTED CASH

FLOWS) TRADE IN THE MARKET AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT CREDIT

CONSIDERATIONS. THE FIRM CALCULATES THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE

ASSETS BY DISCOUNTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT A RATE WHICH

INCORPORATES COUNTERPARTY CREDIT SPREADS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES BY DISCOUNTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT A

RATE WHICH INCORPORATES THE FIRMS OWN CREDIT SPREADS. IN

DOING SO, CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT MITIGANTS,

NAMELY COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS WHICH REDUCE EXPOSURES BASED ON

TRIGGERS AND CONTRACTUAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM MANAGES

ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK AS IT DOES OTHER MARKET RISKS AND

WILL PRICE, ECONOMICALLY HEDGE, FACILITATE AND INTERMEDIATE

TRADES WHICH INVOLVE CREDIT RISK. THE FIRM RECORDS LIQUIDITY

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING

CONCENTRATED RISK POSITIONS, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO THE

FIRMS OWN CREDIT SPREADS.

IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM SEPARATES TRADING ASSETS, AT

FAIR VALUE AND TRADING LIABILITIES, AT FAIR VALUE INTO TWO

CATEGORIES: CASH INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.



CASH INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRMS CASH

INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR

LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BECAUSE THEY ARE VALUED

USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR

ALTERNATIVE PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE

TRANSPARENCY. THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS VALUED BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDE MOST GOVERNMENT

OBLIGATIONS, ACTIVE LISTED EQUITIES AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET

SECURITIES. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE REQUIRED TO

BE CARRIED AT QUOTED MARKET PRICES, EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE

FIRM HOLDS A LARGE POSITION AND A SALE COULD REASONABLY IMPACT

THE QUOTED PRICE.

THE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS THAT TRADE IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE, BUT ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE PRICING

SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY INCLUDE

MOST GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, MOST CORPORATE BONDS, CERTAIN

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, CERTAIN BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS, LESS

LIQUID LISTED EQUITIES, CERTAIN STATE, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL

OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET SECURITIES AND LOAN

COMMITMENTS. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BECAUSE THEY TRADE INFREQUENTLY AND

THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE OR NO PRICE TRANSPARENCY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND REAL ESTATE FUND

INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN BANK LOANS AND BRIDGE LOANS (INCLUDING

CERTAIN MEZZANINE FINANCING, LEVERAGED LOANS ARISING FROM

CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER CORPORATE BANK DEBT), LESS

LIQUID CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS

(INCLUDING LESS LIQUID CORPORATE BONDS, DISTRESSED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS) BACKED BY

CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS), LESS LIQUID MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND

SECURITIES (BACKED BY EITHER COMMERCIAL OR RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE), AND ACQUIRED PORTFOLIOS OF DISTRESSED LOANS. THE

TRANSACTION PRICE IS INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH

AN INSTRUMENT, THE MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT

INCEPTION EQUALS THE TRANSACTION PRICE. THIS VALUATION IS

ADJUSTED ONLY WHEN CHANGES TO INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS TRANSACTIONS IN SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS, COMPLETED OR PENDING

THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OR COMPARABLE

ENTITIES, SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS ACROSS THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OFFERINGS IN

THE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CAN

BE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

OR

OVER-THE-COUNTER

(OTC).

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES TYPICALLY FALL WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2

OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY ARE DEEMED

TO BE ACTIVELY TRADED OR NOT. THE FIRM GENERALLY VALUES

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES USING MODELS WHICH CALIBRATE TO

MARKET-CLEARING

LEVELS AND ELIMINATE TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CLOSING

PRICE OF THE

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES AND THEIR UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS. IN SUCH CASES,

EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY.

OTC DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

MARKET EVIDENCE WHENEVER POSSIBLE, INCLUDING

MARKET-BASED

INPUTS TO MODELS, MODEL CALIBRATION TO

MARKET-CLEARING

TRANSACTIONS, BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE

PRICING SOURCES WITH REASONABLE LEVELS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

WHERE MODELS ARE USED, THE SELECTION OF A PARTICULAR MODEL TO

VALUE AN OTC DERIVATIVE DEPENDS UPON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF,

AND SPECIFIC RISKS INHERENT IN, THE INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRICING INFORMATION IN THE MARKET. THE FIRM

GENERALLY USES SIMILAR MODELS TO VALUE SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE A VARIETY OF INPUTS, INCLUDING

CONTRACTUAL TERMS, MARKET PRICES, YIELD CURVES, CREDIT CURVES,

MEASURES OF VOLATILITY, VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT

RATES, LOSS SEVERITY RATES AND CORRELATIONS OF SUCH INPUTS. FOR

OTC DERIVATIVES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS, SUCH AS GENERIC

FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS, MODEL INPUTS CAN GENERALLY BE

VERIFIED AND MODEL SELECTION DOES NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. OTC DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHEN ALL OF THE

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS CAN BE CORROBORATED TO MARKET EVIDENCE.

CERTAIN OTC DERIVATIVES TRADE IN LESS LIQUID MARKETS WITH

LIMITED PRICING INFORMATION, AND THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

FOR THESE DERIVATIVES IS INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT. SUCH

INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY. WHERE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE CORROBORATING MARKET

EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT MODEL INPUTS AND CANNOT VERIFY

THE MODEL TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS

INITIALLY USED AS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY,

WHEN A PRICING MODEL IS USED TO VALUE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT, THE

MODEL IS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE MODEL VALUE AT INCEPTION EQUALS

THE TRANSACTION PRICE. THE VALUATIONS OF THESE LESS LIQUID OTC

DERIVATIVES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON LEVEL 1

AND/OR

LEVEL 2 INPUTS THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE MARKET, AS WELL

AS UNOBSERVABLE LEVEL 3 INPUTS. SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL

RECOGNITION, THE FIRM UPDATES THE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2

INPUTS TO REFLECT OBSERVABLE MARKET CHANGES, WITH RESULTING

GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED WITHIN LEVEL 3. LEVEL 3

INPUTS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY EVIDENCE SUCH AS

SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

THIRD-PARTY

PRICING SERVICES

AND/OR

BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS, OR OTHER EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM CANNOT VERIFY THE MODEL VALUE TO

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A DIFFERENT VALUATION

MODEL COULD PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE.

WHEN APPROPRIATE, VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED FOR VARIOUS FACTORS

SUCH AS LIQUIDITY, BID/OFFER SPREADS AND CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS.

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET EVIDENCE WHERE

AVAILABLE. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EVIDENCE, MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE IS USED.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS). DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RSUS

ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

PAID ON RSUS EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED ARE INCLUDED IN

COMPENSATION EXPENSE. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009, THE

FIRM ADOPTED AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES RELATED TO INCOME TAX

BENEFITS OF DIVIDENDS ON

SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT AWARDS (ASC 718). THESE AMENDED PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THE

TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RSUS TO BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL

PAID-IN

IS TESTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS

IS RECOGNIZED IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING

SEGMENT, WHICH IS A COMPONENT ONE LEVEL BELOW THE FIRMS

THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED NET BOOK

VALUE. SUCH LOSS IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

REVENUES. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST

THAT AN ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS CARRYING VALUE MAY

NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, GENERALLY

CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

DECEMBER 1, 2007, AND RECORDED A TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT

RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF $201 MILLION TO BEGINNING

RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2008. THE FIRM

RECOGNIZES TAX POSITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY WHEN

IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

UPON EXAMINATION BY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY BASED ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. A POSITION THAT MEETS THIS

STANDARD IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT WILL

EARNINGS PER

COMMON SHARE (EPS)

BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING. COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING INCLUDES COMMON

FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION.

IN

JULY 2009, THE FASB LAUNCHED THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

CODIFICATION (THE CODIFICATION) AS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF GAAP.

WHILE THE CODIFICATION DID NOT CHANGE GAAP, IT INTRODUCED A NEW

STRUCTURE TO THE ACCOUNTING LITERATURE AND CHANGED REFERENCES TO

SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT AWARDS, WHICH REQUIRE THAT THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON RSUS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO VEST,

BE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL

PAID-IN

CAPITAL. THE FIRM PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR THIS TAX BENEFIT AS A

REDUCTION TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THESE AMENDED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES WERE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY FOR TAX BENEFITS ON

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS DECLARED BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND REPURCHASE

FINANCING TRANSACTIONS (ASC 860).

IN

FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES RELATED TO TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

REPURCHASE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE AMENDED PRINCIPLES

REQUIRE AN INITIAL TRANSFER OF A FINANCIAL ASSET AND A

REPURCHASE FINANCING THAT WAS ENTERED INTO CONTEMPORANEOUSLY OR

IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE INITIAL TRANSFER TO BE EVALUATED AS A

LINKED TRANSACTION (FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER A SALE

HAS OCCURRED) UNLESS CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET, INCLUDING THAT

THE TRANSFERRED ASSET MUST BE READILY OBTAINABLE IN THE

MARKETPLACE. THE FIRM ADOPTED THESE AMENDED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES FOR NEW TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO AFTER

NOVEMBER 2008. ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

CASH FLOWS.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (ASC 805).

IN

DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES RELATED TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH CHANGED THE

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTION COSTS, CERTAIN CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, AND OTHER BALANCES IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. IN

ADDITION, IN PARTIAL ACQUISITIONS, WHEN CONTROL IS OBTAINED, THE

AMENDED PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THAT THE ACQUIRING COMPANY MEASURE

AND RECORD ALL OF THE TARGETS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

INCLUDING GOODWILL, AT FAIR VALUE AS IF THE ENTIRE TARGET

COMPANY HAD BEEN ACQUIRED. THESE AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

APPLIED TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BEGINNING IN

COMBINATIONS.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(ASC 810).

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED

AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH REQUIRE

THAT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES HELD BY

PARTIES OTHER THAN THE PARENT (I.E., NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS) BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND PRESENTED AS EQUITY, RATHER THAN

AS A LIABILITY OR MEZZANINE EQUITY. THESE AMENDED ACCOUNTING

ENTITIES (ENTERPRISES) ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

INTERESTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH WERE EFFECTIVE

FOR THE FIRM BEGINNING IN THE ONE MONTH ENDED

DECEMBER 2008. SINCE THESE AMENDED PRINCIPLES REQUIRE ONLY

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED

OWN STOCK. THESE AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES PROVIDE GUIDANCE

ABOUT WHETHER AN INSTRUMENT (SUCH AS THE FIRMS OUTSTANDING

COMMON STOCK WARRANTS) SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY AND NOT

SUBSEQUENTLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ADOPTED THESE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES RELATED TO DETERMINING FAIR VALUE WHEN THE

VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND IDENTIFYING TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE

NOT ORDERLY. SPECIFICALLY, THESE AMENDED PRINCIPLES LIST FACTORS

WHICH SHOULD BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TRANSACTION IS

ORDERLY, CLARIFY THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO TRANSACTIONS OR QUOTED

PRICES MAY BE NECESSARY WHEN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY

FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND

PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING THE CONCURRENT WEIGHTING OF THE

IMPAIRMENT ON A DEBT SECURITY RELATED TO CREDIT LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS, WITH THE REMAINDER

RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, IF THE HOLDER DOES NOT

INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

THE HOLDER WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY PRIOR TO

RECOVERY. PREVIOUSLY, THE ENTIRE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. THE FIRM

ADOPTED THESE AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

CASH FLOWS.

INTERIM DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

(ASC 825).

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED

AMENDED PRINCIPLES RELATED TO INTERIM DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRM ADOPTED THESE AMENDED

PRINCIPLES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION DID

NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INTERESTS IN VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (ASC 860 AND 810).

IN

JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

WHICH CHANGE THE ACCOUNTING FOR SECURITIZATIONS AND VIES. THESE

PRINCIPLES WERE CODIFIED AS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE

(ASU) NO. 2009-16,

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING (TOPIC 860)  ACCOUNTING

FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ASU

NO. 2009-17,

CONSOLIDATIONS (TOPIC 810)  IMPROVEMENTS TO

FINANCIAL REPORTING BY ENTERPRISES INVOLVED WITH VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES IN DECEMBER 2009. ASU

NO. 2009-16

ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF A QSPE, CHANGES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

DERECOGNIZING FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH

TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS. ASU

NO. 2009-17

CHANGES THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN A VIE SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED.

UNDER ASU

NO. 2009-17,

THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TO CONSOLIDATE A VIE IS BASED ON

THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

TOGETHER WITH EITHER THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE

RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS THAT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE,

AS WELL AS THE VIES PURPOSE AND DESIGN. ASU

NO. 2009-16

AND

2009-17

ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER

NOVEMBER 15, 2009. IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE FASB

FINALIZED A STANDARD WHICH DEFERS THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASU

NO. 2009-17

FOR CERTAIN INTERESTS IN INVESTMENT FUNDS AND CERTAIN SIMILAR

ENTITIES. ADOPTION OF ASU NOS.

2009-16

AND

2009-17

ON

JANUARY 1, 2010 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH

FLOWS. HOWEVER, CONTINUED APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES THE FIRM TO MAKE JUDGMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE

BASED ON NEW FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, AND EVOLVING

INTERPRETATIONS AND PRACTICES.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES  MEASURING

LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE (ASC 820).

IN

AUGUST 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU

NO. 2009-05,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES (TOPIC

820)  MEASURING LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. ASU

NO. 2009-05

PROVIDES GUIDANCE IN MEASURING LIABILITIES WHEN A QUOTED PRICE

IN AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR AN IDENTICAL LIABILITY IS NOT AVAILABLE

AND CLARIFIES THAT A REPORTING ENTITY SHOULD NOT MAKE AN

ADJUSTMENT TO FAIR VALUE FOR A RESTRICTION THAT PREVENTS THE

TRANSFER OF THE LIABILITY. THE FIRM ADOPTED ASU

NO. 2009-05

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. SINCE THE FIRMS FAIR

VALUE METHODOLOGIES WERE CONSISTENT WITH ASU

NO. 2009-5,

ADOPTION DID NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ENTITIES THAT CALCULATE NET ASSET

CREDIT

CONCENTRATIONS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS MAY ARISE FROM TRADING, INVESTING,

UNDERWRITING, LENDING AND SECURITIES BORROWING ACTIVITIES AND

MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL

FACTORS. THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK BY ACTIVELY

MONITORING EXPOSURES AND OBTAINING COLLATERAL AS DEEMED

APPROPRIATE. WHILE THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES EXPOSE IT TO MANY

DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, THE FIRM ROUTINELY

EXECUTES A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS,

COMMERCIAL BANKS, CLEARING HOUSES, EXCHANGES AND INVESTMENT

FUNDS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION

WITH RESPECT TO THIS INDUSTRY. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS, THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A CONCENTRATION OF

CREDIT RISK TO A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY, BORROWER OR ISSUER,

INCLUDING SOVEREIGN ISSUERS, OR TO A PARTICULAR CLEARING HOUSE

OR EXCHANGE.

AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM HELD

$83.83 BILLION (10% OF TOTAL ASSETS) AND

$53.98 BILLION (6% OF TOTAL ASSETS), RESPECTIVELY, OF

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDED IN

TRADING ASSETS, AT FAIR VALUE AND CASH AND

UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AND SECURITIES BORROWED (INCLUDING

DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FUTURES, FORWARDS,

SWAPS OR OPTION CONTRACTS, THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM

UNDERLYING ASSETS, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES OR A COMBINATION OF

THESE FACTORS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS OTC

DERIVATIVES, OR THEY MAY BE LISTED AND TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES MAY INVOLVE FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR COMMODITIES, OR TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY OR

INTEREST PAYMENT STREAMS. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE BASED ON THE

SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIED

RATES, SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, CURRENCIES OR INDICES.

CERTAIN CASH INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS

MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY OBLIGATIONS, AND

INDEXED DEBT INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES EVEN

THOUGH THEIR VALUES OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED CASH FLOWS ARE

DERIVED FROM THE PRICE OF SOME OTHER SECURITY OR INDEX. HOWEVER,

CERTAIN COMMODITY-RELATED CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURE, AS THESE CONTRACTS MAY BE

SETTLED IN CASH OR THE ASSETS TO BE DELIVERED UNDER THE CONTRACT

ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO FACILITATE

CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS AND AS A

MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. RISK EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED THROUGH

DIVERSIFICATION, BY CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES AND BY ENTERING

INTO OFFSETTING POSITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAY MANAGE THE

RISK RELATED TO A PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCK BY ENTERING INTO AN

OFFSETTING POSITION IN A RELATED

EQUITY-INDEX

FUTURES CONTRACT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS. THE FIRM USES THESE DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE CERTAIN

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXPOSURES, INCLUDING THE FIRMS

NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM DESIGNATES CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS HEDGE CHANGES

IN THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE (E.G., LONDON

INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR)), EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FIRMS UNSECURED

LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS, CERTAIN UNSECURED

BORROWINGS AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT INTO FLOATING RATE

OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 2 FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE

FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM APPLIES A

LONG-HAUL

METHOD TO ALL OF ITS HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS TO PERFORM

AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE

RELATIONSHIPS IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR

OFFSETTING CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE

FIRM UTILIZES A

DOLLAR-OFFSET

METHOD, WHICH COMPARES THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGING INSTRUMENT TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEM, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME, TO

PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

UNDER THE

LONG-HAUL

METHOD. THE FIRMS PROSPECTIVE

DOLLAR-OFFSET

ASSESSMENT UTILIZES SCENARIO ANALYSES TO TEST HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS VIA SIMULATIONS OF NUMEROUS PARALLEL AND SLOPE

SHIFTS OF THE RELEVANT YIELD CURVE. PARALLEL SHIFTS CHANGE THE

INTEREST RATE OF ALL MATURITIES BY IDENTICAL AMOUNTS. SLOPE

SHIFTS CHANGE THE CURVATURE OF THE YIELD CURVE. FOR BOTH THE

PROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, IN RESPONSE TO EACH OF THE SIMULATED

YIELD CURVE SHIFTS, AND THE RETROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT, A HEDGING

RELATIONSHIP IS DEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGING INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM CHANGE INVERSELY WITHIN A

RANGE OF 80% TO 125%.

FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED

IS REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE AND IS

SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER ITS REMAINING

LIFE. GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS FOR THESE

HEDGES ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THESE GAINS OR LOSSES WERE

NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2009,

NOVEMBER 2008 AND NOVEMBER 2007 OR THE ONE MONTH ENDED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO A BROAD ARRAY OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO

FACILITATE CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, TO TAKE PROPRIETARY POSITIONS

AND AS A MEANS OF RISK MANAGEMENT. THE FIRM USES EACH OF THE

CREDIT DERIVATIVES DESCRIBED BELOW FOR THESE PURPOSES. THESE

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO BY VARIOUS TRADING DESKS

AROUND THE WORLD, AND ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED BASED ON THE

UNDERLYING RISKS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE FREQUENTLY PART OF A

BROADER TRADING STRATEGY AND ARE DYNAMICALLY MANAGED BASED ON

THE NET RISK POSITION. AS INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS,

CREDIT DERIVATIVES CAN HAVE NUMEROUS SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT

CONVENTIONS. THE MORE COMMON TYPES OF TRIGGERS INCLUDE

BANKRUPTCY OF THE REFERENCE CREDIT ENTITY, ACCELERATION OF

INDEBTEDNESS, FAILURE TO PAY, RESTRUCTURING, REPUDIATION AND

DISSOLUTION OF THE ENTITY.



CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

SINGLE-NAME CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS PROTECT THE BUYER AGAINST THE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL ON

ONE OR MORE BONDS, LOANS OR MORTGAGES (REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS) IN

THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE ISSUER (REFERENCE ENTITY). THE

BUYER OF PROTECTION PAYS AN INITIAL OR PERIODIC PREMIUM TO THE

SELLER AND RECEIVES CREDIT DEFAULT PROTECTION FOR THE PERIOD OF

THE CONTRACT. IF THERE IS NO CREDIT DEFAULT EVENT, AS DEFINED BY

THE SPECIFIC DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, THEN THE SELLER OF PROTECTION

MAKES NO PAYMENTS TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION. HOWEVER, IF A

CREDIT DEFAULT EVENT OCCURS, THE SELLER OF PROTECTION WILL BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE BUYER OF PROTECTION. TYPICAL

CREDIT DEFAULT EVENTS REQUIRING PAYMENT INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OF

THE REFERENCE CREDIT ENTITY, FAILURE TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR

INTEREST, AND RESTRUCTURING OF THE RELEVANT OBLIGATIONS OF THE

REFERENCE ENTITY.



CREDIT INDICES, BASKETS AND TRANCHES.

CREDIT

DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE A BASKET OF SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT

SWAPS OR A

BROAD-BASED

INDEX. TYPICALLY, IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT OF ONE OF THE

UNDERLYING REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS, THE PROTECTION SELLER WILL PAY

TO THE PROTECTION BUYER A PRO-RATA PORTION OF A

TRANSACTIONS TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT RELATING TO THE

UNDERLYING DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION. IN TRANCHED

TRANSACTIONS, THE CREDIT RISK OF A BASKET OR INDEX IS SEPARATED

INTO VARIOUS PORTIONS EACH HAVING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

SUBORDINATION. THE MOST JUNIOR TRANCHES COVER INITIAL DEFAULTS,

AND ONCE LOSSES EXCEED THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE TRANCHES,

THE EXCESS IS COVERED BY THE NEXT MOST SENIOR TRANCHE IN THE

CAPITAL STRUCTURE.



TOTAL RETURN SWAPS.

A TOTAL RETURN SWAP

TRANSFERS THE RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF A

REFERENCE OBLIGATION FROM THE PROTECTION BUYER TO THE PROTECTION

SELLER. TYPICALLY, THE PROTECTION BUYER RECEIVES FROM THE

PROTECTION SELLER A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST AND PROTECTION

AGAINST ANY REDUCTION IN FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION,

AND IN RETURN THE PROTECTION SELLER RECEIVES THE CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, PLUS ANY INCREASE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.



CREDIT OPTIONS.

IN A CREDIT OPTION, THE OPTION

WRITER ASSUMES THE OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OR SELL A REFERENCE

OBLIGATION AT A SPECIFIED PRICE OR CREDIT SPREAD. THE OPTION

PURCHASER BUYS THE RIGHT TO SELL THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION TO, OR

PURCHASE IT FROM, THE OPTION WRITER. THE PAYMENTS ON CREDIT

OPTIONS DEPEND EITHER ON A PARTICULAR CREDIT SPREAD OR THE PRICE

OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ARE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

STRINGENT COLLATERAL THRESHOLDS. THE FIRM ECONOMICALLY HEDGES

ITS EXPOSURE TO WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVES PRIMARILY BY ENTERING

INTO OFFSETTING PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES WITH IDENTICAL

UNDERLYINGS. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A SPECIFIED

TRIGGER EVENT, THE FIRM MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF THE REFERENCE

OBLIGATIONS UNDERLYING A PARTICULAR WRITTEN CREDIT DERIVATIVE,

AND CONSEQUENTLY MAY, UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE REFERENCE

OBLIGATIONS, RECOVER AMOUNTS ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE

OBLIGATIONS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. AS OF DECEMBER 2009,

THE FIRMS WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT DERIVATIVES HAD

TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $2.54 TRILLION AND

$2.71 TRILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TOTAL NET PURCHASED

PROTECTION OF $164.13 BILLION IN NOTIONAL VALUE. AS OF

NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRMS WRITTEN AND PURCHASED CREDIT

DERIVATIVES HAD TOTAL GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

$3.78 TRILLION AND $4.03 TRILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR

TOTAL NET PURCHASED PROTECTION OF $255.24 BILLION IN

NOTIONAL VALUE. THE DECREASE IN NOTIONAL AMOUNTS FROM

NOVEMBER 2008 TO DECEMBER 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTS

COMPRESSION EFFORTS ACROSS THE INDUSTRY.

CONTINGENCIES

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL, REGULATORY AND

ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION

WITH THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED

ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE RESULTS OF SUCH

PROCEEDINGS, IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT MAY BE

MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD, DEPENDING, IN PART, UPON THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SUCH

PERIOD. GIVEN THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME

OF THE FIRMS LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY IN CASES OR PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL OR

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR FINES ARE SOUGHT, THE FIRM CANNOT

ESTIMATE LOSSES OR RANGES OF LOSSES FOR CASES OR PROCEEDINGS

WHERE THERE IS ONLY A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE

INCURRED.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE FIRM IS

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE TO PROVIDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH AND

INCOME BENEFITS TO CERTAIN CONTRACT HOLDERS AND HAS ESTABLISHED

A RESERVE RELATED TO $6.35 BILLION AND $6.13 BILLION

OF CONTRACT HOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND

NOVEMBER 2008, RESPECTIVELY, FOR SUCH BENEFITS. THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE ATTAINED AGE OF THESE CONTRACT HOLDERS WAS

68 YEARS AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 2009 AND

GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH AND INCOME BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF

CONTRACT HOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES, WAS $1.96 BILLION AND

$2.96 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND

NOVEMBER 2008, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 12 FOR MORE

INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS INSURANCE LIABILITIES.

GUARANTEES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE

DEFINITION OF A GUARANTEE UNDER ASC 460. DISCLOSURES ABOUT

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT REQUIRED IF SUCH CONTRACTS MAY BE

CASH SETTLED AND THE FIRM HAS NO BASIS TO CONCLUDE IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES HELD, AT INCEPTION, THE

UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE

FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET FOR

CERTAIN LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT

BANK COUNTERPARTIES AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTERPARTIES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT INCLUDED SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE

TABLES BELOW.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE FIRM, IN ITS CAPACITY AS AN AGENCY LENDER, INDEMNIFIES MOST

OF ITS SECURITIES LENDING CUSTOMERS AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED IN

THE EVENT THAT BORROWERS DO NOT RETURN SECURITIES AND THE

COLLATERAL HELD IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

SECURITIES BORROWED.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM PROVIDES OTHER

FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES

(E.G., PERFORMANCE BONDS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND

OTHER GUARANTEES TO ENABLE CLIENTS TO COMPLETE TRANSACTIONS AND

MERCHANT BANKING FUND-RELATED GUARANTEES). THESE GUARANTEES

REPRESENT OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES IF THE

GUARANTEED PARTY FAILS TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER A

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THAT BENEFICIARY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A

GUARANTEE AND CERTAIN OTHER GUARANTEES AS OF DECEMBER 2009.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS SET FORTH BELOW INCLUDE WRITTEN EQUITY AND

COMMODITY PUT OPTIONS, WRITTEN CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND INTEREST

RATE CAPS, FLOORS AND SWAPTIONS. SEE NOTE 3 FOR INFORMATION

SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE ANTICIPATED LOSSES IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE CONTRACTS.

(2)

BECAUSE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE,

CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED THE BEST INDICATION OF

PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK FOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF A LEGAL RIGHT OF SETOFF

THAT MAY EXIST UNDER AN ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT AND THE

EFFECT OF NETTING OF CASH PAID PURSUANT TO CREDIT SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS. THESE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE RISK MANAGED TOGETHER

WITH DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A

GUARANTEE UNDER ASC 460 AND, THEREFORE, THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT

REFLECT THE FIRMS OVERALL RISK RELATED TO ITS DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES. AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

NET LIABILITY RELATED TO DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES WAS

$17.46 BILLION.

(3)

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES

LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS WAS $28.07 BILLION AND

$19.95 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND

NOVEMBER 2008, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE THE CONTRACTUAL NATURE

OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL

WITH A MARKET VALUE THAT EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON

LOAN FROM THE BORROWER, THERE IS MINIMAL PERFORMANCE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES.

(4)

AS OF NOVEMBER 2008, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET

LIABILITY RELATED TO OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES WAS

$235 MILLION.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED TRUSTS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL

I, II AND III, AND OTHER ENTITIES FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF

ISSUING SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, LENDING THE PROCEEDS TO THE

FIRM AND ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FIRM

AND THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO THIS PURPOSE. SEE NOTE 7 FOR

INFORMATION REGARDING THE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING GOLDMAN SACHS

CAPITAL I, II AND III. THE FIRM EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES FOR THE

FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY

THESE ENTITIES, WHICH ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES. TIMELY PAYMENT BY THE FIRM OF AMOUNTS DUE TO THESE

ENTITIES UNDER THE BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER PAYMENTS

DUE ON THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WILL OCCUR,

SUCH AS NONPERFORMANCE ON THE PART OF PAYING AGENTS OR OTHER

SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR THE FIRM TO

MAKE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE ENTITIES OTHER THAN THOSE

REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BORROWING, PREFERRED STOCK AND

RELATED CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN

EXPENSES INCURRED BY THESE ENTITIES. GROUP INC. ALSO FULLY

AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEES THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY GS

FINANCE CORP., A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM,

WHICH IS CONSOLIDATED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND THE CONTINGENCIES TRIGGERING THE

OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR. THE FIRM IS

UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PAYOUT UNDER THESE

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL

PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND NO LIABILITIES RELATED TO

THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

GROUP INC. HAS GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF

PROCEEDS OF $5.75 BILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009.

IN JUNE 2009, GROUP INC. REPURCHASED FROM THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (U.S. TREASURY) THE

10.0 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS FIXED RATE

CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES H

(SERIES H PREFERRED STOCK), THAT WERE ISSUED TO THE

U.S. TREASURY PURSUANT TO THE U.S. TREASURYS

TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. THE REPURCHASE RESULTED IN A

ONE-TIME

PREFERRED DIVIDEND OF $426 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 2009. THIS

ONE-TIME

PREFERRED DIVIDEND REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

ISSUED A

10-YEAR

WARRANT TO THE U.S. TREASURY TO PURCHASE UP TO

12.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$122.90 PER SHARE. THE FIRM REPURCHASED THIS WARRANT IN FULL IN

BOARD DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF $0.4666666 PER COMMON SHARE TO BE

PAID ON MARCH 26, 2009 TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF

RECORD ON FEBRUARY 24, 2009. THE DIVIDEND OF

$0.4666666 PER COMMON SHARE IS REFLECTIVE OF A FOUR-MONTH PERIOD

(DECEMBER 2008 THROUGH MARCH 2009), DUE TO THE CHANGE

IN THE FIRMS FISCAL YEAR-END.

DURING 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 19,578 AND

10.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE COST

PER SHARE OF $80.83 AND $193.18, FOR A TOTAL COST OF

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN SHARE COUNT OVER TIME

RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE

PRIMARILY BY THE FIRMS CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL

POSITIONS (I.E., COMPARISONS OF THE FIRMS DESIRED

LEVEL OF CAPITAL TO ITS ACTUAL LEVEL OF CAPITAL) BUT WHICH MAY

ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE

PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF THE FIRMS COMMON

DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. THESE

PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE BENEFITS BASED ON YEARS OF CREDITED

SERVICE AND A PERCENTAGE OF THE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION. THE FIRM MAINTAINS A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

FOR MOST U.K. EMPLOYEES. AS OF APRIL 2008, THE U.K. DEFINED

BENEFIT PLAN WAS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS, BUT WILL CONTINUE

TO ACCRUE BENEFITS FOR EXISTING PARTICIPANTS.

THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO

NOVEMBER 1, 2003. AS OF NOVEMBER 2004, THIS PLAN

WAS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS AND FROZEN SUCH THAT EXISTING

PARTICIPANTS WOULD NOT ACCRUE ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAINTAINS UNFUNDED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE FOR ELIGIBLE

RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS COVERED UNDER THESE PROGRAMS.

ON NOVEMBER 30, 2007, THE FIRM ADOPTED AMENDED

PRINCIPLES RELATED TO EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS WHICH REQUIRE AN

ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION THE

FUNDED STATUS OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

PLAN ASSETS AND THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION. UPON ADOPTION, THESE

AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRED AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE

PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, PRIOR

SERVICE COSTS, AND TRANSITION OBLIGATIONS AND ASSETS WITHIN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY,

AND TO DERECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITIES.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THESE AMENDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE

FIRM RECORDED IN 2007 INCREASES OF $59 MILLION AND

$253 MILLION TO OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER

LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY, AND A

GENERALLY, THE FIRM DETERMINED THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS BY REFERENCING INDICES FOR

LONG-TERM,

HIGH-QUALITY

BONDS AND ENSURING THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE DOES NOT EXCEED THE

YIELD REPORTED FOR THOSE INDICES AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR THE

DURATION OF THE PLANS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH IN DETERMINING THE

LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL

FINANCIAL MARKET RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE EXISTED OVER TIME WITH

THE PRESUMPTION THAT THIS TREND WILL GENERALLY REMAIN CONSTANT

IN THE FUTURE.

PROGRAMS. THE PLANS EMPLOY A TOTAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT

APPROACH, WHEREBY A MIX, WHICH IS BROADLY SIMILAR TO THE ACTUAL

ASSET ALLOCATION AS OF DECEMBER 2009, OF EQUITY SECURITIES,

DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS, IS TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE THE

LONG-TERM

RETURN ON ASSETS FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF RISK. INVESTMENT RISK IS

MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY THE FIRMS

RETIREMENT COMMITTEE THROUGH PERIODIC PORTFOLIO REVIEWS,

MEETINGS WITH INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ANNUAL LIABILITY

MEASUREMENTS.

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009. THIS LEVEL 3 ASSET COMPRISED

LESS THAN 1% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL PENSION PLAN ASSETS AS OF

THE FIRM EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE A MINIMUM OF $49 MILLION TO

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

THE FIRM HAS MAINTAINED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES. IN GENERAL, UNDER THE PLANS, PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE

TO DEFER PAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THEIR CASH YEAR-END

COMPENSATION. DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE

TO NOTIONALLY INVEST THEIR DEFERRALS IN CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES

AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLANS. GENERALLY, UNDER CURRENT TAX LAW,

PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX ON AMOUNTS DEFERRED

OR ON ANY NOTIONAL INVESTMENT EARNINGS UNTIL THE RETURNS ARE

DISTRIBUTED, AND THE FIRM IS NOT ENTITLED TO A CORRESPONDING TAX

DEDUCTION UNTIL THE AMOUNTS ARE DISTRIBUTED. BEGINNING WITH THE

2008 YEAR, THESE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS WERE FROZEN

WITH RESPECT TO NEW CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE PLANS WERE TERMINATED.

PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY RECEIVED DISTRIBUTIONS OF THEIR BENEFITS

IN 2009 EXCEPT THAT NO PAYMENTS WERE ACCELERATED FOR CERTAIN

SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR THE AMOUNTS DEFERRED UNDER THESE PLANS. AS OF

DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, $9 MILLION AND

$220 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE PLANS WAS

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE FIRM HAS A DISCOUNT STOCK PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH

PARTICIPATING MANAGING DIRECTORS MAY BE PERMITTED TO ACQUIRE

RSUS AT AN EFFECTIVE 25% DISCOUNT (FOR 2009 AND

2008 YEAR-END COMPENSATION, THE PROGRAM WAS SUSPENDED, AND

NO INDIVIDUAL WAS PERMITTED TO ACQUIRE DISCOUNTED RSUS

THEREUNDER). IN PRIOR YEARS, THE 25% DISCOUNT WAS EFFECTED BY AN

ADDITIONAL GRANT OF RSUS EQUAL TO

ONE-THIRD

THE NUMBER OF RSUS PURCHASED BY QUALIFYING PARTICIPANTS. THE

PURCHASED RSUS WERE 100% VESTED WHEN GRANTED, BUT THE SHARES

UNDERLYING THEM GENERALLY WERE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS (WHICH WERE WAIVED IN DECEMBER 2008 EXCEPT FOR

CERTAIN SENIOR EXECUTIVES). THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE RSUS THAT

WERE GRANTED TO EFFECT THE 25% DISCOUNT GENERALLY VEST IN EQUAL

INSTALLMENTS ON THE SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES FOLLOWING THE

GRANT DATE AND WERE NOT TRANSFERABLE BEFORE THE THIRD

ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE (TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON VESTED

AWARDS WERE WAIVED IN DECEMBER 2008 EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN

IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE TOTAL VALUE OF RSUS

GRANTED FOR 2007 IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE 25% DISCOUNT WAS

AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRMS

LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS REPORTED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WAS $1.93 BILLION AND

$1.37 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND

NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM REPORTED A RELATED DEFERRED TAX

ASSET OF $1.00 BILLION AND $625 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF RECOGNIZED, THE NET TAX BENEFIT OF

$921 MILLION AND $748 MILLION, WOULD REDUCE THE

FIRMS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AS OF DECEMBER 2009

AND NOVEMBER 2008, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 2009

AND NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRMS ACCRUED LIABILITY FOR

INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS AND INCOME TAX

PENALTIES WAS $194 MILLION AND $111 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM REPORTS INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO

INCOME TAX MATTERS IN PROVISION FOR TAXES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND INCOME TAX PENALTIES IN

OTHER EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED $62 MILLION, $37 MILLION

AND $3 MILLION OF INTEREST AND INCOME TAX PENALTIES FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008 AND ONE

MONTH ENDED DECEMBER 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE

SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS SUBSEQUENT TO

DECEMBER 2009. AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE

THE CHANGE OR ITS IMPACT ON THE FIRMS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE U.S. INTERNAL

AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATOR OF

GROUP INC., A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT IN AUGUST 2009

ALSO BECAME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE

U.S. GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY

ACT OF 1999. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO

CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THE FIRMS BANK DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GS BANK USA, ARE SUBJECT TO

SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARDS CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND THE REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA) THAT IS APPLICABLE

TO GS BANK USA, THE FIRM AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT

INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY REPORTING PRACTICES. THE

FIRM AND ITS BANK DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES

CAPITAL AMOUNTS, AS WELL AS GS BANK USAS PCA

CLASSIFICATION, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE

REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.

CREDIT RISK FOR ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS IS BASED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET VALUE. FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, INCLUDING OTC

DERIVATIVES AND COMMITMENTS, A CREDIT EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IS

CALCULATED BASED ON THE NOTIONAL OF EACH TRADE. ALL SUCH ASSETS

AND AMOUNTS ARE THEN ASSIGNED A RISK WEIGHT DEPENDING ON, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, WHETHER THE COUNTERPARTY IS A SOVEREIGN, BANK OR

QUALIFYING SECURITIES FIRM, OR OTHER ENTITY (OR IF COLLATERAL IS

HELD, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE COLLATERAL).

THE FIRMS TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS

TIER 1 CAPITAL UNDER BASEL I DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE

TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR DISALLOWED GOODWILL

AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS).

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATIONS REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4% AND A

MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 8%. THE REQUIRED MINIMUM

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO IN ORDER TO BE

CONSIDERED A WELL CAPITALIZED BANK HOLDING COMPANY

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES ARE 6% AND 10%,

RESPECTIVELY. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN

RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR

PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. THE MINIMUM

TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

HAVE RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SUPERVISORY RATING UNDER FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARDS

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

MUST HAVE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%.

THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS SET

OUT IN THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE

OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL II) AS APPLICABLE

TO IT AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS

HAVE INCORPORATED THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS GROUP INC., TRANSITION TO

BASEL II OVER SEVERAL YEARS.

GS BANK USA, A NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A MEMBER OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION (FDIC), IS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

AND THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT (NYSBD) AND IS SUBJECT

TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS) ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES. GS BANK USA COMPUTES ITS CAPITAL RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE REGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO

STATE MEMBER BANKS, WHICH ARE BASED ON BASEL I AS IMPLEMENTED BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING THE

ADEQUACY OF ITS CAPITAL. IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A WELL

RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES, GS BANK USA MUST MAINTAIN A

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO

OF AT LEAST 10% AND A TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM CONTRIBUTED SUBSIDIARIES INTO

GS BANK USA. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRIBUTION, GS BANK

USA AGREED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO MINIMUM CAPITAL

RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THESE WELL CAPITALIZED LEVELS.

ACCORDINGLY, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, GS BANK USA IS EXPECTED TO

IS REQUIRED TO TRANSITION TO BASEL II OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

YEARS.

THE DEPOSITS OF GS BANK USA ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC TO THE

EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL

APPROXIMATELY $27.43 BILLION AND $94 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH

EXCEEDED REQUIRED RESERVE AMOUNTS BY $25.86 BILLION AND

$6 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. GS BANK EUROPE, A WHOLLY OWNED CREDIT INSTITUTION,

IS REGULATED BY THE IRISH FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY

AUTHORITY AND IS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, GS BANK USA AND

GS BANK EUROPE WERE BOTH IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GS BANK USA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

GROUP INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES (OTHER THAN,

GENERALLY, SUBSIDIARIES OF GS BANK USA) ARE REGULATED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THESE REGULATIONS GENERALLY LIMIT THE

MANAGEMENT AND SECURITIES SERVICES.

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

IN REPORTING SEGMENTS, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS LINES

HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS.

(I) THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE,

(II) THEIR METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION, (III) THE TYPES OF

CLIENTS THEY SERVE AND (IV) THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE COST DRIVERS OF THE FIRM TAKEN AS A WHOLE 

COMPENSATION, HEADCOUNT AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITY  ARE BROADLY SIMILAR IN EACH OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

EXPENSES WITHIN THE FIRMS SEGMENTS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER

PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS UNITS. CONSEQUENTLY,

PRE-TAX

MARGINS IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM ALLOCATES REVENUES AND EXPENSES AMONG THE THREE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF THESE

SEGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ALLOCATING

CERTAIN REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS

ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC CRITERIA OR APPROXIMATE

THIRD-PARTY

RATES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE ITEMS THAT

HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE

ALLOCATION PROCESS IS BASED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE BUSINESS OF THE FIRM.

THE SEGMENT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW IS PREPARED

CLIENTS, THE METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING THE FIRMS

PROFITABILITY TO GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IS DEPENDENT ON ESTIMATES

AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS.



INVESTMENT BANKING: LOCATION OF THE CLIENT AND INVESTMENT

BANKING TEAM.



FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES, AND EQUITIES: LOCATION

OF THE TRADING DESK.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS: LOCATION OF THE INVESTMENT.



ASSET MANAGEMENT: LOCATION OF THE SALES TEAM.



SECURITIES SERVICES: LOCATION OF THE PRIMARY MARKET FOR THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY.
