ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING

ANY

STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING

INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE

OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT

-

SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

-

THAN WE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL

RISKS

THAT OUR BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION OF OUR 2005

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS AND IN THE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1.

OF THIS

FORM 10-K. BELOW, WE HAVE DESCRIBED OUR PRESENT VIEW OF CERTAIN IMPORTANT

STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS

OUR

COMPETITORS REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WILL DETERMINE OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND REGULATORY

RISKS

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. GLOBAL ECONOMIC

AND

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN MANY WAYS. OPERATIONS

ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION. PARTICULAR LOCAL JURISDICTION

RISKS INCLUDE REGULATORY RISKS ARISING FROM LOCAL LAWS AND FROM LOCAL LIQUIDITY

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING RISKS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS. OUR GLOBAL

BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF

OUR

ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED

USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE,

SUCH

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL.

OUR

CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COST OF CAPITAL

THE

MAJOR DEBT AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT AND HAVE GIVEN THEIR HIGHEST

DEBT RATINGS TO US. ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IS TO MAINTAIN THESE

TRIPLE

A RATINGS AS THEY SERVE TO LOWER OUR BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATE OUR ACCESS

TO A VARIETY OF LENDERS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE A DEBT RATING COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS.

THE

DISPOSITION OF BUSINESSES THAT DO NOT FIT WITH OUR EVOLVING STRATEGY CAN

BE

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

WE

WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES

THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. OUR DECISIONS TO SELL

GENWORTH AND GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS ARE RECENT EXAMPLES OF DISPOSITION

DECISIONS. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE

TERMS

IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES, OR WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS WHICH

ARE

LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE SELL A

BUSINESS WHOSE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN WHICH

CASE

OUR DECISION WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE VALUE.

CORRESPONDINGLY, WE MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A PARTICULAR BUSINESSS

PROSPECTS, IN WHICH CASE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A BUYER AT A PRICE ACCEPTABLE

TO US AND THEREFORE MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE

VALUE.
