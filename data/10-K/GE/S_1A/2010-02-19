ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO

UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE

FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART II, ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED

NOTES IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS

FORM 10-K REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT  SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT  THAN WE

PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR

BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION AND IN THE BUSINESS

DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. BELOW, WE DESCRIBE

CERTAIN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS

WILL AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS.

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. IN 2009,

APPROXIMATELY 54% OF OUR REVENUES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION.

THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR

ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED

USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR

ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION HAS DECREASED OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS

A RESULT OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY CHANGE IN

SIGNIFICANT WAYS.

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL AND

STATE AND NON-U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES.

(14)

THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN WAYS THAT

WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR

RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS BY MAKING EXISTING PRACTICES MORE RESTRICTED, SUBJECT TO

ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITED OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR, U.S. AND NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERTAKING A SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE REGULATION

AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CONSUMER LENDING,

THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKET AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON GE CAPITALS STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND

PERFORMANCE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF TRADE CONTROL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN GLOBAL MARKETS.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RISKS FROM LAWS THAT REDUCE THE

ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT CONSUMER BORROWING, LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS, AND CHANGES TO

TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GES EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW

THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS

PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH NON-U.S. BANKS AND OTHER

NON-U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH EXPIRED

AT THE END OF 2009, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY

CONGRESS ON FIVE PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN OCTOBER OF 2008. A ONE-YEAR

EXTENSION WAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN 2009 AND THE SENATE

FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MEMBER HAVE INDICATED AN INTENTION TO

EXTEND THE PROVISION FOR ONE YEAR RETROACTIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF 2010, BUT

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THE PROVISION

IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2009, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF

THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2010. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT RECENTLY

PROPOSED THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CRISIS FEE, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO PAY

A FEE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 15 BASIS POINTS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF COVERED

LIABILITIES (DEFINED AS ASSETS LESS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND FEDERAL

DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC)-ASSESSED DEPOSITS). THIS PROPOSAL IS AT AN

EARLY STAGE, AND ITS IMPACT ON THE COMPANY, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF

FACTORS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL. IF ADOPTED, THIS

FEE COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF OUR EARNINGS GOING FORWARD. IN ADDITION, THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING BROAD-BASED LEGISLATION TO CHANGE

HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, THAT INCLUDES PROVISIONS FOR A FEE ON MEDICAL DEVICES,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE BUSINESS AND

INCREASE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO OUR EMPLOYEES. FURTHERMORE, WE

HAVE BEEN, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE, PARTICIPATING IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAMS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH STRICT GOVERNMENTAL

REGULATIONS. INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR STATUS IN THESE PROJECTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE

RISKS.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. WE AND OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE AT TIMES

BEING REVIEWED OR INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND

DAMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER

OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. THESE INCLUDE THE DREDGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS FROM A

40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE, AS DESCRIBED IN

ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT

AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS

THAT LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED

WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

(15)

THE

SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.

WITH

RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE

CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND

OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION CHALLENGES,

SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL

DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR

OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS

IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS

THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. EVEN UPON REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH A

BUYER OR SELLER FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF A BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT

TO NECESSARY REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WHICH

MAY PREVENT US FROM COMPLETING THE TRANSACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECENTLY ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH COMCAST CORPORATION TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS OF THE NBCU

BUSINESS TO A NEWLY FORMED ENTITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE CASH AND

WILL OWN A 49% INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED ENTITY. THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT

TO RECEIPT OF VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE

MAY SELL A BUSINESS WHOSE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN

WHICH CASE OUR DECISION WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE

VALUE.

SUSTAINED

INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF

INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME

OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY

CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR 2010 ARE

THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLANS ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A

REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED GAINS (LOSSES)  NET, BENEFIT PLANS. AT THE

END OF 2009, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF OUR U.S. PRINCIPAL PENSION

PLANS WAS $48.1 BILLION AND ASSETS WERE $42.1 BILLION. FOR A DISCUSSION

REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION PLAN

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  PENSION ASSUMPTIONS IN

PART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT

DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO

LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS

REQUIRED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). FAILURE TO

ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS COULD ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE

AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS. IN ADDITION,

UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO CURRENT

EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE

COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

(16)

CONDITIONS

IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF GE

CAPITALS FUNDING.

A LARGE

PORTION OF GE CAPITALS BORROWINGS IS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

LONG-TERM DEBT. GE CAPITALS OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT WAS

$42 BILLION AND $399 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE WE

HAVE FULLY PREFUNDED OUR PLANNED 2010 LONG-TERM DEBT REQUIREMENTS, WE CONTINUE

TO RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR

TERM MATURITIES BEYOND 2010. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS TO REFINANCE MATURING SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER DEBT

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN ORDER TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES, WE ALSO

PLAN TO EXPAND OUR RELIANCE ON ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING BANK

DEPOSITS, SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER ASSET-BASED FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN DIVERSIFYING OUR FUNDING SOURCES OR THAT THE

SHORT AND LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS WILL BE AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE

COST OF FUNDING WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE AND AFFECT THE OVERALL

PROFITABILITY OF GE CAPITAL. FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING

COSTS INCLUDE: A DECREASED RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM FUNDING, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL

PAPER, IN FAVOR OF LONGER-TERM FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS; REFINANCING OF FUNDING THAT

WE HAVE OBTAINED UNDER THE FDIC TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP) AT

MARKET RATES AT THE TIME SUCH FUNDING MATURES; DECREASED CAPACITY AND INCREASED

COMPETITION AMONG DEBT ISSUERS; AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF

REFINANCING. IF GE CAPITALS COST OF FUNDING WERE TO INCREASE, IT MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND RESULT IN LOWER LENDING MARGINS, EARNINGS

AND CASH FLOWS AS WELL AS LOWER RETURNS ON ITS SHAREOWNERS EQUITY AND INVESTED

CAPITAL. WHILE WE CURRENTLY DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY EQUITY OFFERINGS, OTHER

SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT INVOLVE THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES

WOULD BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING SHAREOWNERS.

DIFFICULT

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS HAVE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF GE CAPITAL AND THESE

CONDITIONS MAY PERSIST.

DECLINES

IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS, INCREASED PAYMENT DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES AND

SUSTAINED LEVELS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT WRITE-DOWNS

OF ASSET VALUES BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GE CAPITAL. IF THESE

CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND

TAX ASSETS. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE ESTABLISHED

ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES IN GE CAPITALS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE, FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND

RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE THESE ALLOWANCES AND WRITE-OFFS,

WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS

,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. TO REDUCE GES EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE CONDITIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND REBALANCE THE RELATIVE SIZE OF ITS FINANCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WE HAVE DECIDED TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF GE CAPITAL, AS

MEASURED BY ITS ENDING NET INVESTMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE

ABLE TO TIMELY EXECUTE ON OUR REDUCTION TARGETS AND FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD

RESULT IN GREATER EXPOSURE TO FINANCIAL MARKETS THAN CONTEMPLATED UNDER OUR

STRATEGIC FUNDING PLAN OR MAY RESULT IN THE NEED FOR US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL

CONTRIBUTIONS TO GE CAPITAL.

THE

SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GE

CAPITAL.

GE

CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND

ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO

CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION,

GE CAPITALS CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD CANNOT BE

REALIZED UPON SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL

AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS

EXPOSURE TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF UNSECURED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING

TO INITIAL CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES

(AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT),

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY LOSSES OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

(17)

THE

REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES ARE HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN.

GE

CAPITAL PARTICIPATES IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IN TWO WAYS: IT

PROVIDES FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTIES, AND IT ALSO ACQUIRES EQUITY POSITIONS IN VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTIES. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT

UPON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH THE

PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED AND THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF THOSE MARKETS AT THE TIME OF

SALE. THE LEVEL OF TRANSACTIONS FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY

FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. CONTINUED HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, SLOWDOWN IN

BUSINESS ACTIVITY, EXCESS INVENTORY CAPACITY AND LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT

ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND

COLLATERAL TO REAL ESTATE LOANS GE CAPITAL HOLDS. UNDER CURRENT MARKET AND

CREDIT CONDITIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES GE CAPITAL

WILL COMPLETE OR THE NET SALES PROCEEDS IT WILL REALIZE. ALSO, OCCUPANCY RATES

AND MARKET RENTALS MAY WORSEN, WHICH MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING

VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS.

GE

CAPITAL IS ALSO A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDER IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES AND HOME SALE VOLUMES, JOB LOSSES,

CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CREDIT

PERFORMANCE OF OUR MORTGAGE LOANS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THESE

MORTGAGE LOANS IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF CURRENT AND HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY

AND LOAN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS OTHER MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY BE

INACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL NOT BE

MATERIALLY WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED AND, AS A RESULT, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

FAILURE

TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND

RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS.

THE

MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY

WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN MARCH 2009,

STANDARD & POORS (S&P) DOWNGRADED GE AND GE CAPITALS LONG-TERM RATING

BY ONE NOTCH FROM AAA TO AA+ AND, AT THE SAME TIME, REVISED THE OUTLOOK FROM

NEGATIVE TO STABLE. IN ADDITION, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) DOWNGRADED

GE AND GE CAPITALS LONG-TERM RATING BY TWO NOTCHES FROM AAA TO AA2 WITH A

STABLE OUTLOOK. THE SHORT-TERM RATINGS OF A-1+/P-1 WERE AFFIRMED BY BOTH

RATING AGENCIES AT THE SAME TIME WITH RESPECT TO GE, GE CAPITAL SERVICES AND GE

CAPITAL. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT

RATINGS AND FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND

RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

VARIOUS DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, WHICH,

DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION.

(18)

CURRENT

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ALSO MAY

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR

NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES.

THE

BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL AND MEDIA BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE, AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CONDITIONS

IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION, HEALTHCARE, MEDIA AND

OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. AS A RESULT OF SLOWING GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH,

THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, INCREASED

UNEMPLOYMENT, REDUCED LEVELS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY

PRICES, BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY, SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION OF THEIR

BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A

RESULT, EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY FASHION. IN PARTICULAR,

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL

IS CORRELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES. A

PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONALLY THAT CONTINUES TO

RESULT IN THE LOSS OF BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAFFIC COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. SERVICE

CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR CONTRACT

COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR

CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US.

IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN CONTINUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS

SIGNIFICANT FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WE

ARE DEPENDENT ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND PRODUCT

INNOVATIONS FOR CONTINUED REVENUE GROWTH.

THE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. OUR LONG-TERM

OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP,

INTRODUCE, AND MARKET NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, TO MODIFY EXISTING PRODUCTS,

TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TO CUSTOMIZE CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO MEET

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THIS PROCESS,

INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE THE DIRECTION OF

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE OR THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW

PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION TO SATISFY CUSTOMER

DEMANDS.

OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY

DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO OURS, AND WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

OUR

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM

INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE OF

OURS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY US TO PROTECT

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR

TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC

ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES.

REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF SUCH CLAIMS, RESPONDING TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS CAN BE

EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. IF GE IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS,

WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR WE COULD BE ENJOINED FROM

OFFERING SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES

THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR RE-NEW FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES WE NEED

IN THE FUTURE, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON

REASONABLE TERMS.

SIGNIFICANT

RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION

DISRUPTIONS, SUPPLIER QUALITY ISSUES OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR

OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR

PRODUCTS.

OUR

RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS

AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS

USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF

THESE MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. A DISRUPTION IN

DELIVERIES FROM OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR SERVICE

PROVIDERS, CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE INCREASES, OR

DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR

OPERATING COSTS. QUALITY ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS CAN ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

RESULT IN LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

(19)

THERE

ARE RISKS INHERENT IN OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE

MARKET PRICE AND VOLUME OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE,

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. THESE MAY ARISE FROM GENERAL STOCK MARKET

CONDITIONS, THE IMPACT OF THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, A CHANGE IN SENTIMENT IN THE MARKET

REGARDING US OR OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR FROM OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THE

AMOUNTS AND FREQUENCY OF SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDENDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
