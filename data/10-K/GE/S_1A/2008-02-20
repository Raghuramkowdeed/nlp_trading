ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS.

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY

STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING

INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT

-

SOMETIMES

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

-

THAN WE PRESENTLY

ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESSES

ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION OF OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS AND IN THE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. OF THIS FORM 10-K.

BELOW, WE HAVE DESCRIBED CERTAIN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO

MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS REACTIONS TO THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS WILL DETERMINE OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

RISKS

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. GLOBAL ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN MANY WAYS. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION. OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY LOCAL

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY.

POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR

SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION.

WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE

COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL.

OUR

CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COST OF CAPITAL

THE

MAJOR DEBT AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT AND HAVE GIVEN THEIR HIGHEST

DEBT RATINGS TO US. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH

INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES

AND  TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES IS TO MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE A RATINGS AS THEY SERVE TO LOWER OUR

BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATE OUR ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF LENDERS. FAILURE TO

MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE A DEBT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND

RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS.

THE

SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

WITH

RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE

CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND

OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND

TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND

BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO

SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD

DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, OR WE MAY DISPOSE OF A

BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS, WHICH ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. IN

ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE SELL A BUSINESS WHOSE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE

EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN WHICH CASE OUR DECISION WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY

SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE VALUE. CORRESPONDINGLY, WE MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A

PARTICULAR BUSINESSS PROSPECTS, IN WHICH CASE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A BUYER

AT A PRICE ACCEPTABLE TO US AND THEREFORE MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED

ENTERPRISE VALUE.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND FOREIGN

LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY EVEN REQUIRE

US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IF EXISTING PRACTICES BECOME MORE

RESTRICTED, SUBJECT TO ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITED OUTRIGHT. PARTICULAR RISKS

INCLUDE REGULATORY RISKS ARISING FROM LOCAL LAWS, SUCH AS LAWS THAT REDUCE THE

ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT CONSUMER BORROWING, FROM LOCAL LIQUIDITY

REGULATIONS THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISKS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS,

AND CHANGES TO TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE,

GES EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S.

RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S.

TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A

DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS

U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH FOREIGN BANKS

AND OTHER FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION,

WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF 2008, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON

FOUR PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, AND EACH TIME IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS. IF THIS

PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE ALSO AT TIMES BEING

REVIEWED OR INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS,

FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND

DAMAGES.

CHANGES

IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

WE

PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTIES. WE ALSO CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY AND SELL PROPERTIES

WHICH MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OUTLAYS OR PROCEEDS OF CASH, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY

OR IN THE AGGREGATE. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY

DEPENDENT UPON THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED AND THE

PERCEIVED VALUE OF THAT MARKET AT THE TIME OF SALE. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY

OPTIMIZING THAT MIX AND SUCH ACTIVITY MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE YEAR TO

THE NEXT.
