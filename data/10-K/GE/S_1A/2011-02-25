ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR

ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

OUR BUSINESSES

ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT  SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT  THAN WE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER

CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION AND IN THE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. BELOW, WE DESCRIBE CERTAIN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WILL AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL RISKS.

WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. IN 2010, APPROXIMATELY 53% OF OUR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION. THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH

MAY BE DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH ATTEMPTS

TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION HAS DECREASED OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS A RESULT OF MORE VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND NON-U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN WAYS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS BY RESTRICTING EXISTING ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTS, SUBJECTING THEM TO ESCALATING COSTS OR

PROHIBITING THEM OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR, U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERTAKING A SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CONSUMER LENDING, THE OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES MARKET AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON GE CAPITALS STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND PERFORMANCE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF TRADE CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RISKS FROM LAWS THAT REDUCE THE ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT CONSUMER BORROWING, LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE

ASSETS, AND CHANGES TO TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GES EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S.

RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS

PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH NON-U.S. BANKS AND OTHER NON-U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH EXPIRES AT THE END

OF 2011, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS ON SIX PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN DECEMBER OF 2010, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THE PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER

2011, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED,

WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2012. IN ADDITION, EFFORTS BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE COSTS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REIMBURSEMENTS AND INCREASED UTILIZATION CONTROLS RELATED TO THE

USE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. INCREASED GOVERNMENT REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF MEDICAL DEVICES, INCLUDING REVIEWS OF THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (U.S. FDA) DEVICE PRE-MARKET AUTHORIZATION PROCESS, MAY IMPACT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SLOW OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE BEEN, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE, PARTICIPATING IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAMS, WHICH

REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH STRICT GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS. INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STATUS IN THESE PROJECTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. WE, OUR REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE AT TIMES BEING REVIEWED OR

INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND DAMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO

CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. THESE INCLUDE THE DREDGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE, AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS

FORM 10-K REPORT. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE

GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND JOINT

VENTURES.

WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS AND JOINT VENTURES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR

MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION AND COLLABORATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES

THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF

OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. EVEN UPON REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH A BUYER OR SELLER FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF A BUSINESS, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO SATISFACTION OF PRE-CLOSING CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TO NECESSARY REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM COMPLETING THE TRANSACTION.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS

USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USED TO ESTIMATE

PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR 2011 ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT

CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED GAINS (LOSSES)  NET, BENEFIT PLANS. AT THE END OF 2010, THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED BY $2.8 BILLION, AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN, AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD A

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $4.4 BILLION. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  PENSION ASSUMPTIONS IN PART II, ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). FAILURE TO ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS COULD ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS. IN ADDITION, UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST

OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST

INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY

AND COST OF GE CAPITAL FUNDING.

A LARGE PORTION OF GE CAPITALS BORROWINGS IS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT. GE

CAPITALS OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT WAS $37 BILLION AND $350 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. WE CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR TERM MATURITIES

FOR 2011 AND BEYOND. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS TO REFINANCE MATURING COMMERCIAL PAPER DEBT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN ORDER TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES, WE ALSO PLAN TO EXPAND OUR RELIANCE ON

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING BANK DEPOSITS, SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER ASSET-BASED FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN DIVERSIFYING OUR FUNDING SOURCES OR THAT THE SHORT AND LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS WILL BE

AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE COST OF FUNDING WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE AND AFFECT THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OF GE CAPITAL. FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING COSTS INCLUDE: A DECREASED RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM FUNDING,

SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, IN FAVOR OF LONGER-TERM FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS; DECREASED CAPACITY AND INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG DEBT ISSUERS; AND INCREASED COMPETITION FOR DEPOSITS IN OUR AFFILIATE BANKS MARKETS. IF GE CAPITALS COST OF

FUNDING WERE TO INCREASE, IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND RESULT IN LOWER LENDING MARGINS, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AS WELL AS LOWER RETURNS ON ITS SHAREOWNERS EQUITY AND INVESTED CAPITAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DETERIORATE, IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OF GE CAPITAL.

INCREASED PAYMENT DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES AND SUSTAINED LEVELS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT WRITE-DOWNS OF

ASSET VALUES BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GE CAPITAL. IF THESE CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND TAX ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE ESTABLISHED ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES IN GE CAPITALS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE, FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO

INCREASE THESE ALLOWANCES AND WRITE-OFFS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS

,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. TO REDUCE GES EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND REBALANCE THE RELATIVE SIZE OF ITS FINANCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WE DECIDED TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF GE CAPITAL, AS MEASURED BY ITS ENDING NET INVESTMENT. WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY AHEAD OF OUR REDUCTION

TARGETS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO TIMELY EXECUTE ON OUR REDUCTION TARGETS AND FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD RESULT IN GREATER EXPOSURE TO FINANCIAL MARKETS THAN CONTEMPLATED UNDER OUR STRATEGIC FUNDING PLAN OR MAY RESULT IN THE

NEED FOR US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO GE CAPITAL.

THE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITAL.

GE CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION, GE

CAPITALS CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS EXPOSURE TO

THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF UNSECURED DEBT INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING TO INITIAL CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 22 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT), WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY LOSSES

OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IN TWO WAYS: IT PROVIDES FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTIES, AND IT ALSO ACQUIRES EQUITY POSITIONS IN VARIOUS TYPES OF PROPERTIES OR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH THE

PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED AND THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF THOSE MARKETS AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE LEVEL OF TRANSACTIONS FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS CONTINUE TO REMAIN AT LEVELS BELOW HISTORICAL NORMS IN MANY OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL OPERATES. CONTINUED

HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, SLOWDOWN IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY, EXCESS INVENTORY CAPACITY AND LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND COLLATERAL TO REAL ESTATE LOANS GE CAPITAL HOLDS. UNDER

CURRENT MARKET AND CREDIT CONDITIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES GE CAPITAL WILL COMPLETE OR THE NET SALES PROCEEDS IT WILL REALIZE. ALSO, OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENT LEVELS MAY WORSEN, WHICH MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS TO

THE CARRYING VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS.

GE CAPITAL IS ALSO A

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDER IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES AND HOME SALE VOLUMES, JOB LOSSES, CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER

FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF OUR MORTGAGE LOANS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THESE MORTGAGE LOANS IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF CURRENT AND HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND LOAN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS OTHER MANAGEMENT

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY BE INACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED AND, AS A RESULT, MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY,

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GE AND GECCS LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD AND POORS

RATINGS SERVICE (S&P) WAS AA+ (THE SECOND HIGHEST OF 22 RATING CATEGORIES) WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK AND FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) WAS AA2 (THE THIRD HIGHEST OF 21 RATING CATEGORIES) WITH

A STABLE OUTLOOK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GE, GE CAPITAL SERVICES AND GE CAPITALS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING FROM S&P WAS A-1+ (THE HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF SIX CATEGORIES) AND FROM MOODYS WAS P-1 (THE

HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF FOUR CATEGORIES). THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS

TO CAPITAL MARKETS. VARIOUS DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION.

CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ALSO MAY MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES.

THE BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, HOME AND BUSINESS SOLUTIONS AND MEDIA BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CONDITIONS IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION,

HEALTHCARE, MEDIA, HOME BUILDING AND OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. AS A RESULT OF SLOWER GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, REDUCED LEVELS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR

POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY FASHION. IN PARTICULAR, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

CYCLICAL, AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL IS CORRELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF SLOW GROWTH IN THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONALLY THAT RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAFFIC COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. SERVICE CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING

SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IF SLOWER GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

INCREASED IT SECURITY THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED COMPUTER

CRIME COULD POSE A RISK TO OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES.

INCREASED GLOBAL IT SECURITY THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND

TARGETED COMPUTER CRIME POSE A RISK TO THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR DATA. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS BY EMPLOYING A NUMBER OF MEASURES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE TRAINING,

COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING OF OUR NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS, AND MAINTENANCE OF BACKUP AND PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS, OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS. DEPENDING ON THEIR NATURE

AND SCOPE, SUCH THREATS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE COMPROMISING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, IMPROPER USE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, MANIPULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF DATA, DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, PRODUCTION DOWNTIMES AND OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, COMPETITIVENESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY FACE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM OPERATIONAL

FAILURES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WE ARE DEPENDENT ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND PRODUCT INNOVATIONS FOR CONTINUED REVENUE

GROWTH.

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR BOTH OUR AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE OR USE

LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. WHILE WE HAVE BUILT EXTENSIVE OPERATIONAL PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICING OF SUCH PRODUCTS MEET THE MOST RIGOROUS QUALITY STANDARDS, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT WE OR OUR CUSTOMERS WILL NOT EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL PROCESS FAILURES THAT COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL PRODUCT, SAFETY, REGULATORY OR ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS. SUCH OPERATIONAL FAILURES OR

(19)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUALITY ISSUES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. OUR LONG-TERM OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP, INTRODUCE, AND MARKET NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, TO MODIFY EXISTING PRODUCTS, TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TO CUSTOMIZE

CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO OURS.

OUR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY

DEVELOPING OR SELLING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE OF OURS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY US TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL

ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY. WE COULD ALSO FACE COMPETITION IN SOME COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE NOT INVESTED IN AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND

OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF SUCH CLAIMS, RESPONDING TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. IF GE IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY

RIGHTS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR WE COULD BE ENJOINED FROM OFFERING SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR RE-NEW FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES WE NEED IN THE

FUTURE, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS.

SIGNIFICANT RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, SUPPLIER QUALITY ISSUES OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN

THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE

INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. QUALITY ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS CAN ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RESULT IN LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.
