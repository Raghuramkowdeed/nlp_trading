ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO

UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE

FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART II, ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED

NOTES IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS

FORM 10-K REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT - SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT - THAN WE

PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR

BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION AND IN THE BUSINESS

DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. BELOW, WE DESCRIBE

CERTAIN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS

WILL AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

THE

UNPRECEDENTED CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY AFFECT THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF GE CAPITALS FUNDING.

THE

FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF

VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION, PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON FINANCIAL AND OTHER

ASSET PRICES GENERALLY AND ON THE CREDIT AVAILABILITY FOR CERTAIN ISSUERS. THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK RECENTLY CREATED A NUMBER OF

PROGRAMS TO HELP STABILIZE CREDIT MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND RESTORE

LIQUIDITY. MANY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALSO CREATED OR ANNOUNCED SIMILAR

MEASURES FOR INSTITUTIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE

IMPROVED CONDITIONS IN THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THESE PROGRAMS, INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY, WILL CONTINUE TO

HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON THE MARKETS OVERALL, OR WILL RESOLVE THE CREDIT OR

LIQUIDITY ISSUES OF COMPANIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAMS.

A LARGE

PORTION OF GE CAPITALS BORROWINGS HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

TERM DEBT MARKETS. GE CAPITAL HAS CONTINUED TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND, AS

PLANNED, HAS REDUCED ITS OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE TO $67 BILLION AT

THE END OF 2008. GE CAPITAL HAS ALSO ISSUED TERM DEBT, MAINLY DEBT GUARANTEED BY

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION UNDER THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY

GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, ON A NON-GUARANTEED BASIS.

ALTHOUGH THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM DEBT MARKETS HAVE REMAINED AVAILABLE TO

GE CAPITAL TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS AND DEBT MATURITIES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT SUCH MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE COST

OF SUCH FUNDING WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE. IF CURRENT LEVELS OF MARKET

DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY CONTINUE OR WORSEN, OR IF WE CANNOT FURTHER REDUCE GE

CAPITALS ASSET LEVELS AS PLANNED IN 2009, WE WOULD SEEK TO REPAY COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND TERM DEBT AS IT BECOMES DUE OR TO MEET OUR OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS BY

USING THE FEDERAL RESERVES COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY (CPFF) AND THE

TLGP, APPLYING THE NET PROCEEDS OF OUR OCTOBER 2008 EQUITY OFFERING AND THE

INVESTMENT BY BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC., DRAWING UPON CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED

LENDING AGREEMENTS PRIMARILY PROVIDED BY GLOBAL BANKS AND/OR SEEKING OTHER

SOURCES OF FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE TLGP AND THE

CPFF WILL BE EXTENDED BEYOND THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION, OR THAT, UNDER SUCH

EXTREME MARKET CONDITIONS, CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED LENDING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER

FUNDING SOURCES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR SUFFICIENT.

OUR 2009

FUNDING PLAN ANTICIPATES APPROXIMATELY $45 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED

LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCE. IN JANUARY 2009, WE COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $11.0

BILLION OF FUNDING UNDER THE TLGP. WE ALSO ISSUED $5.1 BILLION IN NON-GUARANTEED

SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT WITH A MATURITY OF 30 YEARS UNDER THE NON-GUARANTEE

OPTION OF THE TLGP. THESE ISSUANCES, ALONG WITH THE $13.4 BILLION OF PRE-FUNDING

DONE IN DECEMBER 2008, BRING OUR AGGREGATE ISSUANCES TO $29.5 BILLION OR 66% OF

OUR ANTICIPATED 2009 FUNDING PLAN. ADDITIONALLY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE

90% COMPLETE WITH OUR 2009 FUNDING PLAN BY JUNE 30, 2009.

DIFFICULT

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS HAVE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF GE CAPITAL AND WE DO NOT

EXPECT THESE CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

DRAMATIC

DECLINES IN THE HOUSING MARKET, WITH FALLING HOME PRICES AND INCREASING

FORECLOSURES AND UNEMPLOYMENT, HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT WRITE-DOWNS OF ASSET

VALUES BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES AND

MAJOR COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANKS. THESE WRITE-DOWNS, INITIALLY OF

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES BUT SPREADING TO CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AND OTHER

DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, HAVE CAUSED MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SEEK

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, TO MERGE WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND, IN SOME CASES, TO

FAIL. MANY LENDERS AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS HAVE REDUCED AND, IN SOME CASES,

CEASED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO BORROWERS INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THIS MARKET TURMOIL AND TIGHTENING OF CREDIT HAVE LED TO AN INCREASED LEVEL OF

COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER DELINQUENCIES, LACK OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, INCREASED

MARKET VOLATILITY AND WIDESPREAD REDUCTION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY GENERALLY. IF

THESE CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE

ABLE TO RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS SUCH AS GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLES. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE ESTABLISHED

ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES IN GE CAPITALS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE, SIGNIFICANT AND UNEXPECTED FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE

ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE THESE

ALLOWANCES AND WRITE-OFFS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS

,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

(13)

THE

SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GE

CAPITAL.

GE

CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND

ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO

CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION,

GE CAPITALS CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY IT CANNOT

BE REALIZED UPON SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE

FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS

EXPOSURE TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF UNSECURED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING

TO INITIAL CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES

(AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 29 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT),

WHICH MITIGATE CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER,

THAT ANY LOSSES OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD

NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES ARE HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN.

GE

CAPITAL PARTICIPATES IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IN TWO WAYS: IT

PROVIDES FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTIES AND IT ALSO ACQUIRES AN EQUITY POSITION IN VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTIES. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT

UPON THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET IN WHICH THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED AND THE

PERCEIVED VALUE OF THAT MARKET AT THE TIME OF SALE. SUCH ACTIVITY MAY VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, A SLOWDOWN IN

GENERAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND RECENT DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS HAVE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT, THE VALUE

OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS GE CAPITAL HOLDS. UNDER CURRENT MARKET AND CREDIT

CONDITIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES GE CAPITAL WILL

COMPLETE OR THE NET SALES PROCEEDS IT WILL REALIZE. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENTALS WILL CONTINUE AT THEIR CURRENT

LEVELS GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH GE

CAPITAL CONTINUES TO HOLD ITS EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THESE PROPERTIES WHICH MAY

RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS.

GE

CAPITAL IS ALSO A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDER IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THAT HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES AND HOME SALE

VOLUMES, JOB LOSSES, CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY

IMPACT THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF OUR MORTGAGE LOANS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES ON THESE MORTGAGE LOANS IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF CURRENT AND

HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND LOAN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS OTHER MANAGEMENT

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY BE INACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN THIS

ENVIRONMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, CREDIT

PERFORMANCE WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED AND, AS A RESULT,

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FAILURE

TO MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE-A CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF

FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS.

THE

MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY

WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN DECEMBER 2008,

STANDARD & POORS RATINGS SERVICES AFFIRMED OUR AND GE CAPITALS AAA

LONG-TERM AND A-1+ SHORT-TERM CORPORATE CREDIT RATINGS BUT REVISED ITS RATINGS

OUTLOOK FROM STABLE TO NEGATIVE BASED PARTLY ON THE CONCERNS REGARDING GE

CAPITALS FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FUNDING IN LIGHT OF CAPITAL MARKET TURMOIL. ON

JANUARY 24, 2009, MOODYS INVESTMENT SERVICES PLACED THE LONG-TERM RATINGS OF GE

AND GE CAPITAL ON REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE. THE FIRMS PRIME-1 SHORT-TERM

RATINGS WERE AFFIRMED. MOODYS SAID THE REVIEW FOR DOWNGRADE IS BASED PRIMARILY

UPON HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING GE CAPITALS ASSET QUALITY AND EARNINGS

PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL MARKETS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR 2009 OPERATIONAL AND FUNDING PLAN FOR GE

CAPITAL OR, IN THE EVENT OF FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, THAT

COMPLETION OF OUR PLAN AND ANY OTHER STEPS WE MIGHT TAKE IN RESPONSE WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE-A RATINGS. FAILURE TO DO SO

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY,

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS. VARIOUS DEBT INSTRUMENTS,

GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL

IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, BUT NONE ARE TRIGGERED IF OUR RATINGS ARE

REDUCED TO AA-/AA3 OR A-1+/P-1 OR HIGHER.

(14)

CURRENT

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ALSO MAY

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR

NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES.

THE

BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL AND MEDIA BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR,

CONDITIONS IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION, HEALTHCARE,

NETWORK TELEVISION AND OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. AS A RESULT OF SLOWING

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND

BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, REDUCED LEVELS OF CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES

CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE

DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING

FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL

PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE

PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY

FASHION. CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR

CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING

SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS

TO US. ALTHOUGH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS EXPECTED TO ENACT

VARIOUS ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAMS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE TIMING

AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN CONTINUES

FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS SIGNIFICANT FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE

GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS.

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. IN 2008,

APPROXIMATELY 53% OF OUR REVENUES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION.

THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR

ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED

USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR

ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION HAS DECREASED OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS

A RESULT OF RECENT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.

THE

SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.

WITH

RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE

CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND

OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND

TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND

BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO

SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER (AS WAS THE

CASE WITH OUR CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS IN 2008), WHICH COULD DELAY THE

ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A

BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. THESE

DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL AND CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE SOME POTENTIAL SELLERS MAY HOLD ONTO ASSETS PENDING A

REBOUND IN PRICES AND BUYERS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING THE NECESSARY

FINANCING. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY SELL A BUSINESS WHOSE

SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN WHICH CASE OUR DECISION

WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE VALUE.

THERE

ARE RISKS INHERENT IN OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE

MARKET PRICE AND VOLUME OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE,

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. THESE MAY ARISE FROM GENERAL STOCK MARKET

CONDITIONS, THE IMPACT OF THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, A CHANGE IN SENTIMENT IN THE MARKET

REGARDING US OR OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR FROM OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THE

AMOUNTS AND FREQUENCY OF SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDENDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

(15)

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE

AND FOREIGN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN

RESPONSE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL NOT BE

CHANGED IN WAYS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND

OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON INVESTMENT BY MAKING EXISTING PRACTICES MORE

RESTRICTED, SUBJECT TO ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITED OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR,

WE EXPECT U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO UNDERTAKE A SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW AND

REVISION OF THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATION, WHICH MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON

GE CAPITALS STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY RISKS FROM LAWS THAT REDUCE THE ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT

CONSUMER BORROWING, LOCAL LIQUIDITY REGULATIONS THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF

NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS, AND CHANGES TO TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GES EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE

ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS

REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF

U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS

REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT

WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO

COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER FOREIGN FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT

THE END OF 2009, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS

ON FIVE PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN OCTOBER OF 2008, BUT THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THIS PROVISION IS

NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2009, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF

THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2010.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. WE AND OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE AT TIMES

BEING REVIEWED OR INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND

DAMAGES. THESE INCLUDE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANTITRUST

DIVISION AND THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) OF THE MARKETING

AND SALES OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

TO MUNICIPALITIES BY CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF GE CAPITAL AND AN INVESTIGATION BY

THE SEC OF POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN

ACCOUNTING ISSUES, AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER

OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. THESE INCLUDE THE DREDGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS FROM A

40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE, AS DESCRIBED IN

ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT

AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS

THAT LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED

WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, DISCOUNT RATES, AND OTHER

FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EQUITY, AND PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF

INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME

OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY

CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR 2009 ARE

THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLANS ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A

REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED GAINS (LOSSES)  NET, BENEFIT PLANS. AT THE

END OF 2008, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF OUR U.S. PRINCIPAL PENSION

PLANS WAS $45.1 BILLION AND ASSETS WERE $40.7 BILLION. FOR A DISCUSSION

REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION PLAN

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  PENSION ASSUMPTIONS IN

PART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT

DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO

LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS

REQUIRED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).
