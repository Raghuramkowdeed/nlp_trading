GE

IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD.

WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING A WIDE VARIETY OF

PRODUCTS FOR THE GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION, CONTROL AND UTILIZATION

OF ELECTRICITY SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1892. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE

DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED

CONSIDERABLY THE SCOPE OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

OUR

IN

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WE ENCOUNTER AGGRESSIVE AND

ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY

CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL

AS CUSTOMER COMMITMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE

THAT, IN GENERAL, WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IS ONE OF FOUR

MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH

SYNDICATED BROADCAST TELEVISION PROGRAMMING, CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES AND IN THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY. THE BUSINESSES IN

WHICH GECS ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, THRIFTS, INVESTMENT BANKS,

BROKER-DEALERS, CREDIT UNIONS, LEASING COMPANIES, CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES,

INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES, FINANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURERS,

AND INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANIES.

THIS

DOCUMENT CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” - THAT IS, STATEMENTS RELATED TO

FUTURE, NOT PAST, EVENTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OFTEN

ADDRESS OUR EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND OFTEN

CONTAIN WORDS SUCH AS “EXPECTS,” “ANTICIPATES,” “INTENDS,” “PLANS,” “BELIEVES,”

“SEEKS,” OR “WILL.” FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR NATURE ADDRESS MATTERS

THAT ARE, TO DIFFERENT DEGREES, UNCERTAIN. FOR US, PARTICULAR UNCERTAINTIES

ARISE FROM THE BEHAVIOR OF FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST

RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES; FROM FUTURE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; FROM

FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR INDUSTRIES WHICH WE SERVE INCLUDING,

WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION AND

HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES; FROM UNANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN OUR INSURANCE

BUSINESSES; AND FROM NUMEROUS OTHER MATTERS OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL

SCALE, INCLUDING THOSE OF A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, COMPETITIVE OR

REGULATORY NATURE. THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS TO BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE EXPRESSED IN OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE

DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED GLOBAL REVENUES INCREASED TO $71.8 BILLION IN 2004, COMPARED WITH

$60.8 BILLION IN 2003 AND $53.4 BILLION IN 2002. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ABOUT OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, SEE PAGES 58 AND 59 OF THE 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS.

SEGMENTS

SEGMENT

REVENUE AND PROFIT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED ON PAGE 53 OF THE 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREOWNERS. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL DATA AND COMMENTARY ON RECENT FINANCIAL

RESULTS FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON PAGES 52-58 OF THAT REPORT AND IN

NOTE 27 (PAGE 103) TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE REPORTED AS SEGMENTS INCLUDE ADVANCED MATERIALS, COMMERCIAL

FINANCE, CONSUMER FINANCE, CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL, ENERGY, EQUIPMENT &

OTHER SERVICES, HEALTHCARE, INFRASTRUCTURE, INSURANCE, NBC UNIVERSAL AND

TRANSPORTATION. THERE IS APPROPRIATE ELIMINATION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF GECS AND

THE IMMATERIAL EFFECT OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS TO ARRIVE AT TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED DATA. A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS

FOLLOWS.

(4)

ADVANCED

MATERIALS

ADVANCED

MATERIALS (5.4%, 5.3% AND 5.3% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY) MANUFACTURES AND SELLS HIGH-PERFORMANCE PLASTICS USED BY

COMPOUNDERS, MOLDERS, AND MAJOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS FOR USE IN A

VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING FABRICATION OF AUTOMOTIVE PARTS, COMPUTER

ENCLOSURES, COMPACT DISKS AND OPTICAL-QUALITY MEDIA, MAJOR APPLIANCE PARTS,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. OUR PRODUCTS ALSO

INCLUDE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, SILICONES, HIGH-PURITY QUARTZWARE AND, UNTIL THE

SALE OF OUR SUPERABRASIVES BUSINESS IN LATE 2003, INDUSTRIAL GRADE AND GEM

QUALITY DIAMONDS. MARKET OPPORTUNITIES ARE CREATED BY SUBSTITUTING MANY OF THESE

PRODUCTS FOR OTHER MATERIALS, THEREBY PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCTIVITY

THROUGH IMPROVED MATERIAL PERFORMANCE AT LOWER SYSTEM COSTS. WE SELL THESE

MATERIALS TO A DIVERSE, WORLDWIDE CUSTOMER BASE, MAINLY MANUFACTURERS. OUR

BUSINESS HAS A SIGNIFICANT OPERATING PRESENCE AROUND THE WORLD AND WE

PARTICIPATE IN NUMEROUS MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION JOINT VENTURES. IN 2003,

WE ACQUIRED OSI SPECIALTIES, A LEADING, GLOBAL SUPPLIER OF SILANES, SPECIALTY

SILICONES AND URETHANE ADDITIVES, AND WE DIVESTED OUR SPECIALTY CHEMICALS AND

SUPERABRASIVES UNITS.

OUR

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS CHARACTERIZED BY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND HEAVY

CAPITAL INVESTMENT. TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WE MUST MAINTAIN EMPHASIS ON EFFICIENT

MANUFACTURING PROCESS IMPLEMENTATION AND DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MARKET

AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE LARGE, TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN

SUPPLIERS OF THE SAME, AS WELL AS OTHER FUNCTIONALLY SIMILAR, MATERIALS. OUR

BUSINESS IS CYCLICAL AND IS SENSITIVE TO VARIATIONS IN PRICE AND TO THE EFFECTS

OF SUPPLY/DEMAND FACTORS ON THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS BENZENE, CUMENE

AND METHANOL. COMPETITION IS AFFECTED BY AVAILABILITY OF MANUFACTURING CAPACITY

AND ANTICIPATION OF NEW PRODUCT OR MATERIAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. OUR

APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, OFTEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH OUR EXISTING OR POTENTIAL

CUSTOMERS, AND ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL MARKET

DEMAND. PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS PATENTS ESTABLISH BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN

MANY PRODUCT LINES.

OUR

HEADQUARTERS ARE IN PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN

NORTH AMERICA, ASIA, EUROPE, AND SOUTH AMERICA.

COMMERCIAL

FINANCE

COMMERCIAL

FINANCE (15.4%, 15.5% AND 14.8% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2004, 2003, AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY) OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES WORLDWIDE. WE

HAVE PARTICULAR EXPERTISE IN THE MID-MARKET, AND OFFER LOANS, LEASES, AND OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND

INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL AND ENERGY-RELATED FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT; COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE; VEHICLES; AIRCRAFT; AND EQUIPMENT USED IN MANY

INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION, MANUFACTURING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND

HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES.

DURING

2004, WE ACQUIRED THE COMMERCIAL LENDING BUSINESS OF TRANSAMERICA FINANCE

CORPORATION; THE U.S. LEASING BUSINESS OF IKON OFFICE SOLUTIONS; SOPHIA, S.A., A

REAL ESTATE COMPANY IN FRANCE; AND BENCHMARK GROUP PLC, A U.K.-LISTED REAL

ESTATE PROPERTY COMPANY.

(5)

WE

OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, LEASING COMPANIES, FINANCING COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH

MANUFACTURERS AND INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES. COMPETITION IS BASED ON PRICE,

THAT IS INTEREST RATES AND FEES, AS WELL AS DEAL STRUCTURE AND TERMS.

PROFITABILITY IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY BY BROAD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT

CUSTOMER CREDIT QUALITY AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL, BUT ALSO BY

SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, OPERATING RISK AND MARKET RISKS SUCH AS

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS. SUCCESS REQUIRES HIGH QUALITY RISK

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, CUSTOMER AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, DIVERSIFICATION,

SERVICE AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, STRONG COLLATERAL AND ASSET MANAGEMENT

KNOWLEDGE, DEAL STRUCTURING EXPERTISE AND THE ABILITY TO REDUCE COSTS THROUGH

TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTIVITY.

WE

PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TWO OF OUR SEGMENT PRODUCT LINES, REAL ESTATE

(COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE FINANCING) AND AVIATION SERVICES (COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

FINANCING). EACH OF THESE PRODUCT LINES FINANCES A SINGLE FORM OF COLLATERAL,

AND EACH HAS UNDERSTANDABLE CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK AND OPPORTUNITIES.

REAL

ESTATE

OUR

REAL ESTATE PRODUCT LINE OPERATES GLOBALLY, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH JOINT

VENTURES. OUR REAL ESTATE BUSINESS FINANCES, WITH BOTH EQUITY AND LOAN

STRUCTURES, THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF OFFICE BUILDINGS,

APARTMENT BUILDINGS, SELF STORAGE FACILITIES, RETAIL FACILITIES, INDUSTRIAL

PROPERTIES, PARKING FACILITIES AND FRANCHISE PROPERTIES. OUR TYPICAL REAL ESTATE

LOANS ARE INTERMEDIATE TERM, MAY BE EITHER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED, FIXED OR

FLOATING-RATE, AND ARE SECURED BY EXISTING INCOME-PRODUCING COMMERCIAL

PROPERTIES. OUR ORIGINATIONS OF LOW LOAN-TO-VALUE LOANS ARE CONDUCTED FOR TERM

SECURITIZATION WITHIN ONE YEAR. WE INVEST IN, AND PROVIDE RESTRUCTURING

FINANCING FOR, PORTFOLIOS OF MORTGAGE LOANS, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND TAX-EXEMPT

BONDS.

OUR

HEADQUARTERS ARE IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT WITH OFFICES THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA,

SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA.

FINANCE

RESPECTIVELY) IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF CREDIT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO

OUR

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF BANK AND CONSUMER PROTECTION REGULATIONS,

INCLUDING REGULATIONS CONTROLLING DATA PRIVACY. FURTHER, A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES

HAVE CEILINGS ON RATES CHARGEABLE TO CONSUMERS IN FINANCIAL SERVICE

TRANSACTIONS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, LEASING COMPANIES, CONSUMER LOAN

COMPANIES, INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES, MANUFACTURERS’ CAPTIVE FINANCE

COMPANIES, AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS COMPETE ON THE BASIS

OF PRICE, SERVICING CAPABILITY, PROMOTIONAL MARKETING, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND

CROSS SELLING. THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF

DECLINING RETAIL SALES, CHANGES IN INTEREST AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND

INCREASES IN PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY FILINGS.

OUR

HEADQUARTERS ARE IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE

NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, SOUTH AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA.

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL (9.0%, 9.6% AND 9.7% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2004, 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY) SELLS PRODUCTS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH VOLUME AND RELATIVELY

LOW UNIT PRICES. OUR PRODUCTS SHARE SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS - COMPETITIVE

DESIGN, EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE. STRONG

GLOBAL COMPETITION RARELY PERMITS PREMIUM PRICING, SO COST CONTROL, INCLUDING

PRODUCTIVITY, IS KEY. DESPITE PRICING PRESSURES ON MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE ALSO

INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENTIATED, PREMIUM PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE

PROFITABLE. THE COMBINATION OF THREE SEPARATE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES PROVIDES

SCALE AND FACILITATES SYNERGIES IN HEADQUARTER, BACK OFFICE AND DISTRIBUTION

CHANNEL COSTS. WHILE SOME CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY

DIRECTED TO CONSUMER APPLICATIONS (APPLIANCES, FOR EXAMPLE), AND SOME PRIMARILY

TO INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS (SWITCHGEAR, FOR EXAMPLE), OTHERS ARE DIRECTED TO

BOTH MARKETS (LIGHTING, FOR EXAMPLE).

OUR

HEADQUARTERS ARE IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN NORTH

AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA.

WE

DESCRIBE THE SEGMENT ACCORDING TO MARKET CHANNEL - CONSUMER, AND INDUSTRIAL

THE

AGGREGATE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN MARKETS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

GENERALLY LAG OVERALL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES. IN

USED AS THE PRIMARY FUEL FOR GAS TURBINES IN COMBINED-CYCLE SYSTEMS. IGCC

SYSTEMS PRODUCE FEWER AIR POLLUTANTS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL PULVERIZED COAL

POWER PLANTS. OUR OIL AND GAS BUSINESS OFFERS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TURBOMACHINERY

(DLN) TUNING. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL

PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND MORE EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS THAT COMPLY

WITH TODAY’S STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

WORLDWIDE

COMPETITION FOR POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS INTENSE. DEMAND FOR

MOST POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS GLOBAL AND, AS A RESULT, IS

SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH WE

DO BUSINESS. REGIONAL LOAD GROWTH REQUIREMENTS AND DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT ARE

IMPORTANT FACTORS. THE AVAILABILITY OF FUELS AND RELATED PRICES HAVE A LARGE

IMPACT ON DEMAND. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ORDERS AND BACKLOG, SEE PAGE 55 OF THE

RESPECTIVELY) PRODUCES, SELLS AND SERVICES EQUIPMENT FOR THE AIR AND RAIL

TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRIES.

WE

DESCRIBE THE SEGMENT ACCORDING TO MARKET CHANNEL - AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND RAIL.

FOR

INFORMATION ABOUT ORDERS AND BACKLOG, SEE PAGE 57

OF

THE 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

OUR

AIRCRAFT ENGINES BUSINESS PRODUCES, SELLS AND SERVICES JET ENGINES, TURBOPROP

AND TURBO SHAFT ENGINES, AND RELATED REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR USE IN MILITARY AND

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. OUR MILITARY ENGINES ARE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT

INCLUDING FIGHTERS, BOMBERS, TANKERS, HELICOPTERS AND SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT AND

OUR COMMERCIAL ENGINES POWER AIRCRAFT IN ALL CATEGORIES OF RANGE: SHORT/MEDIUM,

INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE, AS WELL AS EXECUTIVE AND REGIONAL AIRCRAFT. WE ALSO

PRODUCE ENGINES THROUGH CFM INTERNATIONAL, A COMPANY JOINTLY OWNED BY GE AND

SNECMA MOTEURS OF FRANCE, AND A NEW ENGINE IS BEING DESIGNED AND MARKETED IN A

JOINT VENTURE WITH THE PRATT & WHITNEY DIVISION OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES

CORPORATION.

(13)

WE

PROVIDE MAINTENANCE, COMPONENT REPAIR AND OVERHAUL SERVICES (MRO), INCLUDING

SALES OF REPLACEMENT PARTS, FOR MANY MODELS OF ENGINES, INCLUDING REPAIR AND

OVERHAUL OF ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS. WE ALSO MANUFACTURE AIRCRAFT

ENGINE DERIVATIVES USED FOR MARINE PROPULSION, MECHANICAL DRIVES AND INDUSTRIAL

POWER GENERATION SOURCES, THE LATTER OF WHICH IS ALSO REPORTED AS PART OF THE

ENERGY SEGMENT. IN DECEMBER 2003, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE

COMBINED WITH AIRCRAFT ENGINES’ NDT BUSINESS TO OFFER RADIOGRAPHIC, ULTRASONIC,

EDDY CURRENT AND OTHER INSPECTION SOLUTIONS THAT TEST THE STRUCTURE AND

TOLERANCE OF MATERIALS WITHOUT DAMAGING THEM.

THE

WORLDWIDE COMPETITION IN AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES AND MRO (INCLUDING PARTS SALES) IS

INTENSE. BOTH U.S. AND EXPORT MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES

ARE LONG AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES, BOTH CUSTOMER-FINANCED AND INTERNALLY FUNDED, ARE

IMPORTANT IN THIS BUSINESS, AS ARE FOCUSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGIES AND

PROTECTION OF KEY AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND PRODUCT

UPGRADE TECHNOLOGIES.

POTENTIAL

SALES FOR ANY ENGINE ARE LIMITED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS TECHNOLOGICAL

LIFETIME, WHICH MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING UPON THE RATE OF ADVANCE IN

TECHNOLOGY, THE SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER OF

RELEVANT AIRFRAME APPLICATIONS. AIRCRAFT ENGINE ORDERS TEND TO FOLLOW MILITARY

AND AIRLINE PROCUREMENT CYCLES, ALTHOUGH CYCLES FOR MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL

ENGINE PROCUREMENT ARE DIFFERENT.

OUR

RAIL BUSINESS PROVIDES TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS IN A VARIETY OF

INDUSTRIES INCLUDING RAILROAD, TRANSIT, MINING, OIL AND GAS, POWER GENERATION,

AND MARINE. WE SERVE CUSTOMERS IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES. OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE

HIGH HORSEPOWER DIESEL-ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES AS WELL AS PARTS AND SERVICES FOR

LOCOMOTIVES, INCLUDING LOCOMOTIVES MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS.

WITH

THE LAUNCH OF THE EVOLUTION SERIESTM LOCOMOTIVE, WE CREATED OUR MOST

OR EXCEEDING THE EPA’S TIER II REQUIREMENTS. COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF THE GE

EVOLUTION SERIESTM LOCOMOTIVE BEGAN IN JANUARY 2005.

THE

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

TOTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WERE $3,091 MILLION IN 2004. TOTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE $2,656 MILLION IN 2003 AND $2,631 MILLION IN 2002. OF THESE

AMOUNTS, $2,443 MILLION IN 2004 WAS GE-FUNDED ($2,103 MILLION IN 2003 AND $2,215

MILLION IN 2002); AND $648 MILLION IN 2004 WAS FUNDED BY CUSTOMERS ($553 MILLION

IN 2003 AND $416 MILLION IN 2002), PRINCIPALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF GE’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENDITURES FROM BOTH GE AND CUSTOMER FUNDS. HEALTHCARE AND ENERGY ALSO MADE

SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES OF GE AND CUSTOMER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

FUNDS.

APPROXIMATELY

14,800 PERSON-YEARS OF SCIENTIST AND ENGINEERING EFFORT WERE DEVOTED TO RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN 2004, WITH ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME INVOLVED

PRIMARILY IN GE-FUNDED ACTIVITIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS.

WE

HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT

SYSTEMS AT ALL OF OUR FACILITIES AND TRACK OUR PERFORMANCE. SINCE 1996, WE HAVE

REDUCED EMPLOYEE INJURIES BY OVER 75% AS WELL AS REDUCING AIR AND WASTEWATER

EXCEEDANCES AND EMISSIONS AT OUR FACILITIES. WE ALSO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN

VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT RECOGNIZE FACILITIES WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRAMS THAT

EXCEED LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND

HEALTH ADMINISTRATION’S VOLUNTARY PROTECTION PROGRAM (VPP), AS WELL AS A SIMILAR

GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IN MEXICO. PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRES

GOVERNMENT AUDITS TO VERIFY OUR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT

SYSTEMS. WE ARE A LEADING PARTICIPANT IN THE U.S. VPP PROGRAM WITH 89 SITES, AND

HAVE AN ADDITIONAL 20 SITES PARTICIPATING IN THE MEXICO PROGRAM. WE HAVE A

GLOBAL STAR PROGRAM DESIGNED TO RECOGNIZE SITES WITH WORLD-CLASS HEALTH AND

SAFETY PROGRAMS IN THOSE COUNTRIES WITHOUT GOVERNMENT VPP PROGRAMS. OUR 56

GLOBAL STAR SITES HAVE PASSED A RIGOROUS EVALUATION CONDUCTED BY GE INTERNAL

HEALTH AND SAFETY EXPERTS. WE ALSO HAVE 89 SITES ACCREDITED BY OUTSIDE AUDITORS

UNDER THE ISO 14000 STANDARD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.

(15)

OVER

THE LAST TWO YEARS WE SPENT A TOTAL OF ABOUT $0.1 BILLION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS

RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION

ACTIONS, WHICH ARE PRINCIPALLY EXPENSED AND ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL

DEVICES—SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS, GROUNDWATER MONITORING DEVICES, AIR

STRIPPERS OR SEPARATORS, AND INCINERATORS—AT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES

CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH

POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS TO TOTAL ABOUT $0.1 BILLION

OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR

MODIFY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WE

ALSO ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP

HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE

THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY

OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE

REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO $0.1 BILLION IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE

PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL

EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF $0.1 BILLION TO $0.2 BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO

YEARS.

THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) RULED IN FEBRUARY 2002 THAT

APPROXIMATELY 150,000 POUNDS OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS) MUST BE DREDGED

FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE. WE HAVE

SUBMITTED WHAT IS KNOWN AS A “GOOD FAITH OFFER” UNDER THE SUPERFUND LAW AND

CONTINUE TO COOPERATE AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE EPA IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

RULING. PURSUANT TO NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS, WE HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE SAMPLING

OF THE PROJECT AREA TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF PCBS THAT MAY BE DREDGED AND

HAVE AGREED TO UNDERTAKE THE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING OF THE REMEDY. THE

AGREEMENTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN EPA COSTS EXPENDED IN

THE PAST AND WHICH WOULD BE EXPENDED IN THE FUTURE. THE REMEDIAL DESIGN AND

ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES ARE SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED DURING 2006. NEGOTIATIONS

CONTINUE CONCERNING PERFORMANCE OF THE REMEDIAL WORK. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, INCLUDED LIABILITIES FOR THE

ESTIMATED COSTS OF THIS REMEDIATION.
