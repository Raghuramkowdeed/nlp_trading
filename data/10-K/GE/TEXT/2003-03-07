GE IS ONE OF THE

LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. GE HAS

ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS

FOR THE GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION, CONTROL AND UTILIZATION OF

ELECTRICITY SINCE ITS INCORPORATION IN 1892. OVER THE YEARS, GE HAS DEVELOPED OR

ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED CONSIDERABLY THE

SCOPE OF ITS ACTIVITIES.

GE'S PRODUCTS

INCLUDE MAJOR APPLIANCES; LIGHTING PRODUCTS; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION PRODUCTS;

MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING EQUIPMENT; MOTORS; ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND

CONTROL EQUIPMENT; LOCOMOTIVES; POWER GENERATION AND DELIVERY PRODUCTS; NUCLEAR

POWER SUPPORT SERVICES AND FUEL ASSEMBLIES; COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT JET

ENGINES; AND ENGINEERED MATERIALS, SUCH AS PLASTICS, SILICONES AND SUPERABRASIVE

INDUSTRIAL DIAMONDS; AND CHEMICALS FOR TREATMENT OF WATER AND PROCESS SYSTEMS.

GE'S SERVICES

INCLUDE PRODUCT SERVICES; ELECTRICAL PRODUCT SUPPLY HOUSES; ELECTRICAL APPARATUS

INSTALLATION, ENGINEERING, REPAIR AND REBUILDING SERVICES; AND THROUGH THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2002, COMPUTER-RELATED INFORMATION SERVICES. THROUGH ITS AFFILIATE,

THE NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY, INC., GE DELIVERS NETWORK TELEVISION

SERVICES, OPERATES TELEVISION STATIONS, AND PROVIDES CABLE, INTERNET AND

MULTIMEDIA PROGRAMMING AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES. THROUGH ANOTHER AFFILIATE,

SERVICES, CONSUMER SAVINGS AND INSURANCE SERVICES, AND SPECIALTY INSURANCE AND

REINSURANCE.

IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF

ITS GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, GE ENCOUNTERS AGGRESSIVE AND ABLE COMPETITION.

IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY CHANGING

TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS

CUSTOMER COMMITMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT, IN GENERAL, GE IS ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH IT PARTICIPATES. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IS ONE OF FOUR

MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS. IT ALSO COMPETES WITH

SYNDICATED BROADCAST TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES. THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH GE CAPITAL SERVICES ENGAGES ARE

SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

COMMERCIAL BANKS, THRIFTS, INVESTMENT BANKS, BROKER-DEALERS, CREDIT UNIONS,

LEASING COMPANIES, CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES, INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES,

FINANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURERS, AND INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE

COMPANIES.

THIS 10-K REPORT

INCLUDES CERTAIN "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE STATEMENTS ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENT'S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND CHANGES

IN CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE EXPECTATIONS

DUE TO CHANGES IN GLOBAL POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, COMPETITIVE, MARKET AND

REGULATORY FACTORS.

GE CONSOLIDATED

INTERNATIONAL REVENUES HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

REVENUE AND SEGMENT

PROFIT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT

SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, IS PRESENTED ON PAGE 57 OF

THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHARE OWNERS. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL DATA AND COMMENTARY

ON RECENT FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON PAGES 50-58

OF THAT REPORT AND IN NOTE 27 (PAGES 101 AND 102) TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

OPERATING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE REPORTED AS SEGMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 131 INCLUDE AIRCRAFT

ENGINES, COMMERCIAL FINANCE, CONSUMER FINANCE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS, EQUIPMENT

MANAGEMENT, INSURANCE, NBC AND POWER SYSTEMS. THE REMAINING KEY BUSINESSES DO

NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO

THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES

(INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, MATERIALS, AND TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES). THERE IS APPROPRIATE ELIMINATION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF GECS AND THE

IMMATERIAL EFFECT OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS TO ARRIVE AT TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED DATA. A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES

AIRCRAFT ENGINES

(8.5%, 9.0% AND 8.3% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY) PRODUCES, SELLS AND SERVICES JET ENGINES, TURBOPROP AND TURBOSHAFT

ENGINES, AND RELATED REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR USE IN MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT. GE'S MILITARY ENGINES ARE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT THAT

INCLUDES FIGHTERS, BOMBERS, TANKERS, HELICOPTERS AND SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT. THE

CFM56TM, PRODUCED BY CFMI, A COMPANY JOINTLY OWNED BY GE AND SNECMA OF FRANCE,

AND GE'S CF6 AND GE90® ENGINES POWER AIRCRAFT IN ALL CATEGORIES OF LARGE

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT: SHORT/MEDIUM, INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE. APPLICATIONS FOR

THE CFM56TM ENGINE INCLUDE: BOEING'S 737-300/-400/-500 SERIES, THE NEXT

GENERATION 737-600/-700/-800/-900 SERIES, AND THE 737 BUSINESS JET; AIRBUS

INDUSTRIE'S A318, A319, A320, A321 AND A340-200/-300 SERIES; AND MILITARY

AIRCRAFT SUCH AS THE KC-135R, E/KE-3 AND E-6. THE CF6 FAMILY OF ENGINES POWERS

INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE AIRCRAFT SUCH AS BOEING'S 747, 767, DC-10 AND MD-11

SERIES, AS WELL AS AIRBUS INDUSTRIE'S A300, A310 AND A330 SERIES. THE GE90®

ENGINE IS USED TO POWER BOEING'S 777 SERIES TWIN-ENGINE AIRCRAFT. THE GP7000,

BEING DESIGNED AND MARKETED IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH THE PRATT & WHITNEY

DIVISION OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, IS OFFERED ON AIRBUS INDUSTRIE'S

A380. THE BUSINESS PRODUCES JET ENGINES, SUCH AS THE CF34®, FOR EXECUTIVE

AIRCRAFT AND REGIONAL COMMUTER AIRCRAFT. THE BUSINESS ALSO MANUFACTURES AIRCRAFT

ENGINE DERIVATIVES USED FOR MARINE PROPULSION, MECHANICAL DRIVES AND INDUSTRIAL

POWER GENERATION SOURCES, THE LATTER OF WHICH ARE REPORTED AS PART OF THE POWER

SYSTEMS SEGMENT. MAINTENANCE, COMPONENT REPAIR AND OVERHAUL SERVICES (MRO),

INCLUDING SALES OF REPLACEMENT PARTS, ARE PROVIDED FOR MANY MODELS OF ENGINES,

INCLUDING ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS, AND REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THIS SEGMENT'S PROFITS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AIRCRAFT

ENGINES COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF UNISON INDUSTRIES INC., A GLOBAL LEADER IN

IGNITION SYSTEMS FOR AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.

(4)

THE WORLDWIDE

COMPETITION IN AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES AND MRO (INCLUDING PARTS SALES) IS INTENSE.

BOTH U.S. AND EXPORT MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES ARE LONG

AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES, BOTH CUSTOMER-FINANCED AND INTERNALLY FUNDED, ARE

IMPORTANT IN THIS SEGMENT. FOCUSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGIES AND

PROTECTION OF KEY AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND PRODUCT

UPGRADE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. POTENTIAL SALES FOR ANY ENGINE ARE

LIMITED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS TECHNOLOGICAL LIFETIME, WHICH MAY VARY

CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING UPON THE RATE OF ADVANCE IN THE STATE OF THE ART, BY THE

SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND BY THE LIMITED NUMBER OF RELEVANT

AIRFRAME APPLICATIONS. AIRCRAFT ENGINE ORDERS TEND TO FOLLOW MILITARY AND

AIRLINE PROCUREMENT CYCLES, ALTHOUGH CYCLES FOR MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL ENGINE

PROCUREMENT ARE DIFFERENT. PROCUREMENTS OF MILITARY JET ENGINES ARE AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN GLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS.

IN LINE WITH

INDUSTRY PRACTICE, AIRFRAME MANUFACTURERS SUPPORT THEIR SALES OF COMMERCIAL JET

AIRCRAFT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH LONG-TERM FINANCING COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS,

AND ENGINE MANUFACTURERS ARE OFTEN ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH FINANCINGS. IN

MAKING SUCH COMMITMENTS, IT IS GE'S POLICY TO ESTABLISH A SECURED POSITION IN

THE AIRCRAFT BEING FINANCED. UNDER SUCH AIRLINE FINANCING PROGRAMS, GE HAD

ISSUED GUARANTEES AMOUNTING TO $0.7 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002, AND HAD ENTERED

INTO COMMITMENTS TOTALING $1.6 BILLION TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ON FUTURE

AIRCRAFT ENGINE SALES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE TOTAL ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

AIRCRAFT SECURING THESE GUARANTEES EXCEEDED THE GUARANTEED AMOUNTS, NET OF THE

ASSOCIATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. SEE PAGE 50 OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHARE

OWNERS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ORDERS AND BACKLOG.

COMMERCIAL FINANCE

COMMERCIAL FINANCE

(12.2%, 11.0% AND 9.2% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY) OFFERS BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AN ARRAY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE. WITH A PARTICULAR EXPERTISE IN THE MID-MARKET SEGMENT,

COMMERCIAL FINANCE PROVIDES LOANS, FINANCING AND OPERATING LEASES, AND OTHER

SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND END-USERS, FOR

A VARIETY OF EQUIPMENT AND MAJOR CAPITAL ASSETS INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES

AND EQUIPMENT, ENERGY-RELATED FACILITIES, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AND

INVESTMENTS, VEHICLES, AIRCRAFT, AND EQUIPMENT USED IN CONSTRUCTION,

MANUFACTURING, DATA PROCESSING AND OFFICE APPLICATIONS, ELECTRONICS AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTHCARE. A DESCRIPTION OF COMMERCIAL FINANCE'S

PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES FOLLOWS.

COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCING

COMMERCIAL

EQUIPMENT FINANCING (CEF) OFFERS LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES A BROAD LINE OF

LEASES AND LOANS. CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS, DEALERS,

END-USERS, AND MUNICIPALITIES. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INCLUDE FINANCING FOR

CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, TRUCKS AND

PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS LEASE AND SALE/LEASEBACK OFFERINGS. PRODUCTS ARE EITHER

OFF-LEASE AND REPOSSESSED EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS. DURING 2002, CEF PURCHASED

CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM FINOVA CORPORATION, COMDISCO CORPORATION AND

AUSTRALIAN GUARANTEE CORPORATION.

(5)

THE GLOBAL

COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCING INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND

INTENSELY COMPETITIVE. COMPETITORS IN THE U.S. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS INCLUDE INDEPENDENT FINANCING COMPANIES, FINANCING SUBSIDIARIES OF

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, AND BANKS (NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL). INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS COMPETE NOT ONLY ON THE BASIS OF MONTHLY PAYMENTS, INTEREST RATES

AND FEES CHARGED CUSTOMERS BUT ALSO ON DEAL STRUCTURES AND CREDIT TERMS. THE

PROFITABILITY OF CEF IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY BY BROAD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT

IMPACT CUSTOMER CREDIT QUALITY AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL, BUT

ALSO BY SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, OPERATING RISK AND SUCH MARKET

RISKS AS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK. IMPORTANT FACTORS TO

CONTINUED SUCCESS INCLUDE MAINTAINING STRONG RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, DIVERSE

PORTFOLIOS, SERVICE AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, STRONG COLLATERAL AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE, DEAL STRUCTURING EXPERTISE AND THE REDUCTION OF COSTS

THROUGH ENHANCED USE OF TECHNOLOGY.

CEF OPERATES FROM

OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA AND AUSTRALIA AND THROUGH JOINT

VENTURES IN INDONESIA AND CHINA. CEF HEADQUARTERS ARE IN DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

REAL ESTATE

REAL ESTATE IS ONE

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET. REAL ESTATE PROVIDES FUNDS FOR THE ACQUISITION,

REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AS WELL AS MAKING EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO, EUROPE

AND ASIA. LENDING IS A MAJOR PORTION OF REAL ESTATE'S BUSINESS IN THE FORM OF

INTERMEDIATE-TERM SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED FIXED AND FLOATING-RATE LOANS SECURED

BY EXISTING INCOME-PRODUCING COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS OFFICE BUILDINGS,

APARTMENT BUILDINGS, RETAIL CENTERS, WAREHOUSES AND HOTELS. LOANS RANGE FROM

SINGLE-PROPERTY MORTGAGES TYPICALLY NOT LESS THAN $1 MILLION TO MULTI-PROPERTY

PORTFOLIOS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. REAL ESTATE'S BUSINESS ALSO

INCLUDES THE ORIGINATION AND SUBSEQUENT SECURITIZATION OF LOW LEVERAGE REAL

ESTATE LOANS, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO BE HELD LESS THAN ONE YEAR BEFORE SALE.

ADDITIONALLY, REAL ESTATE PURCHASES AND PROVIDES RESTRUCTURING FINANCING FOR

PORTFOLIOS OF REAL ESTATE, MORTGAGE LOANS, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AND TAX-EXEMPT

BONDS.

EQUITY POSITIONS IN A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS VIA DIRECT

REAL ESTATE OWNERSHIP AND JOINT VENTURE INTERESTS. PROPERTY TYPES INCLUDE

APARTMENT BUILDINGS, SELF-STORAGE FACILITIES, WAREHOUSES, PARKING FACILITIES,

RETAIL CENTERS AND OFFICE PROPERTIES. REAL ESTATE'S EQUITY HOLDINGS INCREASED IN

2002 WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SECURITY CAPITAL GROUP INCORPORATED, AN

INTERNATIONAL REAL ESTATE OPERATING COMPANY. THIS ACQUISITION PROVIDED REAL

ESTATE WITH OWNERSHIP POSITIONS IN SELF-STORAGE FACILITIES, PARKING FACILITIES,

GROCERY-ANCHORED NEIGHBORHOOD RETAIL CENTERS, WAREHOUSE FACILITIES AND

DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, SENIOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, OFFICE PROPERTIES AND

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT ADVISORY BUSINESSES. ALSO IN 2002, REAL ESTATE PURCHASED

THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND ASSET-BASED LENDING PORTFOLIOS OF DAIMLERCHRYSLER

CAPITAL SERVICES.

COMPETITION IS

INTENSE IN EACH OF REAL ESTATE'S AREAS AND ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES. COMPETITORS

INCLUDE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND, INCREASINGLY, MULTI-NATIONAL LENDERS AND INVESTORS.

IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN REAL ESTATE'S LENDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

FINANCING RATES, LOAN PROCEEDS, LOAN STRUCTURE, THE ABILITY TO FUND TRANSACTIONS

EFFICIENTLY, AND THE OUTLOOK OF LOCAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS. WHERE REAL ESTATE

PROVIDES EQUITY CAPITAL, PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE THE VALUATION OF

UNDERLYING PROPERTIES AND INVESTMENT STRUCTURE AS WELL AS TRANSACTION CYCLE

TIME.

REAL ESTATE HAS

OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS IN CANADA, MEXICO, EUROPE AND

ASIA. REAL ESTATE HEADQUARTERS ARE IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT.

RETAIL, AND MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES. CF ALSO PROVIDES SENIOR DEBT,

SUBORDINATED DEBT AND BRIDGE FINANCING TO BUYOUT AND PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS.

THE CORPORATE

FINANCING BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY INTENSE COMPETITION FROM A VARIETY OF

LENDERS AND FACTORING SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING LOCAL, REGIONAL, NATIONAL

AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND NON-BANK FINANCING INSTITUTIONS. COMPETITION IS

BASED ON INTEREST RATES, FEES, CREDIT TERMS, AND TRANSACTION STRUCTURES. IN

ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISKS WITHIN THE

EXISTING CUSTOMER LOAN PORTFOLIO ALSO AFFECTS PROFITABILITY. IMPORTANT FACTORS

TO CONTINUED SUCCESS INCLUDE MAINTAINING DEAL STRUCTURING EXPERTISE, STRONG RISK

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, AND COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE.

CF HEADQUARTERS ARE

IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT. CF HAS LENDING OPERATIONS IN 25 CITIES, INCLUDING

INTERNATIONAL OFFICES IN CANADA, MEXICO, THAILAND, KOREA, SINGAPORE, THE

OF ASEA BROWN BOVERI (ABB). THE ACQUIRED STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS INCLUDES

GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING, EQUIPMENT LEASING AND FINANCING BUSINESSES.

THIS ACQUISITION WILL INCREASE SFG'S PRESENCE IN THE PROJECT AND TRADE FINANCE

MARKETS.

SFG'S COMPETITION

IS DIVERSE AND GLOBAL, RANGING FROM LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SMALL NICHE

CAPITAL PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, TWO OF SFG'S CLIENT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY, ARE FACED WITH EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOSTERED

BY DEREGULATION, GLOBALIZATION AND TECHNICAL INNOVATION. BOTH OF THESE

INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN RECENTLY EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN DEMAND FOR

THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR SFG TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, SFG MUST PROVIDE

CAPITAL TO BORROWERS IN INNOVATIVE AND UNIQUE WAYS BASED ON INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE

AND COMPETITIVE PRICING AND PROPERLY ASSESS CREDIT RISKS AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE

PORTFOLIOS.

SFG HEADQUARTERS

ARE IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT, AND IT HAS OFFICES IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS; HOUSTON,

TEXAS; NEW YORK, NEW YORK; DENVER, COLORADO; AND SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.

AVIATION SERVICES

AVIATION SERVICES,

THE WORLD'S FOREMOST AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANY, IS A GLOBAL COMMERCIAL AVIATION

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS THAT OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS TO

AIRLINES, AIRCRAFT OPERATORS, OWNERS, LENDERS AND INVESTORS. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

INCLUDE LEASES, AIRCRAFT PURCHASING AND TRADING, LOANS, ENGINE/SPARE PARTS

FINANCING, PILOT TRAINING, FLEET PLANNING AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES.

FOLLOWING THE

EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, MANY OF OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED

FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. IN FACE OF DECLINING TRAFFIC, THEY HAVE RESPONDED BY

CURTAILING FLIGHT SCHEDULES AND DEFERRING AND CANCELING DELIVERIES OF COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT. DETERIORATING AIRCRAFT UTILIZATION AND PRICING AFFECTS AVIATION

SERVICES, WHICH OWNED 1,161 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WHEN,

DESPITE PRESSURE ON THE INDUSTRY, 1,149, OR 99% WERE ON LEASE. WE BELIEVE,

HOWEVER, THAT THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE

TO WEIGH ON THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IN 2003.

AVIATION SERVICES

HEADQUARTERS ARE IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT, WITH REGIONAL OFFICES IN SHANNON,

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND; NEW YORK, NEW YORK; MIAMI, FLORIDA; CHICAGO, ILLINOIS;

VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES INCLUDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, OFFICE EQUIPMENT,

HEALTHCARE, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY AND INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT. VFS ESTABLISHES

SALES FINANCING IN TWO WAYS -- BY FORMING CAPTIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH

MANUFACTURERS THAT DO NOT HAVE THEM, AND BY OUTSOURCING CAPTIVE PARTNERSHIPS

FROM MANUFACTURERS THAT DO (CAPTIVE PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE SALES FINANCING SOLELY

FOR PRODUCTS OF A GIVEN MANUFACTURER). VFS OFFERS INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE,

LEADING EDGE TECHNOLOGY, LEASING AND EQUIPMENT EXPERTISE, AND GLOBAL

CAPABILITIES. IN ADDITION, VFS PROVIDES AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF RELATED FINANCIAL

SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING TRADE PAYABLES SERVICES. IN NOVEMBER 2002, VFS

LINE, COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION FINANCE (CDF). CDF IS A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF

SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION FINANCING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES INCLUDING INVENTORY

FINANCING, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING, FORMULA BASED LENDING, PRIVATE LABEL

FINANCING, RENTAL FINANCE, WARRANTY AND COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

A FURTHER ECONOMIC

SLOWDOWN COULD IMPACT THE EQUIPMENT FINANCING INDUSTRY, INTENSIFYING A

COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT, PRESSURE DELINQUENCIES AND RESIDUAL

REALIZATIONS, AND PRESSURE ANY RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS FROM VENDOR RELATIONSHIPS.

FOR VFS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE VFS MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DRIVE DOWN COSTS

THROUGH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AND CONTINUE TO

MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS SPREAD OF RISK IN INDUSTRY SECTORS AND EQUIPMENT

CATEGORIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH VENDOR PARTNERS.

VFS HAS SALES

OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, EUROPE, ASIA (INCLUDING JAPAN),

AND AUSTRALIA. VFS HEADQUARTERS ARE IN DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

IT COMPETES IN THE REINSURANCE MARKETPLACE PRINCIPALLY ON THE BASIS OF ITS

EXPERTISE, RELATIONSHIPS, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, PRICE AND CREATIVITY IN DEVELOPING

CUSTOMIZED SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS. WITHIN THE DIRECT INSURANCE MARKETPLACE,

MAINTAINING STRONG

FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN REMAINING COMPETITIVE IN

BOTH THE REINSURANCE AND DIRECT INSURANCE MARKETS IN WHICH GE GLOBAL INSURANCE

HOLDING COMPETES. DURING 2002, CERTAIN EXTERNAL CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ANNOUNCED

THE LOWERING OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS WITH RESPECT TO GE GLOBAL INSURANCE

HOLDING AND SUBSIDIARIES. THOSE RATING AGENCIES MADE SIMILAR ANNOUNCEMENTS WITH

REGARD TO OTHER PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE ENTITIES AT

BILLION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT. THESE RATINGS WERE ADJUSTED NEGATIVELY IN 2002, BUT

REMAINED INVESTMENT GRADE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE ACTIONS WILL MATERIALLY

AFFECT GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OR THE ABILITY

TO WRITE FUTURE BUSINESS.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, IN JANUARY 2002 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NEW YORK

STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION REGARDING NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE

STATE'S CLEAN WATER ACT AT ITS WATERFORD, NY FACILITY. THE STATE ALLEGES SPILLS

AND DISCHARGES IN EXCESS OF PERMITTED LIMITS AS WELL AS REPORTING VIOLATIONS.

THE STATE INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WOULD SEEK A PENALTY OF $1.5 MILLION. IT

HAS SINCE REDUCED ITS DEMAND TO $1 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY COMMENCED

IMPLEMENTATION OF A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM TO ELIMINATE THE SOURCE OF THE

SPILLS. NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE FINAL PENALTY ARE UNDERWAY.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, IN APRIL 2002, THE OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY INFORMED THE

COMPANY THAT IT WAS SEEKING PENALTIES OF $4.3 MILLION FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE

STATE'S CLEAN AIR ACT AT ITS NEWARK, OH FACILITY. THE STATE ALLEGED THAT THE

SITE CONSTRUCTED AIR EMISSION SOURCES WITHOUT UNDERGOING ADEQUATE NEW SOURCE

REVIEW. THE MATTER INVOLVES CONDITIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY AND VOLUNTARILY

DISCLOSED TO THE STATE MORE THAN 5 YEARS AGO WHICH THE COMPANY PROACTIVELY

ADDRESSED WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE STATE. THE STATE HAS SINCE REDUCED ITS

DEMAND TO $1.4 MILLION, WHICH THE COMPANY STILL BELIEVES IS INAPPROPRIATE AND

UNREASONABLE CONSIDERING THE HISTORY OF THE MATTER. NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE STATE

ARE UNDERWAY.

(20)

IN SEPTEMBER 2002,

THE OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS

SEEKING PENALTIES OF $220,000 FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE'S CLEAN AIR ACT AT ITS

WILLOUGHBY, OH FACILITY. THE STATE ALLEGED THAT THE SITE CONSTRUCTED AIR

EMISSION SOURCES WITHOUT UNDERGOING PERMITTING. SOME OF THE FACTS IN THIS MATTER

ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE NEWARK, OH MATTER DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND THE COMPANY

IS CONDUCTING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE STATE TO RESOLVE BOTH MATTERS JOINTLY.

FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, SEE PAGES 59 AND 96 OF GE'S 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHARE OWNERS.

IT IS THE VIEW OF

CORPORATE INFORMATION

ABOUT THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AT GE, ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES SHARE COMMON VALUES AND OBJECTIVES, EACH

STRIVING TO DELIVER EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE AND GENERATE INCREASING SHARE OWNER

VALUE. HOWEVER, OUR BUSINESSES ARE ALSO DIVERSE. WITH THIS DIVERSITY COMES

ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. ONE EXAMPLE OF

THIS COMBINATION OF OPPORTUNITY AND CHALLENGE IS OUR NEED TO SHARE OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN THE MOST MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE. TO FULFILL THIS OBJECTIVE WE

CONTINUE TO PRESENT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AS WELL AS

INFORMATION DIVIDED INTO TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES – INDUSTRIAL (GE) AND FINANCIAL

SERVICES (GECS). BY REVIEWING THE TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES, YOU CAN GAIN A

MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF OUR PERFORMANCE IN MEASURES LIKE LEVERAGE, ASSET

TURNOVER AND CASH FLOW. WHILE OUR FINANCIAL REPORT IS LONGER THAN IT HAS BEEN

HISTORICALLY, THAT ADDITIONAL LENGTH AROSE FROM YOUR REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

OUR DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT RESULTS INCLUDES ASSET DETAILS FOR THE MAJOR FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES, FOR EXAMPLE, SINCE PORTFOLIO SIZE IS SIGNIFICANT TO

EARNINGS OF THOSE BUSINESSES.

WHEN WE COMMITTED TO INCREASING OUR TRANSPARENCY, WE EXPECTED THAT THIS

REPORT WOULD BE A PRIMARY VEHICLE THAT PROVIDES A REFERENCE SOURCE FOR YOUR

QUESTIONS ABOUT US. WE STARTED THAT PROCESS LAST YEAR, AND THE 2002 REPORT

CONTINUES THE TREND. YOU WILL SEE THAT OUR FINANCIAL SECTION, 69 PAGES LONG,

CONTAINS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION THAN OUR 2000 REPORT CONTAINED IN ITS 44

PAGES. WE SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE PROGRESSED TOWARDS OUR TRANSPARENCY

OBJECTIVE, AND BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL FIND THE IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INFORMATION

YOU NEED IN THE PAGES THAT FOLLOW.

WE ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, AND, WHEN THOSE QUESTIONS WOULD BE

OF INTEREST TO A BROADER AUDIENCE, WE WILL INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION IN OUR

FINANCIAL REPORTS. FOLLOWING ARE AMONG THE OTHER IMPORTANT CHANGES THIS YEAR,

CHANGES THAT WE TRUST WILL ASSIST YOU IN USING THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE PRESENT OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY AT

WWW.GE.COM/INVESTOR

. THIS SITE IS MUCH MORE THAN AN ELECTRONIC REPRODUCTION

OF THE FOLLOWING PAGES. IT IS INTERACTIVE AND INFORMATIVE, AND WE BELIEVE IT

GIVES A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. WE INVITE YOU TO

HELP US ACCELERATE THIS PROCESS BY GIVING US FEEDBACK ON THE WEBSITE.

WE CHANGED THE WAY THAT WE MANAGE CERTAIN FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES,

INCREASING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF REPORTING SEGMENTS FROM EIGHT TO 12. WE HAVE

RECAST ALL COMPARATIVE FINANCIAL DATA TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE BASIS FOR

COMPARISON.

WE DESCRIBE OUR BUSINESSES ON PAGES 108 AND 109.

WE HAVE INCLUDED A GLOSSARY OF KEY FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS TERMS ON PAGES

110 AND 111.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

ONE

OF OUR MOST CRUCIAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR INVESTORS ARE WELL

INFORMED. WE TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MEETING THIS OBJECTIVE, ADOPTING APPROPRIATE

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DEVOTING OUR FULL, UNYIELDING COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT THOSE

POLICIES ARE APPLIED PROPERLY AND CONSISTENTLY. WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO REPORT IN A MANNER

THAT IS RELEVANT, COMPLETE AND CLEAR, AND WE WELCOME AND EVALUATE EACH SUGGESTION FROM

THOSE WHO USE OUR REPORTS.

RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT

OVERSIGHT

MEMBERS OF OUR CORPORATE LEADERSHIP

TEAM REVIEW EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES CONSTANTLY, ON MATTERS THAT RANGE FROM OVERALL STRATEGY

AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, TO STAFFING AND COMPLIANCE. OUR BUSINESS LEADERS CONSTANTLY

MONITOR REAL-TIME FINANCIAL AND OPERATING SYSTEMS, ENABLING US TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL

OPPORTUNITIES AND CONCERNS AT AN EARLY STAGE, AND POSITIONING US TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE

RAPID RESPONSES. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OVERSEES MANAGEMENTS BUSINESS CONDUCT, AND

OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, OVERSEES OUR SYSTEM

OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS. WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF RECENT

GOVERNANCE ACTIONS INTENDED TO ENHANCE INVESTOR TRUST AND IMPROVE THE BOARDS OVERALL

EFFECTIVENESS. THESE ACTIONS INCLUDE INCREASING TO A MAJORITY THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT

DIRECTORS, NAMING A PRESIDING DIRECTOR WHO WILL CONDUCT AT LEAST THREE MEETINGS PER YEAR

WITH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, REQUIRING EACH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR TO VISIT TWO OF

GES BUSINESSES ANNUALLY TO MEET DIRECTLY WITH OPERATING LEADERSHIP AND VOLUNTARILY

EXPENSING OUR STOCK OPTIONS.

DEDICATION TO

CONTROLLERSHIP

WE MAINTAIN A DYNAMIC SYSTEM OF

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESINCLUDING INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTINGDESIGNED TO ENSURE RELIABLE FINANCIAL RECORD-KEEPING, TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE, PROTECTION OF PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND EFFICIENT

USE OF RESOURCES. WE RECRUIT AND RETAIN A WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL TEAM, INCLUDING 450

INTERNAL AUDITORS WHO CONDUCT THOUSANDS OF AUDITS EACH YEAR, IN EVERY GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AT

EVERY GE BUSINESS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSEE THE SCOPE AND RESULTS

OF THESE REVIEWS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A SET OF INTEGRITY POLICIESOUR SPIRIT &

LETTERWHICH REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND POLICY, AND WHICH PERTAIN TO SUCH

VITAL ISSUES AS UPHOLDING FINANCIAL INTEGRITY AND AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. WE HAVE

PUBLISHED THESE INTEGRITY POLICIES IN 27 LANGUAGES, AND WE HAVE PROVIDED THEM TO EVERY ONE

OF GES MORE THAN 300,000 GLOBAL EMPLOYEES, HOLDING EACH OF THESE

INDIVIDUALSFROM OUR TOP MANAGEMENT ON DOWNPERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR

COMPLIANCE WITH THEM. OUR INTEGRITY POLICIES SERVE TO REINFORCE KEY EMPLOYEE

RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND WE INQUIRE EXTENSIVELY ABOUT COMPLIANCE. OUR STRONG

COMPLIANCE CULTURE REINFORCES THESE EFFORTS BY REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO RAISE ANY COMPLIANCE

CONCERNS AND BY PROHIBITING RETRIBUTION FOR DOING SO.

VISIBILITY TO INVESTORS

WE ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE

OF FULL AND OPEN PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. TO

FACILITATE THIS, WE MAINTAIN A DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE, WHICH INCLUDES SENIOR EXECUTIVES WHO

POSSESS EXCEPTIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR INVESTORS. WE HAVE ASKED THIS

COMMITTEE TO EVALUATE THE FAIRNESS OF OUR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES, AND TO REPORT THEIR

FINDINGS TO US AND TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE FURTHER ENSURE STRONG DISCLOSURE BY HOLDING

MORE THAN 250 ANALYST AND INVESTOR MEETINGS EVERY YEAR, AND BY COMMUNICATING ALL MATERIAL

INFORMATION COVERED IN THOSE MEETINGS TO THE PUBLIC. IN TESTAMENT TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

OUR STRINGENT DISCLOSURE POLICIES, INVESTORS SURVEYED ANNUALLY BY

INVESTOR RELATIONS

MAGAZINE HAVE AWARDED GE BEST OVERALL INVESTOR RELATIONS PROGRAM BY A MEGA-CAP COMPANY FOR

SIX CONSECUTIVE YEARS, AND 15 AWARDS IN OTHER CATEGORIES IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. WE ARE

IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES, AND OUR DEBT

CONTINUES TO RECEIVE THEIR HIGHEST RATINGS. WE WELCOME THE STRONG OVERSIGHT OF OUR

FINANCIAL REPORTING ACTIVITIES BY OUR INDEPENDENT AUDIT FIRM, KPMG LLP, WHO ARE ENGAGED BY

AND REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. THEIR REPORT FOR 2002 APPEARS ON PAGE 45.

GREAT

COMPANIES ARE BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION OF RELIABLE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND COMPLIANCE

WITH THE LAW. FOR GE, THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES MADE IN THIS REPORT ARE A VITAL PART OF

THAT FOUNDATION. WE PRESENT THIS INFORMATION PROUDLY, WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WHO

USE IT WILL UNDERSTAND OUR COMPANY, RECOGNIZE OUR COMMITMENT TO PERFORMANCE WITH

INTEGRITY, AND SHARE OUR CONFIDENCE IN GES FUTURE.

INDEPENDENT

AUDITORS REPORT

TO SHARE OWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES ("GE") AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, AND THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, CHANGES IN

SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR

PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF GE MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUDITING STANDARDS

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT

WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE AFOREMENTIONED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPEARING ON PAGES F-30, F-32, F-34, F-15, AND F-36 TO F-67 PRESENT FAIRLY, IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND

CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR

OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

GE IN 2002 CHANGED ITS METHODS OF ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND IN 2001 CHANGED ITS METHODS OF

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND IMPAIRMENT OF

CERTAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED ASSETS.

OUR AUDITS WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING AN OPINION ON

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS WHOLE. THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION APPEARING ON PAGES F-31, F-33, AND F-35 IS PRESENTED

FOR PURPOSES OF ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RATHER THAN TO PRESENT THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH

FLOWS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES. THE CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION HAS BEEN

SUBJECTED TO THE AUDITING PROCEDURES APPLIED IN THE AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND, IN OUR OPINION, IS FAIRLY STATED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS IN RELATION TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE COMBINATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL

MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCT SERVICES BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (GE) AND THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. (GECS OR

FINANCIAL SERVICES).

WE

PRESENT MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS IN THREE PARTS: CONSOLIDATED

OPERATIONS, SEGMENT OPERATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

WE ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS IN 2002,

DEMONSTRATING THE BENEFITS OF OUR DIVERSE BUSINESS PORTFOLIO AND CONTINUING EMPHASIS ON

GLOBALIZATION, TECHNOLOGY, GROWTH IN SERVICES, DIGITIZATION AND THE SIX SIGMA QUALITY

INITIATIVE.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WERE $131.7 BILLION IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF 5% OVER REVENUES OF

$125.9 BILLION IN 2001, REFLECTING A 7% INCREASE IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND A SLIGHT

DECREASE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES OF $125.9 BILLION IN 2001

DECREASED 3% FROM $129.9 BILLION IN 2000, REFLECTING A 6% INCREASE IN INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS

REVENUES PARTIALLY OFFSETTING A 12% DECREASE IN FINANCIAL SERVICESTHE RESULT OF

SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC REPOSITIONING ACTIVITIES.

OUR

EARNINGS BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGES INCREASED TO A RECORD $15.1 BILLION IN 2002, A 7%

INCREASE FROM $14.1 BILLION IN 2001. PER-SHARE EARNINGS BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGES

INCREASED TO $1.51 DURING 2002, UP 7% FROM THE PRIOR YEARS $1.41. (EXCEPT AS

OTHERWISE NOTED, WHEN WE REFER TO PER-SHARE EARNINGS OR EARNINGS PER

SHARE, WE MEAN EARNINGS PER SHARE ON A DILUTED BASIS.)

CONTRIBUTIONS

FROM ACQUISITIONS AFFECT EARNINGS COMPARISONS. OUR CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS IN 2002, 2001

AND 2000 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $636 MILLION, $225 MILLION AND $345 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. WE INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND ONLY

EARNINGS DURING THE FIRST 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE QUARTER IN WHICH WE COMPLETE THE

ACQUISITION ARE CONSIDERED TO BE RELATED TO ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.

RETURN ON AVERAGE SHARE OWNERS

EQUITY (EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES) WAS 25.8% IN 2002, COMPARED WITH 27.1%

IN 2001, WHICH WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS IN 2000.

WE DECLARED $7.3 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS

IN 2002. PER-SHARE DIVIDENDS OF $0.73 WERE UP 11% FROM 2001, FOLLOWING A 16% INCREASE FROM

THE PRECEDING YEAR. WE HAVE REWARDED OUR SHARE OWNERS WITH 27 CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF

DIVIDEND GROWTH. OUR DIVIDEND GROWTH FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPACED

DIVIDEND GROWTH OF COMPANIES IN THE STANDARD & POORS 500 STOCK INDEX.

EXCEPT

AS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE ANALYSIS IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF

GE (WITH GECS INCLUDED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS) AND GECS. SEE THE SEGMENT OPERATIONS SECTION

ON PAGE 50 FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESSES WITHIN GE AND GECS.

GE TOTAL REVENUES WERE $79.0 BILLION

IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $74.0 BILLION IN 2001 AND $69.5 BILLION IN 2000.

GE

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES WERE $73.3 BILLION IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF 8% FROM 2001, WHICH

IN TURN WAS 7% HIGHER THAN IN 2000. VOLUME WAS ABOUT 9% HIGHER IN 2002, REFLECTING

DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASES AT POWER SYSTEMS, NBC, MEDICAL SYSTEMS, SPECIALTY MATERIALS AND

INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES AT AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND TRANSPORTATION

SYSTEMS. SELLING PRICES WERE LOWER ACROSS MOST SEGMENTS OTHER THAN NBC AND POWER SYSTEMS.

THE NET EFFECT IN 2002 OF EXCHANGE RATES ON SALES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

U.S. DOLLAR WAS SLIGHTLY POSITIVE. VOLUME IN 2001 WAS ABOUT 7% HIGHER THAN IN 2000, WITH

SELLING PRICE AND CURRENCY EFFECTS BOTH SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

GE/S&P CUMULATIVE DIVIDEND GROWTH

SINCE 1997

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISPLAY OF SALES AND COSTS OF SALES ON PAGES 72 AND

73, GOODS IS REQUIRED BY U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATIONS

TO INCLUDE ALL SALES OF TANGIBLE PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES MUST INCLUDE ALL OTHER

SALES, INCLUDING BROADCASTING AND INFORMATION SERVICES ACTIVITIES. WE REFER TO SALES OF

BOTH SPARE PARTS (GOODS) AND REPAIR SERVICES AS SALES OF PRODUCT SERVICES,

WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OPERATIONS. SALES OF PRODUCT SERVICES WERE $20.8 BILLION

IN 2002, AN 11% INCREASE OVER 2001. INCREASES IN PRODUCT SERVICES IN 2002 AND 2001 WERE

WIDESPREAD, LED BY CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH AT POWER SYSTEMS, MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. OPERATING MARGIN FROM PRODUCT SERVICES WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.2

BILLION, UP 11% FROM 2001. THE INCREASE REFLECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN MOST PRODUCT SERVICES

BUSINESSES AND WAS LED BY POWER SYSTEMS AND MEDICAL SYSTEMS.

<PAGE>

F-5

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 47

GE OTHER INCOME, EARNED FROM A WIDE

VARIETY OF SOURCES, WAS $1.1 BILLION, $0.4 BILLION AND $0.5 BILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND

2000, RESPECTIVELY. OTHER INCOME IN 2002 INCLUDED A $0.6 BILLION PRE-TAX GAIN RESULTING

FROM NBCS EXCHANGE OF CERTAIN ASSETS FOR THE CABLE NETWORK BRAVO AND A $0.5 BILLION

PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF 90% OF GLOBAL EXCHANGE SERVICES.

GECS TOTAL REVENUES DECREASED

SLIGHTLY TO $58.2 BILLION IN 2002, FOLLOWING A 12% DECREASE TO $58.4 BILLION IN 2001. THE

LARGEST SINGLE FACTOR AFFECTING 2002 REVENUES WAS GROWTH FROM INCREASES IN ACQUISITIONS

AND ORIGINATIONSPRIMARILY AT COMMERCIAL FINANCE. THIS GROWTH WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY

THE ABSENCE OF REVENUES FROM AMERICOM AFTER ITS SALE IN LATE 2001 ($1.7 BILLION),

INCREASED ESTIMATES OF PRIOR-YEAR LOSS EVENTS AND LOWER INVESTMENT GAINS AT INSURANCE

($0.9 BILLION), LOWER SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY IN ALL SEGMENTS ($0.6 BILLION), AND LOWER

MARKET INTEREST RATES.

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES

(IN BILLIONS)

THE

THREE PRINCIPAL REASONS FOR THE DECREASE IN REVENUES IN 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 WERE: THE

DECONSOLIDATION OF MONTGOMERY WARD LLC (WARDS) AND RESULTING ABSENCE OF SALES IN 2001

($3.2 BILLION); THE EFFECTS OF RATIONALIZATION OF OPERATIONS AND MARKET CONDITIONS AT IT

SOLUTIONS ($2.9 BILLION); AND REDUCED SURRENDER FEES ($1.2 BILLION) ASSOCIATED WITH THE

PLANNED RUN-OFF OF RESTRUCTURED INSURANCE POLICIES OF TOHO MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

(TOHO) AT GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER REVENUE ITEMS IS

PROVIDED IN THE SEGMENT OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGE 50.

DESPITE

GOOD GROWTH IN UNDERLYING OPERATIONS, GECS EARNINGS BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGES OF $4.6

BILLION IN 2002 WERE DOWN 17% FROM 2001. THE INSURANCE SEGMENT MORE THAN ACCOUNTED FOR THE

DECLINE, WITH $2.3 BILLION AFTER TAX OF ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT AND ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATES

OF PRIOR-YEAR LOSS EVENTS. REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND GAINS ON ASSET SECURITIZATION

DECLINED BY $0.8 BILLION AFTER TAX. PARTIAL OFFSETS WERE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION THAT CEASED

AT THE BEGINNING OF 2002 ($0.6 BILLION IN 2001) AND LOWER TAXES ($0.6 BILLION).

GECS

EARNINGS BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGES IN 2001 INCREASED 8% FROM 2000. PRINCIPAL FACTORS IN

THE 2001 INCREASE WERE STRONG PRODUCTIVITY ($0.7 BILLION) AND LOWER TAXES ($0.5 BILLION)

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED EARNINGS AT GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING CORPORATION (GE GLOBAL

INSURANCE HOLDING), THE PARENT OF EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE CORPORATION ($0.5 BILLION)

REFLECTING THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, LOSSES AND LOWER REALIZED GAINS ON FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. EXCLUDING EFFECTS OF PAINE WEBBER GROUP, INC. (PAINEWEBBER) IN 2000 AND

AMERICOM IN 2001, SUCH PRE-TAX GAINS WERE LOWER IN 2001 BY $0.5 BILLION ($0.3 BILLION

AFTER TAX). PRE-TAX GAINS ON SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES DECLINED IN 2001 BY $0.5

BILLION, OF WHICH $0.4 BILLION RELATED TO GE EQUITY; OTHER GE EQUITY GAINS WERE $0.8

BILLION LOWER; WHILE GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS WERE UP $0.8 BILLION FROM 2000.

PRINCIPAL COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR GE

ARE THOSE CLASSIFIED AS COSTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SEVERAL OF OUR ONGOING INITIATIVES HAD SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON

COSTS.

THE SIX SIGMA QUALITY INITIATIVE CONTINUES TO REDUCE REWORK, SIMPLIFY PROCESSES AND REDUCE

DIRECT MATERIAL COSTS.

GLOBALIZATION CONTINUES TO REDUCE COSTS THROUGH SOURCING OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN LOWER-COST COUNTRIES.

DIGITIZATION HAS ALSO ENABLED

US TO SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE PROCESSES WHILE INVESTING IN INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. WE CONDUCT A GROWING PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS OVER THE INTERNET.

BENEFITS FROM THIS INITIATIVE INCLUDE IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE, EXPANDED PRODUCT AND

SERVICE OFFERINGS AND INCREASED OPERATING EFFICIENCY FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS.

OUR

PRINCIPAL U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (PLANS) CONTRIBUTED $806 MILLION TO PRE-TAX

EARNINGS IN 2002, OR 3.5% OF EARNINGS BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGES, COMPARED WITH $1,480

MILLION (6.8%) AND $1,266 MILLION (6.5%) IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. CONSIDERING

CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON

VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF ASSETS IN WHICH OUR PLANS ARE INVESTED, WE ASSUMED THAT LONG-TERM

RETURNS ON OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS WOULD BE 8.5% IN 2002 AND 9.5% IN 2001 AND 2000.

REDUCING THE ASSUMED RETURN BY 100 BASIS POINTS IN 2002 INCREASED ANNUAL PENSION COSTS BY

ABOUT $480 MILLION PRETAX. OF COURSE, ACTUAL ANNUAL INVESTMENT RETURNS CAN BE EXTREMELY

VOLATILE. BECAUSE THIS SHORT-TERM MARKET VOLATILITY OCCURS IN CONTEXT OF THE LONG-TERM

NATURE OF PENSION PLANS, U.S. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

ASSUMED AND ACTUAL RETURNS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES.

<PAGE>

F-6

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 48

TWO

OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE

USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND CHANGES IN POSTRETIREMENT

HEALTHCARE COSTS. WE REDUCED OUR DISCOUNT RATE FROM 71⁄2% TO 71⁄4% FOR 2002, A REDUCTION

THAT INCREASED OUR COSTS BY ABOUT $90 MILLION PRETAX. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE COSTS ALSO

INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN 2002. SEE NOTES 5 AND 6 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT

FUNDING STATUS, COMPONENTS OF EARNINGS EFFECTS AND ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS OF THE PLANS. SEE

PAGES 70-71 FOR DISCUSSION OF PENSION ASSUMPTIONS.

OUR

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS WILL LIKELY INCREASE IN 2003 FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS,

INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM 71⁄4% TO 63⁄4%, AMORTIZATION OF INVESTMENT

LOSSES AND SUSTAINED INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT OUR PLAN

ASSETS WILL EARN 81⁄2%, ON AVERAGE, OVER THE LONG TERM. OUR LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS

UNIONS EXPIRE IN JUNE 2003, AND RESULTS OF UNION NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH ARE UNCERTAIN, COULD

AFFECT POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS IN 2003 AND BEYOND.

WE

WILL NOT MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2003. TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY

TO FORECAST THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THAT PLAN SO

LONG AS EXPECTED INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED. THE PRESENT FUNDING STATUS PROVIDES

ASSURANCE OF BENEFITS FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS, BUT FUTURE EFFECTS ON OPERATING RESULTS AND

FUNDING DEPEND ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE.

OPERATING MARGIN IS SALES OF GOODS

AND SERVICES LESS THE COSTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD, AS WELL AS SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. GE OPERATING MARGIN WAS 19.1% OF SALES IN 2002, DOWN FROM 19.6%

IN 2001 AND ABOUT THE SAME AS THE COMPARABLE 18.9% IN 2000. THE DECLINE IN 2002 WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MATERIALS SEGMENT AND THE LIGHTING BUSINESS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND

ALSO REFLECTED RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES OF $0.6 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATING MARGINS AT POWER SYSTEMS AND NBC. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER

CHARGES INCLUDED $0.4 BILLION FOR RATIONALIZING CERTAIN OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES OF

GES WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THE IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING MARGIN IN 2001 WAS

LED BY POWER SYSTEMS AND AIRCRAFT ENGINES, REFLECTING INCREASING BENEFITS FROM THE

DIGITIZATION, PRODUCT SERVICES AND SIX SIGMA QUALITY INITIATIVES. REPORTED OPERATING

MARGIN WAS 18.6% IN 2000, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF A ONE-TIME RETIREMENT BENEFIT PROVISION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE LABOR AGREEMENT CONCLUDED IN THAT YEAR.

TOTAL COST PRODUCTIVITY (SALES IN

RELATION TO COSTS, BOTH ON A CONSTANT DOLLAR BASIS) FOR GE IN 2002 AND 2001 WAS ABOUT 2%.

VARIABLE COST PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS (LED BY INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS AND PLASTICS) AND BASE

COST PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AT PLASTICS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER BASE COST

PRODUCTIVITY PRIMARILY AT POWER SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS AND SPECIALTY MATERIALS. IN

2001, TOTAL COST PRODUCTIVITY WAS 2.2% AS PRODUCTIVITY IN POWER SYSTEMS AND MEDICAL

SYSTEMS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEGATIVE PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS SEVERAL BUSINESSES,

PARTICULARLY PLASTICS, REFLECTING VOLUME DECLINES.

GE INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL

CHARGES IN 2002 AMOUNTED TO $569 MILLION, DOWN 30% FROM $817 MILLION IN 2001, WHICH WAS

ABOUT THE SAME AS 2000. THE DECREASE IN 2002 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST ON

TAX LIABILITIES (SEE PAGE 49). DURING 2001, THE BENEFITS OF LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES

AND LOWER AVERAGE BORROWING LEVELS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PROVISIONS FOR

INTEREST ON TAX LIABILITIES.

GECS INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS

IN 2002 WAS $9.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $10.6 BILLION IN 2001 AND $11.1 BILLION IN 2000.

CHANGES IN BOTH YEARS REFLECTED THE EFFECTS OF LOWER INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS USED TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET GROWTH.

THE AVERAGE COMPOSITE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE WAS 4.07% IN 2002, COMPARED WITH 5.11% IN

2001 AND 5.89% IN 2000. IN 2002, AVERAGE ASSETS OF $455.2 BILLION WERE 18% HIGHER THAN IN

2001, WHICH IN TURN WERE 7% HIGHER THAN IN 2000. SEE PAGE 62 FOR A DISCUSSION OF INTEREST

RATE RISK MANAGEMENT.

GECS BORROWINGS

(IN BILLIONS)

FINANCING SPREADS. OVER THE LAST

THREE YEARS, MARKET INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN MORE VOLATILE THAN GECS AVERAGE COMPOSITE

EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF THE MIX OF EFFECTIVELY FIXED-RATE

BORROWINGS IN THE GECS FINANCING STRUCTURE. YIELDS ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF FIXED AND

FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS HAVE BEHAVED SIMILARLY; CONSEQUENTLY, FINANCING SPREADS

HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

INCOME TAXES ON CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS

BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGES WERE 19.9%, COMPARED WITH 28.3% IN 2001 AND 31.0% IN 2000. A

MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND THE

CONSOLIDATED RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS, IS

PROVIDED IN NOTE 7.

THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF GE DECREASED TO 20.2% IN 2002 FROM 22.9% IN 2001 AND 23.0% IN 2000.

DURING 2002, GE ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENTS WITH THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)

CONCERNING CERTAIN EXPORT TAX BENEFITS. THE RESULT OF THOSE SETTLEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THE

LINE TAX ON INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXPORTS IN NOTE 7, WAS A

DECREASE IN THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS. ALSO DURING

2002, GE ENTERED INTO A TAX ADVANTAGED TRANSACTION TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN ASSETS FOR THE

CABLE NETWORK BRAVO. THE EFFECT OF THIS TRANSACTION ON THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS

INCLUDED IN THE LINE ALL OTHERNET IN NOTE 7.

GECS

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED TO NEGATIVE 1.7% IN 2002 FROM 19.8% IN 2001 AND 26.9% IN

2000. THE 2002 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS EFFECTS OF PRE-TAX LOSSES AT GE GLOBAL

INSURANCE HOLDING (ERC) AND GE EQUITY, THE EFFECTS OF LOWER TAXED EARNINGS FROM

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND FAVORABLE TAX SETTLEMENTS WITH THE IRS DISCUSSED BELOW.

PRE-TAX LOSSES OF $2.9 BILLION AT ERC AND $0.6 BILLION AT GE EQUITY REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE OF GECS BY APPROXIMATELY 17 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

DURING

2002, AS A RESULT OF REVISED IRS REGULATIONS, GECS REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS

ALLOWING THE DEDUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY REALIZED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIOR DISPOSITION

OF KIDDER PEABODY. ALSO DURING 2002, A SETTLEMENT WAS REACHED WITH THE IRS REGARDING THE

TREATMENT OF CERTAIN RESERVES FOR OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS ON LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS

IN THE GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE BUSINESS. THE BENEFITS OF THESE SETTLEMENTS, WHICH REDUCED

THE GECS RATE APPROXIMATELY FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS (EXCLUDING THE ERC AND GE EQUITY

LOSSES), ARE INCLUDED IN THE LINE ALL OTHERNET IN NOTE 7.

THE

2001 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF GECS REFLECTED THE EFFECTS OF LOWER TAXED EARNINGS FROM

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTE 7). THAT RATE ALSO

INCLUDED EFFECTS OF A $0.6 BILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11,

2001, PRINCIPALLY AT ERC, WHICH REDUCED THE GECS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY ONE PERCENTAGE

POINT.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARDS (FASB) STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, GENERALLY BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR

US ON JANUARY 1, 2002. UNDER SFAS 142, GOODWILL IS NO LONGER AMORTIZED BUT IS TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY. WE STOPPED AMORTIZING GOODWILL EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2002.

THE

RESULT OF OUR APPLYING THE NEW RULES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, WAS A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $1.2

BILLION ($1.0 BILLION AFTER TAX, OR $0.10 PER SHARE), WHICH WE REPORTED IN THE CAPTION

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CHARGE

RELATES TO THE GECS IT SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND THE GECS GE AUTO AND HOME BUSINESS. FACTORS

CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WERE THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR AND HEIGHTENED PRICE COMPETITION IN THE AUTO INSURANCE

INDUSTRY. AFTER THE REQUIRED ACCOUNTING CHANGES, OUR 2002 EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

WERE $14.1 BILLION AND $1.41, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $13.7 BILLION AND $1.37,

RESPECTIVELY, IN 2001.

IN

2002, WE ADOPTED THE STOCK OPTION EXPENSE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

. THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE DID NOT RESULT IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT

CHARGE, BUT INCREASED 2002 COSTS BY $45 MILLION AND REDUCED NET EARNINGS BY $27 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 1 ON PAGE 81 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES IN 2001 RELATED TO THE ADOPTION, AS OF JANUARY 1,

2001, OF SFAS 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES

, AS

AMENDED, AND THE CONSENSUS OF THE FASBS EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ON ISSUE 99-20,

RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME AND IMPAIRMENT ON PURCHASED AND RETAINED BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS

. ADOPTION OF THESE STANDARDS RESULTED IN A

ONE-TIME, NON-CASH CHARGE THAT REDUCED OUR 2001 EARNINGS BY $444 MILLION ($0.04 PER

SHARE). AFTER THESE REQUIRED ACCOUNTING CHANGES, OUR 2001 EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

WERE $13.7 BILLION AND $1.37, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $12.7 BILLION AND $1.27,

RESPECTIVELY, IN 2000.

MAJOR PROVISIONS OF NEW ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS THAT WILL AFFECT US FOLLOW.

SFAS

143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE FAIR VALUE

OF OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL

OBLIGATION TO INCUR SUCH COSTS. THIS AMOUNT IS ACCOUNTED FOR LIKE AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT OF

COST, AND, LIKE OTHER COST ELEMENTS, IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE CORRESPONDING ASSETS

USEFUL LIFE. SFAS 143 PRIMARILY AFFECTS OUR ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

FUTURE RETIREMENT OF FACILITIES USED FOR STORAGE AND PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR FUEL. ON

JANUARY 1, 2003, WE RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THE EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE

RETIREMENT COSTS OF $363 MILLION, INCREASED NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT BY $24

MILLION AND RECOGNIZED A ONE-TIME, CUMULATIVE EFFECT CHARGE OF $215 MILLION (NET OF TAX).

THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE WILL NOT INVOLVE CASH AND WILL HAVE ONLY A MODEST EFFECT ON FUTURE

EARNINGS.

IN

NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 45,

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING

AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS

OF OTHERS

. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE INTERPRETATION REQUIRES GUARANTORS TO RECOGNIZE, AT

FAIR VALUE, THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO STAND READY TO PERFORM UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEES. FIN 45

IS EFFECTIVE FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003. IT WILL HAVE

AN INCONSEQUENTIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES

, WHICH

WE INTEND TO ADOPT ON JULY 1, 2003. FIN 46'S CONSOLIDATION CRITERIA ARE BASED ON

ANALYSIS OF RISKS AND REWARDS, NOT CONTROL, AND REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX

MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. FIN 46 REPRESENTS AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE,

NOT A CHANGE IN THE UNDERLYING ECONOMICS OF ASSET SALES. UNDER ITS PROVISIONS, CERTAIN

ASSETS PREVIOUSLY SOLD TO OUR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) COULD BE CONSOLIDATED ON OUR

BOOKS, AND, IF CONSOLIDATED, ANY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOW ON OUR BOOKS RELATED TO THOSE

SPES WOULD BE REMOVED. IN THE EVENT WE CONSOLIDATED THESE ASSETS, WE WOULD NOT REACQUIRE

THEIR LEGAL OWNERSHIP, NOR WOULD OUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS CHANGE. ANY CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS WOULD EARN RETURNS SUBSTANTIALLY LIKE THE RETURNS WE WOULD HAVE EARNED HAD WE NEVER

SOLD THEM. EVEN ASSUMING THE LEGAL PROVISIONS CONTROLLING THESE SPES ARE NOT CHANGED

BETWEEN NOW AND THE JULY 1 EFFECTIVE DATE OF FIN 46, THE VERY COMPLEXITY OF THE NEW

CONSOLIDATION RULES AND THEIR EVOLVING CLARIFICATION MAKE FORECASTING THAT JULY 1 EFFECT

IMPRACTICABLE. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT MANY ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES FOR SALES OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED AS SALES UNDER FIN 46 WITH THE ASSETS QUALIFYING FOR

SALE NOT CONSOLIDATED. WE ARE EVALUATING WHETHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE STRUCTURES CAN

COST-BENEFICIALLY BE APPLIED TO OUR ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE THE JULY 1 EFFECTIVE DATE. FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT ENTITIES THAT POTENTIALLY FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF FIN 46 IS PROVIDED IN

NOTE 29.

SEGMENT OPERATIONS

REVENUES AND SEGMENT PROFIT FOR

OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE SHOWN ON PAGE 57. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING A

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN EACH SEGMENT, SEE PAGES 108 AND 109.

SEGMENT

PROFIT IS DETERMINED BASED ON INTERNAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER TO ASSESS PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS. GENERALLY, THE RESULTS OF DECISIONS MADE

BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REGARDING UNUSUAL MATTERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM INTERNAL

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS. HISTORICALLY, SUCH MATTERS HAVE INCLUDED CHARGES FOR RESTRUCTURING;

RATIONALIZATION OR OTHER SIMILAR EXPENSES; AND LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS OR OTHER LOSSES,

RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHICH PRECEDES THE CURRENT BUSINESS MANAGEMENT TEAM. SEGMENT PROFIT

EXCLUDES ANY GOODWILL AMORTIZATION, THE EFFECTS OF PENSIONS AND OTHER RETIREE BENEFIT

PLANS AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES. SEGMENT PROFIT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES INTEREST AND OTHER

FINANCIAL CHARGES AND SEGMENT INCOME TAXES ACCORDING TO HOW SEGMENT MANAGEMENT IS

MEASUREDEXCLUDED IN DETERMINING OPERATING PROFIT FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINES, CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, MATERIALS, NBC, POWER SYSTEMS AND TECHNICAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, BUT INCLUDED IN DETERMINING NET EARNINGS FOR COMMERCIAL FINANCE,

CONSUMER FINANCE, EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT, INSURANCE AND ALL OTHER GECS.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES REPORTED A 2%

DECREASE IN REVENUES IN 2002 AS COMMERCIAL ENGINE PRICING PRESSURES AND REDUCED COMMERCIAL

PRODUCT SERVICES REVENUES COMBINED WITH LOWER INDUSTRIAL UNITS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET

BY INCREASED MILITARY SALES. OPERATING PROFIT WAS 4% LOWER, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER

PRICING FOR COMMERCIAL ENGINES, LOWER PRODUCT SERVICES VOLUME FROM REDUCED FLIGHT HOURS

AND HIGHER LABOR COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MATERIAL COSTS AND PRODUCTIVITY.

REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED 6% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2001, REFLECTING

HIGHER VOLUME IN PRODUCT SERVICES AND HIGHER VOLUME OF COMMERCIAL ENGINES AND

AERO-DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS. THE IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING PROFIT WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO

PRODUCTIVITY.

OPERATING PROFIT OF GE SEGMENTS

(IN BILLIONS)

IN

2002, REVENUES FROM SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WERE $2.2 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.9

BILLION IN 2001.

AIRCRAFT

ENGINES RECEIVED ORDERS OF $11.6 BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $12.1 BILLION IN 2001. THE

$11.6 BILLION TOTAL BACKLOG AT YEAR-END 2002 COMPRISED UNFILLED PRODUCT ORDERS OF $9.8

BILLION (OF WHICH 43% WAS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2003) AND PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS OF

$1.8 BILLION SCHEDULED FOR 2003 DELIVERY. COMPARABLE DECEMBER 31, 2001, TOTAL BACKLOG WAS

$11.2 BILLION.

COMMERCIAL FINANCE REVENUES INCREASED

16% IN BOTH 2002 AND 2001. THE 2002 INCREASE PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED ACQUISITIONS AND

INCREASED ORIGINATIONS ACROSS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED

MARKET INTEREST RATES AND LOWER SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AT CF AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT

FINANCING. THE 2001 INCREASE RESULTED FROM ACQUISITION AND VOLUME GROWTH AT COMMERCIAL

EQUIPMENT FINANCING, VENDOR FINANCIAL SERVICES, AVIATION SERVICES AND CF, INCLUDING THE

ACQUISITION OF HELLER FINANCIAL, INC. IN OCTOBER, VOLUME GROWTH AT STRUCTURED FINANCE

GROUP AND INCREASED SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY. NET EARNINGS INCREASED 17% IN 2002 AND 19% IN

2001. THE 2002 INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS RESULTED FROM ACQUISITIONS AND ORIGINATION GROWTH,

PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES AND GROWTH IN LOWER TAXED EARNINGS FROM INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES AND LOWER SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY

AT CF AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCING. THE 2001 INCREASE REFLECTED SECURITIZATION

GAINS, ASSET GROWTH FROM ACQUISITIONS AT COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCING, CF AND VENDOR

FINANCIAL SERVICES, ORIGINATION GROWTH AT STRUCTURED FINANCE GROUP, AND HIGHER ASSET GAINS

AND PRODUCTIVITY AT REAL ESTATE. OTHER COMMERCIAL FINANCE PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES 2002

8% FOLLOWING A 2% INCREASE IN 2001. REVENUES INCREASED IN 2002 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF

ACQUISITIONS AND INCREASED INTERNATIONAL ORIGINATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AT CARD SERVICES. THE REVENUE PERFORMANCE IN 2001 REFLECTED THE

POST-ACQUISITION REVENUES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND VOLUME GROWTH. NET EARNINGS

INCREASED 13% FOLLOWING A 24% INCREASE IN 2001, AS A RESULT OF ORIGINATION GROWTH,

ACQUISITIONS, GROWTH IN LOWER TAXED EARNINGS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTIVITY BENEFITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AT CARD SERVICES.

THE 2001 INCREASE REFLECTED PRODUCTIVITY AT GLOBAL CONSUMER FINANCE AND VOLUME GROWTH AT

CHARGES OF $306 MILLION IN 2001 WERE NOT ALLOCATED TO THIS SEGMENT BECAUSE WE

DID NOT INCLUDE THESE COSTS IN MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF BUSINESSES IN THIS

SEGMENT FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES. SUCH CHARGES, INCLUDED IN ALL OTHER GECS, RELATED

TO UNPROFITABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND LINES THAT HAVE BEEN EXITED AND TO

PROVISIONS FOR DISPOSITION OF NONSTRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

INSURANCE REVENUES DECREASED 2% IN

2002, BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING PLANNED RUN-OFF OF ACQUIRED POLICIES AT TOHO AND LOWER

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS. SEGMENT REVENUES DECLINED 4% IN 2001 ON REDUCED NET PREMIUMS

EARNED AT ERC, REFLECTING THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, DECREASED INVESTMENT INCOME,

AND THE PLANNED RUN-OFF OF RESTRUCTURED INSURANCE POLICIES AT TOHO. THESE FACTORS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PREMIUM INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH ORIGINATION VOLUME AT ERC AND

BY POST-ACQUISITION REVENUES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND VOLUME GROWTH AT GE FINANCIAL

ASSURANCE.

NET

PRE-TAX REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN THE EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS AMOUNTED TO

$413 MILLION, $972 MILLION AND $818 MILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

NET

EARNINGS DECREASED $1.8 BILLION IN 2002, FOLLOWING A $0.3 BILLION DECREASE IN 2001. THE

2002 DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RECOGNITION OF ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT RELATED

TO PRIOR-YEAR LOSS EVENTS AT ERC, DISCUSSED BELOW. WITH RETROCESSION COVERAGES PREVIOUSLY

PURCHASED BY ERC, THE RECORDING OF THIS ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT BOTH INCREASED POLICYHOLDER

LOSSES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, DECREASED PREMIUM REVENUES (PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER

LEVELS OF CONTINGENT CEDED PREMIUMS FOLLOWING THESE RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS). ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE REDUCTION IN 2002 NET EARNINGS WERE LOWER INVESTMENT GAINS ACROSS ALL

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING A $110 MILLION AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT ON WORLDCOM, INC. BONDS AT GE

FINANCIAL ASSURANCE. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CORE PREMIUM GROWTH,

INCLUDING HIGHER PREMIUM PRICING AT ERC AND THE $152 MILLION BENEFIT FROM RECOGNITION OF A

FAVORABLE TAX SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS RELATED TO THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN RESERVES FOR

OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS ON LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS AT GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE.

THE

LEVEL OF REPORTED CLAIMS ACTIVITY AT ERC RELATED TO PRIOR-YEAR LOSS EVENTS, PARTICULARLY

FOR LIABILITY-RELATED EXPOSURES UNDERWRITTEN IN 1997 THROUGH 2001, ACCELERATED AT A RATE

HIGHER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. IN 2002, CONSIDERING THE CONTINUED ACCELERATION IN

REPORTED CLAIMS ACTIVITY, WE CONCLUDED THAT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE LOSSES WAS

HIGHER IN THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS SCENARIOS THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED.

ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZED A FOURTH QUARTER PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $2.5 BILLION TO INCREASE

RECORDED RESERVES TO REFLECT THE REVISED INDICATIONS OF REMAINING LIABILITY. THE MORE

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT WAS IN HOSPITAL MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ($300 MILLION),

PRODUCT LIABILITY ($300 MILLION), PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY ($250 MILLION), UMBRELLA

LIABILITY ($200 MILLION), WORKERS COMPENSATION ($200 MILLION), INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY ($150

MILLION) AND ASBESTOS ($150 MILLION). WITH AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN PREVIOUS QUARTERS OF

2002, OUR OVERALL 2002 PRE-TAX CHARGE FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT AMOUNTED TO $3.5 BILLION.

INSURANCE LOSS PROVISIONS ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES AT A GIVEN TIME. AS

DESCRIBED ON PAGE 70 UNDER THE CAPTION INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND RESERVES,

THESE ESTIMATES WILL BE ADJUSTED IN THE FUTURE AS REQUIRED.

WE

HAVE CONTINUED OUR RIGOROUS COMMITMENT TO IMPROVED UNDERWRITING INITIATIVES AT ERC AIMED

AT ENSURING THAT CONSISTENT AND DILIGENT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS ARE APPLIED TO ALL RISKS.

THROUGHOUT 2002, WE HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED IN REJECTING RISKS THAT EITHER FAIL TO MEET THE

ESTABLISHED STANDARDS OF PRICE OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OR THAT INVOLVE AREAS FOR WHICH

SUFFICIENT HISTORICAL DATA DO NOT EXIST TO EVALUATE THE RISK ADEQUATELY. FOR RISKS THAT

PASS OUR CRITERIA, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO RETAIN OR EVEN JUDICIOUSLY EXPAND OUR BUSINESS. ON

THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE CURTAILED OR EXITED BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

BUSINESS CHANNELS WHEN EXPECTED RETURNS DO NOT APPEAR TO JUSTIFY THE RISKS.

NET

EARNINGS DECREASED $0.3 BILLION IN 2001, REFLECTING UNDERWRITING RESULTS AT ERC, WHICH

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRODUCTIVITY BENEFITS AT GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE. NET EARNINGS IN

2001 AT ERC WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY APPROXIMATELY $575 MILLION ($386 MILLION AFTER TAX)

RELATED TO THE INSURANCE LOSSES ARISING FROM THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. THIS AMOUNT

PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM CONTINGENT PREMIUM PAYMENT PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN CERTAIN

RETROCESSION AGREEMENTS. AFTER THESE PARTICULAR LOSSES, TOTAL LOSSES EXCEEDED RETROCESSION

POLICY LIMITS IN PLACE AT ERC. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, LOSSES ARE

RECOVERABLE UNDER REINSURANCE POLICIES THAT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS TO THOSE

RETROCESSIONAIRES. THEREFORE, THE 2001 STATEMENT OF EARNINGS REFLECTS A $698 MILLION

REDUCTION IN NET

<PAGE>

F-12

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 54

PREMIUMS EARNED AND $78 MILLION OF INCREASED LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$201 MILLION IN LOWER INSURANCE ACQUISITION COSTS. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE RELATED TO LARGE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS HAS SHOWN THAT A BROAD RANGE OF TOTAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOSS

ESTIMATES OFTEN EXISTS FOLLOWING SUCH AN EVENT, AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THERE TO BE

SIGNIFICANT SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS TO SUCH ESTIMATES. OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EXISTING

LIABILITY, NET OF ESTIMATED RECOVERIES UNDER RETROCESSION ARRANGEMENTS, HAS NOT CHANGED

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR INITIAL ESTIMATE.

EXCLUDING

EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, NET EARNINGS IN 2001 AND 2000 WERE ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY THE CONTINUED GENERAL DETERIORATION OF UNDERWRITING RESULTS AT ERC, REFLECTING HIGHER

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY-RELATED LOSSES (PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT

RELATING TO PRIOR-YEAR LOSS EVENTS) AND THE CONTINUED EFFECTS OF LOW PREMIUMS IN THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE/REINSURANCE INDUSTRY. ERC UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN 2001

TRACKED PERFORMANCE IN THE GLOBAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INDUSTRY.

THE

MAJORITY OF THE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT AT ERC IN 2001, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN 2000,

RELATED TO HIGHER PROJECTED ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR LIABILITY COVERAGES, ESPECIALLY IN THE

HOSPITAL LIABILITY, NONSTANDARD AUTOMOBILE (AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE EXTENDED TO HIGHER-RISK

DRIVERS) AND COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC ENTITY GENERAL LIABILITY LINES OF BUSINESS. RESULTS IN

2000 ALSO REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE LOSS ESTIMATES RELATED TO CERTAIN LARGE

PROPERTY LOSS EVENTS, WITH THE LARGEST EFFECT RESULTING FROM THE EUROPEAN WINDSTORMS

OCCURRING IN LATE 1999.

OUR

MORTGAGE INSURANCE BUSINESS HAD FAVORABLE LOSS EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE THREE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002, REFLECTING CONTINUED STRENGTH IN CERTAIN REAL ESTATE MARKETS AND THE

SUCCESS OF OUR LOSS CONTAINMENT INITIATIVES.

PLASTICS DECLINED 28% AS PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREASED VOLUME WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET

SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER SELLING PRICES AND INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS. SPECIALTY MATERIALS

REVENUES INCREASED 32%, REFLECTING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER SELLING PRICES. OPERATING PROFIT AT SPECIALTY MATERIALS ROSE 6%,

REFLECTING HIGHER ACQUISITION VOLUME AND LOWER MATERIAL COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

PRICING AND HIGHER BASE COSTS. IN 2001, MATERIALS REVENUES WERE 12% LOWER THAN THE PRIOR

YEAR, REFLECTING INCREASED PRICING PRESSURES AND LOWER VOLUME AT BOTH PLASTICS AND

SPECIALTY MATERIALS. PLASTICS EXPERIENCED CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE, OPTICAL

MEDIA, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND BUSINESS EQUIPMENT MARKETS, WHILE SPECIALTY MATERIALS WAS

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOWER SALES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET. OPERATING PROFIT IN 2001

WAS 23% LOWER THAN IN 2000, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER PRICING AND VOLUME, WHICH MORE

THAN OFFSET BASE COST REDUCTIONS AT BOTH PLASTICS AND SPECIALTY MATERIALS.

NBC REPORTED RECORD REVENUES OF $7.1

BILLION IN 2002, A 24% INCREASE COMPARED WITH 2001, AND OPERATING PROFIT OF $1.7 BILLION,

IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET, OUR BROADCAST OF THE 2002 WINTER OLYMPICS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

FROM THE TELEMUNDO ACQUISITION. NBCS 2002 RESULTS ALSO INCLUDED $0.2 BILLION OF THE

$0.6 BILLION TOTAL GAIN FROM THE EXCHANGE OF CERTAIN ASSETS FOR THE CABLE NETWORK BRAVO

AND $0.2 BILLION OF OTHER CHARGES FOR VARIOUS ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. REVENUES DECLINED 15% IN

2001, MOSTLY FROM AN INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINE IN ADVERTISING VOLUME AND PRICING, AS WELL AS

LOST REVENUE RELATED TO COVERING THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. OPERATING PROFIT

DECREASED 12% IN 2001, REFLECTING ADVERSE ADVERTISING MARKET CONDITIONS, THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND CHARGES RESULTING FROM DISSOLVING THE XFL, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET

SAVINGS FROM COST REDUCTION ACTIONS.

POWER SYSTEMS REVENUES INCREASED 13%

TO $22.9 BILLION IN 2002, FOLLOWING AN INCREASE OF 36% IN 2001. OPERATING PROFIT ROSE 29%

TO $6.3 BILLION IN 2002, FOLLOWING A 93% INCREASE IN 2001. OPERATING PROFIT IMPROVEMENTS

AT POWER SYSTEMS REFLECT THE $0.9 BILLION POSITIVE EFFECT OF CUSTOMER CONTRACT TERMINATION

FEES, NET OF ASSOCIATED COSTS. RESULTS IN 2002 ALSO INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER

CHARGES OF $0.2 BILLION AS POWER SYSTEMS ADJUSTED ITS COST STRUCTURE.

THESE

RESULTS REFLECTED THE CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE POWER GENERATION BUSINESS AS DEMAND FOR

NEW POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT DECLINED IN 2002 AND ORDERS WERE DELAYED OR CANCELLED. WHEN

ORDERS ARE CANCELLED, CONTRACTUAL TERMS REQUIRE CUSTOMERS TO PAY TERMINATION FEES. IN ALL

CASES, WE EXPECT SUCH FEES TO COVER OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CONTRACTS. AT LEAST A PORTION OF

THIS INVESTMENT HAS GENERALLY BEEN RECEIVED AS PROGRESS COLLECTIONS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO

RECOVER AT LEAST PART OF LOST PROFITS.

TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

REVENUES INCREASED 3% IN 2002, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF 6% REVENUE GROWTH AT MEDICAL

SYSTEMS, WHICH REPORTED HIGHER EQUIPMENT AND PRODUCT SERVICES VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

WEAK MARKET CONDITIONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND JAPAN. OPERATING PROFIT FOR THE SEGMENT

DECLINED 4% WITH SHARPLY LOWER EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL EXCHANGE SERVICES, 90% OF WHICH WAS

SOLD IN SEPTEMBER 2002. PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREASED VOLUME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

PRICING AT MEDICAL SYSTEMS. TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REVENUES ROSE 14% IN 2001,

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SHARPLY HIGHER VOLUME AT MEDICAL SYSTEMS. OPERATING PROFIT GREW

13% IN 2001, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND VOLUME GROWTH.

ORDERS

RECEIVED BY MEDICAL SYSTEMS IN 2002 WERE $9.6 BILLION, AN 8% INCREASE OVER 2001. THE $4.0

ALL

OTHER GECS INCLUDES GECS ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESSES THAT WE DO NOT MEASURE WITHIN ONE OF

THE OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO COMMENTS ON ALL OTHER GECS ELSEWHERE

IN THIS REPORT, THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS RELATE TO THE TABLE ABOVE.

IT SOLUTIONS (ITS)REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS IN 2002 DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT

OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND 2001 PRODUCT LINE AND GEOGRAPHIC MARKET EXITS. DURING 2001 AND

2000, IN RESPONSE TO INTENSE COMPETITION AND TRANSITION OF THE COMPUTER EQUIPMENT MARKET

TO A DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MODEL, ITS EXITED ITS UNDERPERFORMING OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, FRANCE, BRAZIL AND MEXICO AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ITS RESELLER ROLE IN THE

UNITED STATES. COSTS FOR INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION BENEFITS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, FACILITIES

EXIT COSTS AND LOSSES ON SALES OF PORTIONS OF THE BUSINESS AMOUNTED TO $45 MILLION ($43

MILLION AFTER TAX) AND $246 MILLION ($191 MILLION AFTER TAX) IN 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN RESTRUCTURING IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES WAS REDUCED FROM A 2000 PEAK OF 11,000 TO 6,600 AT THE END OF 2002.

GE EQUITYGE EQUITY

MANAGES EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE, EARLY GROWTH, PRE-IPO COMPANIES. GE EQUITY

REVENUES INCLUDE INCOME, GAINS AND LOSSES ON SUCH INVESTMENTS. REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS

DURING 2002 REFLECTED INCREASED LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING LOSSES IN THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFTWARE INDUSTRIES, AND LOWER GAINS. EFFECTIVE IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2002, GE EQUITY WILL NO LONGER MAKE NEW INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES. GE

EQUITY WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO COMPANIES WITHIN ITS EXISTING PORTFOLIO.

THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO WILL BE MANAGED FOR MAXIMUM VALUE OVER TIME, EVENTUALLY WINDING

DOWN. DURING 2001, LOSSES ON GE EQUITYS INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED GAINS AND OTHER

INVESTMENT INCOME, RESULTING IN NEGATIVE REVENUES AND A $270 MILLION NET LOSS, WHICH

INCREASED OVER THE PRIOR YEAR PRINCIPALLY FROM REDUCED ASSET GAINS.

AMERICOMON NOVEMBER 9,

2001, GECS EXCHANGED ITS SATELLITE OPERATIONS, COMPRISING THE STOCK OF AMERICOM AND OTHER

RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, FOR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND 31% OF THE PUBLICLY-TRADED

STOCK OF SES GLOBAL, A LEADING SATELLITE COMPANY, IN ORDER TO CREATE THE WORLDS

LARGEST SATELLITE SERVICES PROVIDER. THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A GAIN OF $1,158 MILLION

($642 MILLION AFTER TAX), REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

69% INVESTMENT IN AMERICOM AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH PLUS THE MARKET VALUE OF SES GLOBAL

SHARES RECEIVED AT THE CLOSING DATE. NO GAIN WAS RECORDED ON THE 31% INTEREST IN AMERICOM

THAT WAS INDIRECTLY RETAINED BY GECS. GECS INVESTMENT IN SES GLOBAL IS ACCOUNTED FOR ON

THE EQUITY METHOD IN COMMERCIAL FINANCE.

2001 ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND PRODUCT LINE EXITSOPERATIONS INCLUDED $656 MILLION OF

AFTER-TAX CHARGES RELATED TO DISPOSING OF AND PROVIDING FOR DISPOSITION OF SEVERAL

NONSTRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS, TO CERTAIN UNPROFITABLE INSURANCE AND FINANCING

PRODUCT LINES THAT WERE EXITED, AND TO RESTRUCTURING VARIOUS GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THESE

COSTS, NOT ALLOCATED TO THE RELATED BUSINESSES AS WE DID NOT INCLUDE THESE COSTS IN

MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE BUSINESSES FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES, INCLUDED $478 MILLION

($310 MILLION AFTER TAX) FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS, THE LARGEST

OF WHICH WERE HELD BY GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE, GE EQUITY AND ERC. THESE LOSSES, $383

MILLION OF WHICH WERE CHARGED TO REVENUES, INCLUDED $130 MILLION ($84 MILLION AFTER TAX)

OF LOSSES ON ENRON BONDS; SUCH BONDS WERE WRITTEN DOWN TO A COST BASIS OF $32 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2001. SUCH LOSSES ALSO INCLUDED INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $199 MILLION

($130 MILLION AFTER TAX) ON NON-U.S. MUTUAL FUNDS AND THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.

IN

RESPONSE TO ESCALATING LOSSES, GECS IN 2001 DECIDED TO CEASE FURTHER UNDERWRITING AND EXIT

CERTAIN INSURANCE AND FINANCING PRODUCT LINES. CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LOSS EVENTS

AND THE RESULTING EXITS TOTALED $180 MILLION AFTER TAX, OF WHICH $149 MILLION RELATED TO

THE LOSS EVENTS IN ERC PRODUCT LINES, PRIMARILY NONSTANDARD AUTOMOBILE AND HIGHER LIMIT

INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERAGES.

RESTRUCTURING

OF SEVERAL GECS GLOBAL BUSINESSES INCLUDED CONSOLIDATION OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN EQUIPMENT

MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES AND RATIONALIZATION OF EUROPEAN EQUIPMENT FINANCE BUSINESSES. COSTS

RELATED TO THE EXIT OF THESE ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $144 MILLION AFTER TAX AND CONSISTED

OF INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION BENEFITS, FACILITIES EXIT COSTS, AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

OTHERALL OTHER GECS INCLUDES GECS CORPORATE FUNCTION EXPENSES, LIQUIDATING

BUSINESSES AND OTHER NON-SEGMENT ALIGNED OPERATIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH WERE

AUTO FINANCIAL SERVICES (AFS) AND GE AUTO AND HOME. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES IN 2002 AND

2001 RESULTED FROM AFS, WHICH STOPPED ACCEPTING NEW BUSINESS IN 2000. NET EARNINGS

INCREASED IN 2002 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A FAVORABLE TAX SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS ALLOWING

THE DEDUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY REALIZED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIOR DISPOSITION OF

KIDDER PEABODY AND TAX BENEFITS FROM GROWTH IN LOWER TAXED EARNINGS FROM INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

JANUARY 1, 2003, RECLASSIFICATION OF

FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT PROFIT. GE CAPITAL HISTORICALLY HAS ISSUED ABOUT $8 OF DEBT FOR

EACH $1 OF EQUITYA LEVERAGE RATIO OF 8:1. FOR PURPOSES OF MEASURING

SEGMENT PROFIT, EACH OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES WAS ALSO ASSIGNED DEBT AND

INTEREST COSTS ON THE BASIS OF THAT CONSOLIDATED 8:1 LEVERAGE RATIO. IN EVALUATING

EXPECTED RETURNS ON POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS, HOWEVER, WE ALSO USED BUSINESS-SPECIFIC,

MARKET-BASED LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003, WE EXTENDED THE BUSINESS-SPECIFIC,

MARKET-BASED LEVERAGE TO THE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT OF EACH OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES

BUSINESSES, AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE DEFINITION OF SEGMENT PROFIT. AS A RESULT, AT JANUARY

1, 2003, DEBT OF $12.5 BILLION PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS WAS ALLOCATED TO THE

ALL OTHER GECS SEGMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, WE REVISED OUR HISTORICAL TECHNIQUES FOR

ALLOCATING SHARED COSTS AND UNUSUAL ITEMS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. IN THIS

WHICH WAS 11% LOWER THAN IN 2000. OPERATING PROFIT ROSE 24% TO $1.2 BILLION IN THE

AMERICAS AND 28% TO $0.9 BILLION IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL AND WAS RELATIVELY

UNCHANGED IN EUROPE ($2.1 BILLION) AND THE PACIFIC BASIN ($2.3 BILLION).

TOTAL

ASSETS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WERE $229.0 BILLION IN 2002 (40% OF CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS), AN INCREASE OF $49.0 BILLION, OR 27%, OVER 2001. GECS INTERNATIONAL ASSETS GREW

28% FROM $161.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2001 TO $207.5 BILLION AT THE END OF 2002. GECS ASSETS

INCREASED 41% AND 26% IN THE PACIFIC BASIN AND EUROPE, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING FROM

ACQUISITIONS AND ORIGINATION GROWTH.

OUR

INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES SPAN ALL GLOBAL REGIONS AND PRIMARILY ENCOMPASS MANUFACTURING FOR

LOCAL AND EXPORT MARKETS, IMPORT AND SALE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN OTHER REGIONS, LEASING

OF AIRCRAFT, SOURCING FOR OUR PLANTS DOMICILED IN OTHER GLOBAL REGIONS AND PROVISION OF

FINANCIAL SERVICES WITHIN THESE REGIONAL ECONOMIES. THUS, WHEN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS

EXPERIENCE CURRENCY AND/OR ECONOMIC STRESS, WE MAY HAVE INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN

RISKS, BUT ALSO MAY HAVE NEW PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES. POTENTIAL INCREASED RISKS INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER RECEIVABLES DELINQUENCIES AND BAD DEBTS, DELAYS OR CANCELLATION

OF SALES AND ORDERS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO POWER AND AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT, HIGHER LOCAL

CURRENCY FINANCING COSTS AND A SLOWDOWN IN ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES. NEW

PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWER COSTS OF GOODS SOURCED FROM

COUNTRIES WITH WEAKENED CURRENCIES, MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER COST OUTSOURCING,

EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES THROUGH PURCHASES OF COMPANIES

OR ASSETS AT REDUCED PRICES AND LOWER U.S. DEBT FINANCING COSTS.

2002 TOTAL ASSETS OF

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

FINANCIAL

RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS ARE AFFECTED BY CURRENCY

EXCHANGE. WE USE A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES TO MANAGE THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE,

INCLUDING SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND SELECTIVE HEDGING OF SIGNIFICANT

CROSS-CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES ARE THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE

CANADIAN DOLLAR.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

OUR OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF

OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES, INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF

SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS.

IN

2002, WE EXPENDED ABOUT $43 MILLION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE

COMPARABLE AMOUNT IN 2001 WAS $52 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE EXPENDITURES FOR

REMEDIATION ACTIONS, WHICH ARE PRINCIPALLY EXPENSED AND ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICESSUCH

AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS, GROUNDWATER MONITORING DEVICES, AIR STRIPPERS OR

SEPARATORS, AND INCINERATORSAT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY, AVERAGE ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS

ARE PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $65 MILLION OVER EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW OR

EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE

AND REDUCE EMISSIONS. THIS IS ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL AS RECENT EXPERIENCE.

WE

ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES

AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND

REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A

DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $113

MILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $119 MILLION IN 2001. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH

REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF $120 MILLION

TO $170 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) RULED IN FEBRUARY 2002 THAT APPROXIMATELY

150,000 POUNDS OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS) MUST BE DREDGED FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH

OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE. WE HAVE SUBMITTED WHAT IS KNOWN AS A

GOOD FAITH OFFER UNDER THE SUPERFUND LAW AND HAVE BEGUN NEGOTIATIONS WITH EPA

TO UNDERTAKE THE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING OF THE REMEDY. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, INCLUDES A LIABILITY FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF THIS

REMEDIATION.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

OVERVIEW

THIS DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL

RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ADDRESSES THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION (PAGES 74-75),

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHARE OWNERS EQUITY (PAGE 72) AND THE STATEMENT OF CASH

FLOWS (PAGES 76-77).

ONLY

A SMALL PORTION OF GECS BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OTHER GE OPERATIONS. THE

FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GE AND GECS ARE REFLECTED IN THE MEASUREMENTS COMMONLY

USED BY INVESTORS, RATING AGENCIES AND FINANCIAL ANALYSTS. THESE DIFFERENCES WILL BECOME

CLEARER IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS WITH RESPECT TO THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION

(PAGES 74-75)

BECAUSE GE AND GECS SHARE CERTAIN

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF THEIR STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITIONPROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, AND BORROWINGS, FOR EXAMPLETHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES SIGNIFICANT

CAPTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT. WITHIN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS,

HOWEVER, WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GE AND GECS ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO PERMIT MEANINGFUL

ANALYSIS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL STATEMENT.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR EACH OF THE

PAST TWO YEARS COMPRISED MAINLY INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY INSURANCE IN

SUPPORT OF OBLIGATIONS TO ANNUITANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS. INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE $116.9

BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $101.0 BILLION IN 2001. THE INCREASE OF $15.9 BILLION

RESULTED FROM INVESTMENT OF PREMIUMS RECEIVED, REINVESTMENT OF INVESTMENT INCOME, THE

ADDITION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND INCREASES IN FAIR VALUE,

PRIMARILY DEBT SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES AND MATURITIES AS WELL AS IMPAIRMENTS

AND LOSSES RELATED TO CERTAIN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

GROSS

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES WERE $4.4 BILLION AND $2.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER

31, 2002 (GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES OF $2.2 BILLION AND $2.7 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001). MARKET VALUE FOR THESE PURPOSES IS DEFINED BY

RELEVANT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A FORECAST OF FUTURE GAINS OR

LOSSES. WE ESTIMATE THAT AVAILABLE GAINS, NET OF HEDGING POSITIONS AND ESTIMATED

IMPAIRMENT OF INSURANCE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, COULD BE AS MUCH AS $1.4 BILLION.

WE

REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CRITERIA THAT INCLUDE THE

EXTENT TO WHICH COST EXCEEDS MARKET VALUE, THE DURATION OF THAT MARKET DECLINE AND THE

FINANCIAL HEALTH AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER. OF SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED

LOSSES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION OF PORTFOLIO VALUE IS AT RISK OF

BEING CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN 2003. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED FOR 2002 WERE $759

MILLION, INCLUDING $348 MILLION FROM THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CABLE INDUSTRIES, OF WHICH

$167 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002 FOLLOWING THE EVENTS RELATING TO

WORLDCOM, INC.

WORKING CAPITAL, REPRESENTING GE CASH INVESTED IN INVENTORIES AND RECEIVABLES

FROM CUSTOMERS LESS TRADE PAYABLES AND PROGRESS COLLECTIONS, INCREASED TO $3.8

BILLION AT THE END OF 2002. WORKING CAPITAL DECLINED FROM AN INVESTMENT OF $3.9

BILLION AT THE BEGINNING OF 2000 TO A NEGATIVE $2.4 BILLION AT THE END OF 2001

ON MUCH HIGHER PROGRESS COLLECTIONS FROM POWER SYSTEMS CUSTOMERS. WORKING

CAPITAL BALANCES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PROGRESS COLLECTIONS, PRIMARILY

FROM POWER SYSTEMS CUSTOMERS, AS SHOWN BELOW.

DECEMBER 31 (IN MILLIONS)                                  2002             2001

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING

PROGRESS COLLECTIONS                                 $10,424          $ 9,240

================================================================================

WE EXPECT POWER SYSTEMS PROGRESS

COLLECTIONS TO DECLINE ABOUT $3 BILLION IN 2003, AND THAT WORKING CAPITAL TURNOVER

OTHERWISE WILL SHOW IMPROVEMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR SIX SIGMA AND DIGITIZATION INITIATIVES.

WE DISCUSS CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, TWO IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL,

IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

CURRENT RECEIVABLES FOR GE WERE $11.0

BILLION AT THE END OF 2002, AN INCREASE OF $1.2 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2001, AND INCLUDED

$6.3 BILLION DUE FROM CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF 2002, COMPARED WITH $5.9 BILLION AT THE END

OF 2001. TURNOVER OF CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES FROM SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES WAS 10.9 IN

2002, COMPARED WITH 10.1 IN 2001. OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES ARE PRIMARILY AMOUNTS THAT DID

NOT ORIGINATE FROM SALES OF GE GOODS OR SERVICES, SUCH AS ADVANCES TO SUPPLIERS IN

CONNECTION WITH LARGE CONTRACTS.

INVENTORIES FOR GE WERE $9.0 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, UP $0.7 BILLION FROM THE END OF 2001. GE INVENTORY TURNOVER WAS 7.7

IN 2002, A DECREASE FROM 7.9 IN 2001, AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INVENTORIES AT POWER SYSTEMS,

PLASTICS AND MEDICAL SYSTEMS.

GECS

INVENTORIES WERE $208 MILLION AND $270 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN 2002 PRIMARILY REFLECTED REDUCED SALES VOLUME AND IMPROVED

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AT IT SOLUTIONS.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS THE LARGEST

CATEGORY OF ASSETS FOR GECS AND REPRESENTS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY SOURCES OF REVENUES. THE

PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, INCREASED TO $205.4

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, FROM $178.9 BILLION AT THE END OF 2001, AS DISCUSSED IN THE

FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS. THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AT THE END OF 2002 AMOUNTED TO $5.5

BILLION ($4.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2001), REPRESENTING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO.

<PAGE>

F-19

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 61

A

DISCUSSION OF THE QUALITY OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO

FOLLOWS. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE DELINQUENT

(OR FOR WHICH COLLECTION HAS OTHERWISE BECOME DOUBTFUL) AND REDUCED-EARNING

RECEIVABLES ARE COMMERCIAL RECEIVABLES WHOSE TERMS HAVE BEEN RESTRUCTURED TO A

BELOW-MARKET YIELD.

COMMERCIAL

FINANCE FINANCING RECEIVABLES BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES TOTALED $130.9 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, ($120.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001) AND CONSISTED OF LOANS AND LEASES

TO THE EQUIPMENT, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL, REAL ESTATE AND COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

INDUSTRIES. THIS PORTFOLIO OF RECEIVABLES INCREASED PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED ACQUISITIONS

AND ORIGINATIONS GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS. RELATED NONEARNING

AND REDUCED-EARNING RECEIVABLES WERE $2.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, ABOUT 1.7% OF

OUTSTANDINGS, COMPARED WITH $2.0 BILLION, ABOUT 1.7% OF OUTSTANDINGS AT YEAR-END 2001.

COMMERCIAL FINANCE RECEIVABLES ARE GENERALLY BACKED BY ASSETS AND THERE IS A BROAD SPREAD

OF GEOGRAPHIC AND CREDIT RISK IN THE PORTFOLIO.

CONSUMER

FINANCE FINANCING RECEIVABLES BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, PRIMARILY INSTALLMENT LOANS,

AUTO LOANS AND LEASES, AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, WERE $66.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002,

AN INCREASE OF $16.0 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2001. THIS PORTFOLIO OF RECEIVABLES INCREASED

PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED ORIGINATIONS, ACQUISITION GROWTH AND THE NET EFFECTS OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS. NONEARNING CONSUMER

RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WERE $1.6 BILLION, ABOUT 2.4% OF OUTSTANDINGS, COMPARED

WITH $1.3 BILLION, ABOUT 2.7% OF OUTSTANDINGS AT YEAR-END 2001.

OTHER,

PRINCIPALLY EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT FINANCING RECEIVABLES BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES

AMOUNTED TO $8.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, A DECREASE OF $0.3 BILLION FROM YEAR-END

2001, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE RUN-OFF OF THE LIQUIDATING AUTO FINANCIAL SERVICES

PORTFOLIO. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WERE $0.1 BILLION, ABOUT 1.0% OF

OUTSTANDINGS, COMPARED WITH $0.2 BILLION, ABOUT 1.8% OF OUTSTANDINGS AT YEAR-END 2001.

DELINQUENCY

RATES ON CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WERE 5.34%; AT YEAR-END 2001

WERE 5.21%; AND AT YEAR-END 2000 WERE 4.53% ON A MANAGED BASIS. INCREASED 2002 AND 2001

DELINQUENCIES REFLECTED OUR SECURED FINANCING BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN 2001 AND VOLUME GROWTH

IN THAT BUSINESS IN 2002. WHEN DELINQUENT, THESE LOANS HAVE RELATIVELY LOWER LOSSES THAN

THE REST OF OUR CONSUMER PORTFOLIO. DELINQUENCIES ON COMMERCIAL FINANCE EQUIPMENT LOANS

AND LEASES WERE 1.72%, 2.16% AND 1.68% AT YEAR-END 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, ON A

MANAGED BASIS. THE DECLINE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTED A HIGHER

CONCENTRATION OF VENDOR FINANCIAL SERVICES RECEIVABLES COUPLED WITH IMPROVED COLLECTION

RESULTS AT COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCE. THE INCREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, REFLECTED THE

ACQUISITION OF HELLER FINANCIAL, INC. FUTURE PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY

ON THE SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW, AND ON ASSOCIATED

BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF GECS WERE

$31.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002, AN INCREASE OF $3.3 BILLION THAT WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS AND CORE GROWTH AT GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE, INCREASED

RECOVERIES UNDER EXISTING RETROCESSION AGREEMENTS AT ERC AND AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGES HELD

FOR INVESTMENT AT MORTGAGE INSURANCE.

OTHER RECEIVABLES OF GECS TOTALED

$13.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND $13.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, AND CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF NONFINANCING CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES, ACCRUED INVESTMENT INCOME, AMOUNTS DUE

FROM GE (GENERALLY RELATED TO CERTAIN TRADE PAYABLE PROGRAMS), AMOUNTS DUE UNDER OPERATING

LEASES, RECEIVABLES DUE ON SALES OF SECURITIES AND VARIOUS SUNDRY ITEMS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

(INCLUDING EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS) WAS $47.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, UP $5.1

BILLION FROM 2001, PRIMARILY REFLECTING ACQUISITIONS OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AT COMMERCIAL

FINANCE. GE PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTS OF INVESTMENTS FOR ITS OWN PRODUCTIVE

USE, WHEREAS THE LARGEST ELEMENT FOR GECS IS EQUIPMENT PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES ON

OPERATING LEASES. DETAILS BY CATEGORY OF INVESTMENT ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 15.

GE

EXPENDITURES FOR PLANT AND EQUIPMENT DURING 2002 TOTALED $2.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.9

BILLION IN 2001. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS WERE $12.4 BILLION, OF WHICH

38% WAS INVESTMENT FOR GROWTH THROUGH NEW CAPACITY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; 35% WAS

INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH NEW EQUIPMENT AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS; AND 27% WAS

INVESTMENT FOR OTHER PURPOSES SUCH AS IMPROVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES

AND SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

GECS

ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS) WERE

$11.0 BILLION AND $12.6 BILLION DURING 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

ACQUISITIONS OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AT COMMERCIAL FINANCE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE $46.2 BILLION

AT YEAR-END 2002, UP FROM $35.1 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2001. GE INTANGIBLES INCREASED TO

$23.1 BILLION FROM $14.4 BILLION AT THE END OF 2001, PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF GOODWILL

AND OTHER INTANGIBLES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS BY NBC, SPECIALTY MATERIALS AND INDUSTRIAL

SYSTEMS. GECS INTANGIBLES INCREASED $2.4 BILLION TO $23.1 BILLION, REFLECTING GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS AND PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE 2001 ACQUISITION OF HELLER FINANCIAL, INC., PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL FROM ADOPTING SFAS 142 (SEE NOTES 1 AND 16).

<PAGE>

F-20

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 62

ALL OTHER ASSETS TOTALED $93.2

BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002, AN INCREASE OF $16.6 BILLION FROM THE END OF 2001. GE OTHER

ASSETS INCREASED $5.0 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING INCREASES IN THE PREPAID PENSION

ASSET AND ACQUISITIONS. GECS OTHER ASSETS INCREASED $12.1 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT

OF ACQUISITIONS AFFECTING REAL ESTATE AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS (INVESTMENTS CONTROLLED BY

POLICYHOLDERS); THE TRANSFER OF HOME DEPOT PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES (ASSETS

HELD FOR SALE) IN PREPARATION FOR THEIR SALE WHEN THAT CONTRACT IS TERMINATED IN 2003; AND

INCREASING DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH ONGOING INSURANCE OPERATIONS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN OUR INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATED COMPANIES REFLECTING THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THE BANC ONE JOINT VENTURE (SEE NOTE 17).

CONSOLIDATED BORROWINGS AGGREGATED

$279.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED WITH $232.9 BILLION AT THE END OF 2001. THE

MAJOR DEBT-RATING AGENCIES EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF GE AND OF GE CAPITAL

CORPORATION (GE CAPITAL), THE MAJOR PUBLIC BORROWING ENTITY OF GECS, DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE

OF THEIR DISTINCT BUSINESS CHARACTERISTICS. USING CRITERIA APPROPRIATE TO EACH AND

CONSIDERING THEIR COMBINED STRENGTH, THOSE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO GIVE THE

HIGHEST RATINGS TO DEBT OF BOTH GE AND GE CAPITAL.

GE

TOTAL BORROWINGS WERE $9.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002 ($8.8 BILLION SHORT TERM, $1.0 BILLION

LONG TERM), AN INCREASE OF $7.3 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2001. GE TOTAL DEBT AT THE END OF

2002 EQUALED 13.1% OF TOTAL CAPITAL, UP FROM 4.3% AT THE END OF 2001.

GECS

TOTAL BORROWINGS WERE $270.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, OF WHICH $130.1 BILLION IS DUE

IN 2003 AND $140.8 BILLION IS DUE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. COMPARABLE AMOUNTS AT THE END OF

2001 WERE $239.9 BILLION IN TOTAL, $160.8 BILLION DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR AND $79.1 BILLION

DUE THEREAFTER. A LARGE PORTION OF GECS BORROWINGS ($84.2 BILLION AND $117.5 BILLION AT

THE END OF 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY) WAS ISSUED IN ACTIVE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THAT

WE BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF SHORT-TERM FINANCING. MOST OF THIS

COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS ISSUED BY GE CAPITAL. THE AVERAGE REMAINING TERMS AND INTEREST RATES

OF GE CAPITAL COMMERCIAL PAPER WERE 47 DAYS AND 1.95% AT THE END OF 2002, COMPARED WITH 46

DAYS AND 2.37% AT THE END OF 2001. THE GE CAPITAL RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY WAS 6.58 TO 1 AT

THE END OF 2002 AND 7.31 TO 1 AT THE END OF 2001.

INSURANCE LIABILITIES, RESERVES AND

ANNUITY BENEFITS OF $135.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WERE $21.6 BILLION HIGHER THAN IN

2001. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS, GROWTH IN DEFERRED

ANNUITIES AND GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AT GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE AND ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENT AT ERC. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 19.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK

MANAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT IN OUR NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. AS A MATTER OF

POLICY, WE

DO NOT ENGAGE IN DERIVATIVES TRADING, DERIVATIVES MARKET-MAKING OR OTHER SPECULATIVE

ACTIVITIES.

THE

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS PROVIDE INFORMATION

ABOUT POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION IS BASED ON SO-CALLED SHOCK TESTS, WHICH MODEL EFFECTS OF INTEREST

RATE AND CURRENCY SHIFTS ON THE REPORTING COMPANY. WHILE THE FOLLOWING RESULTS OF SHOCK

TESTS FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MAY HAVE SOME LIMITED USE

AS BENCHMARKS, THEY SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS FORECASTS.

ONE MEANS OF ASSESSING

EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES IS A DURATION-BASED ANALYSIS THAT MEASURES THE POTENTIAL

LOSS IN NET EARNINGS RESULTING FROM A HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF 100 BASIS

POINTS ACROSS ALL MATURITIES (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD

CURVE). UNDER THIS MODEL, WITH ALL ELSE HELD CONSTANT, WE ESTIMATE THAT SUCH AN

INCREASE, INCLUDING REPRICING IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WOULD REDUCE THE 2003 NET

EARNINGS OF GECS BASED ON YEAR-END 2002 POSITIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $184 MILLION; THE

PRO-FORMA EFFECT FOR GE WAS $61 MILLION. BASED ON POSITIONS AT YEAR-END 2001, THE

PRO-FORMA EFFECT ON 2002 NET EARNINGS OF SUCH AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WAS ESTIMATED

TO BE A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $189 MILLION FOR GECS AND WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR GE.

OUR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OPERATIONS IS DIVERSE. ONE MEANS OF ASSESSING EXPOSURE TO

CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IS TO MODEL EFFECTS ON REPORTED EARNINGS USING A

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS. WE ANALYZED YEAR-END 2002 CONSOLIDATED CURRENCY EXPOSURES, INCLUDING

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, TO IDENTIFY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THEIR RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. NET UNHEDGED

EXPOSURES IN EACH CURRENCY WERE THEN REMEASURED, GENERALLY ASSUMING A 10% DECREASE

(SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER DECREASES FOR HYPERINFLATIONARY CURRENCIES) IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES COMPARED WITH THE U.S. DOLLAR. UNDER THIS MODEL, WE ESTIMATED AT YEAR-END 2002 THAT

SUCH A DECREASE WOULD HAVE AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON 2003 EARNINGS.

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN

SHARE OWNERS EQUITY

(PAGE 72)

SHARE OWNERS EQUITY INCREASED

$8.9 BILLION, $4.3 BILLION AND $7.9 BILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASES WERE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET EARNINGS OF $14.1 BILLION, $13.7 BILLION AND

$12.7 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF $7.3 BILLION, $6.6 BILLION AND

$5.6 BILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS INCREASED EQUITY BY $1.0 BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH REDUCTIONS

OF $0.6 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. CHANGES IN THE CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR

NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT HAVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

U.S. DOLLAR. IN 2002, STRENGTHENING IN THE EURO AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, ASIAN CURRENCIES

VERSUS THE U.S. DOLLAR REVERSED TRENDS IN THOSE EXCHANGE RELATIONSHIPS OVER THE PRIOR TWO

YEARS. THE EURO STRENGTHENED SIGNIFICANTLY VERSUS THE U.S. DOLLAR IN 2002, AND WAS

RELATIVELY UNCHANGED IN 2001 AFTER WEAKENING IN 2000. ASIAN CURRENCIES ALSO STRENGTHENED

AGAINST THE DOLLAR IN 2002, AND HAD WEAKENED IN 2001 AND 2000. ACCUMULATED CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AFFECT NET EARNINGS ONLY WHEN ALL OR A PORTION OF AN AFFILIATE IS

DISPOSED OF OR SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED.

ADOPTION

OF SFAS 133 IN 2001 REDUCED EQUITY BY $955 MILLION, INCLUDING $827 MILLION AT THE DATE OF

ADOPTION. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 1.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

(PAGES 76-77)

BECAUSE CASH MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES OF

GE AND GECS ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT, IT IS MORE USEFUL TO REVIEW THEIR CASH FLOWS

SEPARATELY.

GE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AGGREGATED

$1.1 BILLION AT THE END OF 2002, DOWN FROM $9.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2001. GE PERIODICALLY

INVESTS AVAILABLE CASH IN GECS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. SUCH AMOUNTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS IN THE GE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. NO SUCH INVESTMENTS WERE MADE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED WITH $8.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

DURING

2002, GE GENERATED $10.1 BILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, A $7.1 BILLION

DECREASE FROM 2001 AS ORDERS FOR NEW POWER SYSTEMS EQUIPMENT AND THE ASSOCIATED PROGRESS

COLLECTIONS DECLINED SHARPLY. EXCLUDING EFFECTS OF PROGRESS COLLECTIONS, CASH FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED 10% IN 2002 AND 13% IN 2001, INCLUDING EFFECTS OF

RECEIVABLES MONETIZATION PROGRAMS IN BOTH YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THE $10.1 BILLION OF CASH

FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, GE BEGAN 2002 WITH $9.8 BILLION OF CASH AND INCREASED NET CASH

FROM BORROWINGS BY $6.8 BILLION, FOR A TOTAL OF $26.7 BILLION. WE USED THE CASH TO INVEST

IN STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS ($9.0 BILLION) AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($2.4 BILLION);

TO REWARD OUR SHARE OWNERS WITH INCREASED DIVIDENDS (TOTALING $7.2 BILLION) AND TO BUY

SHARES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ($2.0 BILLION); AND TO CONTRIBUTE CAPITAL TO OUR

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES ($6.3 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.8 BILLION CONTRIBUTED TO ERC).

DURING

2001 AND 2000, GE GENERATED $32.6 BILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

$6.7 BILLION CUMULATIVE ADDITIONAL CASH FROM PROGRESS COLLECTIONS. THIS CASH PROVIDED

RESOURCES FOR DIVIDENDS TO SHARE OWNERS ($11.8 BILLION); CONTINUATION OF THE SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM ($5.4 BILLION); INVESTMENT IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($5.4

BILLION); AND COMPLETION OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS ($2.6 BILLION).

GE CUMULATIVE CASH FLOWS SINCE 1994

(IN BILLIONS)

UNDER

THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM INITIATED IN DECEMBER 1994, WE HAVE PURCHASED 1.1 BILLION

SHARES OF GE STOCK. IN DECEMBER 2001, THE GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE AMOUNT

AUTHORIZED FROM $22 BILLION TO $30 BILLION. FUNDS USED FOR THE SHARE REPURCHASE ARE

EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED LARGELY FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW.

BASED

ON PAST PERFORMANCE AND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, IN COMBINATION WITH THE FINANCIAL

FLEXIBILITY THAT COMES WITH A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND THE HIGHEST CREDIT RATINGS, WE

BELIEVE WE ARE IN A SOUND POSITION TO CONTINUE THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, TO GROW

DIVIDENDS AND TO CONTINUE MAKING SELECTIVE INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH. WE EXPECT

EXPENDITURES FOR PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TO BE ABOUT $2.2 BILLION IN 2003, PRINCIPALLY FOR

PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 64

GECS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AGGREGATED

$7.9 BILLION AT THE END OF 2002, UP FROM $7.3 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2001. OVER THE PAST

THREE YEARS, GECS BORROWINGS WITH MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS HAVE DECREASED BY $13.2

BILLION. NEW BORROWINGS OF $173.7 BILLION HAVING MATURITIES LONGER THAN 90 DAYS WERE ADDED

DURING THOSE YEARS, WHILE $107.2 BILLION OF SUCH LONGER-TERM BORROWINGS WERE RETIRED. GECS

ALSO GENERATED $48.1 BILLION FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, WHICH

BENEFITED IN 2002 AND 2001 FROM INCREASES IN INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND RESERVES.

THE

PRINCIPAL USE OF CASH BY GECS HAS BEEN INVESTING IN ASSETS TO GROW OUR BUSINESSES. OF THE

$122.9 BILLION THAT GECS INVESTED OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, $48.0 BILLION WAS USED FOR

ADDITIONS TO FINANCING RECEIVABLES; $35.0 BILLION WAS USED TO INVEST IN NEW EQUIPMENT,

PRINCIPALLY FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; AND $24.8 BILLION WAS USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF NEW

BUSINESSES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WERE AUSTRALIAN GUARANTEE CORPORATION, SECURITY CAPITAL

AND DEUTSCHE FINANCIAL SERVICES IN 2002 AND HELLER FINANCIAL, INC. AND MELLON LEASING IN

2001.

WITH

THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY THAT COMES WITH EXCELLENT CREDIT RATINGS, WE BELIEVE THAT GECS

SHOULD BE WELL POSITIONED TO MEET THE GLOBAL NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS FOR CAPITAL AND TO

CONTINUE PROVIDING OUR SHARE OWNERS WITH GOOD RETURNS.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

COMMERCIAL AIRLINES. FOLLOWING THE

EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, MANY OF OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES. IN THE FACE OF DECLINING TRAFFIC, THEY HAVE RESPONDED BY CURTAILING FLIGHT

SCHEDULES AND DEFERRING AND CANCELING DELIVERIES OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. DETERIORATING

AIRCRAFT UTILIZATION AND PRICING AFFECTS COMMERCIAL FINANCE, WHICH OWNED 1,161 COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WHEN, DESPITE PRESSURE ON THE INDUSTRY, 1,149, OR 99% WERE

ON LEASE. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS

WILL CONTINUE TO WEIGH ON THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IN 2003.

AIRCRAFT

ENGINES SALES OF NEW EQUIPMENT OFTEN INCLUDE LONG-TERM CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS.

UNDER THESE COMMITMENTS, IT IS OUR POLICY TO ESTABLISH A SECURED POSITION IN THE AIRCRAFT

BEING FINANCED. AT YEAR-END 2002, GUARANTEES OF $0.7 BILLION WERE IN PLACE. FURTHER, WE

HAD COMMITTED $1.6 BILLION TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ON FUTURE AIRCRAFT SALES (SEE

NOTE 30). OUR GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS ARE SECURED BY INDIVIDUAL AIRCRAFT OR POOLS OF

AIRCRAFT ENGINES RELATED TO THE SPECIFIC FINANCING ARRANGEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

TOTAL ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT SECURING THESE GUARANTEES EXCEEDED THE GUARANTEED

AMOUNTS, NET OF THE ASSOCIATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES.

AT

YEAR-END 2002, COMMERCIAL FINANCE HAD PROVIDED LOANS AND LEASES OF $26.6 BILLION, AND

COMBINED WITH OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS, HAD $1.9 BILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES RELATED TO

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, COMMERCIAL FINANCE HAD FUNDING COMMITMENTS OF $0.5

BILLION AND HAD PLACED MULTI-YEAR ORDERS FOR VARIOUS BOEING, AIRBUS AND OTHER AIRCRAFT

WITH LIST PRICES APPROXIMATING $15.4 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002. COMMERCIAL FINANCE HELD

PLACEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH COMMERCIAL AIRLINES FOR 40 OF THE 42 AIRCRAFT SCHEDULED FOR

DELIVERY IN 2003.

TWO

OF OUR MAJOR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, US AIRWAYS GROUP INC. AND UAL CORP, THE PARENT COMPANIES

OF US AIRWAYS AND UNITED AIRLINES, RESPECTIVELY, ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES AND BOTH FILED FOR REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY IN 2002. AT DECEMBER 31,

2002, OUR EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE AIRLINES AMOUNTED TO $3.7 BILLION, INCLUDING LOANS,

LEASES, INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. VARIOUS

BOEING AND AIRBUS AIRCRAFT SECURE THESE FINANCIAL EXPOSURES. WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES UNDER THESE PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENTS IN LIGHT OF ESTIMATED

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE UNDER RECOURSE PROVISIONS.

IN

DECEMBER 2002, COMMERCIAL FINANCE AND US AIRWAYS GROUP INC. AGREED ON A GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE COGNIZANT BANKRUPTCY COURT IN JANUARY 2003.

THE PLAN WILL PROVIDE THE AIRLINE WITH UP TO $120 MILLION DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING,

WHICH WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY REFINANCED AS PART OF A $360 MILLION FACILITY BEING PROVIDED BY

US UPON US AIRWAYS GROUP INC.'S EXITING FROM CHAPTER 11, AND $350 MILLION OF FUTURE

LEASE FINANCING FOR REGIONAL JET AIRCRAFT. UPON US AIRWAYS GROUP INC.'S EMERGENCE

FROM BANKRUPTCY WE WOULD RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CLASS A SHARES OF THE

REORGANIZED US AIRWAYS GROUP INC. ALONG WITH 3.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS CLASS A PREFERRED

STOCK.

COMMERCIAL

AVIATION IS IMPORTANT TO US, AS IT IS TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND WE ARE PLEASED THAT OUR

TECHNOLOGY, OUR PROACTIVE PARTNERING AND OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH HAVE EARNED US THE LOYALTY

OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE IN THAT INDUSTRY. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE SERVED THE

NEEDS OF OUR GLOBAL INVESTORS WITH PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO THE

INDUSTRYS RISKS. OUR UNDERWRITING ESTABLISHES POSITIONS THAT ARE SECURED BY TANGIBLE

ASSETS; OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROTECTS OUR INVESTMENTS; AND WE RECORD LOSSES IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INVESTMENTS IN AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS IN

THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CABLE INDUSTRIES AMOUNTED TO $9.2 BILLION AND $2.9

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND PRIMARILY COMPRISED

FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES. INCLUDED IN THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMOUNT IS COMMERCIAL FINANCES EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT

IN SES GLOBAL OF $1.7 BILLION. LIKE ALL FINANCIAL SERVICES POSITIONS, THESE

RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN ENTERED INTO SUBJECT TO STRICT RISK AND

UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, ARE DIVERSIFIED, AND FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE GENERALLY

SECURED. DURING RECENT DECLINES IN THE VALUES OF THESE PORTFOLIOS, THE POSITIONS

HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY REVIEWED FOR CREDIT AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, AND ACTIONS HAVE

BEEN TAKEN TO MITIGATE EXPOSURES. WE HAVE MADE PROVISION FOR PROBABLE LOSSES.

FUTURE LOSSES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND UPON BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AS

WELL AS THE SUCCESS OF RISK MITIGATION ACTIONS.

LIQUIDITY

THE MAJOR DEBT-RATING AGENCIES

EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF GE AND OF GE CAPITAL CORPORATION (GE CAPITAL), THE

MAJOR PUBLIC BORROWING ENTITY OF GECS, DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR DISTINCT BUSINESS

CHARACTERISTICS. FACTORS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE RATINGS OF BOTH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CASH GENERATING ABILITYINCLUDING CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES; EARNINGS

QUALITYINCLUDING REVENUE GROWTH AND THE BREADTH AND DIVERSITY OF SOURCES OF INCOME;

LEVERAGE RATIOSSUCH AS DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL AND INTEREST COVERAGE; AND ASSET

UTILIZATION, INCLUDING RETURN ON ASSETS AND ASSET TURNOVER RATIOS. CONSIDERING THOSE

FACTORS, THOSE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO GIVE THE HIGHEST RATINGS TO DEBT OF BOTH

GE AND GE CAPITAL (LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING AAA/AAA; SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING A-1+/P-1).

ONE

OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IS TO MAINTAIN THESE RATINGS ON DEBT ISSUED BY GE AND GE

CAPITAL. OUR TRIPLE-A RATING LOWERS OUR COST OF BORROWINGS AND FACILITATES ACCESS TO A

VARIETY OF LENDERS. WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH MAINTAINING THESE

TRIPLE-A RATINGS.

TO

SUPPORT THE GE CAPITAL RATING, AT THE END OF 2002, GE WAS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO

MAINTAIN THE RATIOS OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AT GE CAPITAL AT A SPECIFIED LEVEL. TO

BUILD EQUITY, THE GECS BOARD OF DIRECTORS INTENDS TO REDUCE GECS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO GE

TO 10% OF OPERATING EARNINGS. GE CONTRIBUTED $6.3 BILLION OF CASH IN 2002, OF WHICH $1.8

BILLION FUNDED CERTAIN LOSS DEVELOPMENT AT ERC. SEE ALSO JANUARY 1, 2003,

RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT PROFIT ON PAGE 58. OUR PLANS ARE TO

REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DEBT AND INCREASE EQUITY IN FINANCIAL SERVICES; TARGETING 2005 FOR

ELIMINATION OF THE $12.5 BILLION OF DEBT ALLOCATED TO ALL OTHER GECS AS OF JANUARY 1,

2003. PROCEEDS FROM ANY STRATEGIC DISPOSITIONS WILL BE EVALUATED WHEN AND IF THEY ARE

RECEIVED, BUT WE ANTICIPATE USING AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE PROCEEDS TO REDUCE FINANCIAL

SERVICES DEBT.

DURING

2002, CERTAIN EXTERNAL CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ANNOUNCED THE LOWERING OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH

RATINGS WITH RESPECT TO GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING AND SUBSIDIARIES. THOSE RATING

AGENCIES MADE SIMILAR ANNOUNCEMENTS WITH REGARD TO OTHER PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

AND REINSURANCE ENTITIES AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. DEBT RATINGS FOR GE GLOBAL INSURANCE

HOLDING AFFECT $1.7 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT. THESE RATINGS WERE ADJUSTED NEGATIVELY IN

2002, BUT REMAINED INVESTMENT GRADE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE ACTIONS WILL MATERIALLY

AFFECT GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OR THE ABILITY TO WRITE

FUTURE BUSINESS.

GLOBAL COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS ARE

ALSO A PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR GE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. GE CAPITAL IS THE MOST

WIDELY-HELD NAME IN THOSE MARKETS AND IS THE PRINCIPAL ISSUER OF FINANCIAL SERVICES DEBT.

FINANCIAL SERVICES DEBT COMPOSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, FOLLOWS.

=================================================================================

DURING 2002, GE CAPITAL ISSUED

APPROXIMATELY $88 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THESE FUNDS

WERE USED PRIMARILY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING BY $33 BILLION

AND TO FUND ACQUISITIONS AND NEW ASSET GROWTH. WE TARGET A RATIO FOR COMMERCIAL PAPER OF

25% TO 35% OF OUTSTANDING DEBT BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED COMPOSITION OF OUR ASSETS. GE

CAPITAL ANTICIPATES ISSUING APPROXIMATELY $60 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT USING BOTH U.S.

AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS DURING 2003. THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH ISSUANCES WILL BE USED TO

FUND MATURING LONG-TERM DEBT, ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET GROWTH. THE ULTIMATE

AMOUNT OF DEBT ISSUANCES WILL DEPEND ON THE GROWTH IN ASSETS, ACQUISITION ACTIVITY,

AVAILABILITY OF MARKETS AND MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES.

WE

BELIEVE THAT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT AN ORDERLY

TRANSITION FROM COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF IMPAIRED ACCESS TO THOSE

MARKETS. FUNDING SOURCES ON WHICH WE WOULD RELY WOULD DEPEND ON THE NATURE OF SUCH A

HYPOTHETICAL EVENT, BUT INCLUDE $54 BILLION OF CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED LENDING AGREEMENTS

WITH HIGHLY-RATED GLOBAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT BANKS, AN INCREASE OF $21 BILLION SINCE

DECEMBER 31, 2001, AS WELL AS OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM

FUNDING, MONETIZATION, ASSET SECURITIZATION, CASH RECEIPTS FROM LENDING AND LEASING

ACTIVITIES, SHORT-TERM SECURED FUNDING ON GLOBAL ASSETS, AND POTENTIAL ASSET SALES.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 66

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ARE

USED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO ACHIEVE IMPROVED SHARE OWNER RETURNS. ONE OF

THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IS ASSET SECURITIZATION. THE

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WE ENGAGE IN ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND ARE PART OF A $700 BILLION ANNUAL MARKET FOR ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL

PAPER. WE USE SPONSORED AND THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES TO EXECUTE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS

FUNDED IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM MARKETS. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, WE CONSIDER THE

RELATIVE RISKS AND RETURNS OF EACH ALTERNATIVE AND PREDOMINANTLY USE SPONSORED ENTITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE READILY EXECUTED THROUGH NON-SPONSORED

ENTITIES OR TERM SECURITIZATION AT MODEST INCREMENTAL COST. BEYOND IMPROVED RETURNS, THESE

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS SERVE AS FUNDING SOURCES FOR A VARIETY OF DIVERSIFIED LENDING

AND SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, TRANSFER SELECTED CREDIT RISK AND IMPROVE CASH FLOWS WHILE

ENHANCING THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A FULL RANGE OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS.

SIMPLY

STATED, IN A TYPICAL SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION, WE SELL HIGH-QUALITY FINANCIAL ASSETS TO

ENTITIES THAT HAVE FINANCED THOSE PURCHASES USING LOW-COST, HIGHLY-RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER.

IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS, WE DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL HOW THESE TRANSACTIONS WITH SUCH

ENTITIES TYPICALLY WORK.

THE

FIRST STEP IN THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS USES ENTITIES THAT MEET THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA

FOR QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (QUALIFYING ENTITIES). AMONG OTHER CRITERIA, A

QUALIFYING ENTITYS ACTIVITIES MUST BE RESTRICTED TO PASSIVE INVESTMENT IN FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND ISSUANCE OF RETAINED INTERESTS IN THOSE ASSETS. UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, ENTITIES MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED IN THE

SPONSORS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE SELL SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS TO QUALIFYING

ENTITIES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE FINANCING AND CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. ON

THE WHOLE, THE CREDIT QUALITY OF SUCH ASSETS IS EQUAL TO OR HIGHER THAN THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF SIMILAR ASSETS WE OWN.

QUALIFYING

ENTITIES RAISE CASH BY ISSUING RETAINED INTERESTSRIGHTS TO CASH FLOWS FROM THE

ASSETSTO OTHER SPES WE SPONSOR THAT ISSUE HIGHLY-RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO

THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. THESE SPES USE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROCEEDS TO OBTAIN

RETAINED INTERESTS IN THE FINANCIAL ASSETS OF QUALIFYING ENTITIES, AS WELL AS FINANCIAL

ASSETS ORIGINATED BY MULTIPLE THIRD PARTIES. WE PROVIDE CREDIT SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN OF

THESE ASSETS, AS WELL AS LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE COMMERCIAL PAPER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

OUR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO THE QUALIFYING ENTITIES, WE RIGOROUSLY UNDERWRITE AND

SERVICE THE ASSOCIATED ASSETS, BOTH THOSE WE ORIGINATE AND THOSE ORIGINATED BY OTHER

PARTICIPANTS. ALL OF THE QUALIFYING ENTITIES ASSETS SERVE AS COLLATERAL FOR THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER. SUPPORT ACTIVITIES INCLUDE CREDIT REVIEWS AT ACQUISITION AND ONGOING

REVIEW, BILLING AND COLLECTION ACTIVITIESTHE SAME SUPPORT ACTIVITIES THAT GECS

EMPLOYS FOR ITS OWN FINANCING RECEIVABLES. THESE ENTITIES ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OUR

SPONSORED SPES ARE ROUTINELY EVALUATED BY THE MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES, INCLUDING

MONTHLY REVIEWS OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ASSET QUALITY.

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THESE ENTITIES HAS ALWAYS RECEIVED THE HIGHEST AVAILABLE

RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AND AT YEAR-END 2002 WAS RATED A-1+/P-1.

ASSETS

HELD BY SPES INCLUDE: RECEIVABLES SECURED BY EQUIPMENT, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND OTHER

ASSETS; CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES; AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. IN ADDITION TO BEING OF HIGH

CREDIT QUALITY, THESE ASSETS ARE DIVERSIFIED TO AVOID CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK. EXAMPLES OF

THESE ASSETS INCLUDE LOANS AND LEASES ON MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, LOANS

ON COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL LOANS, AND BALANCES OF HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ACCOUNTS

FROM SALES OF A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO A DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE. SUCH

ASSETS TOTALED $42.2 BILLION AND $43.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY.

SALES

OF SECURITIZED ASSETS TO SPES RESULT IN A GAIN OR LOSS AMOUNTING TO THE NET OF SALES

PROCEEDS, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF NET ASSETS SOLD, THE FAIR VALUE OF RETAINED INTERESTS AND

SERVICING RIGHTS AND AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. TOTAL SECURITIZATION SALES RESULTED IN GAINS

OF $0.8 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN

REVENUES NET OF ANY EFFECTS OF REPLENISHING SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD BALANCES.

IN

ADDITION TO THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, FINANCIAL GUARANTY

INSURANCE COMPANY (FGIC), AN AFFILIATE THAT IS A LEADER IN THE MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE

MARKET, USES SPES THAT OFFER MUNICIPALITIES GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS WITH INTERESTS

IN HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED MATURITY, INVESTMENT GRADE ASSETS. FGIC ACTIVELY MANAGES THESE

ASSETS UNDER STRICT INVESTMENT CRITERIA AND GE CAPITAL ALSO PROVIDES CERTAIN PERFORMANCE

GUARANTEES. TOTAL ASSETS IN SPONSORED FGIC ENTITIES AMOUNTED TO $13.7 BILLION AND $13.4

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

WE

PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT RELATED TO ASSETS HELD BY CERTAIN SPES THROUGH LIQUIDITY

AGREEMENTS, CREDIT SUPPORT, PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES AND GUARANTEE AND REIMBURSEMENT

CONTRACTS. NET CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AMOUNTED TO $27.2 BILLION AFTER CONSIDERATION

OF PARTICIPATED LIQUIDITY AND ARRANGEMENTS THAT DEFER LIQUIDITY DRAWS BEYOND 2003, A

REDUCTION OF $15.9 BILLION FROM 2001. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES CREDIT SUPPORT, IN WHICH WE

PROVIDE RECOURSE FOR A MAXIMUM OF $16.9 BILLION OF CREDIT LOSSES IN SPES. POTENTIAL CREDIT

LOSSES ARE PROVIDED FOR IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, WE PROVIDED AN ALLOWANCE OF $233

MILLION FOR RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2002. PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES RELATE TO

LETTERS OF CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND ARE

SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $3.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

NONE

OF THE GE SPONSORED SPES IS PERMITTED TO HOLD GE STOCK, AND THERE ARE NO COMMITMENTS OR

GUARANTEES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCE OF GE STOCK. THESE ENTITIES DO NOT

ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES OF ANY DESCRIPTION, ARE NOT USED TO HEDGE OUR ASSET

POSITIONS, AND UNDER GE INTEGRITY POLICIES, NO GE EMPLOYEE, OFFICER OR DIRECTOR IS

PERMITTED TO INVEST IN ANY SPONSORED SPE.

WE

HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN EVALUATING ECONOMIC, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK. IN VIEW OF

THIS EXPERIENCE, THE HIGH QUALITY OF ASSETS IN THESE ENTITIES, THE HISTORICALLY ROBUST

QUALITY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, AND THE HISTORICAL RELIABILITY OF CONTROLS APPLIED TO

BOTH ASSET SERVICING AND TO ACTIVITIES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, WE BELIEVE THAT, UNDER ANY

REASONABLE FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE ECONOMIC EFFECT ON US.

UNDER

FIN 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

, NEW CONSOLIDATION CRITERIA WILL BE

APPLIED TO CERTAIN SPES, WHICH IT DEFINES AS VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ENTITIES THAT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF FIN 46 IS PROVIDED IN

NOTE 29.

PRINCIPAL DEBT CONDITIONS THAT COULD

AUTOMATICALLY RESULT IN REMEDIES, SUCH AS ACCELERATION OF GE OR FINANCIAL SERVICES DEBT,

ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

IF THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL OR CERTAIN SPES DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 29

WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1, GE CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE LIQUIDITY

FOR THOSE ENTITIES OR PROVIDE FUNDS TO RETIRE THE OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT (NET OF PARTICIPATED LIQUIDITY AND ARRANGEMENTS THAT DEFER LIQUIDITY TO

2004) THAT GE CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS

DETERMINED BY CONTRACT, AND AMOUNTED TO $22.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO FALL BELOW AA/AA2, GE CAPITAL WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE CREDIT SUPPORT OR LIQUIDATE THE SPES. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT

THAT GE CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBSTITUTE IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS

DETERMINED BY CONTRACT, AND AMOUNTED TO $2.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR ITS SHORT-TERM

CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GE CAPITAL COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UP TO

$1.1 BILLION TO THE FGIC SPES AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO REPAY AN AMOUNT OF FGICS

GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AS SPECIFIED BY CONTRACT; AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THAT

MAXIMUM REPAYMENT WAS $3.6 BILLION.

IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF EITHER GE OR

GECS UNDER CERTAIN SWAP, FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS FALLS BELOW A-/A3, CERTAIN REMEDIES

ARE REQUIRED AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 28.

IF GE CAPITALS RATIO OF

EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES, WHICH WAS 1.65:1 AT THE END OF 2002, WERE TO DETERIORATE TO

1.10:1 OR, UPON REDEMPTION OF CERTAIN PREFERRED STOCK, ITS RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY, WHICH

WAS 6.58:1 AT THE END OF 2002, WERE TO EXCEED 8:1, GE HAS COMMITTED TO CONTRIBUTE CAPITAL

TO GE CAPITAL. GE ALSO HAS GUARANTEED SUBORDINATED DEBT OF GECS WITH A FACE AMOUNT OF $1.0

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001.

NONE OF THESE CONDITIONS HAS BEEN MET

IN GE OR GECS HISTORY, AND WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER ANY REASONABLE FUTURE ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENTS, THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA, SUMMARIZED

ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE, ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS: UPPER PORTIONCONSOLIDATED

DATA; MIDDLE PORTIONGE DATA THAT REFLECT VARIOUS CONVENTIONAL MEASUREMENTS FOR SUCH

ENTERPRISES; AND LOWER PORTIONGECS DATA THAT REFLECT KEY INFORMATION PERTINENT TO

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES.

GES TOTAL RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $2.6 BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $2.3 BILLION AND $2.2

BILLION IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2002, EXPENDITURES FROM GES OWN FUNDS

WERE $2.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 12% FROM 2001, REFLECTING CONTINUING RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT WORK RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT, SERVICE, INFORMATION AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES.

PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY EFFORTS IN 2002 INCLUDED CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT WORK ON THE NEXT

GENERATION OF GAS TURBINES, FURTHER ADVANCES IN STATE-OF-THE-ART DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING

TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPING REDUCED EMISSIONS AND MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT LOCOMOTIVES, IMPROVING

THE PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY OF WIND ENERGY TURBINES AND CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF MORE

FUEL-EFFICIENT, COST-EFFECTIVE AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGNS. SERVICES TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE

FURTHER ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING REMOTE DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITIES

RELATED TO REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, AIRCRAFT ENGINES, POWER GENERATION

EQUIPMENT AND LOCOMOTIVES. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD ARE

HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS INTEGRATE THEIR VARIOUS DEVICES AND CRITICAL SYSTEMS. PROCESS

TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDED IMPROVED PRODUCT QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED CAPACITY FOR

MANUFACTURING ENGINEERED MATERIALS. EXPENDITURES FUNDED BY CUSTOMERS (MAINLY THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT) WERE $416 MILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $369 MILLION IN 2001.

GES TOTAL BACKLOG OF FIRM

UNFILLED ORDERS AT THE END OF 2002 WAS $36.1 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 24% FROM YEAR-END

2001, REFLECTING SOFTENING DEMAND FOR NEW EQUIPMENT IN THE POWER GENERATION BUSINESS AT

POWER SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER BACKLOG AT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND AIRCRAFT

ENGINES. OF THE TOTAL BACKLOG, $28.6 BILLION RELATED TO PRODUCTS, OF WHICH 65% WAS

SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2003. PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS, INCLUDED IN THIS REPORTED BACKLOG

FOR ONLY THE SUCCEEDING 12 MONTHS, WERE $7.5 BILLION AT THE END OF 2002. ORDERS

CONSTITUTING THIS BACKLOG MAY BE CANCELED OR DEFERRED BY CUSTOMERS, SUBJECT IN CERTAIN

CASES TO PENALTIES. SEE SEGMENT OPERATIONS BEGINNING ON PAGE 50 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF THE APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED IN THIS

SECTION ARE THOSE THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEIR APPLICATION PLACES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEMANDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

JUDGE THE EFFECT OF INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR ALL OF

THESE POLICIES, WE CAUTION THAT FUTURE EVENTS RARELY DEVELOP EXACTLY AS FORECAST, AND THE

BEST ESTIMATES ROUTINELY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED. MEASUREMENT OF SUCH LOSSES REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING THE NEED TO ADJUST FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND

JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND

MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST

RATES. EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES AT YEAR-END 2002 WAS $222.3 BILLION,

INCLUDING CREDIT SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, AGAINST WHICH AN ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES OF $5.8 BILLION WAS PROVIDED. FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON PAGES 60 AND 61,

AND IN NOTES 1, 12, 13 AND, FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, IN NOTE 29. WHILE LOSSES DEPEND

TO A LARGE DEGREE ON FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE

CREDIT DEVELOPMENT IN 2003.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

RESULTS IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS WHEN A MARKET DECLINE BELOW COST IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY. WE REGULARLY REVIEW EACH INVESTMENT SECURITY FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CRITERIA

THAT INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COST EXCEEDS MARKET VALUE, THE DURATION OF THAT MARKET

DECLINE AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER. GECS INVESTMENT

SECURITIES AMOUNTED TO $116.5 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002. GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

INCLUDED IN THAT CARRYING AMOUNT RELATED TO DEBT SECURITIES WERE $4.2 BILLION AND $1.9

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES WERE $0.2

BILLION AND $0.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OF SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES AT YEAR-END

2002, AND BASED ON APPLICATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT, APPROXIMATELY $800

MILLION OF PORTFOLIO VALUE, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION FROM THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CABLE INDUSTRIES, IS AT RISK OF BEING CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN 2003.

GECS ACTIVELY PERFORMS COMPREHENSIVE MARKET RESEARCH, MONITORS MARKET CONDITIONS AND

SEGMENTS ITS INVESTMENTS BY CREDIT RISK IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE IMPAIRMENT RISKS. FURTHER

INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1 AND 9 AND ON PAGE 60, WHICH DISCUSSES THE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 70

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE PRODUCT

SERVICES (PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS) REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF PROFITS OVER THE MULTI-YEAR

TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENTS, CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF FUTURE

MONITORING, MAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL EVENTS; COST OF PERSONNEL; SPARE PARTS AND OTHER

RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE SERVICES; AND FUTURE COST CHANGES. WE ROUTINELY REVIEW

ESTIMATES UNDER PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS AND REGULARLY REVISE THEM TO ADJUST FOR

CHANGES IN OUTLOOK. REVISIONS THAT AFFECT A PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS TOTAL

ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY WILL ALSO RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENT OF EARNINGS. WE ALSO

REGULARLY ASSESS CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CONTRACT COSTS

AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS AND PROVIDE FOR LOSSES WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED. CARRYING AMOUNTS FOR

PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS IN PROGRESS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, WERE $2.9 BILLION

AND $2.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED

EARNINGS IN NOTE 17. ADJUSTMENTS TO EARNINGS RESULTING FROM REVISIONS TO ESTIMATES

ON PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002.

INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND RESERVES

DIFFER FOR SHORT AND LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS. SHORT-DURATION CONTRACTS SUCH AS

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BASED ON ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES OF LOSSES

INHERENT IN THAT PERIODS CLAIMS, INCLUDING LOSSES FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

REPORTED. SHORT-DURATION CONTRACT LOSS ESTIMATES RELY ON ACTUARIAL OBSERVATIONS OF

ULTIMATE LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR SIMILAR HISTORICAL EVENTS. MEASUREMENT OF LONG-DURATION

INSURANCE LIABILITIES (SUCH AS TERM AND WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES) IS ALSO BASED ON

APPROVED ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MORTALITY, LAPSE RATES AND

FUTURE YIELD ON RELATED INVESTMENTS. HISTORICAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE INDICATES

THAT A GREATER DEGREE OF INHERENT VARIABILITY EXISTS IN ASSESSING THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF

LOSSES UNDER SHORT-DURATION PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CONTRACTS THAN EXISTS FOR LONG-DURATION

MORTALITY EXPOSURES. THIS INHERENT VARIABILITY IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT FOR

LIABILITY-RELATED EXPOSURES, INCLUDING LATENT CLAIMS ISSUES (SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED COVERAGE DISPUTES), BECAUSE OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF

TIMEOFTEN MANY YEARSTHAT TRANSPIRES BETWEEN WHEN A GIVEN CLAIM EVENT OCCURS

AND THE ULTIMATE FULL SETTLEMENT OF SUCH CLAIM. THIS SITUATION IS THEN FURTHER EXACERBATED

FOR REINSURANCE ENTITIES (AS OPPOSED TO PRIMARY INSURERS) DUE TO COVERAGE OFTEN BEING

PROVIDED ON AN EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS AND THE RESULTING LAGS IN RECEIVING

CURRENT CLAIMS DATA. GECS INSURANCE LIABILITIES, RESERVES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS WITHIN THE

INSURANCE SEGMENT TOTALED $135.9 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002. OF THAT TOTAL, $30.6 BILLION

($20.9 BILLION NET OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES) RELATED TO UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES UNDER SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS OF WHICH ERCS SHARE

APPROXIMATED $26.6 BILLION ($17.4 BILLION NET OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES).

WE

CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN LOSS ESTIMATES WITH THE SUPPORT OF

QUALIFIED RESERVING ACTUARIES AND USE THE RESULTS OF THESE EVALUATIONS BOTH TO ADJUST

RECORDED RESERVES AND TO PROACTIVELY MODIFY UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

FOR ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS PURPOSES, REPORTED AND PAID CLAIMS ACTIVITY IS SEGREGATED INTO

SEVERAL HUNDRED RESERVING SEGMENTS, EACH HAVING DIFFERING HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT TRENDS. A

VARIETY OF ACTUARIAL METHODOLOGIES ARE THEN APPLIED TO THE UNDERLYING DATA FOR EACH OF

THESE RESERVING SEGMENTS IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATED RANGE OF REASONABLY

POSSIBLE LOSS SCENARIOS. FACTORS SUCH AS LINE OF BUSINESS, LENGTH OF HISTORICAL

SETTLEMENT PATTERN, RECENT CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND UNUSUAL TRENDS IN

REPORTED CLAIMS ACTIVITY WILL GENERALLY AFFECT WHICH ACTUARIAL METHODOLOGIES ARE GIVEN

MORE WEIGHT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE BEST ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE LOSSES

IN A PARTICULAR RESERVING SEGMENT. AS DISCUSSED ON PAGES 53-54, IN RECENT PERIODS AND

CONTINUING THROUGHOUT 2002, THE LEVEL OF REPORTED CLAIMS ACTIVITY RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR

LOSS EVENTS, PARTICULARLY FOR LIABILITY-RELATED EXPOSURES UNDERWRITTEN IN 1997 THROUGH

2001 AT ERC, HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED. FULL CONSIDERATION OF THESE

TRENDS WAS INCORPORATED INTO A COMPREHENSIVE RESERVE STUDY COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2002.

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS. PENSION BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND THE RELATED EFFECTS ON OPERATIONS ARE CALCULATED USING ACTUARIAL MODELS.

TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT

ELEMENTS OF PLAN EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS

RETIREMENT, MORTALITY AND TURNOVER. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE EVALUATED PERIODICALLY AND ARE

UPDATED TO REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCE. OF COURSE, ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WILL OFTEN

DIFFER FROM ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

<PAGE>

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 71

THE

DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT A PRESENT VALUE ON THE

MEASUREMENT DATE. WE HAVE LITTLE LATITUDE IN SELECTING THIS RATE, AS IT IS REQUIRED TO

REPRESENT THE MARKET RATE FOR HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE

INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. FOR OUR

PRINCIPAL PLANS, A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE PENSION

EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $180 MILLION. WE REDUCED OUR DISCOUNT RATE FROM 7 1/4% TO

6 3/4% FOR

2003 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS.

TO

DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE

CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON

VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

ASSETS OF PRINCIPAL PLANS WOULD INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE ON OUR PRINCIPAL PLANS BY

APPROXIMATELY $240 MILLION PER YEAR. WE ASSUMED THAT LONG-TERM RETURNS ON OUR PENSION

PLANS WERE 8 1/2% IN 2002 AND 9 1/2% IN 2001 AND 2000. FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR PRINCIPAL

PENSION PLANS IS PROVIDED ON PAGES 47-48 OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

UNDER THE CAPTION PRINCIPAL COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR GE. NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES DISCLOSURE OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS.

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES

ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE

AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED WHEN THERE IS A

REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL EXCEED THE RECORDED PROVISION.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE OFTEN RESOLVED OVER LONG TIME PERIODS. ESTIMATING PROBABLE

LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FORECASTS THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT

POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS REGULATORS.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, NOT INVOLVING THE SAME LEVEL OF MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTIES AS THOSE DISCUSSED

ABOVE, ARE NEVERTHELESS IMPORTANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

POLICIES RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

REQUIRE DIFFICULT JUDGMENTS ON COMPLEX MATTERS THAT ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO MULTIPLE SOURCES

OF AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE. CERTAIN OF THESE MATTERS ARE AMONG TOPICS CURRENTLY UNDER

RE-EXAMINATION BY ACCOUNTING STANDARD SETTERS AND REGULATORS. ALTHOUGH NO SPECIFIC

CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THESE STANDARD SETTERS APPEAR LIKELY TO CAUSE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OUTCOMES CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CONFIDENCE. ALSO SEE NOTE 1,

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH DISCUSSES ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE

HAVE SELECTED FROM ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES.

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL

AFFILIATES – COMPANIES THAT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

CONTROLS. RESULTS OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES – GENERALLY COMPANIES IN WHICH WE OWN

20% TO 50% AND OVER WHICH WE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE

– ARE INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A "ONE-LINE"

BASIS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THIS YEAR'S

PRESENTATION.

FINANCIAL DATA AND RELATED

MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

GE THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OTHER THAN

GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. (GECS), WHOSE OPERATIONS ARE

PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS.

GECS THIS AFFILIATE OWNS ALL OF THE COMMON STOCK OF GENERAL ELECTRIC

CAPITAL CORPORATION (GE CAPITAL) AND GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING CORPORATION

(GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING), THE PARENT OF EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE

CORPORATION. GE CAPITAL, GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING AND THEIR RESPECTIVE

AFFILIATES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE GECS COLUMNS AND CONSTITUTE ITS

BUSINESS.

CONSOLIDATED THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF GE AND GECS.

THE EFFECTS OF TRANSACTIONS AMONG RELATED COMPANIES WITHIN AND BETWEEN EACH

OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED GROUPS ARE ELIMINATED. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECS

ARE IMMATERIAL AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GECS SERVICES FOR MATERIAL PROCUREMENT

AND TRADE PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT, AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND MEDICAL

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT ARE LEASED TO OTHERS, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

LEASED BY GE FROM GECS, AND GE INVESTMENTS OF CASH IN GECS COMMERCIAL PAPER.

PREPARING FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS AND RELATED

DISCLOSURES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

WE RECORD SALES OF GOODS WHEN A FIRM SALES AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE, DELIVERY

HAS OCCURRED AND COLLECTIBILITY OF THE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE SALES PRICE IS

REASONABLY ASSURED. IF CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF PRODUCTS IS NOT ASSURED, SALES ARE

RECORDED ONLY UPON FORMAL CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE.

SALES OF GOODS IN THE

APPLIANCES, INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS, IT SOLUTIONS, LIGHTING, PLASTICS, SPECIALTY

MATERIALS AND GE SUPPLY BUSINESSES TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE PRODUCT

AND/OR SERVICE ELEMENTS, AS COMPARED WITH SALES IN CERTAIN OF THE BUSINESSES

REFERRED TO BELOW. CONSUMER LIGHTING PRODUCTS AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

ARE OFTEN SOLD WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN. ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE IS USED TO

ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR SUCH RETURNS.

SALES OF GOODS IN THE

AIRCRAFT ENGINES, MEDICAL SYSTEMS, POWER SYSTEMS, TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND

CERTAIN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS BUSINESSES SOMETIMES INCLUDE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS AND

SOMETIMES INCLUDE SERVICES SUCH AS INSTALLATION. IN SUCH CONTRACTS, AMOUNTS

ASSIGNED TO EACH COMPONENT ARE BASED ON THAT COMPONENT'S OBJECTIVELY

DETERMINED FAIR VALUE, SUCH AS THE SALES PRICE FOR THE COMPONENT WHEN IT IS SOLD

SEPARATELY OR COMPETITOR PRICES FOR SIMILAR COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, SALES ARE

RECOGNIZED INDIVIDUALLY FOR DELIVERED COMPONENTS ONLY WHEN UNDELIVERED

COMPONENTS ARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THEIR FUNCTIONALITY. HOWEVER, WHEN UNDELIVERED

COMPONENTS ARE INCONSEQUENTIAL OR PERFUNCTORY, SUCH AS CERTAIN TRAINING

COMMITMENTS, SALES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE TOTAL CONTRACT WITH PROVISION MADE FOR

THE COST OF THE INCOMPLETE ELEMENTS.

WE RECORD SALES OF PRODUCT

SERVICES AND CERTAIN POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTS.

FOR LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS, WE USE ESTIMATED CONTRACT PROFIT

RATES TO RECORD SALES AS WORK IS PERFORMED. FOR CERTAIN POWER GENERATION

EQUIPMENT, WE USE ESTIMATED CONTRACT PROFIT RATES TO RECORD SALES AS MAJOR

COMPONENTS ARE COMPLETED AND DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS. ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO

CHANGE; REVISIONS THAT AFFECT AN AGREEMENT'S TOTAL ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY

RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENT OF EARNINGS. LOSSES, IF ANY, ARE PROVIDED FOR

WHEN PROBABLE.

SALES BY NBC ARE RECORDED

WHEN ADVERTISEMENTS ARE BROADCAST, WITH PROVISION MADE FOR ANY SHORTFALLS FROM

VIEWER COMMITMENTS ("MAKE GOODS") BASED ON SPECIFIC CONTRACTS AND

INDEPENDENT VIEWER CENSUS INFORMATION.

GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME)

WE USE THE INTEREST METHOD TO RECOGNIZE INCOME ON ALL LOANS. WE STOP ACCRUING

INTEREST INCOME AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT

BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS DELINQUENT. WE RECOGNIZE

INTEREST INCOME ON IMPAIRED LOANS EITHER AS CASH IS COLLECTED OR ON A

COST-RECOVERY BASIS AS CONDITIONS WARRANT.

WE RECORD FINANCING LEASE

INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD TO PRODUCE A LEVEL YIELD ON FUNDS NOT YET

RECOVERED. ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED ASSETS ARE BASED

PRIMARILY ON PERIODIC INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS OF THE VALUES OF LEASED ASSETS

REMAINING AT EXPIRATION OF THE LEASE TERMS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN

ESTIMATING RESIDUAL VALUES INCLUDE ESTIMATED NET CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING

LEASE TERM, RESULTS OF FUTURE REMARKETING AND FUTURE COMPONENT PART AND SCRAP

METAL PRICES, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE.

<PAGE>

F-37

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 79

WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE

INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF UNDERLYING LEASES.

WE DEFER ORIGINATION,

COMMITMENT AND OTHER NONREFUNDABLE FEES RELATED TO FUNDINGS AND RECORD THEM IN

EARNED INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD. WE DEFER COMMITMENT FEES RELATED TO LOANS

THAT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO FUND AND ON LINE-OF-CREDIT FEES AND RECORD THEM IN

EARNED INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PERIOD TO WHICH THE FEES RELATE.

WE RECORD SYNDICATION FEES IN EARNED INCOME AT THE TIME RELATED SERVICES ARE

PERFORMED UNLESS SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES EXIST.

SEE BELOW AND PAGE 80 FOR OUR

DISCUSSION OF INCOME FROM INVESTMENT AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COST OF MOST OF GE'S MANUFACTURING PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED

OVER ITS ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE USING AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED PRIMARILY ON

A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA.

THE COST OF GECS EQUIPMENT

LEASED TO OTHERS ON OPERATING LEASES IS AMORTIZED, PRINCIPALLY ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER THE LEASE TERM OR OVER THE

ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT. DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

USED BY GECS IS RECORDED ON EITHER A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA OR A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIVES OF THE ASSETS.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON SMALL-BALANCE RECEIVABLES REFLECTS OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO DETERMINED PRINCIPALLY ON

THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FOR OTHER RECEIVABLES, PRINCIPALLY THE

LARGER LOANS AND LEASES, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON THE

BASIS OF OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES, INCLUDING SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR

KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS. SMALL BALANCE RECEIVABLES CONSIST OF CONSUMER LOANS,

PRIMARILY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, AND CERTAIN HOMOGENEOUS LEASES AND SECURED

LOANS. LARGE BALANCE RECEIVABLES COMPRISE ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LEASES.

LOSSES ON FINANCING

RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED. MEASUREMENT OF SUCH LOSSES

REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING THE NEED TO

ADJUST FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF

RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS

DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS,

COLLATERAL VALUE, AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. FOR

LARGE BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENEOUS LOANS, THE FOLLOWING SOURCES OF VALUE ARE USED TO

DETERMINE RECOVERABILITY, AS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES: PRESENT VALUE

OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN'S EFFECTIVE INTEREST

RATE, THE LOAN'S OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE, OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL.

ALL ACCOUNTS OR PORTIONS

THEREOF THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE OR TO REQUIRE AN EXCESSIVE

COLLECTION COST ARE WRITTEN OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. SMALL-BALANCE

ACCOUNTS GENERALLY ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN SIX TO 12 MONTHS DELINQUENT, ALTHOUGH

ANY SUCH BALANCE JUDGED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, SUCH AS AN ACCOUNT IN BANKRUPTCY,

IS WRITTEN DOWN IMMEDIATELY TO ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE. LARGE-BALANCE

ACCOUNTS ARE REVIEWED AT LEAST QUARTERLY, AND THOSE ACCOUNTS WITH AMOUNTS THAT

ARE JUDGED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE.

WHEN COLLATERAL IS

REPOSSESSED IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN, THE RECEIVABLE IS WRITTEN DOWN AGAINST

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET LESS COSTS TO

SELL, TRANSFERRED TO OTHER ASSETS AND SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST

OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. THIS ACCOUNTING METHOD HAS BEEN

EMPLOYED PRINCIPALLY FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING TRANSACTIONS.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

DEBT SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE INCLUDED

IN CASH EQUIVALENTS UNLESS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CLASSIFIED AS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REPORT INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND EQUITY

SECURITIES AT OUR INSURANCE AFFILIATES, AT FAIR VALUE BASED PRIMARILY ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES OR, IF QUOTED PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS USING MARKET RATES COMMENSURATE WITH CREDIT QUALITY AND MATURITY OF THE

INVESTMENT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE

FOR SALE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY,

NET OF APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT

SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CRITERIA THAT INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH

COST EXCEEDS MARKET VALUE, THE DURATION OF THE MARKET DECLINE, AND THE FINANCIAL

HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER. UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT ARE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

INVENTORIES

ALL INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR REALIZABLE VALUES. COST

FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF GE'S U.S. INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) BASIS. COST OF OTHER GE INVENTORIES IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED ON

A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS. GECS INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

FINISHED PRODUCTS HELD FOR SALE. COST IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED ON A FIFO

BASIS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, WE COMPLETED ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

. UNDER

SFAS 142, GOODWILL IS NO LONGER AMORTIZED BUT IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A

FAIR VALUE APPROACH, AT THE "REPORTING UNIT" LEVEL. A REPORTING UNIT IS THE

OPERATING SEGMENT, OR A BUSINESS ONE LEVEL BELOW THAT OPERATING SEGMENT (THE "COMPONENT"

LEVEL) IF DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PREPARED AND REGULARLY REVIEWED BY

MANAGEMENT AT

<PAGE>

F-38

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 80

THE COMPONENT LEVEL. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR ANY AMOUNT

BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS FAIR

VALUE. WE USE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES. WHEN AVAILABLE AND

AS APPROPRIATE, WE USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW RESULTS. WHEN A BUSINESS WITHIN A REPORTING UNIT IS DISPOSED OF,

GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSITION USING THE RELATIVE FAIR

VALUE METHODOLOGY.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER

INTANGIBLES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED

INDEFINITE. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND, IF IMPAIRED, WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE BASED ON

EITHER DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AND WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AS

REQUIRED.

BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2002, WE

AMORTIZED GOODWILL OVER ITS ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS; WE AMORTIZED OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON APPROPRIATE BASES OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED LIVES. NO AMORTIZATION PERIOD EXCEEDED 40 YEARS. WHEN AN INTANGIBLE

ASSET'S CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDED ASSOCIATED EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WE

CONSIDERED IT TO BE IMPAIRED AND WROTE IT DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, WHICH WE

DETERMINED BASED ON EITHER DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES.

GECS INSURANCE ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR GECS INSURANCE BUSINESSES FOLLOW.

PREMIUM INCOME. WE

REPORT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME AS FOLLOWS.

FOR SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS (INCLUDING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY,

ACCIDENT AND HEALTH, AND FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE), WE REPORT PREMIUMS

AS EARNED INCOME, GENERALLY ON A PRO-RATA BASIS, OVER THE TERMS OF THE

RELATED AGREEMENTS. FOR RETROSPECTIVELY RATED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS, WE

RECORD PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON ESTIMATED LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES,

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH CASE AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED (IBNR)

RESERVES.

FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS (INCLUDING TERM AND

WHOLE LIFE CONTRACTS AND ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ANNUITANT),

WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME WHEN DUE.

FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS, WE REPORT PREMIUMS

RECEIVED AS LIABILITIES, NOT AS REVENUES. UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS ARE

LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT ARE NEITHER FIXED NOR

GUARANTEED; FOR THESE CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FOR ASSESSMENTS

AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDER'S ACCOUNT, MOSTLY FOR MORTALITY, CONTRACT

INITIATION, ADMINISTRATION AND SURRENDER. INVESTMENT CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS

THAT HAVE NEITHER SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY NOR SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY RISK,

INCLUDING ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR A DETERMINED PERIOD; FOR THESE CONTRACTS, WE

RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON THE ASSOCIATED INVESTMENTS AND AMOUNTS CREDITED TO

POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT OUR

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATIONS FOR REPORTED CLAIMS PLUS THOSE IBNR

AND THE RELATED ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES FOR ALL CLAIMS INCURRED

THROUGH DECEMBER 31 OF EACH YEAR. SPECIFIC RESERVES – ALSO REFERRED TO AS CASE

RESERVES – ARE ESTABLISHED FOR REPORTED CLAIMS USING CASE-BASIS EVALUATIONS OF THE

UNDERLYING CLAIM DATA AND ARE UPDATED AS FURTHER INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN. IBNR

RESERVES ARE DETERMINED USING GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACTUARIAL RESERVING TECHNIQUES

THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DATA AND, AS APPROPRIATE,

CERTAIN QUALITATIVE FACTORS. IBNR RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

CERTAIN ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT CAN BE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE LIABILITY FOR

CLAIMS OVER TIME, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE VOLUME AND MIX OF BUSINESS WRITTEN,

REVISIONS TO CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN LEGAL PRECEDENCE OR

DEVELOPED CASE LAW, TRENDS IN HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL COSTS, AND GENERAL

INFLATION LEVELS. SETTLEMENT OF COMPLEX CLAIMS ROUTINELY INVOLVES THREATENED OR

PENDING LITIGATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AS TO COVERAGE, INTERPRETATION OF

CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR FAIR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES SUFFERED. THESE

DISPUTES ARE SETTLED THROUGH NEGOTIATION, ARBITRATION OR ACTUAL LITIGATION.

RECORDED RESERVES INCORPORATE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT THAT ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF SUCH DISPUTES HAVE ON BOTH CLAIMS PAYMENTS AND RELATED SETTLEMENT

EXPENSES. LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ARE

CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED; SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENT

OPERATIONS AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES.

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS. COSTS THAT VARY WITH AND ARE PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF NEW AND RENEWAL INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS

ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE RESPECTIVE POLICY TERMS. FOR SHORT-DURATION

INSURANCE CONTRACTS, ACQUISITION COSTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMMISSIONS,

BROKERAGE EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. FOR LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS,

THESE COSTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIRST-YEAR COMMISSIONS IN EXCESS OF RECURRING

RENEWAL COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN VARIABLE SALES EXPENSES AND CERTAIN SUPPORT COSTS

SUCH AS UNDERWRITING AND POLICY ISSUE EXPENSES.

<PAGE>

F-39

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 81

FOR SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, WE AMORTIZE THESE COSTS ON A

PRO-RATA BASIS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE

EARNED.

FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, WE AMORTIZE THESE COSTS

OVER THE RESPECTIVE CONTRACT PERIODS IN PROPORTION TO EITHER ANTICIPATED

PREMIUM INCOME OR, IN THE CASE OF LIMITED-PAYMENT CONTRACTS, ESTIMATED

BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS, WE AMORTIZE THESE

COSTS ON THE BASIS OF ANTICIPATED GROSS PROFITS.

WE REVIEW DEFERRED POLICY

ACQUISITION COSTS PERIODICALLY FOR RECOVERABILITY CONSIDERING ANTICIPATED

INVESTMENT INCOME.

PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS. THE ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED PRESENT VALUE OF

ANTICIPATED NET CASH FLOWS TO BE REALIZED FROM INSURANCE, ANNUITY AND INVESTMENT

CONTRACTS IN FORCE AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION OF LIFE INSURANCE ENTERPRISES IS

RECORDED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS AND IS AMORTIZED OVER THE

RESPECTIVE POLICY TERMS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION

COSTS. WE ADJUST UNAMORTIZED BALANCES TO REFLECT EXPERIENCE AND IMPAIRMENT, IF

ANY.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

UNDER SFAS 142, GOODWILL IS NO LONGER AMORTIZED BUT IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

USING A FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY. WE STOPPED AMORTIZING GOODWILL EFFECTIVE JANUARY

1, 2002.

UNDER SFAS 142, WE WERE

REQUIRED TO TEST ALL EXISTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, ON

A REPORTING UNIT BASIS, AND RECORDED A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $1.204 BILLION ($1.015

BILLION AFTER TAX, OR $0.10 PER SHARE), WHICH WE REPORTED IN THE CAPTION "CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES." SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CHARGE RELATES TO THE

GECS IT SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND THE GECS GE AUTO AND HOME BUSINESS. FACTORS

CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WERE THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN

THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR AND HEIGHTENED PRICE COMPETITION IN THE AUTO

INSURANCE INDUSTRY. NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE HAD BEEN REQUIRED UNDER OUR PREVIOUS

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT POLICY, WHICH WAS BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

IN 2002, WE ADOPTED THE STOCK

OPTION EXPENSE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

,

RESULTING IN A $27 MILLION CHARGE TO NET EARNINGS. WE FIRST MEASURE THE TOTAL

COST OF EACH OPTION GRANT AT THE GRANT DATE, USING MARKET-BASED OPTION TRADING

MODELS. WE THEN RECOGNIZE EACH GRANT'S TOTAL COST OVER THE PERIOD THAT THE

OPTIONS VEST. UNDER THIS APPROACH, OUR 2002 OPTION GRANTS HAD A TOTAL VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, AFTER TAX; WE CHARGED $27 MILLION TO NET EARNINGS IN

2002, AND AFTER-TAX EXPENSE FROM THIS GRANT FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS WILL BE

ABOUT $80 MILLION, $50 MILLION AND $30 MILLION. A COMPARISON OF REPORTED AND

PRO-FORMA NET EARNINGS, INCLUDING EFFECTS OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS, FOLLOWS.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED

INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 45,

GUARANTOR'S ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF

OTHERS

. THE RESULTING DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR YEAR-END 2002 AND

SUCH DISCLOSURES ARE PROVIDED IN NOTES 29 AND 30. RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

PROVISIONS OF FIN 45 BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED ON OR

<PAGE>

F-40

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 82

THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT ON EARNINGS OF ADOPTING SFAS 133 COMPRISED TWO

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS. ONE ELEMENT REPRESENTED THE FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY OPTIONS

EMBEDDED IN LOANS THAT PROVIDED BOTH US AND THE BORROWER THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE

OBLIGATION, TO CONVERT THE LOANS INTO SHARES OF THE BORROWER'S STOCK. THE

SECOND ELEMENT OF THE TRANSITION EFFECT WAS A PORTION OF THE EFFECT OF MARKING

TO MARKET OPTIONS AND CURRENCY CONTRACTS USED FOR HEDGING. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT

ON SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO MARKING TO MARKET

FORWARD AND SWAP CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE VARIABLE-RATE BORROWINGS. DECREASES IN

THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINES IN INTEREST

RATES SINCE INCEPTION OF THE HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS. AS A MATTER OF POLICY, WE

ENSURE THAT, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF DERIVATIVES, LENDING AND FINANCING ASSET

POSITIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MATCHED IN CHARACTER (E.G., FIXED VS. FLOATING) AND

DURATION. AS A RESULT, DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE EFFECTIVE

DERIVATIVES ARE OFFSET BY UNRECOGNIZED GAINS ON THE RELATED FINANCING ASSETS AND

HEDGED ITEMS, AND FUTURE EARNINGS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY FROM

INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

IN NOVEMBER 2000, THE

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) OF THE FASB REACHED A CONSENSUS ON ACCOUNTING

FOR IMPAIRMENT OF RETAINED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS (EITF 99-20). UNDER THIS

CONSENSUS, IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED ASSETS MUST

BE RECOGNIZED WHEN (1) THE ASSET'S FAIR VALUE IS BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE, AND

(2) IT IS PROBABLE THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN ESTIMATED CASH

FLOWS. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTING EITF 99-20 AT JANUARY 1, 2001, WAS A

ONE-TIME REDUCTION OF NET EARNINGS OF $120 MILLION ($0.01 PER SHARE).

THESE 2001 ACCOUNTING CHANGES

DID NOT INVOLVE CASH, AND WE EXPECT THAT THEY WILL HAVE NO MORE THAN A MODEST

EFFECT ON FUTURE RESULTS.

EMPLOYEES, 171,000 FORMER EMPLOYEES WITH VESTED RIGHTS TO FUTURE BENEFITS, AND

201,000 RETIREES AND BENEFICIARIES RECEIVING BENEFITS.

GE AND GECS FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THE GECS

PROVISION FOR CURRENT TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES ITS EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED

RETURN.

CONSOLIDATED CURRENT TAX

EXPENSE INCLUDES AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES OF $137

MILLION, $2,514 MILLION AND $3,005 MILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY,

AND AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS OF $1,061 MILLION, $1,225

MILLION AND $1,246 MILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. CONSOLIDATED

DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES WAS $2,112 MILLION,

$1,455 MILLION AND $1,095 MILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES

REFLECT THE EFFECT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES AND ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX RATES

EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN TAXES ARE ACTUALLY PAID OR RECOVERED. SEE NOTE 21

FOR DETAILS.

WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S.

DEFERRED TAXES ON CUMULATIVE EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED

COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. SUCH AMOUNT RELATES TO ONGOING

OPERATIONS AND, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS APPROXIMATELY $15 BILLION. BECAUSE OF

THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE

THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS

WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR EARNINGS OF

NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES WHEN WE PLAN TO REMIT THOSE

EARNINGS.

CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME

BEFORE TAXES AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES WAS $12.0 BILLION

IN 2002, $13.9 BILLION IN 2001 AND $12.9 BILLION IN 2000. THE CORRESPONDING

AMOUNTS FOR NON-U.S.-BASED OPERATIONS WERE $6.9 BILLION IN 2002, $5.8 BILLION IN

DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES OF AIRCRAFT, RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK,

AUTOS, OTHER TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT AND MEDICAL

EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS OTHER MANUFACTURING, POWER GENERATION, COMMERCIAL REAL

TAXED ON TOTAL LEASE PAYMENTS RECEIVED AND IS ENTITLED TO TAX DEDUCTIONS BASED

ON THE COST OF LEASED ASSETS AND TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR INTEREST PAID TO THIRD-PARTY

PARTICIPANTS. GECS IS GENERALLY ENTITLED TO ANY RESIDUAL VALUE OF LEASED ASSETS.

INVESTMENT IN DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED

LEASES REPRESENTS NET UNPAID RENTALS AND ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES

OF LEASED EQUIPMENT, LESS RELATED DEFERRED INCOME. GECS HAS NO GENERAL

OBLIGATION FOR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS

LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS TAKES THE FORM OF VARIOUS LENDING ARRANGEMENTS THAT

ARE NONRECOURSE TO GECS AND ARE SECURED BY BOTH THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE LEASES

AND THE AMOUNTS OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS RECEIVABLE. SINCE THIS THIRD-PARTY DEBT

IS NONRECOURSE TO GECS, THE RELATED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS DEDUCTED FROM THE

(A)  EXTENDIBLE NOTES AMOUNTING TO $12 BILLION ARE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES WITH

AN INITIAL MATURITY OF 13 MONTHS, WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED ON A ROLLING BASIS

AT THE INVESTOR'S OPTION TO A FINAL MATURITY OF FIVE YEARS ENDING IN 2007.

COMMITTED CREDIT LINES TOTALING $54.1 BILLION HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO US BY 90

BANKS AT YEAR-END 2002. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WAS $47.0 BILLION PROVIDED

DIRECTLY TO GECS AND $7.1 BILLION PROVIDED BY 21 BANKS TO GE TO WHICH GECS ALSO

HAS ACCESS. THE GECS LINES INCLUDE $19.2 BILLION OF REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS

UNDER WHICH WE CAN BORROW FUNDS FOR PERIODS EXCEEDING ONE YEAR. WE PAY BANKS FOR

CREDIT FACILITIES, BUT COMPENSATION AMOUNTS WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN EACH OF THE

PAST THREE YEARS.

INTEREST RATE RISK IS MANAGED IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED BEHAVIOR, INCLUDING

PREPAYMENT BEHAVIOR, OF ASSETS IN WHICH DEBT PROCEEDS ARE INVESTED. A VARIETY OF

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS AND CURRENCY FORWARDS,

ARE EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE OUR INTEREST RATE OBJECTIVES. EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES

ARE LOWER UNDER THESE "SYNTHETIC" POSITIONS THAN COULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY

ISSUING DEBT DIRECTLY.

METHOD USING ESTIMATED YIELDS GENERALLY RANGING FROM 1.5% TO 8.5% IN 2002

AND 2% TO 9% IN 2001.

(B)  PRINCIPALLY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RESERVES AMOUNTING TO $26.1 BILLION AND

$23.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDES AMOUNTS

FOR BOTH REPORTED AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED CLAIMS, REDUCED BY

ANTICIPATED SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION RECOVERIES. ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES

ARE REVIEWED AND UPDATED CONTINUALLY, WITH CHANGES IN ESTIMATED LOSSES

REFLECTED IN OPERATIONS.

WHEN INSURANCE AFFILIATES CEDE INSURANCE TO THIRD PARTIES, THEY ARE NOT

RELIEVED OF THEIR PRIMARY OBLIGATION TO POLICYHOLDERS. LOSSES ON CEDED RISKS

GIVE RISE TO CLAIMS FOR RECOVERY; WE ESTABLISH ALLOWANCES FOR PROBABLE LOSSES ON

SUCH RECEIVABLES FROM REINSURERS AS REQUIRED.

WE RECOGNIZE REINSURANCE

RECOVERIES AS A REDUCTION OF INSURANCE LOSSES AND POLICYHOLDER AND ANNUITY

BENEFITS. INSURANCE RECOVERIES WERE $2,234 MILLION, $5,863 MILLION AND $3,232

MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INSURANCE LIABILITY FOR

UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES RELATED TO POLICIES THAT MAY COVER

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS EXPOSURES IS BASED ON KNOWN FACTS AND AN ASSESSMENT

OF APPLICABLE LAW AND COVERAGE LITIGATION. LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR BOTH

KNOWN AND UNASSERTED CLAIMS (INCLUDING THE COST OF RELATED LITIGATION) WHEN

SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO INDICATE THAT A CLAIM HAS BEEN

INCURRED AND A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DEVELOPED

CASE LAW AND ADEQUATE CLAIM HISTORY DO NOT EXIST FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY

DUE TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AS TO BOTH THE LEVEL OF ULTIMATE LOSSES THAT

WILL OCCUR AND WHAT PORTION, IF ANY, WILL BE DEEMED TO BE INSURED AMOUNTS.

AFFECTING UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, PRINCIPALLY IN PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY LINES, FOLLOWS.

4% AND 4% OF BEGINNING OF YEAR NET LOSS RESERVES IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY, WAS PRIMARILY ENCOUNTERED AT GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING (ERC),

WHERE WE EXPERIENCED A SHIFT FROM PROPERTY TO LIABILITY INSURANCE LOSSES. IN

2000, ERC EXPERIENCED ITS SHARE OF AN INCREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE LOSS ESTIMATES

RELATED TO CERTAIN LARGE PROPERTY LOSS EVENTS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH RESULTED

FROM THE EUROPEAN WINDSTORMS OF DECEMBER 1999. IN 2001, WE BEGAN TO IDENTIFY AN

ACCELERATION OF REPORTED CLAIMS ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN LIABILITY-RELATED COVERAGES –

SPECIFICALLY, HOSPITAL LIABILITY, NON-STANDARD AUTO (AUTOMOBILE

INSURANCE EXTENDED TO HIGHER-RISK DRIVERS) AND COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC ENTITY

GENERAL LIABILITY LINES OF BUSINESS – AND RECOGNIZED THE INCREASE IN PROJECTED

ULTIMATE LOSSES. DURING 2002, REPORTED CLAIMS ACTIVITY ACCELERATED DRAMATICALLY,

AFFECTING MUCH OF OUR LIABILITY-RELATED INSURANCE WRITTEN IN 1997 THROUGH 2001.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR NORMAL ACTUARIAL UPDATES, WE ADJUSTED OUR BEST ESTIMATE

OF ULTIMATE LOSSES TO REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCE, INCREASING RECORDED RESERVES BY

$2.5 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, FOR A TOTAL OF $3.5 BILLION ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENT IN ERC FOR THE YEAR. OUR MORTGAGE INSURANCE BUSINESS EXPERIENCED

FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT DURING THIS PERIOD, REFLECTING CONTINUED STRENGTH IN

CERTAIN REAL ESTATE MARKETS AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR LOSS CONTAINMENT INITIATIVES.

CERTAIN INSURANCE AFFILIATES OFFER INSURANCE GUARANTEEING THE TIMELY PAYMENT

OF SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON MUNICIPAL BONDS AND CERTAIN ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES. THESE INSURANCE AFFILIATES ALSO PROVIDE INSURANCE TO PROTECT

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDERS FROM SEVERE FINANCIAL LOSS CAUSED BY THE

NON-PAYMENT OF LOANS AND ISSUE CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE DESIGNED TO PAY THE BALANCE

DUE ON A LOAN IF THE BORROWER DIES BEFORE THE LOAN IS REPAID. AS PART OF THEIR

OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, INSURANCE AFFILIATES CEDE TO THIRD PARTIES A

PORTION OF THEIR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES. IN DOING SO, THEY ARE

NOT RELIEVED OF THEIR PRIMARY OBLIGATION TO POLICYHOLDERS.

ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES NONCURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT ACCRUALS AT

YEAR-END 2002 AND 2001 OF $8,826 MILLION AND $8,745 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALSO

INCLUDED ARE AMOUNTS FOR DEFERRED INCOME, INTEREST ON TAX LIABILITIES, PRODUCT

WARRANTIES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS

REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT EACH SITE ARE BASED ON OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE COSTS, EXCLUDING POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERIES.

WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD,

LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOWER END OF SUCH RANGE. UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE

STATUS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL

SITES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE REASONABLY

POSSIBLE AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION EXPOSURE. HOWEVER, EVEN IN THE

UNLIKELY EVENT THAT REMEDIATION COSTS AMOUNTED TO THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF

COSTS FOR EACH SITE, THE RESULTING ADDITIONAL LIABILITY WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO

OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

BASIS FOR PRESENTATION

OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES ARE ORGANIZED BASED ON THE NATURE OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES PROVIDED. CERTAIN BUSINESSES DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A REPORTABLE

OPERATING SEGMENT AND HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED. THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS

SEGMENT CONSISTS OF INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS, TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND GE SUPPLY.

THE MATERIALS SEGMENT CONSISTS OF PLASTICS AND SPECIALTY MATERIALS. THE

TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SEGMENT CONSISTS OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND GLOBAL

EXCHANGE SERVICES, 90% OF WHICH WAS SOLD IN 2002. SEGMENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ARE THE SAME AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1.

A DESCRIPTION OF OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 108-109 AND DETAILS OF SEGMENT PROFIT

BY OPERATING SEGMENT CAN BE FOUND ON PAGE 57 OF THIS REPORT.

NOTE 28

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ROUTINELY DEAL WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST

RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY AND OTHER ASSET PRICES. WE APPLY

STRICT POLICIES TO MANAGING EACH OF THESE RISKS, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS ON

DERIVATIVES TRADING, DERIVATIVES MARKET-MAKING OR OTHER SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES.

THESE POLICIES REQUIRE THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN CONCERT WITH OTHER

TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THESE RISKS.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

UNDER SFAS 133, CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE HEDGES THAT USE SIMPLE DERIVATIVES TO

OFFSET THE VARIABILITY OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. VARIABILITY CAN APPEAR IN

FLOATING RATE ASSETS, FLOATING RATE LIABILITIES OR FROM CERTAIN TYPES OF

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, AND CAN ARISE FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOR EXAMPLE, GECS OFTEN BORROWS AT A VARIABLE RATE OF

INTEREST TO FUND OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. IF COMMERCIAL FINANCE NEEDS

THE FUNDS TO MAKE A FLOATING RATE LOAN, THERE IS NO EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

CHANGES, AND NO HEDGE IS NECESSARY. HOWEVER, IF A FIXED RATE LOAN IS MADE, WE

WILL CONTRACTUALLY COMMIT TO PAY A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST TO A COUNTERPARTY WHO

WILL PAY US A VARIABLE RATE OF INTEREST (AN "INTEREST RATE SWAP"). THIS SWAP

WILL THEN BE DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE OF THE ASSOCIATED VARIABLE RATE

BORROWING. IF, AS WOULD BE EXPECTED, THE DERIVATIVE IS PERFECTLY EFFECTIVE IN

OFFSETTING VARIABLE INTEREST IN THE BORROWING, CHANGES IN ITS FAIR VALUE ARE

RECORDED IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT IN EQUITY AND RELEASED TO EARNINGS

CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS PROVIDED ON PAGE 103.

WE USE CURRENCY FORWARDS AND

OPTIONS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ASSOCIATED

WITH COMMERCIAL PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS. THESE INSTRUMENTS PERMIT US TO

ELIMINATE THE CASH FLOW VARIABILITY, IN LOCAL CURRENCY, OF COSTS OR SELLING

PRICES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. IN

ADDITION, WE USE THESE INSTRUMENTS, ALONG WITH INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS,

TO OPTIMIZE BORROWING COSTS AND INVESTMENT RETURNS. FOR EXAMPLE, CURRENCY SWAPS

AND NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY BORROWINGS TOGETHER PROVIDE LOWER FUNDING COSTS THAN

COULD BE ACHIEVED BY ISSUING DEBT DIRECTLY IN A GIVEN CURRENCY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AMOUNTS

RELATED TO DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AMOUNTED TO A REDUCTION OF

EQUITY OF $2,112 MILLION, OF WHICH $519 MILLION WAS EXPECTED TO BE TRANSFERRED

TO EARNINGS IN 2003 ALONG WITH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE RELATED FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS. IN 2002, THERE WERE NO FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THAT FAILED TO

OCCUR. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE MAXIMUM TERM OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT

HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS WAS 24 MONTHS.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

UNDER SFAS 133, FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE HEDGES THAT ELIMINATE THE RISK OF

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN TYPES OF FIRM

COMMITMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WILL USE AN INTEREST RATE SWAP IN WHICH WE RECEIVE

A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST AND PAY A VARIABLE RATE OF INTEREST TO CHANGE THE CASH

FLOW PROFILE OF A FIXED RATE BORROWING TO MATCH THE VARIABLE RATE FINANCIAL

ASSET THAT IT IS FUNDING. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AND

EFFECTIVE AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS AND ARE OFFSET BY

CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

WE USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

CURRENCY SWAPS AND INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FORWARDS TO HEDGE THE EFFECT OF

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON LOCAL AND NONFUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIXED RATE BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN TYPES OF FIXED RATE

ASSETS. EQUITY OPTIONS ARE USED TO HEDGE PRICE CHANGES IN INVESTMENT SECURITIES

AND EQUITY-INDEXED ANNUITY LIABILITIES AT INSURANCE.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE DESIGNATION UNDER SFAS 133 REFERS TO THE USE OF

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS OR CASH INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE

OF A NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION. WE MANAGE CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT

RESULT FROM NET INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES PRINCIPALLY BY FUNDING ASSETS

DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCY WITH DEBT DENOMINATED IN THAT SAME CURRENCY. IN

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES WITH CURRENCY FORWARDS AND

CURRENCY SWAPS.

<PAGE>

F-61

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 103

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

SFAS 133 SPECIFIES CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO APPLY ANY OF THE

THREE FORMS OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR EXAMPLE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT PERMITTED

FOR HEDGED ITEMS THAT ARE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVES

TO HEDGE EXPOSURES WHEN IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE TO DO SO, INCLUDING

CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING AS DESCRIBED BELOW. WE ALSO WILL OCCASIONALLY RECEIVE DERIVATIVES,

SUCH AS EQUITY WARRANTS, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. UNDER SFAS 133,

DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET

THROUGH EARNINGS.

WE USE OPTION CONTRACTS,

INCLUDING CAPS, FLOORS AND COLLARS, AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND EQUITY PRICES ON CERTAIN TYPES OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, INSURANCE USES EQUITY OPTIONS TO HEDGE THE RISK OF

CHANGES IN EQUITY PRICES EMBEDDED IN LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ANNUITY

CONTRACTS IT WRITES. WE ALSO USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, PURCHASED OPTIONS AND

FUTURES AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS. WE

OCCASIONALLY OBTAIN EQUITY WARRANTS AS PART OF SOURCING OR FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DERIVATIVES UNDER

SFAS 133, THEIR ECONOMIC RISK IS SIMILAR TO, AND MANAGED ON THE SAME BASIS AS,

OTHER EQUITY INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD.

EARNINGS EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVES

THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE EARNINGS

EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVES. IN THE CONTEXT OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS, "EFFECTIVENESS"

REFERS TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT

OFFSET THE CORRESPONDING EXPECTED EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. CERTAIN

ELEMENTS OF HEDGE POSITIONS CANNOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS 133

WHETHER EFFECTIVE OR NOT, AND MUST THEREFORE BE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH

EARNINGS. TIME VALUE OF PURCHASED OPTIONS IS THE MOST COMMON EXAMPLE OF SUCH

ELEMENTS IN INSTRUMENTS WE USE. PRE-TAX EARNINGS EFFECTS OF SUCH ITEMS ARE SHOWN

IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE AS "AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS."

================================================================================

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WILL BE FINANCIALLY

UNABLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS IS

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. WE MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ON AN INDIVIDUAL

COUNTERPARTY BASIS, WHICH MEANS THAT WE NET GAINS AND LOSSES FOR EACH

COUNTERPARTY TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT AT RISK. WHEN A COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS CREDIT

EXPOSURE LIMITS IN TERMS OF AMOUNTS THEY OWE US (SEE TABLE BELOW), TYPICALLY AS

A RESULT OF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, NO ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS ARE

PERMITTED TO BE EXECUTED UNTIL THE EXPOSURE WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY IS REDUCED TO

AN AMOUNT THAT IS WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED LIMIT. ALL SWAPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE

EXECUTED UNDER MASTER SWAP AGREEMENTS CONTAINING MUTUAL CREDIT DOWNGRADE

PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE ASSIGNMENT OR TERMINATION IN THE

EVENT EITHER PARTY IS DOWNGRADED BELOW A3 OR A-. IF THE DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS HAD

BEEN TRIGGERED AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WE COULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO DISBURSE UP

TO $4.0 BILLION AND COULD HAVE CLAIMED $1.9 BILLION FROM COUNTERPARTIES--THE NET

FAIR VALUE LOSSES AND GAINS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, GROSS FAIR VALUE

GAINS AMOUNTED TO $5.0 BILLION AND $3.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2002 AND 2001, GROSS FAIR VALUE LOSSES AMOUNTED TO $7.1 BILLION AND $5.4

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS PART OF ITS ONGOING

ACTIVITIES, OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES ENTER INTO SWAPS THAT ARE

INTEGRATED INTO INVESTMENTS IN OR LOANS TO PARTICULAR CUSTOMERS. SUCH INTEGRATED

SWAPS NOT INVOLVING ASSUMPTION OF THIRD-PARTY CREDIT RISK ARE EVALUATED AND

MONITORED LIKE THEIR ASSOCIATED INVESTMENTS OR LOANS AND ARE THEREFORE NOT

SUBJECT TO THE SAME CREDIT CRITERIA THAT WOULD APPLY TO A STAND-ALONE POSITION.

EXCEPT FOR SUCH POSITIONS, ALL OTHER SWAPS, PURCHASED OPTIONS AND FORWARDS WITH

CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES LONGER THAN ONE YEAR ARE CONDUCTED WITHIN THE CREDIT

POLICY CONSTRAINTS PROVIDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS WITH

NON-CONTROLLED ENTITIES

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) ARE SPONSORED AND USED BY GE IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS, MOST COMMONLY FOR ASSET SECURITIZATION. THE TYPICAL

ENTITIES FINANCED WITH COMMERCIAL PAPER. OFTEN, WE PROVIDE CREDIT SUPPORT FOR

CERTAIN OF THESE ASSETS AS WELL AS LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE COMMERCIAL PAPER.

AND ALL BUT $416 MILLION OF OTHER ASSETS.

IN ADDITION TO THE ACTIVITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE

COMPANY (FGIC), A CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE IN THE INSURANCE SEGMENT, USES SPES

THAT OFFER MUNICIPALITIES GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS WITH INTERESTS IN

HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED MATURITY, INVESTMENT GRADE ASSETS. FGIC ACTIVELY MANAGES

THESE ASSETS UNDER STRICT INVESTMENT CRITERIA AND WE ALSO PROVIDE CERTAIN

CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE AGREED TO LEND TO THESE

ENTITIES ON A SECURED BASIS IF (A) CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS RENDER THE

ENTITIES UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW DEBT INSTRUMENTS, OR (B) THE CREDIT RATINGS OF

DEBT ISSUED BY SUCH ENTITIES WERE REDUCED BELOW SPECIFIED LEVELS. TIMING OF

SUCH LIQUIDITY SUPPORT DEPENDS ON THE ASSOCIATED MATURITIES OF SUPPORTED

DEBT. WE REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AGREEMENTS BY OBTAINING

OFFSETTING SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY BANKS. SUCH OFFSETTING SUPPORT AMOUNTED

TO $11.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. WE ALSO PROVIDE CREDIT SUPPORT FOR

CREDIT LOSSES ON CERTAIN ASSETS: FULL RECOURSE FOR $9.7 BILLION AND THE

REMAINING $7.2 BILLION BASED ON LOSS-SHARING FORMULAE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THIS SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ASSETS BUT GENERALLY AMORTIZES

IN PROPORTION TO THE ASSETS OUTSTANDING. ASSETS WITH CREDIT SUPPORT ARE

PRIMARILY FUNDED BY COMMERCIAL PAPER THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE LIQUIDITY

SUPPORT.

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES. WE PROVIDE BOTH LETTERS OF CREDIT AND LINES OF

CREDIT FOR GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT MAY BE

DRAWN UPON OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT OR A PROGRAM EVENT OF DEFAULT, WHICH

INCLUDES A DOWNGRADE OF THE SPE OR FAILURE TO PAY THE SPE'S SECURED

OBLIGATIONS. THE LINES OF CREDIT ENABLE THE SPES TO PAY ALL AMOUNTS OWED

UNDER INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS, HEDGE CONTRACTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS ON PREFERRED

SECURITIES.

GUARANTEE AND REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS. WE PROVIDE PROTECTION TO CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS ENTERED INTO BY SPES RELATED TO

CHANGES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMERCIAL PAPER INTEREST RATES AND THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT STREAMS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE

PROTECTION FOR THE LIFE OF THE ASSETS HELD BY THE SPE BUT GENERALLY AMORTIZE

IN PROPORTION TO THE ASSETS OUTSTANDING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED

LIABILITY IS $26 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2002.

WE EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC,

LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THE ABOVE SPES AND SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS

AND BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS COULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. WE RECORD LIABILITIES, AS DISCLOSED ABOVE, FOR SUCH

GUARANTEES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES.

SALES OF SECURITIZED ASSETS

TO SPES RESULT IN A GAIN OR LOSS AMOUNTING TO THE NET OF SALES PROCEEDS, THE

RETAINED INTERESTS. WHEN WE SECURITIZE RECEIVABLES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO

RECOGNIZE OUR RETAINED INTERESTS, WHICH REPRESENT OUR RIGHTS TO EXPECTED NET

FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. RETAINED INTERESTS GENERALLY

APPROXIMATE THE GAIN RECOGNIZED, AND ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO CREDIT,

PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE RISKS.

SERVICING ASSETS. FOLLOWING A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION, WE RETAIN THE

RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVICING THE RECEIVABLES, AND, AS SUCH, ARE ENTITLED TO

RECEIVE AN ONGOING FEE BASED ON THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCES OF THE

RECEIVABLES. SERVICING ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE LOANS. THEIR VALUE IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT, PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST

RATE RISK.

RECOURSE LIABILITY. AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, UNDER CREDIT SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS WE PROVIDE RECOURSE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN SPES. WE PROVIDE FOR

EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS APPROXIMATE

FAIR VALUE.

AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 105 RELATE TO SPES THAT ARE

SPONSORED OR SUPPORTED BY US; AMOUNTS RELATED TO OTHER SECURITIZATIONS

TOTALED $1,346 MILLION AND $1,345 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER NON-CONTROLLED ENTITIES. WE ALSO HAVE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATED

COMPANIES FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE VARYING DEGREES OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND ARE

ENTITLED TO A SHARE IN THE RESULTS OF THE ENTITIES' ACTIVITIES. WHILE ALL OF

THESE ENTITIES ARE SUBSTANTIVE OPERATING COMPANIES, SOME MAY NEED TO BE

EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION UNDER FIN 46. THE TYPES OF SUPPORT WE

TYPICALLY PROVIDE TO THESE ENTITIES CONSIST OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, SUCH AS DEBT

GUARANTEES, TAKE-OR-PAY CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS,

AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS.

NOTE 30

COMMITMENTS AND PRODUCT WARRANTIES

COMMITMENTS

IN OUR AIRCRAFT ENGINES BUSINESS, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL

ASSISTANCE ON FUTURE SALES OF AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH OUR ENGINES, TOTALING $1.6

BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002. IN ADDITION, OUR COMMERCIAL FINANCE BUSINESS HAD

PLACED MULTI-YEAR ORDERS FOR VARIOUS BOEING, AIRBUS AND OTHER AIRCRAFT WITH LIST

PRICES APPROXIMATING $15.4 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002.

AT YEAR-END 2002, WE WERE

COMMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS BEYOND THOSE PROVIDED ON

BEHALF OF SPES (SEE NOTE 29).

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT. LIQUIDITY SUPPORT PROVIDED

TO HOLDERS OF CERTAIN VARIABLE RATE BONDS ISSUED BY MUNICIPALITIES AMOUNTED TO

$4.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. IF HOLDERS ELECT TO SELL SUPPORTED BONDS THAT

CANNOT BE REMARKETED, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE THEM AT PAR. IF CALLED

UPON, OUR POSITION WOULD BE SECURED BY THE REPURCHASED BONDS. WHILE WE HOLD ANY

SUCH BONDS, WE WOULD RECEIVE INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM THE MUNICIPALITIES AT A RATE

THAT IS IN EXCESS OF THE STATED RATE ON THE BOND. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN

REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS.

CREDIT SUPPORT. WE HAVE PROVIDED $4.2 BILLION OF CREDIT SUPPORT ON BEHALF

OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OR ASSOCIATED COMPANIES, PREDOMINANTLY JOINT VENTURES

AND PARTNERSHIPS, USING ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS AND

ASSOCIATED COMPANIES TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS OR OBTAIN DESIRED FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. SHOULD THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY

FAIL TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT,

WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THEIR BEHALF. UNDER MOST SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS, OUR GUARANTEE IS SECURED, USUALLY BY THE ASSET BEING PURCHASED

OR FINANCED BUT POSSIBLY BY TOTAL ASSETS OF THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED

COMPANY. THE LENGTH OF THESE CREDIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS PARALLELS THE

LENGTH OF THE RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS. THE LIABILITY

FOR SUCH CREDIT SUPPORT WAS $51 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS. THESE ARE AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO FUND

UP TO $1.3 BILLION UNDER RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES ON A VARIETY OF LEASED

EQUIPMENT AND $0.2 BILLION OF OTHER INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS ARISING FROM

SALES OF BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. UNDER MOST OF OUR RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES,

OUR COMMITMENT IS SECURED BY THE LEASED ASSET AT TERMINATION OF THE LEASE.

THE LIABILITY FOR INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WAS $64 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002.

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. THESE ARE AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

CONSIDERATION IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO THE SELLER IF CONTRACTUALLY

SPECIFIED CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE ACQUIRED ENTITY ARE ACHIEVED. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, WE HAD RECOGNIZED LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED PAYMENTS

AMOUNTING TO $72 MILLION OF OUR EXPOSURE OF $0.3 BILLION.

OUR GUARANTEES ARE PROVIDED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE UNDERWRITE

THESE GUARANTEES CONSIDERING ECONOMIC, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK OF THE

COUNTERPARTY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. WE RECORD LIABILITIES, AS DISCLOSED ABOVE,

FOR SUCH GUARANTEES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES, WHICH

CONSIDERS AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE UNDER RECOURSE PROVISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, AT

YEAR-END 2002, THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT SECURING OUR AIRLINE INDUSTRY

GUARANTEES EXCEEDED THE GUARANTEED AMOUNTS, NET OF THE ASSOCIATED ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES.
