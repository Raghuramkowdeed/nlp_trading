SIGNIFICANT TRENDS & DEVELOPMENTS



ON AUGUST 1, 2013, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE AVIATION BUSINESS OF AVIO, A MANUFACTURER OF AVIATION PROPULSION COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS FOR $4.4 BILLION.



WE EXPECT MILITARY SHIPMENTS TO BE LOWER DUE TO CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE U.S. MILITARY BUDGET.



THE INSTALLED BASE CONTINUES TO GROW WITH NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES.



LOWER FUEL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN INCREASED AIRLINE PROFITABILITY AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN PASSENGER TRAFFIC AND FREIGHT.



REVENUE SHARING PROGRAMS ARE A STANDARD FORM OF COOPERATION FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCT PROGRAMS IN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY. THESE PROGRAMS ARE CONTROLLED BY AVIATION, BUT COUNTERPARTIES (WITH INTERESTS RANGING FROM 1% TO 39%) HAVE AN AGREED SHARE OF REVENUES AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT AND COMPONENT PRODUCTION RESPONSIBILITIES.

SIGNIFICANT TRENDS & DEVELOPMENTS

ENDING NET INVESTMENT

WE HAVE COMMUNICATED OUR GOAL OF REDUCING GE CAPITAL'S ENI, EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY, MOST RECENTLY TARGETING A BALANCE OF LESS THAN $300 BILLION. ENI IS A METRIC USED BY US TO MEASURE THE TOTAL CAPITAL WE HAVE INVESTED IN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. GE CAPITAL'S ENI (EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY) WAS $363 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE ARE MORE AGGRESSIVELY FOCUSING OUR BUSINESSES ON SELECTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS WHERE WE HAVE DEEP DOMAIN EXPERIENCE, BROAD DISTRIBUTION, THE ABILITY TO EARN A CONSISTENT RETURN ON CAPITAL AND ARE COMPETITIVELY ADVANTAGED, WHILE MANAGING OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET SIZE AND RISK. WE HAVE A STRATEGY OF EXITING THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE NON-STRATEGIC OR THAT ARE UNDERPERFORMING. WE HAVE COMPLETED A NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS IN OUR BUSINESSES IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPTIONS GOING FORWARD.

ACCORDINGLY, IN THE SHORT-TERM, AS WE REDUCE OUR ENI THROUGH EXITING NON-CORE BUSINESSES, THE OVERALL LEVEL OF OUR NET EARNINGS MAY BE REDUCED, WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD INCLUDE IMPAIRMENTS, RESTRUCTURINGS AND OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES. HOWEVER, OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS STRATEGY WILL IMPROVE OUR LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE THROUGH HIGHER RETURNS AS WE WILL HAVE A LARGER CONCENTRATION OF ASSETS IN OUR CORE BUSINESSES, AS OPPOSED TO THE UNDERPERFORMING OR NON-STRATEGIC ASSETS WE WILL BE EXITING; REDUCE LIQUIDITY RISK AS WE PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING DEBT AND DIVERSIFY OUR SOURCES OF FUNDING (WITH LESS RELIANCE ON THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS AND AN INCREASE IN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING SUCH AS DEPOSITS); AND REDUCE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHILE STRENGTHENING CAPITAL RATIOS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR LIQUIDITY AND HOW WE MANAGE THIS RISK CAN BE FOUND IN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

THE ACTIONS BELOW ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGY OF REDUCING GECC ENI AND INVESTING IN OUR CORE BUSINESSES.

SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL

– ON AUGUST 5, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL FINANCE BUSINESS, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL, AS A FIRST STEP IN A PLANNED, STAGED EXIT FROM THAT BUSINESS. SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL CLOSED THE IPO OF 125 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE TO THE PUBLIC OF $23.00 PER SHARE AND ON SEPTEMBER 3, 2014, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 3.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO AN OPTION GRANTED TO THE UNDERWRITERS IN THE IPO (UNDERWRITERS' OPTION). WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM THE IPO AND THE UNDERWRITERS' OPTION OF $2.8 BILLION, WHICH REMAIN AT SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL. FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE IPO AND THE UNDERWRITERS' OPTION, WE CURRENTLY OWN APPROXIMATELY 85% OF SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL AND AS A RESULT, GECC CONTINUES TO CONSOLIDATE THE BUSINESS. THE 15% IS PRESENTED AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. IN ADDITION, IN AUGUST 2014, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $3.6 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT WITH MATURITIES UP TO 10 YEARS AND $8.0 BILLION OF UNSECURED TERM LOANS MATURING IN 2019,

WE ARE TARGETING TO COMPLETE OUR EXIT FROM SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL THROUGH A SPLIT-OFF TRANSACTION, BY MAKING A TAX-FREE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR REMAINING INTEREST IN SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL TO ELECTING GE STOCKHOLDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF GE'S COMMON STOCK. THE SPLIT-OFF TRANSACTION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO OBTAINING REQUIRED BANK REGULATORY APPROVALS. WE MAY ALSO DECIDE TO EXIT BY SELLING OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTING OR DISPOSING OF ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR REMAINING INTEREST IN THE SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL SHARES.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES

INTEREST ON BORROWINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES AMOUNTED TO $9.5 BILLION, $10.1 BILLION AND $12.4 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR BORROWINGS ARE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHERE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $8.4 BILLION, $9.3 BILLION AND $11.6 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. GECC AVERAGE BORROWINGS DECLINED FROM 2013 TO 2014 AND FROM 2012 TO 2013, IN LINE WITH CHANGES IN AVERAGE GECC ASSETS. INTEREST RATES HAVE DECREASED OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINING GLOBAL BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES. GECC AVERAGE BORROWINGS WERE $364.4 BILLION, $379.5 BILLION AND $420.0 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE GECC AVERAGE COMPOSITE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE WAS 2.3% IN 2014, 2.4% IN 2013 AND 2.8% IN 2012. IN 2014, GECC AVERAGE ASSETS OF $507.2 BILLION WERE 3.0% LOWER THAN IN 2013, WHICH IN TURN WERE 7% LOWER THAN IN 2012. SEE THE "LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS" SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF LIQUIDITY, BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS COSTS WERE $4.8 BILLION, $6.0 BILLION AND $5.5 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. COSTS DECREASED IN 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES (PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS' DISCOUNT RATE INCREASED FROM 3.96% AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 TO 4.85% AT DECEMBER 31, 2013) AND LOWER LOSS AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EXPECTED INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS. COSTS INCREASED IN 2013 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUED AMORTIZATION OF 2008 INVESTMENT LOSSES AND THE EFFECTS OF LOWER DISCOUNT RATES (PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS' DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED FROM 4.21% AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 TO 3.96% AT DECEMBER 31, 2012).

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE ACTUARIAL MODELS THAT MEASURE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THEIR RELATED EFFECTS ON OPERATIONS.



OUR DISCOUNT RATE FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS 4.02%, WHICH REFLECTED CURRENT INTEREST RATES.



THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RECENTLY ISSUED NEW MORTALITY TABLES PROJECTING LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES THAT WILL RESULT IN HIGHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR U.S. COMPANIES. WE UPDATED OUR MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED PRINCIPAL POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $4.6 BILLION AT YEAR END.



CONSIDERING THE CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF ASSETS IN WHICH OUR PLANS ARE INVESTED, WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL BE 7.5% FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2015, COMPARED TO 7.5% IN 2014 AND 8.0% IN BOTH 2013 AND 2012.

GAAP PROVIDES FOR RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSUMED AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES. SEE THE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES" SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

WE EXPECT THE COSTS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS TO INCREASE IN 2015 BY APPROXIMATELY $0.6 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2014, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF LOWER DISCOUNT RATES AND NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LOSS AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS.

OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE SERVICE COST AND PRIOR SERVICE COST AMORTIZATION FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AS THESE COSTS REPRESENT EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE SERVICE. OPERATING EARNINGS EXCLUDE NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS/INCOME SUCH AS INTEREST COST, EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND NON-CASH AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES. WE EXPECT OPERATING PENSION COSTS FOR THESE PLANS WILL BE ABOUT $1.7 BILLION IN 2015. THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN OPERATING PENSION COSTS IS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO THE EFFECTS OF LOWER DISCOUNT RATES AND NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS.

THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED BY $15.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2014 AS COMPARED TO $4.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN, WHICH IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (PBO) OF $6.6 BILLION AND $5.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. OUR UNDERFUNDING AT YEAR-END 2014 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED TO 2013 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISCOUNT RATES AND NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS. THE DECREASE IN OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS' DISCOUNT RATE INCREASED THE PBO AT YEAR-END 2014 BY APPROXIMATELY $7.7 BILLION. THE NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED OUR PBO BY APPROXIMATELY $4.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. OUR GE PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE $48.3 BILLION AT THE END OF BOTH 2014 AND 2013 AS 2014 INVESTMENT RETURNS AND PARTICIPANT CONTRIBUTIONS WERE OFFSET BY BENEFIT PAYMENTS MADE DURING THE YEAR. ASSETS OF THE GE PENSION PLAN ARE HELD IN TRUST, SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL COMPANY OPERATIONS.

IN AUGUST 2014, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE "HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT "(HATFA), WHICH CONTAINED PROVISIONS THAT CHANGED THE INTEREST RATE METHODOLOGY USED TO CALCULATE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. THIS CHANGE REDUCED OUR NEAR-TERM ANNUAL CASH FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GE PENSION PLAN. WE DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN EITHER 2014 OR 2013. ON AN ERISA BASIS, OUR PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE IS THAT THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS APPROXIMATELY 104% FUNDED AT JANUARY 1, 2015. THE ERISA FUNDED STATUS IS HIGHER THAN THE GAAP FUNDED STATUS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ERISA PRESCRIBED INTEREST RATE IN HATFA IS CALCULATED USING AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE. AS A RESULT, THE ERISA INTEREST RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE YEAR-END GAAP DISCOUNT RATE. THE HIGHER ERISA INTEREST RATE LOWERS PENSION LIABILITIES FOR ERISA FUNDING PURPOSES. OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE PROJECTS THAT WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE MINIMUM PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2015 OR 2016.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS FOR OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS WAS $3.2 BILLION LESS THAN THE RESPECTIVE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WAS $2.5 BILLION. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER DISCOUNT RATES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTMENT RETURNS. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.5 BILLION TO OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2015, AS COMPARED TO $0.7 BILLION IN BOTH 2014 AND 2013.

THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE PLANS WAS $9.9 BILLION AND $9.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF LOWER DISCOUNT RATES (RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE PLANS' DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED FROM 4.61% AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 TO 3.89% AT DECEMBER 31, 2014) AND NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN AMENDMENT TO OUR POST-65 RETIREE HEALTH COVERAGE. WE FUND OUR RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.5 BILLION TO THESE PLANS IN 2015 COMPARED WITH ACTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.5 BILLION IN BOTH 2014 AND 2013.

THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLANS AND FUTURE EFFECTS ON OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND PRIMARILY ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT FUNDED STATUS, COMPONENTS OF EARNINGS EFFECTS AND ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR NET EARNINGS. AS A GLOBAL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, OUR TAX RATES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MIX OF EARNINGS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE GLOBAL EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, LEGISLATION, ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND TAX CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR INCOME. OUR TAX RATES ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY TAX INCENTIVES INTRODUCED IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN FURTHERANCE OF POLICIES TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT CERTAIN TYPES OF ACTIVITY. OUR TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED AND SETTLEMENTS OF ISSUES RAISED IN THESE AUDITS SOMETIMES AFFECT OUR TAX PROVISIONS.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

CASH INCOME TAXES PAID

2014 – 2013 COMMENTARY



THE INCREASE IN THE CONSOLIDATED PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART TO DECREASED BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE ABSENCE OF THE 2013 BENEFITS RELATED TO THE SALE OF 68.5% OF OUR SWISS CONSUMER FINANCE BANK, CEMBRA MONEY BANK AG (CEMBRA), THROUGH AN IPO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFITS FROM THE 2014 TAX EFFICIENT DISPOSITION OF GEMB-NORDIC.



THE INCOME TAX PROVISION ALSO INCREASED DUE TO THE NON-REPEAT OF THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF AUDIT MATTERS IN 2013.



THE HIGHER INCOME TAX PROVISION ALSO REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXED AT RATES ABOVE THE AVERAGE TAX RATE.

2013 – 2012 COMMENTARY



THE DECREASE IN THE CONSOLIDATED PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN TAX BENEFITS ON LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE TAX BENEFIT ON THE SALE OF A PORTION OF CEMBRA.



THE INCOME TAX PROVISION WAS ALSO LOWER DUE TO FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF AUDIT MATTERS AND LOWER INCOME TAXED AT RATES ABOVE THE AVERAGE TAX RATE.



THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF THE 2012 BENEFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HIGH TAX BASIS IN THE ENTITY SOLD IN THE BUSINESS PROPERTY DISPOSITION.

ON JANUARY 2, 2013, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012 WAS ENACTED AND THE LAW EXTENDED SEVERAL

PROVISIONS, INCLUDING A TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE U.S. TAX PROVISION DEFERRING TAX ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME AND CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESS CREDITS, RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2012. UNDER ACCOUNTING RULES, A TAX LAW CHANGE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CALCULATING THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD ENACTED. BECAUSE THE EXTENSION WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN 2013, TAX EXPENSE IN 2013 REFLECTED RETROACTIVE EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUSLY EXPIRED PROVISIONS.

BENEFITS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS

OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE USE OF GLOBAL FUNDING STRUCTURES. THERE IS A BENEFIT FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS AS NON-U.S. INCOME IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE. THESE NON-U.S. EARNINGS HAVE BEEN

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

MD&A

OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CURRENT U.S. INCOME TAX. THE RATE OF TAX ON OUR INDEFINITELY REINVESTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS IS BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND BECAUSE GE FUNDS THE MAJORITY OF ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LOW FOREIGN TAXES.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE BENEFITS DEPENDS ON THE PROVISION OF U.S. LAW DEFERRING THE TAX ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME, WHICH, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, IS SUBJECT TO EXPIRATION. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE REMAINING BENEFIT RELATED TO BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE IS DERIVED FROM OUR GECAS AIRCRAFT LEASING OPERATIONS LOCATED IN IRELAND. NO OTHER OPERATION IN ANY ONE COUNTRY ACCOUNTS FOR A MATERIAL PORTION OF THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THE BENEFIT.

WE EXPECT OUR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM NON-U.S. INCOME TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE TO CONTINUE, SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN U.S. OR FOREIGN LAW, INCLUDING THE EXPIRATION OF THE U.S. TAX LAW PROVISION DEFERRING TAX ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT

. IN ADDITION, SINCE THIS BENEFIT DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENT'S INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST AMOUNTS OUTSIDE THE U.S., OUR TAX PROVISION WILL INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVEST FOREIGN EARNINGS.

2014 – 2013 COMMENTARY

OUR BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS DECREASED IN 2014 PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF THE 2013 BENEFITS, PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, ON THE SALE OF A PORTION OF CEMBRA, LOWER BENEFITS FROM THE REALIZATION OF PRIOR-YEAR LOSSES AND FROM THE RESOLUTION OF INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AUDITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LARGER BENEFITS FROM OTHER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED EARNINGS INCLUDING FROM THE 2014 DISPOSITION OF GEMB-NORDIC.

2013 – 2012 COMMENTARY

OUR BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCREASED IN 2013 PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF THE REALIZATION OF BENEFITS RELATED TO THE SALE OF A PORTION OF CEMBRA, THE REALIZATION OF BENEFITS FOR PRIOR-YEAR LOSSES, AND THE RESOLUTION OF IRS AUDITS.

OTHER INFORMATION

TO THE EXTENT GLOBAL INTEREST RATES AND NON-U.S. OPERATING INCOME INCREASE, WE WOULD EXPECT TAX BENEFITS TO INCREASE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT'S INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THOSE EARNINGS. INCLUDED IN 2014 IS THE BENEFIT FROM THE INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF THE ELIGIBLE EARNINGS FROM THE SALE OF GEMB-NORDIC. INCLUDED IN 2013 IS THE BENEFIT FROM THE INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF THE ELIGIBLE EARNINGS FROM THE SALE OF A PORTION OF CEMBRA.

GE PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES

2014 – 2013 COMMENTARY



THE GE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DECREASED IN 2014 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF INCREASED BENEFITS FROM LOWER TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS ($0.8 BILLION).



THAT DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN THE BENEFIT OF AUDIT RESOLUTIONS ($0.3 BILLION) SHOWN BELOW, AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXED AT RATES ABOVE THE AVERAGE TAX RATE ($0.3 BILLION), AND THE NON-REPEAT OF THE 2013 BENEFIT FROM THE ENACTMENT OF THE EXTENSION OF CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESS CREDITS ($0.1 BILLION), DISCLOSED ABOVE.

2013 – 2012 COMMENTARY



THE GE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DECREASED IN 2013 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE BENEFIT OF AUDIT RESOLUTIONS ($0.2 BILLION) SHOWN BELOW.

RESOLUTION OF AUDIT MATTERS REDUCED THE GE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES BY $0.1 BILLION, $0.4 BILLION AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTS OF SUCH RESOLUTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING CAPTIONS IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.



GECC FINANCING RECEIVABLES-NET DECREASED $16.0 BILLION

. SEE THE FOLLOWING FINANCING RECEIVABLES SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.



GE ALL OTHER ASSETS INCREASED $1.0 BILLION

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS AT OUR POWER & WATER AND AVIATION BUSINESSES OF $1.5 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF APPLIANCES AND SIGNALING BALANCES TO ASSETS OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE OF $0.5 BILLION.



GECC ALL OTHER ASSETS DECREASED $3.5 BILLION

AS A RESULT OF SALES OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS OF $3.4 BILLION, A NET DECREASE IN EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS OF $1.5 BILLION AND A NET DECREASE IN ADVANCES TO SUPPLIERS OF $0.9 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET INCREASE IN ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OF $2.3 BILLION.



DEFERRED INCOME TAXES INCREASED $2.3 BILLION

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASED DEFERRED TAX ASSET AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD, WHICH REDUCED OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.



GE BORROWINGS INCREASED $3.0 BILLION.

GE COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $3.0 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT WITH MATURITIES UP TO 30 YEARS AND RECLASSIFIED $2.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS TO SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS DURING THE YEAR.



GECC BORROWINGS DECREASED $31.0 BILLION.

GECC HAD NET REPAYMENTS ON THESE BORROWINGS OF $24.9 BILLION DURING THE YEAR, ALONG WITH A NET $9.1 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE BALANCES DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST ALL MAJOR CURRENCIES.



BANK DEPOSITS INCREASED $9.5 BILLION

PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT OUR BANKS OF $12.6 BILLION, INCLUDING SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL OF $9.2 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF BUDAPEST BANK DEPOSITS TO LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE OF $1.9 BILLION.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION



GE ALL OTHER LIABILITIES INCREASED $13.7 BILLION

DECREASE IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) – BENEFIT PLANS OF $7.3 BILLION

. SEE NOTES 12 AND 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.



ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) – CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS DECREASED $2.6 BILLION

DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST ALL MAJOR CURRENCIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2013. THIS DECREASE COINCIDES WITH GENERAL DECREASES IN BALANCES OF OUR MAJOR ASSET AND LIABILITY CATEGORIES, INCLUDING: FINANCING RECEIVABLES; PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; GOODWILL; INTANGIBLE ASSETS; SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS OUR LARGEST CATEGORY OF ASSETS AND REPRESENTS ONE OF OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF REVENUES. OUR PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS DIVERSE AND NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO MAJOR U.S. BANKS. A DISCUSSION OF THE QUALITY OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO FOLLOWS.

OUR COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY COMPRISES SENIOR SECURED POSITIONS WITH COMPARATIVELY LOW LOSS HISTORY. THE SECURED RECEIVABLES IN THIS PORTFOLIO ARE COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF ASSET CLASSES, WHICH FOR OUR CLL BUSINESS PRIMARILY INCLUDE: INDUSTRIAL-RELATED FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, VEHICLES, CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, AND EQUIPMENT USED IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, MEDIA, COMMUNICATIONS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES. THE PORTFOLIOS IN OUR REAL ESTATE, GECAS AND ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND OPERATING ASSETS IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY AND WATER INDUSTRIES, RESPECTIVELY. WE ARE IN A SECURED POSITION FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO.

OUR CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF NON-U.S. MORTGAGE, SALES FINANCE, AUTO AND PERSONAL LOANS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN AND ASIAN COUNTRIES AND U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT CARD AND SALES FINANCE RECEIVABLES.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, WE COMBINED OUR CLL EUROPE AND CLL ASIA PORTFOLIOS INTO CLL INTERNATIONAL AND WE TRANSFERRED OUR CLL OTHER PORTFOLIO TO THE CLL AMERICAS PORTFOLIO. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, WE COMBINED OUR CONSUMER NON-U.S. AUTO PORTFOLIO INTO OUR CONSUMER NON-U.S. INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING CREDIT PORTFOLIO. PRIOR-PERIOD AMOUNTS WERE RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT-PERIOD PRESENTATION.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS, AND EVALUATES RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR INDIVIDUAL LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

LOANS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS ACQUISITION ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCORPORATES OUR ESTIMATE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE OF THE CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IS NOT CARRIED OVER AT ACQUISITION. THIS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF CAUSING LOWER RESERVE COVERAGE RATIOS FOR THOSE PORTFOLIOS.

FOR PURPOSES OF THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS, "DELINQUENT" RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS. LOANS PURCHASED AT A DISCOUNT ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ACCRETE INTEREST INCOME OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE LOAN BASED ON REASONABLY ESTIMABLE CASH FLOWS EVEN IF THE UNDERLYING LOANS ARE CONTRACTUALLY DELINQUENT AT ACQUISITION. "NONACCRUAL" FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE ON WHICH WE HAVE STOPPED ACCRUING INTEREST. WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, FOR WHICH WE CONTINUE TO ACCRUE INTEREST UNTIL THE ACCOUNTS ARE WRITTEN OFF IN THE PERIOD THAT THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE. RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DELINQUENT WHEN PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURED TERMS, BUT MAY REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A PERIOD OF SATISFACTORY PAYMENT PERFORMANCE BY THE BORROWER AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF COLLECTION.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, DECREASED $16.1 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2013, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR ($7.7 BILLION), THE RECLASSIFICATION OF BUDAPEST BANK TO ASSETS OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AND THE SALE OF GEMB-NORDIC ($5.3 BILLION), WRITE-OFFS ($5.1 BILLION) AND TRANSFERS TO ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS ($3.1 BILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ORIGINATIONS EXCEEDING COLLECTIONS (WHICH INCLUDES SALES) ($5.7 BILLION).

NONACCRUAL RECEIVABLES DECREASED $2.7 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2013 PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYOFFS, COLLECTIONS AND WRITE-OFFS IN OUR REAL ESTATE AND CLL PORTFOLIOS AND ASSET SALES AND RESOLUTIONS IN CONSUMER, PRIMARILY IN OUR U.K. PORTFOLIO.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES DECREASED $0.1 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2013. ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES DECREASED AT COMMERCIAL AND REAL ESTATE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF WRITE-OFFS AND RESOLUTIONS. THESE DECREASES WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES AT CONSUMER, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE PROJECTED NET WRITE-OFFS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IN THE U.S. CONSISTENT WITH THE GROWTH OF RELATED FINANCING RECEIVABLES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF BUDAPEST BANK TO ASSETS OF BUSINESS HELD FOR SALE AND THE SALE OF GEMB-NORDIC. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 2.0% AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 TO 2.1% AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 REFLECTING DECREASES IN BOTH THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AND THE OVERALL FINANCING RECEIVABLES BALANCE AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS

WE MAINTAIN A STRONG FOCUS ON LIQUIDITY. AT BOTH GE AND GECC WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY TO HELP PROVIDE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGHOUT BUSINESS CYCLES.

OUR LIQUIDITY AND BORROWING PLANS FOR GE AND GECC ARE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR ANNUAL FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES. AT GE, OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING PLANS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO FUND OUR OPERATING COMMITMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE PRIMARILY PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS FOR INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT, PAYROLL AND GENERAL EXPENSES (INCLUDING PENSION FUNDING). WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND GROWTH OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING PAYING DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASING SHARES, INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUIRING INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. AT GE, WE RELY PRIMARILY ON CASH GENERATED THROUGH OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM GECC, AND ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY MAINTAINED A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT WE REGULARLY USE TO FUND OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., PRINCIPALLY WITHIN FISCAL QUARTERS.

GECC'S LIQUIDITY POSITION IS TARGETED TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER BOTH NORMAL AND STRESSED CONDITIONS. GECC ESTABLISHES A FUNDING PLAN ANNUALLY THAT IS BASED ON THE PROJECTED ASSET SIZE AND CASH NEEDS OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, HAS INCORPORATED OUR STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR ENDING NET INVESTMENT IN GE CAPITAL. GECC RELIES ON A DIVERSIFIED SOURCE OF FUNDING, INCLUDING THE UNSECURED TERM DEBT MARKETS, THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, DEPOSITS, SECURED FUNDING, RETAIL FUNDING PRODUCTS, BANK BORROWINGS AND SECURITIZATIONS TO FUND ITS BALANCE SHEET. WE ALSO RELY ON CASH GENERATED THROUGH COLLECTION OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER PAYMENTS ON OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND LEASES TO FUND ITS OPERATING AND INTEREST EXPENSE COSTS.

OUR 2015 GECC FUNDING PLAN ANTICIPATES REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ($38.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014), THROUGH ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND REISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, CASH ON HAND, DISPOSITIONS, ASSET SALES, AND DEPOSITS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING. LONG-TERM MATURITIES AND EARLY REDEMPTIONS WERE $41.3 BILLION IN 2014. INTEREST ON BORROWINGS IS PRIMARILY REPAID THROUGH INTEREST EARNED ON EXISTING FINANCING RECEIVABLES. DURING 2014, GECC EARNED INTEREST INCOME ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES OF $18.7 BILLION, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES OF $8.4 BILLION.

WE MAINTAIN A DETAILED LIQUIDITY POLICY FOR GECC THAT REQUIRES GECC TO MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE LIQUIDITY POLICY DEFINES GECC'S LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCE UNDER DIFFERENT STRESS SCENARIOS BASED ON ITS LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES TO ESCALATE POTENTIAL ISSUES. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR GECC'S ACCESS TO FUNDING MARKETS AND ITS LIQUIDITY PROFILE THROUGH TRACKING EXTERNAL INDICATORS AND TESTING VARIOUS STRESS SCENARIOS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND ESTABLISHES ESCALATION PROCEDURES IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE.

AS A MATTER OF GENERAL PRACTICE, WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CALLING DEBT INSTRUMENTS WHERE GECC HAS THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE A CALL. IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO CALL DEBT, WE CONSIDER THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO GECC OF CALLING DEBT, THE EFFECT OF CALLING DEBT ON GECC'S LIQUIDITY PROFILE AND OTHER FACTORS. DURING 2014, WE CALLED $0.4 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT.

EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISKS

EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISKS ARE MANAGED WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MATCH FUNDING AND SELECTIVE USE OF DERIVATIVES. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND MARKET RISKS BECAUSE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN DIVERSE MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND LOCAL FUNDING IS NOT ALWAYS EFFICIENT. IN ADDITION, WE USE DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE DEBT WE ARE ISSUING TO MATCH THE FIXED OR FLOATING NATURE OF THE ASSETS WE ARE ORIGINATING. WE APPLY STRICT POLICIES TO MANAGE EACH OF THESE RISKS, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS ON SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES. FOLLOWING IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USING SO-CALLED "SHOCK" TESTS THAT SEEK TO MODEL THE EFFECTS OF SHIFTS IN RATES. SUCH TESTS ARE INHERENTLY LIMITED BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS USED (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A FORECAST; ACTUAL EFFECTS WOULD DEPEND ON MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING MARKET FACTORS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THAT TIME.



IT IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. WE FUND OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS USING DEBT OR A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS SO THAT THE INTEREST RATES OF OUR BORROWINGS MATCH THE EXPECTED INTEREST RATE PROFILE ON OUR ASSETS. TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING ACTIONS, WE ASSUMED THAT, ON JANUARY 1, 2015, INTEREST RATES DECREASED BY 100 BASIS POINTS ACROSS THE YIELD CURVE (A "PARALLEL SHIFT" IN THAT CURVE) AND FURTHER ASSUMED THAT THE DECREASE REMAINED IN PLACE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE YEAR-END 2014 PORTFOLIO AND HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT, WE ESTIMATED THAT OUR CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, STARTING IN JANUARY 2015, WOULD DECLINE BY LESS THAN $0.1 BILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE.



IT IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS EITHER WITHIN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OR USING THE PROTECTION OF HEDGE STRATEGIES. WE ANALYZED YEAR-END 2014 CONSOLIDATED CURRENCY EXPOSURES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, TO IDENTIFY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THEIR RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. FOR SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE THEN EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF A 10% SHIFT IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THOSE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR, HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT. THIS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT OUR 2015 CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS WOULD DECLINE BY LESS THAN $0.1 BILLION AS A RESULT OF SUCH A SHIFT IN EXCHANGE RATES. THIS ANALYSIS EXCLUDES ANY TRANSLATION IMPACT FROM CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS

CREDIT RATINGS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, GE'S AND GECC'S LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS SERVICE (S&P) WERE AA+ WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK AND THEIR SHORT-TERM FUNDING RATINGS FROM S&P WERE A-1+. WE ARE DISCLOSING THESE RATINGS TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND THE EFFECTS OF OUR RATINGS ON OUR COSTS OF FUNDS. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT A

DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS, OUR RATINGS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A REVISION OR WITHDRAWAL AT ANY TIME BY THE ASSIGNING RATING ORGANIZATION, AND EACH RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER RATING.

PRINCIPAL DEBT AND DERIVATIVE CONDITIONS

CERTAIN OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CAN BE TERMINATED

IF SPECIFIED CREDIT RATINGS ARE NOT MAINTAINED AND CERTAIN DEBT AND DERIVATIVES AGREEMENTS OF OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HAVE PROVISIONS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THESE CREDIT RATINGS.

FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN OUR POSITIONS. WE MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL DEFAULT AND NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF OUR STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS) ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS. WHERE WE HAVE AGREED TO NETTING OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES WITH A COUNTERPARTY, WE OFFSET OUR EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND APPLY THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED TO US TO DETERMINE THE NET EXPOSURE. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE NET EXPOSURES AGAINST DEFINED LIMITS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE, INCLUDING REQUIRING ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

SWAP, FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE EXECUTED UNDER STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT TYPICALLY CONTAIN MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3. IN CERTAIN OF THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS, THE COUNTERPARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE SHORT-TERM RATINGS OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. THE NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITY AFTER CONSIDERATION OF NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, OUTSTANDING INTEREST PAYMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTED BY US UNDER THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $0.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

OTHER DEBT AND DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES INCLUDE TRINITY, WHICH COMPRISES TWO ENTITIES THAT HOLD INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE INVESTMENT GRADE, AND WERE FUNDED BY THE ISSUANCE OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (GICS). THESE GICS INCLUDE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CERTAIN HOLDERS COULD REQUIRE IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT OF THEIR INVESTMENT SHOULD THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF GECC FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, AND ARE REPORTED IN INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS. THE TRINITY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE (A) ON OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. ANOTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITY ALSO HAD ISSUED GICS WHERE PROCEEDS ARE LOANED TO GECC. THESE GICS INCLUDED CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CERTAIN HOLDERS COULD REQUIRE IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT OF THEIR INVESTMENT SHOULD THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF GECC FALL BELOW AA-/AA3. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION "LONG-TERM BORROWINGS" ON OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. THESE THREE CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES CEASED ISSUING GICS IN 2010.

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES, INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT AND SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

GE PROVIDES IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT SUPPORT TO GECC THROUGH COMMITMENTS, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND OPERATING SUPPORT. FOR EXAMPLE, AND AS DISCUSSED BELOW, GE HAS COMMITTED TO KEEP GECC'S RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES ABOVE A MINIMUM LEVEL. GECC'S CREDIT RATING IS HIGHER THAN IT WOULD BE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AS A RESULT OF THIS FINANCIAL SUPPORT. GECC CURRENTLY DOES NOT PAY GE FOR THIS SUPPORT.

UNDER AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN GE AND GECC, GE WILL MAKE PAYMENTS TO GECC, CONSTITUTING ADDITIONS TO PRE-TAX INCOME UNDER THE AGREEMENT (WHICH INCREASES EQUITY), TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO CAUSE THE RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES OF GECC AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (DETERMINED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS) TO BE NOT LESS THAN 1.10:1 FOR THE PERIOD, AS A SINGLE AGGREGATION, OF EACH GECC FISCAL YEAR COMMENCING WITH FISCAL YEAR 1991. GECC'S RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES WAS 1.84:1 FOR 2014. NO PAYMENT FOR 2014 WAS REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. ON FEBRUARY 24, 2015, GE AND GECC AMENDED THIS AGREEMENT, EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN 2015, TO EXCLUDE NON-CASH CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES (WHICH ARE EXCLUDED FROM REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS) FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING GECC'S RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES. THE AMENDED AGREEMENT IS FILED AS EXHIBIT 10(Y) HERETO AND IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

IN ADDITION, IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES OF GECC THAT MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY (HYBRID DEBT), DURING EVENTS OF DEFAULT OR INTEREST DEFERRAL PERIODS UNDER SUCH SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, GECC HAS AGREED NOT TO DECLARE OR PAY ANY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS OR MAKE CERTAIN OTHER PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ITS CAPITAL STOCK, AND GE HAS AGREED TO PROMPTLY RETURN ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO GE IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. THERE WERE $7.1 BILLION OF SUCH DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

SEE THE INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND ELIMINATIONS SECTION FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECC. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OPERATING USE OF CASH IS TO PAY OUR SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, TAX AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES. DIVIDENDS FROM GECC, INCLUDING SPECIAL DIVIDENDS, REPRESENT THE DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTION OF GECC RETAINED EARNINGS, AND ARE DISTINCT FROM CASH FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES.

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND ELIMINATIONS

EFFECTS OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN RELATED COMPANIES ARE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS, ARE ELIMINATED AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GECC DIVIDENDS TO GE; GE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES SOLD TO GECC; GECC SERVICES FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT AND MATERIAL PROCUREMENT; BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILES) LEASED BETWEEN GE AND GECC; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND OTHER SERVICES SOLD TO GECC BY GE; AIRCRAFT ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT ARE INSTALLED ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY GECC FROM THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; AND VARIOUS INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ALLOCATIONS OF GE CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS.

GE SELLS CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES TO GECC IN PART TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN RESULT IN CASH GENERATION OR CASH USE. DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, GE RECEIVES CASH FROM THE SALE OF RECEIVABLES TO GECC. IT ALSO FOREGOES COLLECTION OF CASH ON RECEIVABLES SOLD. THE INCREMENTAL AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED FROM SALES OF RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF THE CASH GE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE COLLECTED HAD THOSE RECEIVABLES NOT BEEN SOLD, REPRESENTS THE CASH GENERATED OR USED IN THE PERIOD RELATING TO THIS ACTIVITY. THE INCREMENTAL CASH GENERATED IN GE CFOA FROM SELLING THESE RECEIVABLES TO GECC INCREASED GE'S CFOA BY $2.2 BILLION, $0.1 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

EXPOSURES

WE MANAGE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS. WE PLACE DEFINED RISK LIMITS AROUND EACH OBLIGOR AND REVIEW OUR RISK EXPOSURE ON THE BASIS OF BOTH THE PRIMARY AND PARENT OBLIGOR, AS WELL AS THE ISSUER OF SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL. THESE LIMITS ARE ADJUSTED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BASED ON OUR CONTINUING ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT RISK OF THE OBLIGOR OR ISSUER. IN SETTING OUR COUNTERPARTY RISK LIMITS, WE FOCUS ON HIGH-QUALITY CREDITS AND DIVERSIFICATION THROUGH SPREAD OF RISK IN AN EFFORT TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR OVERALL EXPOSURE. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR EACH EXPOSURE AGAINST THESE LIMITS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT RISK LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED OR THERE ARE EXCESS RISK CONCENTRATIONS. OUR COLLATERAL POSITION AND ABILITY TO WORK OUT PROBLEM ACCOUNTS HAVE HISTORICALLY MITIGATED OUR ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. DELINQUENCY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY STABLE IN OUR EUROPEAN COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER PLATFORMS IN THE AGGREGATE, AND WE ACTIVELY MONITOR AND TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE EXPOSURES WHERE APPROPRIATE. UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING EUROPEAN MARKETS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS.

VENEZUELA

OUR ACTIVITIES RELATED TO VENEZUELA GENERATED REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.6 BILLION IN 2014, CONSISTING OF BOTH EXPORTS TO AND OPERATIONS WITHIN THE COUNTRY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND EURO BUT WE ALSO TRANSACT IN BOLIVARS FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE EXCHANGE RATE FOR REMEASUREMENT OF BOLIVAR-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY. DURING 2014, VENEZUELA OPERATED THREE DIFFERENT EXCHANGE MECHANISMS: CENCOEX (THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE MECHANISM), SICAD1 AND SICAD2. IN 2014, WE BECAME ELIGIBLE TO ACCESS THE SICAD1 EXCHANGE MECHANISM TO SETTLE CERTAIN FUTURE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. IN LIGHT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, WE CONCLUDED THE SICAD1 RATE IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR MEASURING A MAJORITY OF OUR MONETARY ASSETS AND RECORDED PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $66 MILLION DURING 2014. WE CONTINUED TO ACCESS CENCOEX FOR CERTAIN OF OUR QUALIFYING IMPORTS AND MEASURE THE ASSOCIATED BOLIVAR-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AT THAT RATE. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT ELIMINATED SICAD2 AND INTRODUCED A NEW OPEN MARKET EXCHANGE MECHANISM (SIMADI). WE WILL REEVALUATE THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE EXCHANGE RATES FOR REMEASUREMENT IN LIGHT OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR A DEVALUATION OF THE BOLIVAR. NET MONETARY ASSETS SUBJECT TO REMEASUREMENT WERE APPROXIMATELY $78 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION IN BOLIVAR-DENOMINATED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND APPROXIMATELY $41 MILLION RELATED TO A NON-CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT.

WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MONITOR OTHER EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN VENEZUELA ON OUR ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT ON NON-BOLIVAR CREDIT EXPOSURES AND RECOVERABLE AMOUNTS OF BOLIVAR DENOMINATED NON-MONETARY ASSETS.

OIL & GAS INDUSTRY

THE RECENT SHARP DECLINE IN OIL PRICES AND THE PROSPECT OF LOWER OIL PRICES HAS MIXED IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE COMPETE. IN GENERAL, LOWER OIL PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN OIL IMPORTING COUNTRIES WHILE CAUSING NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS IN MANY ENERGY-EXPORTING COUNTRIES. CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR OIL & GAS BUSINESS WILL EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN ORDERS AND PRICING PRESSURES, WHILE WE EXPECT THAT OTHER PARTS WILL BE LARGELY UNAFFECTED. IN RESPONSE TO THIS UNCERTAIN INDUSTRY OUTLOOK, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED COST ACTIONS AND INCREASED OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY. WE EXPECT THAT LOW OIL PRICES WILL BENEFIT OUR OTHER BUSINESSES THROUGH LOWER DIRECT MATERIAL AND OTHER VARIABLE COSTS AS WELL AS THROUGH THE EXPECTED STIMULUS-EFFECT ON GROWTH IN THE U.S. AND IN OTHER ECONOMIES THAT RELY ON ENERGY IMPORTS, INCLUDING EUROPE, JAPAN, AND INDIA.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

APPROXIMATELY 16,400 GE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE REPRESENTED FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PURPOSES BY ONE OF 11 UNIONS (APPROXIMATELY 82 DIFFERENT LOCALS WITHIN SUCH UNIONS). A MAJORITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES ARE REPRESENTED BY UNION LOCALS THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE IUE-CWA, THE INDUSTRIAL DIVISION OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA, AFL-CIO, CLC. DURING 2011, WE NEGOTIATED FOUR-YEAR AGREEMENTS WITH MOST OF OUR U.S. UNIONS. MOST OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL TERMINATE IN JUNE 2015, AND WE WILL BE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS TO ATTAIN NEW AGREEMENTS. WHILE RESULTS OF 2015 UNION NEGOTIATIONS CANNOT BE PREDICTED, OUR RECENT PAST NEGOTIATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN AGREEMENTS THAT INCREASED COSTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY OF THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES REFLECT OUR BEST JUDGMENT ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THESE CONDITIONS CHANGE FROM THOSE EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD CHANGE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, INCREASES IN RESERVES FOR CONTINGENCIES, ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER EFFECTS. ALSO SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED FINANCING RECEIVABLE. SUCH AN ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL VALUES (INCLUDING HOUSING PRICE INDICES, AS APPLICABLE), AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO PROVIDE FOR LOSSES ARE UPDATED TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT CONDITIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES. WRITE-OFFS IN BOTH OUR CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIOS CAN ALSO REFLECT BOTH LOSSES THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE BEGINNING OF A FISCAL YEAR AND INFORMATION BECOMING AVAILABLE DURING THAT FISCAL YEAR THAT MAY IDENTIFY FURTHER DETERIORATION ON EXPOSURES EXISTING PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THAT FISCAL YEAR, AND FOR WHICH RESERVES COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS, AND EVALUATES RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR INDIVIDUAL LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF PROFITS OVER THE MULTIPLE-YEAR TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENTS, CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF FUTURE MONITORING, MAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL EVENTS; THE AMOUNT OF PERSONNEL, SPARE PARTS AND OTHER RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE SERVICES; AND FUTURE BILLING RATE, COST CHANGES AND CUSTOMERS' UTILIZATION OF ASSETS. WE ROUTINELY REVIEW ESTIMATES UNDER PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS AND REGULARLY REVISE THEM TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN OUTLOOK.

WE ALSO REGULARLY ASSESS CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT CONTRACTUAL PENALTIES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET OUR ACCUMULATED INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF CUSTOMER TERMINATION. WE GAIN INSIGHT INTO FUTURE UTILIZATION AND COST TRENDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT RISK, THROUGH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE CLOSE INTERACTION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT COMES WITH SUPPLYING CRITICAL SERVICES AND PARTS OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. REVISIONS MAY AFFECT A PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENT'S TOTAL ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY RESULTING IN AN ADJUSTMENT OF EARNINGS; SUCH ADJUSTMENTS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $1.0 BILLION, $0.3 BILLION AND $0.4 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. WE PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE LOSSES WHEN THEY BECOME EVIDENT.

FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1 AND 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

ASSET IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INVOLVES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY AND IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR CRITERIA INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION. OUR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INVOLVE OUR FINANCE, RISK AND ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGERS. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 3 AND 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED TYPICALLY REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DETERMINING WHICH UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED ASSET, THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, THEIR AMOUNT, AND THE ASSET'S RESIDUAL VALUE, IF ANY. IN TURN, MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS REQUIRES A DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE. WE DERIVE THE REQUIRED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FROM OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS PLANS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, OUR INTERNAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATE AND INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE.

OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF ASSETS IN GE CAPITAL, AND IS PARTICULARLY SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. THEREFORE, WE TEST RECOVERABILITY OF EACH AIRCRAFT IN OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO AT LEAST ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, WE PERFORM QUARTERLY EVALUATIONS IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN AIRCRAFT ARE RE-LEASED, CURRENT LEASE TERMS HAVE CHANGED OR A SPECIFIC LESSEE'S CREDIT STANDING CHANGES. WE CONSIDER MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS GLOBAL DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RENTALS AND RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION RECEIVED ROUTINELY FROM INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS. ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM FUTURE LEASES ARE REDUCED FOR EXPECTED DOWNTIME BETWEEN LEASES AND FOR ESTIMATED TECHNICAL COSTS REQUIRED TO PREPARE AIRCRAFT TO BE REDEPLOYED. FAIR VALUE USED TO MEASURE IMPAIRMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATE. IN DETERMINING ITS BEST ESTIMATE, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES AVERAGE CURRENT

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

86

MD&A

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

MARKET VALUES (OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES) OF SIMILAR TYPE AND AGE AIRCRAFT, WHICH ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT UNDER LEASE.

WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT OF $0.4 BILLION AND $0.7 BILLION IN 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IN 2014 PRIMARILY RELATED TO REGIONAL JETS AND OLDER TECHNOLOGY AIRCRAFT. THE AVERAGE AGE OF AIRCRAFT WE IMPAIRED IN 2014 WAS 17 YEARS COMPARED WITH 7 YEARS FOR OUR TOTAL FLEET. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT WERE AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FOR BOTH 2014 AND 2013.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AND OUR EXPOSURE TO THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRY IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 7 AND 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

REAL ESTATE

WE REVIEW THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY AS CONDITIONS WARRANT. THE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED FOR BOTH ESTIMATING VALUE AND THE RECOVERABILITY ANALYSIS ARE INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL, AND REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE PROFILES, AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTAL, OCCUPANCY AND CAPITALIZATION RATES AND EXPECTED BUSINESS PLANS, WHICH INCLUDE OUR ESTIMATED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE ASSET. OUR PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY ASSET TYPE. HOWEVER, THE GLOBAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC CYCLES THAT CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES. BASED ON THE MOST RECENT VALUATION ESTIMATES AVAILABLE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THEIR ESTIMATED VALUE BY ABOUT $1.2 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT IS SUBJECT TO VARIATION DEPENDENT ON THE ASSUMPTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPOSITION OF OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING SALES. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS HAVE SHOWN SIGNS OF IMPROVED STABILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN CERTAIN MARKETS, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN; HOWEVER, THE PACE OF IMPROVEMENT VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY ASSET CLASS AND MARKET. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CONTINUES TO BE RISK AND UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES. DECLINES IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF REAL ESTATE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WHEN THE AGGREGATE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE MEASUREMENT ARE BELOW THE CARRYING AMOUNT. AS SUCH, ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT, THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED USING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET, WHICH IS BASED UPON CASH FLOW ESTIMATES THAT REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE PROFILES AND AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT CAPITALIZATION RATES AND EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTS AND OCCUPANCY AND IS CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISALS. REAL ESTATE RECOGNIZED PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENTS OF $0.3 BILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT IN BOTH 2014 AND 2013. DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR PROLONGED MARKET ILLIQUIDITY MAY RESULT IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENTS BEING RECOGNIZED. FURTHERMORE, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO FORECASTED VALUATION TRENDS, ESPECIALLY IN ILLIQUID MARKETS, RESULT IN INHERENT IMPRECISION IN REAL ESTATE VALUE ESTIMATES.

FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION AND IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH YEAR USING DATA AS OF JULY 1 OF THAT YEAR. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: IN STEP ONE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS FAIR VALUE; IN STEP TWO, WHICH IS APPLIED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS DERIVED BY DEDUCTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS EQUITY, AND COMPARING THAT AMOUNT WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. WE DETERMINED FAIR VALUES FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING THE MARKET APPROACH, WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, OR THE INCOME APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WE ASSESS THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY BASED UPON THE RELEVANCE AND AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA AT THE TIME WE PERFORM THE VALUATION. IF MULTIPLE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES ARE USED, THE RESULTS ARE WEIGHTED APPROPRIATELY.

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

87

MD&A

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

VALUATIONS USING THE MARKET APPROACH ARE DERIVED FROM METRICS OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES OR HISTORICALLY COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES IS BASED ON THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE GIVING CONSIDERATION TO RISK PROFILES, SIZE, GEOGRAPHY, AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A MARKET APPROACH IS LIMITED TO REPORTING UNITS FOR WHICH THERE ARE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO OUR BUSINESSES.

UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED RATE. WE USE OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM FUTURE GROWTH RATES BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT VIEWS OF THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EACH BUSINESS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ASSUMED IN OUR FORECASTS. WE DERIVE OUR DISCOUNT RATES USING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND ANALYZING PUBLISHED RATES FOR INDUSTRIES RELEVANT TO OUR REPORTING UNITS TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING. WE USE DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND IN OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORECASTS. DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR REPORTING UNIT VALUATIONS RANGED FROM 9.0% TO 16.0%.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, AS NOTED ABOVE, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STEP ONE TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH OF THE GE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED FOR ANY OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

WHILE ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS PASSED STEP ONE OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, WE IDENTIFIED ONE REPORTING UNIT FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE. WITHIN OUR ENERGY MANAGEMENT OPERATING SEGMENT, THE POWER CONVERSION REPORTING UNIT WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE A FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 10%. THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE POWER CONVERSION REPORTING UNIT WAS $1.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 2% OF OUR TOTAL GOODWILL. WHILE THE GOODWILL OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS NOT CURRENTLY IMPAIRED, THERE COULD BE AN IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IF ACTUAL CASH FLOWS ARE BELOW ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS, THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED AT A HIGHER RISK-ADJUSTED RATE OR MARKET MULTIPLES DECREASE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOODWILL IS RECOVERABLE FOR ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE GOODWILL WILL NOT BE IMPAIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN 2013, WHILE THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT'S BOOK VALUE WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF ITS FAIR VALUE, WE FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED OUR REAL ESTATE GOODWILL BALANCE BY PERFORMING THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS IN WHICH THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SECOND STEP WAS NOT REQUIRED, AS THE RESULTS OF STEP ONE INDICATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS BOOK VALUE.

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

WE REVIEW IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINED USEFUL LIVES AND SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OCCURRED REQUIRES COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT TO THE SUM OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. WE TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR VALUE METHOD SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FOR OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES REMAINING IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WE PERIODICALLY TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT OUR DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS AND PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS.

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE ACTUARIAL MODELS THAT MEASURE PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED EFFECTS ON OPERATIONS. TWO ASSUMPTIONS – DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS – ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF PLAN EXPENSE AND ASSET/LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST ANNUALLY ON A PLAN AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC BASIS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT AGE, MORTALITY AND TURNOVER, AND UPDATE THEM TO REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE. ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WILL OFTEN DIFFER FROM ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

ACCUMULATED AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED PAYMENTS. WE DISCOUNT THOSE CASH PAYMENTS USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MARKET-OBSERVED YIELDS FOR HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. LOWER DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE; HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES DECREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE.

OUR DISCOUNT RATES FOR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2013 AND 2012 WERE 4.02%, 4.85% AND 3.96%, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING MARKET INTEREST RATES.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE LONG-TERM RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL BENEFIT PLANS' ASSETS, WE FORMULATE VIEWS ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD. WE EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AND HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG A NUMBER OF KEY VARIABLES THAT IMPACT ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, INFLATION, VALUATIONS, YIELDS AND SPREADS, USING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES. WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXPECTED VOLATILITY BY ASSET CLASS AND DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS CLASSES TO DETERMINE EXPECTED OVERALL PORTFOLIO RESULTS GIVEN CURRENT AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS. ASSETS IN OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS EARNED 5.9% IN 2014, AND HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL RETURNS OF 9.0%, 5.9%, AND 8.4% PER YEAR IN THE 5-, 10- AND 25-YEAR PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL 10- AND 25- RETURNS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY INVESTMENT LOSSES IN 2008. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE, PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE ASSUMED A 7.5% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 7.5% IN 2014 AND 8.0% IN 2013 AND 2012.

CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.



DISCOUNT RATE – A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2 BILLION AND WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT YEAR-END BY ABOUT $2.3 BILLION.



EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS – A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD INCREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2 BILLION.

INCOME TAXES

OUR ANNUAL TAX RATE IS BASED ON OUR INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. TAX LAWS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS BY THE TAXPAYER AND RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTAL TAXING AUTHORITIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR TAX EXPENSE AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING EVALUATING UNCERTAINTIES. WE REVIEW OUR TAX POSITIONS QUARTERLY AND ADJUST THE BALANCES AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. OUR INCOME TAX RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE TAX RATE ON OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THIS RATE DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT IS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT ABOUT AND INTENTIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, APPROXIMATELY $119 BILLION AND $110 BILLION OF EARNINGS, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. SUCH ASSETS ARISE BECAUSE OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS FROM NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. THESE SOURCES OF INCOME RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES. WE USE OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR SHORT- AND LONG-RANGE BUSINESS FORECASTS TO PROVIDE INSIGHT. FURTHER, OUR GLOBAL AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY VARIOUS PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF FUTURE DEDUCTIONS. AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATED TO NON-U.S. NET OPERATING LOSSES, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WERE $5.5 BILLION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, INCLUDING $0.6 BILLION AND $0.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, ASSOCIATED WITH LOSSES REPORTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR LOSS ON THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN. SUCH YEAR-END 2014 AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY RECOVERABLE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY EXPIRATION PERIODS. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON INCOME TAXES IS PROVIDED IN THE OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION – INCOME TAXES SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A AND IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY PRICES. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AS HEDGES REQUIRES THAT, AT INCEPTION AND OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND RELATED DERIVATIVE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES ACCOUNTING ARE COMPLEX. FAILURE TO APPLY THIS COMPLEX GUIDANCE CORRECTLY WILL RESULT IN ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE BEING REPORTED IN EARNINGS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

IN EVALUATING WHETHER A PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, WE TEST EFFECTIVENESS AT INCEPTION AND EACH REPORTING PERIOD THEREAFTER BY DETERMINING WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OFFSET, WITHIN A SPECIFIED RANGE, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM. IF FAIR VALUE CHANGES FAIL THIS TEST, WE DISCONTINUE APPLYING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO THAT RELATIONSHIP PROSPECTIVELY. FAIR VALUES OF BOTH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE CALCULATED USING INTERNAL VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATING MARKET-BASED ASSUMPTIONS, SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY CONFIRMATION, AS APPLICABLE.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 9, 21 AND 22

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EVERY REPORTING PERIOD INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EVERY REPORTING PERIOD BUT THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE LOANS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE HELD FOR SALE, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE IMPAIRED AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, IF WE SELL A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND RETAIN A NONCONTROLLING STAKE IN THE ENTITY. ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN IMPAIRED AND RETAINED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS DETERMINED AS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OFTEN INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS ABOUT ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE THAT FACTORS IN BOTH RISK AND LIQUIDITY PREMIUMS, IDENTIFYING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, WEIGHTING THOSE DIFFERENCES ACCORDINGLY AND THEN MAKING THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE MARKET TRANSACTIONS TO REFLECT THE RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR ASSET BEING VALUED.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 21 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND UNRESOLVED MATTERS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND RESULT FROM EVENTS OR ACTIONS BY OTHERS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN A FUTURE LOSS. SUCH CONTINGENCIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS, LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PRODUCT QUALITY AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM OTHER EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS.

WHEN A LOSS IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE ULTIMATE LOSS. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW-END OF SUCH RANGE. HOWEVER, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A LOSS WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CONTINGENCY IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS OR A RANGE OF LOSS MAY NOT BE PRACTICABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FUTURE EVENTS AND DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES THAT WILL DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE CONTINGENCY. MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SUCH MATTERS TO BE RESOLVED OVER MANY YEARS, DURING WHICH TIME RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEW INFORMATION MUST BE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATED TO DETERMINE BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS. WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE, DISCLOSURE IS PROVIDED.

DISCLOSURE ALSO IS PROVIDED WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LOSS WILL BE INCURRED OR WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF A LOSS WILL EXCEED THE RECORDED PROVISION. WE REGULARLY REVIEW ALL CONTINGENCIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS HAS CHANGED AND TO ASSESS WHETHER A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS CAN BE MADE. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DEVELOPMENT OF A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF LOSS OR A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS IS COMPLEX WHEN THE OUTCOME IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH OR DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE COURT SYSTEM AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES. SUCH FACTORS BEAR DIRECTLY ON WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND BOUNDARIES OF HIGH AND LOW ESTIMATES.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2014-09,

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

, WHICH REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO WHICH IT EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED FOR THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. THE ASU WILL REPLACE MOST EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE IN GAAP WHEN IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2017. EARLY APPLICATION IS NOT PERMITTED. THE STANDARD PERMITS THE USE OF EITHER THE RETROSPECTIVE OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE (CUMULATIVE EFFECT) TRANSITION METHOD. WE ARE EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT ASU 2014-09 WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. WE HAVE NOT YET SELECTED A TRANSITION METHOD NOR HAVE WE DETERMINED THE EFFECT OF THE STANDARD ON OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL REPORTING.

IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2015-02,

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

. THE ASU AMENDS THE CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE FOR VIES AND GENERAL PARTNERS' INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND MODIFIES THE EVALUATION OF WHETHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND SIMILAR LEGAL ENTITIES ARE VIES OR VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF THE ASU ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

OUR OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES, INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION IN EACH OF THE YEARS 2014, 2013 AND 2012. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $0.4 BILLION IN 2015 AND $0.3 BILLION IN 2016.

IN 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENT FROM THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE CONSENT DECREE PROVIDED THAT THE DREDGING WOULD BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES. PHASE 1 WAS COMPLETED IN MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009. BETWEEN PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 THERE WAS AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF NATIONAL EXPERTS. THE PANEL EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF PHASE 1 DREDGING OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO PHASE 1 ENGINEERING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE STANDARDS. ON DECEMBER 17, 2010, EPA ISSUED ITS DECISION SETTING FORTH THE FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR PHASE 2 OF THE HUDSON RIVER DREDGING PROJECT, INCORPORATING ASPECTS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW PANEL AND FROM GE. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE AGREED TO PERFORM PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS SET BY EPA AND INCREASED OUR RESERVE BY $0.8 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS OF COMPLETING PHASE 2. IN 2012, WE COMPLETED THE FIRST YEAR OF PHASE 2 DREDGING AND COMMENCED WORK ON PLANNED UPGRADES TO THE HUDSON RIVER WASTEWATER PROCESSING FACILITY. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE HAVE DREDGED 2.2 MILLION CUBIC YARDS FROM THE RIVER AND, BASED UPON THAT RESULT AND OUR BEST PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING JUDGMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT RESERVE CONTINUES TO REFLECT OUR PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF PHASE 2 OF THE DREDGING PROJECT.

THE SERVICE COST, PRIOR SERVICE COST AND CURTAILMENT LOSS COMPONENTS OF OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING EARNINGS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE COMPONENTS OF PENSION COST BETTER REFLECT THE ONGOING SERVICE-RELATED COSTS OF PROVIDING PENSION BENEFITS TO OUR EMPLOYEES. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MEASURE OF OPERATING EARNINGS PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH A USEFUL MEASURE OF THE OPERATIONAL RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS. OTHER COMPONENTS OF GAAP PENSION COST ARE MAINLY DRIVEN BY CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISIONS AND MARKET PERFORMANCE, AND WE MANAGE THESE SEPARATELY FROM THE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESSES. NEITHER GAAP NOR OPERATING PENSION COSTS ARE NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE CURRENT OR FUTURE CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO OUR PENSION PLAN. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE, CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE, PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR COMPARISON OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS TO THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING OPERATING EARNINGS SEPARATELY FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES ALSO PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RELATIVE SIZE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL COMPANY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OPERATING EPS EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF THE $0.8 BILLION PREFERRED DIVIDEND RELATED TO THE REDEMPTION OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK (CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE REDEMPTION VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK) IS A MEANINGFUL MEASURE BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE COMPARABILITY OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD RESULTS.

WE REFER TO CASH GENERATED BY OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AS "INDUSTRIAL CFOA," WHICH WE DEFINE AS GE'S CASH FROM CONTINUING OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY GE FROM GECC. THIS INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING GE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES SOLD TO GECC; GECC SERVICES FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT AND MATERIAL PROCUREMENT; BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILES) LEASED BETWEEN GE AND GECC; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND OTHER SERVICES SOLD TO GECC BY GE; AIRCRAFT ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT ARE INSTALLED ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY GECC FROM THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; AND VARIOUS INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ALLOCATIONS OF GE CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO COMPARE GE'S OPERATING CASH FLOWS WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF GECC DIVIDENDS, SINCE THESE DIVIDENDS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND CAN VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO COMPARE INDUSTRIAL CFOA EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF TAXES PAID RELATED TO THE NBCU TRANSACTION. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THESE MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO CASH FLOW RESULTS OF COMPANIES THAT CONTAIN BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, BUT BELIEVES THAT THIS COMPARISON IS AIDED BY THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS OF DIVIDENDS PAID BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS AND THE SEPARATE PRESENTATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES (GECC) CASH FLOWS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MEASURES OF INDUSTRIAL CFOA AND CFOA EXCLUDING NBCU DEAL-RELATED TAXES PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH USEFUL MEASURES TO COMPARE THE CAPACITY OF OUR INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS TO GENERATE OPERATING CASH FLOWS WITH THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF OTHER NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES AND AS SUCH PROVIDE USEFUL MEASURES TO SUPPLEMENT THE REPORTED GAAP CFOA MEASURE.

OUR INDUSTRIAL ROTC CALCULATION EXCLUDES EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM THE NUMERATOR.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CLEARER WAY TO MEASURE THE ONGOING TREND IN RETURN ON INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS TO THE EXTENT THAT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS HAVE AFFECTED OUR REPORTED RESULTS. OUR INDUSTRIAL SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY USED IN THE DENOMINATOR IS ADJUSTED FOR DEBT, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF ASSETS HELD BY THE GE PARENT TO SUPPORT GECC. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL DENOMINATOR IN MEASURING THE RETURN ON OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. INDUSTRIAL ROTC WAS 14.0% IN 2014 VERSUS 14.3% IN 2013. IN 2014, A 12% INCREASE IN THE ADJUSTED INDUSTRIAL RETURN WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A 14% INCREASE IN THE ADJUSTED INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL. THIS INCREASE IN CAPITAL WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN YEAR-END 2013 DISCOUNT RATES, WHICH REDUCED THE PENSION DEFICIT. OUR CALCULATION OF THE RETURN ON INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADJUSTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE RESULT IN A MORE RELEVANT MEASURE FOR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL CONTINUING OPERATIONS, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, AND TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL CONTINUING OPERATIONS WITH THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES.

FOR PURPOSES OF THIS RATIO, WE HAVE ALSO ADJUSTED CASH AND DEBT BALANCES TO INCLUDE AMOUNTS CLASSIFIED AS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A USEFUL COMPARISON TO A GAAP-BASED RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY BECAUSE LIQUIDITY BALANCES MAY BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT. THE USEFULNESS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE MAY BE LIMITED, HOWEVER, AS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY AT ANY POINT IN TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNT THAT COULD PRACTICALLY BE APPLIED TO REDUCE OUTSTANDING DEBT. DESPITE THIS POTENTIAL LIMITATION, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE, CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE, PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY BE MORE COMPARABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESSES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE IS A USEFUL INDICATOR OF THE CAPITAL (DEBT OR EQUITY) REQUIRED TO FUND A BUSINESS AS IT ADJUSTS FOR NON-INTEREST BEARING CURRENT LIABILITIES GENERATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A CAPITAL OUTLAY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT BY EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY, WE PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF ASSETS REQUIRING CAPITAL TO FUND OUR GE CAPITAL SEGMENT AS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY RESULTED FROM DEBT ISSUANCES TO PRE-FUND FUTURE DEBT MATURITIES AND WILL NOT BE USED TO FUND ADDITIONAL ASSETS. LIQUIDITY CONSISTS OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF THE U.S. TREASURY. AS A GENERAL MATTER, INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN LIQUIDITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY LIQUID, GIVING US THE ABILITY TO READILY CONVERT THEM TO CASH. PROVIDING THIS MEASURE WILL HELP INVESTORS MEASURE HOW WE ARE PERFORMING AGAINST OUR PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED GOAL TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING OUR 2008 ENI PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH INFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE TOWARD THE GOAL OF MAKING GECC A SMALLER, MORE FOCUSED FINANCE COMPANY.

REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION

REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION

GECC IS A REGULATED SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY AND IN 2011 BECAME SUBJECT TO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FRB) SUPERVISION UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DFA). IN 2013, THE U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (FSOC) DESIGNATED GECC AS A NONBANK SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (NONBANK SIFI) UNDER THE DFA. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE IN SUPERVISION AND DESIGNATION, STRICTER PRUDENTIAL REGULATORY STANDARDS AND SUPERVISION APPLY TO GECC. ON NOVEMBER 25, 2014 THE FRB PROPOSED FOR COMMENT ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS THAT WOULD APPLY TO GECC AS A NONBANK SIFI.  THIS PROPOSAL WOULD, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE GECC TO COMPLY WITH RULES ON CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY THAT APPLY TO LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, MARKET TERMS REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS.  THE PROPOSED STANDARDS WOULD ALSO APPLY STRESS TESTING AND CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS TO GECC UNDER THE FRB'S COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) REGULATIONS. THE COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE PROPOSED STANDARDS CLOSED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2015, AND THE EXACT APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED STANDARDS WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL AFTER THE FINAL RULE IS PUBLISHED.

WHILE THE PROPOSED ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS DO NOT SUBJECT GECC TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S CAPITAL PLAN RULE APPLICABLE TO LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNTIL THE CAPITAL PLANNING CYCLE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016, GECC DOES UNDERTAKE AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THEIR CAPITAL ADEQUACY PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING A PLAN FOR DIVIDENDS TO US, THE PARENT. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON A FORWARD-LOOKING ASSESSMENT OF THEIR MATERIAL ENTERPRISE RISKS AND INVOLVES THE CONSIDERATION OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO INCLUDES AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY LEVELS, AS WELL AS INCORPORATING RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS. THE MOST RECENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY REVIEW WAS APPROVED BY THE GECC BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RISK COMMITTEE IN 2014. WHILE A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY AND NONBANK SIFI LIKE GECC IS CURRENTLY NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FRB APPROVAL TO PAY A DIVIDEND, IT MAY NOT, UNDER FRB REGULATIONS, CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND MANNER. THE FRB HAS ARTICULATED FACTORS THAT IT EXPECTS BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANIES TO CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PAY A DIVIDEND.

IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSED ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, AS A NON-BANK SIFI GECC IS ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL RESOLUTION PLAN TO THE FRB AND FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC).  GECC SUBMITTED ITS FIRST RESOLUTION PLAN TO THE FRB AND FDIC ON JUNE 30, 2014. GECC'S RESOLUTION PLAN DESCRIBES HOW THEY COULD BE RESOLVED UNDER EXISTING INSOLVENCY REGIMES IN A MANNER THAT MITIGATES POTENTIAL DISRUPTION TO THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WITHOUT THE USE OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OR TAXPAYER FUNDS. IF THE FRB AND FDIC DETERMINE THAT THEIR RESOLUTION PLAN IS DEFICIENT, THE DODD-FRANK ACT AUTHORIZES THE FRB AND FDIC TO IMPOSE MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ON GECC OR RESTRICT THEIR GROWTH OR ACTIVITIES UNTIL THEY SUBMIT A PLAN REMEDYING THE DEFICIENCIES. IF THE FRB AND FDIC ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT GECC HAS NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED THE DEFICIENCIES, THEY COULD ORDER GECC TO DIVEST ASSETS OR OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THEIR ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF THEIR FAILURE.

GECC IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE VOLCKER RULE, WHICH U.S. REGULATORS FINALIZED ON DECEMBER 10, 2013. THE RULE PROHIBITS COMPANIES THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH U.S. INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FROM ENGAGING IN "PROPRIETARY TRADING" OR ACQUIRING OR RETAINING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN, OR SPONSORING OR ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH, A "HEDGE FUND" OR A "PRIVATE EQUITY FUND." PROPRIETARY TRADING AND FUND INVESTING, AS PROHIBITED BY THE RULE, ARE NOT CORE ACTIVITIES FOR GECC, BUT WE ARE ASSESSING THE FULL IMPACT OF THE RULE, IN ANTICIPATION OF FULL CONFORMANCE WITH THE RULE, AS REQUIRED BY JULY 21, 2015.

REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION

THE COMPANY IS MAKING THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(R) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

GE MONEY BANK, CZECH REPUBLIC (GEMB CZ) IS A FULL-SERVICE RETAIL BANK IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND A SUBSIDIARY OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION. GEMB CZ MAINTAINS A $7.5 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT AND THREE CASH ACCOUNTS FOR DF DEUTSCHEFORFAIT S.R.O., A CZECH COMPANY (DF SUB), WHICH PURCHASES RECEIVABLES FROM IMPORTS AND EXPORTS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. DF SUB IS A SUBSIDIARY OF DF DEUTSCHE FORFAIT AG, A GERMAN COMPANY (DF PARENT). ON FEBRUARY 6, 2014, DF PARENT WAS ADDED TO THE SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS AND BLOCKED PERSONS (SDN LIST) OF THE OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC) PURSUANT TO E.O. 13382. THE ACCOUNTS AT GEMB CZ FOR DF SUB PRE-DATE THIS DESIGNATION. FOLLOWING THE DESIGNATION, GEMB CZ TERMINATED ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH DF SUB. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSACTIONS WITH DF SUB WERE PERMISSIBLE AND DO NOT VIOLATE U.S. LAW.

RISK MANAGEMENT

A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO RISK IS IMPORTANT IN A DIVERSIFIED ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE EXECUTING ACCORDING TO OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND THAT WE ONLY ACCEPT RISK FOR WHICH WE ARE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED. WE EVALUATE RISK AT THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION LEVEL, AND EVALUATE AGGREGATED RISK AT THE CUSTOMER, INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AND COLLATERAL-TYPE LEVELS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

RESPONSIBILITIES

GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

THE GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOARD) HAS OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT WITH A FOCUS ON THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS FACING THE COMPANY, INCLUDING STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. AT THE END OF EACH YEAR, MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD JOINTLY DEVELOP A LIST OF MAJOR RISKS THAT GE PLANS TO PRIORITIZE IN THE NEXT YEAR. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, THE BOARD AND THE COMMITTEES TO WHICH IT HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY DEDICATE A PORTION OF THEIR MEETINGS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS SPECIFIC RISK TOPICS IN GREATER DETAIL. STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CEO'S REPORT ON OPERATIONS TO THE BOARD AT REGULARLY SCHEDULED BOARD MEETINGS AND AT PRESENTATIONS TO THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES BY THE VICE CHAIRMEN, GE AND GECC CHIEF RISK OFFICERS (CROS), GENERAL COUNSEL AND OTHER EMPLOYEES.

COMMITTEES

THE BOARD HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF SPECIFIC RISKS TO BOARD COMMITTEES AS FOLLOWS.

A VICE-CHAIRMAN OF GE AND GE'S CRO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING AND COORDINATING RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION ON AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE BASIS. THEY LEAD THE CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF KEY BUSINESS RISKS, PROVIDING FOR APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT OF THESE RISKS WITHIN GE BOARD GUIDELINES, AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

POLICY COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD

IS A MANAGEMENT-LEVEL COMMITTEE THAT FURTHER ASSISTS IN ASSESSING AND MITIGATING RISK. THE POLICY COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD, WHICH CONDUCTED 9 COMPLIANCE OPERATING REVIEWS AND MET 3 TIMES IN 2014, IS CHAIRED BY THE COMPANY'S GENERAL COUNSEL AND INCLUDES THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND OTHER SENIOR-LEVEL FUNCTIONAL LEADERS. IT HAS PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE MATTERS ACROSS THE COMPANY.

GE BLUEPRINT REVIEWS

ARE INTEGRATED BUSINESS PLANNING REVIEWS ACROSS GE THAT EVALUATE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, OPERATING AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE, AND ENTERPRISE RISKS. BLUEPRINT REVIEWS ARE HELD AT LEAST 4 TIMES PER YEAR AND INCLUDE THE MOST SENIOR GE BUSINESS LEADERS.

GE CAPITAL ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON GE CAPITAL'S ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE CAN BE FOUND IN THE GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION SECTION BELOW.

RISK MANAGERS

RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGEMENT AND ARE CARRIED OUT THROUGH RISK MANAGERS WHO ARE OPERATIONALLY INTEGRATED INTO EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE RISK MANAGERS HAVE ACQUIRED DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE THROUGH THEIR LONG CAREERS AND PROXIMITY TO THE BUSINESS' OPERATIONS AND CORE PROCESSES. BOTH RISK MANAGERS AND THE BUSINESS LEADERSHIP TEAMS HAVE SPECIFIC, ENTERPRISE RISK FOCUSED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR OVERALL RISK FRAMEWORK.

RISK MITIGATION & COMMUNICATION

RISKS IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES ARE PRIORITIZED AND, DEPENDING ON THE PROBABILITY AND SEVERITY OF THE RISK, ESCALATED TO THE CRO. THESE RISKS ARE DISCUSSED AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM IS ASSIGNED TO THE BUSINESS OR FUNCTIONAL LEADER MOST SUITED TO MANAGE THE RISK IN CONNECTION WITH THE QUARTERLY OPERATING REVIEWS. ASSIGNED OWNERS ARE REQUIRED TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR, EVALUATE AND REPORT ON RISKS FOR WHICH THEY BEAR RESPONSIBILITY. ENTERPRISE RISK LEADERS WITHIN EACH BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTION ARE RESPONSIBLE TO PRESENT TO THE CRO RISK ASSESSMENTS AND KEY RISKS AT LEAST ANNUALLY. WE HAVE GENERAL RESPONSE STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING RISKS, WHICH CATEGORIZE RISKS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL AVOID, TRANSFER, REDUCE OR ACCEPT THE RISK. THESE RESPONSE STRATEGIES ARE TAILORED TO ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE GE BOARD GENERAL GUIDELINES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE RISK INVOLVED AND THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR FUNCTION AFFECTED, WE USE A WIDE VARIETY OF RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES, INCLUDING DELEGATION OF AUTHORITIES, STANDARDIZED PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC PLANNING REVIEWS, OPERATING REVIEWS, INSURANCE, AND HEDGING. AS A MATTER OF POLICY, WE GENERALLY HEDGE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. OUR SERVICE BUSINESSES EMPLOY A COMPREHENSIVE TOLLGATE PROCESS LEADING UP TO AND THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF A CONTRACTUAL SERVICE AGREEMENT TO MITIGATE LEGAL, FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS. FURTHERMORE, WE CENTRALLY MANAGE SOME RISKS BY PURCHASING INSURANCE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY BALANCING THE LEVEL OF RISK RETAINED OR ASSUMED WITH THE COST OF TRANSFERRING RISK TO OTHERS. WE MANAGE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND CUSTOMER DEMAND BY MONITORING INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDING BY ADJUSTING CAPACITY, IMPLEMENTING COST REDUCTIONS AND ENGAGING IN MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.

GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION

GE CAPITAL ACKNOWLEDGES RISK-TAKING AS A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES. IT IS INHERENT TO ITS BUSINESS AND ARISES IN LENDING, LEASING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY GE CAPITAL.

GE CAPITAL'S PHILOSOPHY IS TO HAVE A STRONG CULTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT, COMBINED WITH A SOUND RISK FRAMEWORK THAT EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTS APPROPRIATE RISK AWARENESS, BEHAVIORS AND SOUND RISK-BASED DECISION MAKING. GE CAPITAL RECOGNIZES THAT EFFECTIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT MUST INCLUDE THREE DISTINCT LINES OF DEFENSE INCLUDING BUSINESS UNITS, CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL AUDIT.

BUSINESS UNITS OWN AND MANAGE RISK AS A FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE WITH DEEP RISK EXPERTISE. THE GECC CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION PROVIDES INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AND CHALLENGE AS A SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE. THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ACROSS GECC, INCLUDING STAFF IN BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE, ARE REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS "GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT." THE SENIOR RISK PROFESSIONALS HAVE, ON AVERAGE, OVER 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. INTERNAL AUDIT PROVIDES THE THIRD LINE OF DEFENSE.

CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT LEVERAGES THE RISK INFRASTRUCTURE IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, WHICH HAVE ADOPTED AN APPROACH THAT CORRESPONDS TO GE CAPITAL'S OVERALL RISK POLICIES, GUIDELINES AND REVIEW MECHANISMS. GE CAPITAL'S RISK INFRASTRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ALL RISKS RELEVANT TO ITS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IF MATERIALIZED, COULD PREVENT GE CAPITAL FROM ACHIEVING ITS RISK OBJECTIVES AND/OR RESULT IN LOSSES. THESE RISKS ARE DEFINED AS GE CAPITAL'S ENTERPRISE RISK UNIVERSE, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING RISKS: STRATEGIC, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT, MARKET, COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL (INCLUDING FINANCIAL, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES AND LEGAL). REPUTATIONAL RISK IS CONSIDERED AND MANAGED ACROSS EACH OF THE CATEGORIES.

GE CAPITAL CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO ENHANCE ITS RISK MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES CONSISTENT WITH HEIGHTENED SUPERVISORY EXPECTATION BEFITTING A NONBANK SIFI. AS A RESULT, GE CAPITAL IS EXECUTING ON STRATEGIC PROGRAMS AND AN EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF DELIVERABLES TO IMPROVE DATA AND REPORTING SYSTEMS, RISK AND GOVERNANCE PROCESSES, AND OTHER LARGE SCALE, CRITICAL INITIATIVES INCLUDING CAPITAL PLANNING, MODELS, VALUATIONS AND REGULATORY REPORTING. DURING 2014, GE CAPITAL INCREASED THE NUMBER OF RISK PROFESSIONALS BY 12%.

THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND GECC BOARD OVERSEE GE CAPITAL'S RISK APPETITE, RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GECC BOARD OVERSEE THE GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, WITH THE GECC BOARD APPROVING ALL SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT BORROWINGS AND INVESTMENTS. THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GECC BOARD EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OF INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS MUST COMPLY WITH APPROVAL LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GECC BOARD.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (ERMC), WHICH COMPRISES THE MOST SENIOR LEADERS IN GE CAPITAL AS WELL AS THE GE CRO, OVERSEES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GE CAPITAL'S RISK APPETITE, AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT'S ESTABLISHMENT OF APPROPRIATE SYSTEMS (INCLUDING POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES) TO ENSURE ENTERPRISE RISKS ARE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED, AND CONTROLLED. THE ERMC HAS DELEGATED MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC RISKS TO VARIOUS SUB-COMMITTEES, INCLUDING THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE, CAPITAL PLANNING COMMITTEE, ALLOWANCE AND VALUATION RISK COMMITTEE, CREDIT RISK COMMITTEE AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE. A SIMILAR COMMITTEE STRUCTURE, WHERE APPROPRIATE, IS REPLICATED AT THE BUSINESS UNIT LEVEL.

KEY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE APPROVED BY THE GECC BOARD AND THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AT LEAST ANNUALLY. GE CAPITAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT MEETS WITH THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GECC BOARD THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AT THESE MEETINGS, GE CAPITAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON THE RISK ISSUES, STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE OF THE BUSINESS.

GE CAPITAL'S CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE ERMC, UPDATES THE ENTERPRISE RISK APPETITE STATEMENT ANNUALLY. THIS DOCUMENT ARTICULATES THE ENTERPRISE RISK OBJECTIVES, ITS KEY UNIVERSE OF RISKS AND THE SUPPORTING LIMIT STRUCTURE. GE CAPITAL'S RISK APPETITE IS DETERMINED RELATIVE TO ITS DESIRED RISK OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CREDIT RATINGS, CAPITAL LEVELS, LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS, EARNINGS, DIVIDENDS AND COMPLIANCE. GE CAPITAL DETERMINES ITS RISK APPETITE THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF PORTFOLIO ANALYTICS, INCLUDING STRESS TESTING AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL MEASUREMENT, EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT OF SENIOR RISK OFFICERS, CURRENT PORTFOLIO LEVELS, STRATEGIC PLANNING, AND REGULATORY AND RATING AGENCY EXPECTATIONS.

THE ENTERPRISE RISK APPETITE STATEMENT IS PRESENTED TO THE GECC BOARD AND THE GE RISK COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL AT LEAST ANNUALLY. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE STATUS OF GE CAPITAL'S PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE LIMITS IS REVIEWED BY THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND GECC BOARD.

GE CAPITAL MONITORS ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY INCLUDING THROUGH ECONOMIC CAPITAL, REGULATORY CAPITAL AND ENTERPRISE STRESS TESTING METHODOLOGIES. GE CAPITAL'S ECONOMIC CAPITAL METHODOLOGY USES INTERNAL MODELS TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL UNEXPECTED LOSSES ACROSS DIFFERENT PORTFOLIOS WITH A CONFIDENCE LEVEL EQUIVALENT TO AN AA AGENCY RATING. ALTHOUGH GE CAPITAL IS NOT CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS, GE CAPITAL ESTIMATES CAPITAL ADEQUACY BASED ON THE BASEL 1 AND BASEL 3 U.S. FRAMEWORKS. GE CAPITAL USES STRESS TESTING FOR RISK, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, AND AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF GE CAPITAL'S OVERALL PLANNING PROCESSES. STRESS TESTING RESULTS INFORM KEY STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO DECISIONS SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM EXPECTED REGULATORY CAPITAL LEVELS IN SEVERE BUT PLAUSIBLE STRESSES,

CAPITAL ALLOCATION, ASSIST IN DEVELOPING THE RISK APPETITE AND LIMITS, AND HELP IN ASSESSING PRODUCT SPECIFIC RISK TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND MODIFICATION OF PRODUCT STRUCTURES. THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GECC BOARD REVIEW STRESS TEST RESULTS AND THEIR EXPECTED IMPACT ON CAPITAL LEVELS AND METRICS. THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GECC BOARD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS, AS WELL AS APPROVING GE CAPITAL'S ANNUAL CAPITAL PLAN AND CAPITAL ACTIONS. UNDER ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR GE CAPITAL AS A NONBANK SIFI THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PROPOSED IN NOVEMBER 2014, GE CAPITAL WOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY, STRESS TESTING, CAPITAL PLANNING, RISK MANAGEMENT AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

RISK FACTORS

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS," AS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) SECTION AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

GE'S CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION LEVERAGES THE RISK FRAMEWORK IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH HAVE ADOPTED AN APPROACH THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE COMPANY'S OVERALL RISK POLICIES, GUIDELINES AND REVIEW MECHANISMS. OUR RISK FRAMEWORK OPERATES AT THE BUSINESS AND FUNCTIONAL LEVELS AND IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY, EVALUATE AND MITIGATE RISKS WITHIN EACH OF THE RISK CATEGORIES BELOW.

OUR BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT – SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT – THAN WE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. BELOW, WE DESCRIBE CERTAIN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL, AND LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS' REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WILL AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

STRATEGIC RISKS

STRATEGIC RISK RELATES TO THE COMPANY'S FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS AND STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH: THE GLOBAL MACRO-ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE; MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; AND OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, COMPETITIVE THREATS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT INNOVATION, AND PUBLIC POLICY.

GLOBAL MACRO-ENVIRONMENT - OUR GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS.

WE OPERATE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD AND SERVE CUSTOMERS IN APPROXIMATELY 175 COUNTRIES. IN 2014, APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS. THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION, CURRENCY VOLATILITY, CURRENCY CONTROLS AND ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED DEFAULT ON SOVEREIGN DEBT. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS CAN BE HEDGED USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION MAY DECREASE OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS A RESULT OF MORE VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS.

M&A/RESTRUCTURING - THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS.

WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION AND COLLABORATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED COST SAVINGS FROM RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER MARGIN RATES. WE ALSO PARTICIPATE IN A NUMBER OF JOINT VENTURES WITH OTHER COMPANIES OR GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES IN VARIOUS MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES WHERE WE MAY HAVE A LESSER DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL, LEGAL OR COMPLIANCE RISKS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR EXECUTING ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, DELAYS IN OBTAINING TAX RULINGS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS OR CLEARANCES, AND DISRUPTIONS OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE STAGED EXIT FROM OUR NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL FINANCE BUSINESS, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL, AS PLANNED. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. AFTER REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH A BUYER OR SELLER FOR

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

RISK FACTORS

THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF A BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS AND ALLIANCES WITH ALSTOM OR THE PROPOSED SALE OF APPLIANCES TO ELECTROLUX, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NECESSARY REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS AS WELL AS SATISFACTION OF PRE-CLOSING CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM COMPLETING THE TRANSACTION. DISPOSITIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESS, SUCH AS THROUGH CONTINUING EQUITY OWNERSHIP, GUARANTEES, INDEMNITIES OR OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, PERFORMANCE BY THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES OR OTHER CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO OURS.

OUR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING OR SELLING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE OF OURS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY US TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY. WE COULD ALSO FACE COMPETITION IN SOME COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE NOT INVESTED IN AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO. WE ALSO FACE ATTEMPTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR IT SYSTEMS OR PRODUCTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPROPERLY ACQUIRING OUR TRADE SECRETS OR CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AS A RESULT OF SUCH AN INCIDENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURE OR RETAIN OWNERSHIP OR RIGHTS TO USE DATA IN CERTAIN SOFTWARE ANALYTICS OR SERVICES OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF SUCH CLAIMS, RESPONDING TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. IF GE IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR WE COULD BE ENJOINED FROM OFFERING SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR RENEW FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES WE NEED IN THE FUTURE, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO RISKS ARISING FROM SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, PEOPLE AND EXTERNAL EVENTS THAT AFFECT THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESSES. IT INCLUDES PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE AND EXECUTION; PRODUCT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND DATA PROTECTION AND SECURITY, INCLUDING CYBER SECURITY; SUPPLY CHAIN AND BUSINESS DISRUPTION; AND OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING HUMAN RESOURCES AND REPUTATION.

OPERATIONS - WE MAY FACE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WE ARE DEPENDENT ON MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING PRODUCT LINES, MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INTRODUCTIONS AND PRODUCT AND SERVICE INNOVATIONS FOR CONTINUED REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH.

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR BOTH OUR AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE OR USE LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. WHILE WE HAVE BUILT EXTENSIVE OPERATIONAL PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICING OF SUCH PRODUCTS MEET THE MOST RIGOROUS QUALITY STANDARDS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE OR OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WILL NOT EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL PROCESS FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THROUGH CYBER ATTACKS AND OTHER INTENTIONAL ACTS, THAT COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL PRODUCT, SAFETY, REGULATORY OR ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT OR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS, OPERATIONAL FAILURES OR QUALITY ISSUES, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES OR LABOR RELATIONS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND REQUIRE SKILLED TALENT. OUR LONG-TERM OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP, INTRODUCE, AND MARKET NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO MODIFY EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO CUSTOMIZE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND TO EXECUTE OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT IN LINE WITH OUR PROJECTED PERFORMANCE AND/OR COST ESTIMATES.

RISK FACTORS

CYBERSECURITY - INCREASED CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS, VULNERABILITIES, THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED COMPUTER CRIME COULD POSE A RISK TO OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS, SERVICES AND DATA.

INCREASED GLOBAL CYBERSECURITY VULNERABILITIES, THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED CYBER-RELATED ATTACKS POSE A RISK TO THE SECURITY OF GE'S AND ITS CUSTOMERS', PARTNERS', SUPPLIERS' AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS' PRODUCTS, SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF GE'S AND ITS CUSTOMERS' DATA. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS BY EMPLOYING A NUMBER OF MEASURES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE TRAINING, MONITORING AND TESTING, AND MAINTENANCE OF PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS AND CONTINGENCY PLANS, WE REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO ADDITIONAL KNOWN OR UNKNOWN THREATS. WE ALSO MAY HAVE ACCESS TO SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL OR PERSONAL DATA OR INFORMATION IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES THAT IS SUBJECT TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND CUSTOMER-IMPOSED CONTROLS. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL OR PERSONAL DATA OR INFORMATION, WE MAY BE VULNERABLE TO MATERIAL SECURITY BREACHES, THEFT, MISPLACED OR LOST DATA, PROGRAMMING ERRORS, EMPLOYEE ERRORS AND/OR MALFEASANCE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE COMPROMISING OF SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL OR PERSONAL DATA OR INFORMATION, IMPROPER USE OF OUR SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS OR NETWORKS, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, DISCLOSURE, MODIFICATION OR DESTRUCTION OF INFORMATION, DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, PRODUCTION DOWNTIMES AND OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS. IN ADDITION, A CYBER-RELATED ATTACK COULD RESULT IN OTHER NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION OR COMPETITIVENESS, REMEDIATION OR INCREASED PROTECTION COSTS, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION.

SUPPLY CHAIN - SIGNIFICANT RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, SUPPLIER QUALITY AND SOURCING ISSUES OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. SOME OF THESE SUPPLIERS OR THEIR SUB-SUPPLIERS ARE LIMITED- OR SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. QUALITY AND SOURCING ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RESULT IN LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

FINANCIAL RISKS

FINANCIAL RISK RELATES TO OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO BROAD MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES; CREDIT RISK; AND LIQUIDITY RISK, INCLUDING RISK RELATED TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND OUR AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FUNDING. CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS ARISING FROM A CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY FAILURE TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE FACE CREDIT RISK IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS IN OUR GE CAPITAL INVESTING, LENDING AND LEASING ACTIVITIES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACTIVITIES. LIQUIDITY RISK REFERS TO THE POTENTIAL INABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OR CONTINGENT FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS (WHETHER ON- OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET) AS THEY ARISE, AND COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT AN INSTITUTION'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OVERALL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS.

ECONOMY/COUNTER-PARTIES - A DETERIORATION OF CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE OR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, OR THE SOUNDNESS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTS WE DEAL WITH, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CONDITIONS IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, POWER GENERATION, OIL AND GAS, HEALTHCARE, HOME BUILDING AND OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY FASHION AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS DETERIORATION, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING DUE TO SLOWER GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OTHER CHALLENGES AFFECTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. IN PARTICULAR, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL IS CORRELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF SLOW GROWTH IN THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONALLY THAT RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAFFIC COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. SERVICE CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OR CUSTOMER DYNAMICS SUCH AS EARLY AIRCRAFT RETIREMENTS OR REDUCED ELECTRICITY DEMAND IN OUR POWER & WATER BUSINESS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

114

RISK FACTORS

CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IF SLOWER GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IF CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DETERIORATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING REAL ESTATE, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND TAX ASSETS. DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES, IMPAIRMENTS OR WRITE-OFFS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, GE CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION, GE CAPITAL'S CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL HELD CANNOT BE REALIZED THROUGH SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES INSUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS EXPOSURE TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF CASH ON DEPOSIT AND UNSECURED DEBT INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING TO CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT), WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY LOSSES OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE'S OR GE CAPITAL'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CREDIT RATINGS - FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, GE AND GECC'S LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS SERVICE (S&P) WAS AA+ (THE SECOND HIGHEST OF 22 RATING CATEGORIES) WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY'S) FOR GE WAS AA3 (THE FOURTH HIGHEST OF 21 RATING CATEGORIES) AND FOR GECC WAS A1 (THE FIFTH HIGHEST OF 21 CREDIT RATINGS), BOTH WITH STABLE OUTLOOKS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, GE AND GECC'S SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING FROM S&P WAS A-1+ (THE HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF SIX CATEGORIES) AND FROM MOODY'S WAS P-1 (THE HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF FOUR CATEGORIES). THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS. VARIOUS DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION.

FUNDING ACCESS/COSTS - CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FUNDING.

AS DISCLOSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, A PORTION OF OUR BORROWINGS IS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT. WE CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR TERM AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MATURITIES FOR 2014 AND BEYOND AND TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL U.S. TAX. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS TO REFINANCE MATURING COMMERCIAL PAPER DEBT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN ORDER TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES, GE CAPITAL CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS RELIANCE ON ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING BANK DEPOSITS, SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER ASSET-BASED FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN INCREASING THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR FUNDING SOURCES OR THAT THE SHORT AND LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS WILL BE AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE COST OF FUNDING WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE AND AFFECT OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING OR CAUSE AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING COSTS INCLUDE: A DECREASED RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM FUNDING, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, IN FAVOR OF LONGER-TERM FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS; DECREASED CAPACITY AND INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG DEBT ISSUERS; INCREASED COMPETITION FOR DEPOSITS IN OUR AFFILIATE BANKS' MARKETS; AND POTENTIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS OR OTHER IMPACTS ARISING IN THE UNITED STATES OR EUROPE FROM DEVELOPMENTS IN SOVEREIGN DEBT SITUATIONS. IF

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

RISK FACTORS

GE CAPITAL'S COST OF FUNDING WERE TO INCREASE, IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND RESULT IN LOWER NET INTEREST MARGINS, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AS WELL AS LOWER RETURNS ON ITS SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND INVESTED CAPITAL.

SOCIAL COSTS - SUSTAINED INCREASES IN PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS COSTS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. GAAP REQUIRES THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USE TO ESTIMATE PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2015 ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO EQUITY. AT THE END OF 2014, THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED, ON A GAAP BASIS, BY $15.8 BILLION, AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN, AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD A PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $6.6 BILLION. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). FAILURE TO ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS DRIVEN BY VARIOUS FACTORS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE A CONTINUED ENVIRONMENT OF LOW INTEREST RATES OR SUSTAINED MARKET VOLATILITY, COULD ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS. IN ADDITION, UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY OUR PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, SEE THE OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION – POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS SECTION AND NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. SEE ALSO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES – PENSION ASSUMPTIONS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY OUR PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

LEGAL & COMPLIANCE RISKS

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK RELATES TO RISKS ARISING FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND ACTION, INCLUDING RESULTING FROM THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DFA); AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE WITH INTEGRITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO FINANCIAL REPORTING, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY RISK INCLUDES THE RISK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR REGULATORY ACTIONS WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COST ON US OR CAUSE US TO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS OR PRACTICES.

REGULATORY - WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND NON-U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN WAYS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS BY RESTRICTING EXISTING ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTS, SUBJECTING THEM TO ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITING THEM OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR, SUBSTANTIAL REVISIONS THAT U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERTAKING OR CONSIDERING IN AREAS SUCH AS THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CONSUMER LENDING, FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION IN RESPONSE TO CURRENCY VOLATILITY, TRADE CONTROLS, THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKET AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON GE'S AND GE CAPITAL'S STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS, SALES, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, GE'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH NON-U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH HAD EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2013, WAS REINSTATED IN DECEMBER 2014 RETROACTIVELY FOR ONE YEAR THROUGH THE END OF 2014. THIS PROVISION ALSO HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAD BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS ON SEVEN PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN THE

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

116

RISK FACTORS

EVENT THE PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2014, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2015. IN ADDITION, EFFORTS BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE COSTS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REIMBURSEMENTS AND INCREASED UTILIZATION CONTROLS RELATED TO THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. CONTINUED GOVERNMENT SCRUTINY, INCLUDING REVIEWS OF THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (U.S. FDA) MEDICAL DEVICE PRE-MARKET AUTHORIZATION AND POST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE PROCESSES, MAY IMPACT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SLOW OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE BEEN, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE, PARTICIPATING IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH STRICT GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS. INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STATUS IN THESE PROJECTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

DODD-FRANK - UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO PRUDENTIAL OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF GECC'S DESIGNATION AS A NONBANK SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (NONBANK SIFI), WHICH SUBJECTS US TO INCREASED AND EVOLVING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

GECC IS A REGULATED SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY AND IN 2011 BECAME SUBJECT TO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FRB) SUPERVISION UNDER THE DFA. IN 2013, THE U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (FSOC) DESIGNATED GECC AS A NONBANK SIFI UNDER THE DFA. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE IN SUPERVISION AND DESIGNATION, STRICTER PRUDENTIAL REGULATORY STANDARDS AND SUPERVISION APPLY TO GECC. ON NOVEMBER 25, 2014 THE FRB PROPOSED FOR COMMENT ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS THAT WOULD APPLY TO GECC AS A NONBANK SIFI.  THIS PROPOSAL WOULD, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE GECC TO COMPLY WITH RULES ON CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY THAT APPLY TO LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, MARKET TERMS REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS.  IN ADDITION, WHILE GECC'S CAPITAL ADEQUACY AS A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY, INCLUDING PLANNED CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS SUCH AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE FRB, THE PROPOSED STANDARDS WOULD APPLY STRESS TESTING AND CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS TO GECC UNDER THE FRB'S MORE FORMAL COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) REGULATIONS.  THE COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE PROPOSED STANDARDS CLOSED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2015, AND THE EXACT APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED STANDARDS WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL AFTER THE FINAL RULE IS PUBLISHED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE THE REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION AND LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS SECTIONS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. WE, OUR REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO CONTINUING SCRUTINY BY REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH MAY, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND DAMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. THESE INCLUDE THE DREDGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE, AS DESCRIBED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS OF BUSINESSES WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED, MEANS THAT LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THERE ARE 15 LAWSUITS RELATING TO PENDING MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE CLAIMS IN WHICH WMC, OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS THAT WE SOLD IN 2007, IS A PARTY. THE ADVERSE PARTIES IN THESE CASES ARE SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR PARTIES CLAIMING TO ACT ON THEIR BEHALF. WHILE THE ALLEGED CLAIMS FOR RELIEF VARY FROM CASE TO CASE, THE COMPLAINTS AND COUNTERCLAIMS IN THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY ASSERT CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, INDEMNIFICATION, AND/OR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, AND SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE (REPURCHASE) AND/OR MONETARY DAMAGES. BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2013, WMC ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENTS THAT REDUCED ITS EXPOSURE ON CLAIMS ASSERTED IN CERTAIN SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE CLAIM AMOUNTS REPORTED HEREIN REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THESE SETTLEMENTS.

FIVE WMC CASES ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT. FOUR OF THESE CASES WERE INITIATED IN 2012, AND ONE WAS INITIATED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2013. DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY (DEUTSCHE BANK) IS THE ADVERSE PARTY IN FOUR CASES, AND LAW DEBENTURE TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK (LAW DEBENTURE) IS THE ADVERSE PARTY IN ONE CASE. THE DEUTSCHE BANK COMPLAINTS ASSERT CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $4,300 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND SEEK TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY $1,800 MILLION. THE LAW DEBENTURE COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND ALLEGES LOSSES ON THESE LOANS IN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION. ON MARCH 31, 2014, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED WMC'S MOTIONS TO DISMISS THESE CASES.

FOUR WMC CASES ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AGAINST US BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (US BANK), ONE OF WHICH WAS INITIATED BY WMC SEEKING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT. THREE OF THESE CASES WERE FILED IN 2012, AND ONE WAS FILED IN 2011. THE MINNESOTA CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND DO NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES SOUGHT. IN SEPTEMBER 2013, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART WMC'S MOTIONS TO DISMISS OR FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN THESE CASES.  ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2014, US BANK FILED A PETITION FOR INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF TRUSTS IN MINNESOTA STATE COURT SEEKING AUTHORIZATION AND INSTRUCTION FOR US BANK TO IMPLEMENT THE TERMS OF A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REACHED WITH WMC TO COMPROMISE, SETTLE, AND RELEASE ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE SECURITIZATIONS AT ISSUE IN THESE FOUR LAWSUITS.  IN FEBRUARY 2015, TWO BONDHOLDERS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, AND IN RESPONSE THE COURT HAS SCHEDULED AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING FOR JUNE 2015.  IN LIGHT OF THE STATE COURT ACTION SEEKING APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE DISTRICT COURT HAS ENTERED ORDERS ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2014 STAYING FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN THE FOUR CASES UNTIL APRIL 15, 2015.

FOUR CASES ARE PENDING AGAINST WMC IN NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT, ALL OF WHICH WERE INITIATED BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR SECURITIES ADMINISTRATORS. THESE CASES INVOLVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, CLAIMS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY $4,559 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. ONE OF THESE LAWSUITS WAS INITIATED BY DEUTSCHE BANK IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2013 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC AND BARCLAYS BANK PLC. IT INVOLVES CLAIMS AGAINST WMC ON APPROXIMATELY $1,000 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND DOES NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES SOUGHT. THE SECOND CASE, IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF IS THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON (BNY), WAS INITIATED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2012 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC, J.P. MORGAN MORTGAGE ACQUISITION CORPORATION AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. BNY ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $1,300 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $650 MILLION. THE THIRD CASE WAS INITIATED BY BNY IN NOVEMBER 2013 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC, J.P. MORGAN MORTGAGE ACQUISITION CORPORATION AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. IN THIS CASE, BNY ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $1,300 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $600 MILLION. THE FOURTH CASE WAS FILED IN OCTOBER 2014 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC, J.P. MORGAN MORTGAGE ACQUISITION CORPORATION AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. THE PLAINTIFF, BNY, ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $959 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $475 MILLION.

TWO CASES ARE PENDING AGAINST WMC IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. ONE CASE, IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF IS BNY, WAS FILED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2012. IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2013, BNY FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN WHICH IT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $378 MILLION. IN SEPTEMBER 2013, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED WMC'S MOTION TO DISMISS. ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2014, THE DISTRICT COURT ISSUED AN ORDER DIRECTING THE PARTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS BEFORE A PRIVATE MEDIATOR OR THE ASSIGNED

MAGISTRATE JUDGE. FOLLOWING THIS MEDIATION, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE ON THE CLAIMS ARISING FROM A PORTION OF THE LOANS HELD IN THE TRUST (THE "GROUP 1" LOANS) , AND, AS A RESULT, ON FEBRUARY 9, 2015 THE DISTRICT COURT STAYED THE CASE AS TO THESE CLAIMS. THE SECOND CASE WAS INITIATED BY THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY (FHFA), WHICH FILED A SUMMONS WITH NOTICE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2012. IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2013, DEUTSCHE BANK, IN ITS ROLE AS SECURITIZATION TRUSTEE OF THE TRUST AT ISSUE IN THE CASE, INTERVENED AS A PLAINTIFF AND FILED A COMPLAINT RELATING TO APPROXIMATELY $1,300 MILLION OF LOANS AND ALLEGING LOSSES IN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION. IN DECEMBER 2013, THE DISTRICT COURT ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING WMC'S MOTION TO DISMISS. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE DISTRICT COURT ON ITS OWN MOTION REQUESTED THAT THE PARTIES RE-BRIEF SEVERAL ISSUES RAISED BY WMC'S MOTION TO DISMISS.

THE AMOUNTS OF THE CLAIMS AT ISSUE IN THESE CASES (DISCUSSED ABOVE) REFLECT THE PURCHASE PRICE OR UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS AT ISSUE AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND DO NOT GIVE EFFECT TO PAY DOWNS, ACCRUED INTEREST OR FEES, OR POTENTIAL RECOVERIES BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. ALL OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS INVOLVED IN THESE LAWSUITS ARE INCLUDED IN WMC'S REPORTED CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THE COMPANY IS REPORTING THE FOLLOWING MATTER IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEC REQUIREMENTS TO DISCLOSE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS A PARTY POTENTIALLY INVOLVING MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000 OR GREATER. IN OCTOBER 2014, THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS SEEKING PENALTIES UNDER THE CLEAN AIR AND RESOURCE AND CONSERVATION RECOVERY ACTS IN CONNECTION WITH A FACILITY SOLD TO MOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, INC. IN 2006. THE ALLEGATIONS RELATE TO IMPROPER OPERATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL MONITORING EQUIPMENT BY INCINERATOR OPERATORS.

GENERALLY, AN INSTRUMENT THAT PROVIDES AN OWNERSHIP POSITION IN A CORPORATION (A STOCK), A CREDITOR RELATIONSHIP WITH A CORPORATION OR GOVERNMENTAL BODY (A BOND), RIGHTS TO CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS BACKED BY POOLS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS OR RIGHTS TO OWNERSHIP SUCH AS THOSE REPRESENTED BY OPTIONS, SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS AND SUBSCRIPTION WARRANTS.

MATCH FUNDING

A RISK CONTROL POLICY THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR A PARTICULAR FINANCIAL ASSET HAVING THE SAME CURRENCY, MATURITY AND INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS AS THAT ASSET.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE LEND AT A FIXED INTEREST RATE IN THE U.S., WE CAN BORROW THOSE U.S. DOLLARS EITHER AT A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST OR AT A FLOATING RATE EXECUTED CONCURRENTLY WITH A PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP. SEE "HEDGE."

MONETIZATION

SALE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY FOR CASH. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SELL CERTAIN LOANS, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND TRADE RECEIVABLES TO THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL BUYERS, TYPICALLY PROVIDING AT LEAST SOME CREDIT PROTECTION AND OFTEN AGREEING TO PROVIDE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING SERVICES FOR A FEE. MONETIZATION NORMALLY RESULTS IN GAINS ON INTEREST-BEARING ASSETS AND LOSSES ON NON-INTEREST-BEARING ASSETS. SEE "SECURITIZATION" AND "VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY."

NET INTEREST MARGIN

GLOSSARY

SECURITIZATION

A PROCESS WHEREBY LOANS OR OTHER RECEIVABLES ARE PACKAGED, UNDERWRITTEN AND SOLD TO INVESTORS. IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION, ASSETS ARE SOLD TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH PURCHASES THE ASSETS WITH CASH RAISED THROUGH ISSUANCE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS (USUALLY DEBT INSTRUMENTS) TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. WHETHER OR NOT CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITIZED ASSETS IS RETAINED BY THE SELLER DEPENDS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION. SEE "MONETIZATION" AND "VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY."

SUBPRIME

FOR PURPOSES OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISCUSSION, SUBPRIME INCLUDES CONSUMER FINANCE PRODUCTS LIKE MORTGAGE, AUTO, CARDS, SALES FINANCE AND PERSONAL LOANS TO U.S. AND GLOBAL BORROWERS WHOSE CREDIT SCORE IMPLIES A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT BASED UPON GECC'S PROPRIETARY SCORING MODELS AND DEFINITIONS, WHICH ADD VARIOUS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS TO A BASE CREDIT SCORE SUCH AS A FICO SCORE OR GLOBAL BUREAU SCORE. ALTHOUGH FICO AND GLOBAL BUREAU CREDIT SCORES ARE A WIDELY ACCEPTED RATING OF INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER CREDITWORTHINESS, THE INTERNALLY MODELED SCORES ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE BEHAVIOR AND DEFAULT RISKS IN THE PORTFOLIO COMPARED WITH STAND-ALONE GENERIC BUREAU SCORES.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY

AN ENTITY THAT MUST BE CONSOLIDATED BY ITS PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, THE PARTY THAT HOLDS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY HAS ONE OR BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: (1) ITS EQUITY AT RISK IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES, OR (2) AS A GROUP, THE EQUITY INVESTORS LACK ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: (A) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTITY, (B) OBLIGATION TO ABSORB EXPECTED LOSSES, OR (C) RIGHT TO RECEIVE EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

WE BELIEVE THAT GREAT COMPANIES ARE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF RELIABLE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE LAW. FOR GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, THAT FOUNDATION INCLUDES RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT OF, AND AN UNYIELDING DEDICATION TO, CONTROLLERSHIP. THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES IN THIS REPORT ARE ONE PRODUCT OF OUR COMMITMENT TO HIGH-QUALITY FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN ADDITION, WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ADOPT APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE DEVOTE OUR FULL RESOURCES TO ENSURING THAT THOSE POLICIES ARE APPLIED PROPERLY AND CONSISTENTLY AND WE DO OUR BEST TO FAIRLY PRESENT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT IS COMPLETE AND UNDERSTANDABLE.

MEMBERS OF OUR CORPORATE LEADERSHIP TEAM REVIEW EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ON MATTERS THAT RANGE FROM OVERALL STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO STAFFING AND COMPLIANCE. OUR BUSINESS LEADERS MONITOR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING SYSTEMS, ENABLING US TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CONCERNS AT AN EARLY STAGE AND POSITIONING US TO RESPOND RAPIDLY. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OVERSEES MANAGEMENT'S BUSINESS CONDUCT, AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, OVERSEES OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. WE CONTINUALLY EXAMINE OUR GOVERNANCE PRACTICES IN AN EFFORT TO ENHANCE INVESTOR TRUST AND IMPROVE THE BOARD'S OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS. THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES ANNUALLY CONDUCT A PERFORMANCE SELF-EVALUATION AND RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS. OUR LEAD DIRECTOR CHAIRED THREE MEETINGS OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS THIS YEAR, HELPING US SHARPEN OUR FULL BOARD MEETINGS TO BETTER COVER SIGNIFICANT TOPICS. COMPENSATION POLICIES FOR OUR EXECUTIVES ARE ALIGNED WITH THE LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF GE INVESTORS.

WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A DYNAMIC SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES—INCLUDING INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING—DESIGNED TO ENSURE RELIABLE FINANCIAL RECORDKEEPING, TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE, AND PROTECTION OF PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE RECRUIT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN A WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL TEAM. OUR INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF OUR CORPORATE AUDIT STAFF, CONDUCTS THOUSANDS OF FINANCIAL, COMPLIANCE AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT AUDITS EACH YEAR. OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSEES THE SCOPE AND EVALUATES THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THESE AUDITS, AND MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE REGULARLY ATTEND GE CAPITAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CORPORATE AUDIT STAFF AND CONTROLLERSHIP COUNCIL MEETINGS. OUR GLOBAL INTEGRITY POLICIES—"THE SPIRIT & THE LETTER"—REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND POLICY, AND PERTAIN TO SUCH VITAL ISSUES AS UPHOLDING FINANCIAL INTEGRITY AND AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THESE INTEGRITY POLICIES ARE AVAILABLE IN 31 LANGUAGES, AND ARE PROVIDED TO ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES, HOLDING EACH OF THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMPLIANCE. OUR STRONG COMPLIANCE CULTURE REINFORCES THESE EFFORTS BY REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO RAISE ANY COMPLIANCE CONCERNS AND BY PROHIBITING RETRIBUTION FOR DOING SO. TO FACILITATE OPEN AND CANDID COMMUNICATION, WE HAVE DESIGNATED OMBUDSPERSONS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY TO ACT AS INDEPENDENT RESOURCES FOR REPORTING INTEGRITY OR COMPLIANCE CONCERNS. WE HOLD OUR DIRECTORS, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO THE SAME INTEGRITY STANDARDS.

WE ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FULL AND OPEN PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND RELY FOR THIS PURPOSE ON OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING OUR DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE, WHICH COMPRISES SENIOR EXECUTIVES WITH DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE RELATED NEEDS OF OUR INVESTORS. WE ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO REVIEW OUR COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, TO EVALUATE THE FAIRNESS OF OUR FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES, AND TO REPORT THEIR FINDINGS TO US. IN 2014, WE FURTHER ENSURED STRONG DISCLOSURE BY HOLDING APPROXIMATELY 70 ANALYST AND INVESTOR MEETINGS WITH GE LEADERSHIP PRESENT.

WE WELCOME THE STRONG OVERSIGHT OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING ACTIVITIES BY OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, KPMG LLP, ENGAGED BY AND REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. U.S. LEGISLATION REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR AUDITORS TO RENDER AN OPINION ON SUCH CONTROLS.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT ON OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THEIR REPORT FOLLOWS.

REPORTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO SHAREOWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (THE "COMPANY") AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, AND THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014. WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION ("COSO"). THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY COSO.

OUR AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE. THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION APPEARING ON PAGES 129, 133 AND 135 IS PRESENTED FOR PURPOSES OF ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RATHER THAN TO PRESENT THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES. THE CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE AUDITING PROCEDURES APPLIED IN THE AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND, IN OUR OPINION, IS FAIRLY STATED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS IN RELATION TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

PRESENTATION & POLICIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP).

CONSOLIDATION

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR AFFILIATES – ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. TO DETERMINE IF WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY, WE FIRST EVALUATE IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) MODEL TO THE ENTITY, OTHERWISE THE ENTITY IS EVALUATED UNDER THE VOTING INTEREST MODEL.

WHERE WE HOLD CURRENT OR POTENTIAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE US THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE COMBINED WITH A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT GIVES US THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OR THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THAT VIE. RIGHTS HELD BY OTHERS TO REMOVE THE PARTY WITH POWER OVER THE VIE ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNLESS ONE PARTY CAN EXERCISE THOSE RIGHTS UNILATERALLY. WHEN CHANGES OCCUR TO THE DESIGN OF AN ENTITY, WE RECONSIDER WHETHER IT IS SUBJECT TO THE VIE MODEL. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE.

WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN OTHER ENTITIES WHERE WE CURRENTLY HOLD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTING RIGHTS OR WHERE WE EXERCISE CONTROL THROUGH SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS OR AS A GENERAL PARTNER. WHERE WE ARE A GENERAL PARTNER, WE CONSIDER SUBSTANTIVE REMOVAL RIGHTS HELD BY OTHER PARTNERS IN DETERMINING IF WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. WE REEVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THESE ENTITIES WHEN OUR VOTING OR SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS CHANGE.

ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, BUT OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A VOTING INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%. ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. RESULTS OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN, AND ADVANCES TO, ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS IN THE CAPTION "ALL OTHER ASSETS" IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, WHICH REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN SUCH ASSETS.

SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

ON AUGUST 5, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL FINANCE BUSINESS, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL, AS A FIRST STEP IN A PLANNED, STAGED EXIT FROM THAT BUSINESS. SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL CLOSED THE IPO OF 125 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE TO THE PUBLIC OF $23.00 PER SHARE AND ON SEPTEMBER 3, 2014, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 3.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO AN OPTION GRANTED TO THE UNDERWRITERS IN THE IPO (UNDERWRITERS' OPTION). WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM THE IPO AND THE UNDERWRITERS' OPTION OF $2,842 MILLION, WHICH REMAIN AT SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL. FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE IPO AND THE UNDERWRITERS' OPTION, WE CURRENTLY OWN APPROXIMATELY 85% OF SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL AND AS A RESULT, GECC CONTINUES TO CONSOLIDATE THE BUSINESS. THE 15% IS PRESENTED AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. IN ADDITION, IN AUGUST 2014, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $3,593 MILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT WITH MATURITIES UP TO 10 YEARS AND $8,000 MILLION OF UNSECURED TERM LOANS MATURING IN 2019, AND IN OCTOBER 2014 COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $750

MILLION OF UNSECURED TERM LOANS MATURING IN 2019

UNDER THE NEW BANK TERM LOAN FACILITY WITH THIRD PARTY LENDERS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT-YEAR'S PRESENTATION.

FINANCIAL DATA AND RELATED MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

GE.

THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OTHER THAN GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC), WHOSE CONTINUING OPERATIONS ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS, GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS AMONG SUCH AFFILIATES.

GECC.

THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OF GECC, GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS AMONG SUCH AFFILIATES.

CONSOLIDATED.

THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF GE AND GECC, GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECC.

OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THESE COMPRISE OUR EIGHT BUSINESSES, FOCUSED ON THE BROAD MARKETS THEY SERVE: POWER & WATER, OIL & GAS, ENERGY MANAGEMENT, AVIATION, HEALTHCARE, TRANSPORTATION, APPLIANCES & LIGHTING AND GE CAPITAL.

UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, INFORMATION IN THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED. SEE NOTE 2.

THE EFFECTS OF TRANSLATING TO U.S. DOLLARS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES, WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS.

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, UNEMPLOYMENT, MARKET LIQUIDITY, THE REAL ESTATE MARKET, ETC.), WHICH AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES CONTEMPLATE CURRENT CONDITIONS AND HOW WE EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, AS APPROPRIATE, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IN 2015 ACTUAL CONDITIONS COULD BE WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED IN THOSE ESTIMATES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, SUCH CHANGES COULD RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES.

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

WE RECORD ALL SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES ONLY WHEN A FIRM SALES AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED AND COLLECTABILITY OF THE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE SALES PRICE IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOMETIMES INCLUDE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS. MOST OF OUR MULTIPLE COMPONENT ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN THE HEALTHCARE SEGMENT. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS USUALLY INVOLVE AN UPFRONT DELIVERABLE OF LARGE MACHINERY OR EQUIPMENT AND FUTURE SERVICE DELIVERABLES SUCH AS INSTALLATION, COMMISSIONING, TRAINING OR THE FUTURE DELIVERY OF ANCILLARY PRODUCTS. IN MOST CASES, THE RELATIVE VALUES OF THE UNDELIVERED COMPONENTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE OVERALL ARRANGEMENT AND ARE TYPICALLY DELIVERED WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CORE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED. IN SUCH AGREEMENTS, SELLING PRICE IS DETERMINED FOR EACH COMPONENT AND ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL OF THE SEPARATE SELLING PRICES AND TOTAL CONTRACT CONSIDERATION (I.E., DISCOUNT) IS ALLOCATED PRO RATA ACROSS EACH OF THE COMPONENTS IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO EACH COMPONENT IS OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED AND OBTAINED PRIMARILY FROM SOURCES SUCH AS THE SEPARATE SELLING PRICE FOR THAT OR A SIMILAR ITEM OR FROM COMPETITOR PRICES FOR SIMILAR ITEMS. IF SUCH EVIDENCE IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE, WHICH IS ESTABLISHED CONSISTENT WITH THE PRICING STRATEGY OF THE BUSINESS AND CONSIDERS PRODUCT CONFIGURATION, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER TYPE, AND OTHER MARKET SPECIFIC FACTORS.

EXCEPT FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF GOODS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION

. WE OFTEN SELL CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN. WE USE OUR ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE TO ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR SUCH RETURNS WHEN WE RECORD THE SALE. IN SITUATIONS WHERE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS BASED ON SELLER OR CUSTOMER-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE CRITERIA, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE HAVE RELIABLY DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL SPECIFIED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET OR WHEN FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OCCURS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE PROVIDE GOODS FOR TRIAL AND EVALUATION PURPOSES, WE ONLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE AFTER CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OCCURS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, WE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR ANTICIPATED LOSSES BEFORE WE RECORD SALES.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON AGREEMENTS FOR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES UNDER POWER GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS, NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES, LARGER OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS, AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS, MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, LOCOMOTIVE PRODUCTION CONTRACTS, AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, USING LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION AND PRODUCTION CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. WE ESTIMATE TOTAL LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUE NET OF PRICE CONCESSIONS AS WELL AS TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS. FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER POWER GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS, NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES, AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS, MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS AND LOCOMOTIVE PRODUCTION CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES AS WE COMPLETE MAJOR CONTRACT-SPECIFIED DELIVERABLES, MOST OFTEN WHEN CUSTOMERS RECEIVE TITLE TO THE GOODS OR ACCEPT THE SERVICES AS PERFORMED. FOR LARGER OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES BASED ON OUR PROGRESS TOWARD CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN RELATION TO OUR ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE MEASURE LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUES BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY FOR SALES OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES, MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND RELATED SPARE PARTS NOT SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS. DELIVERY OF COMMERCIAL ENGINES, NON-U.S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND ALL RELATED SPARE PARTS OCCURS ON SHIPMENT; DELIVERY OF MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT SOLD TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AGENCIES THEREOF OCCURS UPON RECEIPT OF A MATERIAL INSPECTION AND RECEIVING REPORT, DD FORM 250 OR MEMORANDUM OF SHIPMENT. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES ARE COMPLEX EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURED TO CUSTOMER ORDER UNDER A VARIETY OF SOMETIMES COMPLEX, LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS. WE MEASURE SALES OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES AND COSTS FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINE AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRICE CONCESSIONS AND PERFORMANCE-RELATED GUARANTEES AS WELL AS MATERIAL, LABOR AND OVERHEAD COSTS. WE MEASURE REVENUE FOR MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS NOT SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC CONTRACT ON A SPECIFICALLY MEASURED OUTPUT BASIS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE; CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, WE MAKE SUCH PROVISION ONLY IF SUCH LOSSES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE HIGHLY PROBABLE SALES OF SPARE PARTS AND SERVICES FOR THOSE ENGINES.

WE SELL PRODUCT SERVICES UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT MAINTENANCE OR EXTENDED WARRANTY AGREEMENTS IN OUR AVIATION, POWER & WATER, OIL & GAS AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS, WHERE COSTS OF PERFORMING SERVICES ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. WE ALSO SELL PRODUCT SERVICES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SEGMENT, WHERE SUCH COSTS GENERALLY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. FOR THE AVIATION, POWER & WATER, OIL & GAS AND TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE RELATED SALES BASED ON THE EXTENT OF OUR PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. FOR THE HEALTHCARE AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS AND EXPENSE RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

PRESENTATION & POLICIES

GECC REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME)

WE USE THE INTEREST METHOD TO RECOGNIZE INCOME ON LOANS. INTEREST ON LOANS INCLUDES ORIGINATION, COMMITMENT AND OTHER NON-REFUNDABLE FEES RELATED TO FUNDING (RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD). WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, WE CONTINUE TO ACCRUE INTEREST ON CONSUMER CREDIT CARDS UNTIL THE ACCOUNTS ARE WRITTEN OFF IN THE PERIOD THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE. PREVIOUSLY, WE STOPPED ACCRUING INTEREST ON CONSUMER CREDIT CARDS WHEN THE ACCOUNT BECAME 90 DAYS PAST DUE. PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED INTEREST INCOME THAT WAS ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED FROM THE BORROWER IS REVERSED, UNLESS THE TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT PERMIT CAPITALIZATION OF ACCRUED INTEREST TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE.

ALTHOUGH WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST IN ADVANCE OF PAYMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST INCOME AS CASH IS COLLECTED WHEN APPROPRIATE, PROVIDED THE AMOUNT DOES NOT EXCEED THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EARNED AT THE HISTORICAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE; OTHERWISE, PAYMENTS RECEIVED ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN.

WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONACCRUAL, NON-RESTRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOANS ONLY WHEN (A) PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE LOAN'S ORIGINAL TERMS AND (B) FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED. WHEN WE AGREE TO RESTRUCTURED TERMS WITH THE BORROWER, WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY ASSURED THAT WE WILL RECOVER FULL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS, AND SUCH LOANS PASS UNDERWRITING REVIEWS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE APPLIED TO NEW LOANS. WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONACCRUAL CONSUMER LOANS WHEN THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT IS LESS THAN 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND COLLECTION OF SUCH AMOUNTS IS PROBABLE. INTEREST ACCRUALS ON MODIFIED CONSUMER LOANS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRS) MAY RETURN TO CURRENT STATUS (RE-AGED) ONLY AFTER RECEIPT OF AT LEAST THREE CONSECUTIVE MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OR THE EQUIVALENT CUMULATIVE AMOUNT, SUBJECT TO A RE-AGING LIMITATION OF ONCE A YEAR, OR TWICE IN A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

WE RECOGNIZE FINANCING LEASE INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD TO PRODUCE A LEVEL YIELD ON FUNDS NOT YET RECOVERED. ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF THE LEASED ASSET AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. WE USE VARIOUS SOURCES OF DATA IN DETERMINING THIS ESTIMATE, INCLUDING INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED FOR THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC ASSET UNDER LEASE. GUARANTEES OF RESIDUAL VALUES BY UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES ARE CONSIDERED PART OF MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN ESTIMATING RESIDUAL VALUES INCLUDE ESTIMATED NET CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERM, ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF FUTURE REMARKETING, AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COMPONENT PART AND SCRAP METAL PRICES, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE.

WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF UNDERLYING LEASES.

FEES INCLUDE COMMITMENT FEES RELATED TO LOANS THAT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO FUND AND LINE-OF-CREDIT FEES. WE RECORD THESE FEES IN EARNED INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PERIOD TO WHICH THEY RELATE. WE RECORD SYNDICATION FEES IN EARNED INCOME AT THE TIME RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED, UNLESS SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES EXIST.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COST OF GE MANUFACTURING PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. U.S. ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED USING AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED ON A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA; NON-U.S. ASSETS ARE GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

THE COST OF GECC EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS ON OPERATING LEASES IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER THE LEASE TERM OR OVER THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT.

THE COST OF GECC ACQUIRED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO THE ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OVER THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OR THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS UPON SALE OF THE INVESTMENT AT THE END OF THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD IF THAT APPROACH PRODUCES A HIGHER MEASURE OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRESENTATION & POLICIES

THE COST OF INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS IS AMORTIZED IN PROPORTION TO ESTIMATED TOTAL RELATED SALES; COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET'S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. SEE NOTES 7 AND 8.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED FINANCING RECEIVABLE. SUCH AN ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL VALUES (INCLUDING HOUSING PRICE INDICES AS APPLICABLE), AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO PROVIDE FOR LOSSES ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT CONDITIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES. WRITE-OFFS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES WHEN WE JUDGE THE PRINCIPAL TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE AND SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES ARE ADDED TO THE ALLOWANCE AT THE TIME CASH IS RECEIVED ON A WRITTEN-OFF ACCOUNT.

"IMPAIRED" LOANS ARE DEFINED AS LARGER-BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CONSUMER AND A PORTION OF OUR COMMERCIAL LENDING AND LEASING (CLL) NONACCRUAL RECEIVABLES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS DEFINITION, AS THEY REPRESENT SMALLER-BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS THAT WE EVALUATE COLLECTIVELY BY PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT.

IMPAIRED LOANS INCLUDE NONACCRUAL RECEIVABLES ON LARGER-BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS, LOANS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PAYING INTEREST UNDER THE CASH BASIS AND LOANS PAYING CURRENTLY THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY RESTRUCTURED.

SPECIFIC RESERVES ARE RECORDED FOR INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED LOANS TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. CERTAIN LOANS CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED MAY NOT REQUIRE A RESERVE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY COLLECT THE UNPAID BALANCE (THROUGH COLLECTION OR COLLATERAL REPOSSESSION).

"TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS" (TDRS) ARE THOSE LOANS FOR WHICH WE HAVE GRANTED A CONCESSION TO A BORROWER EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES WHERE WE DO NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION. SUCH LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED, AND ARE INDIVIDUALLY REVIEWED FOR SPECIFIC RESERVES.

"NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES" ARE THOSE ON WHICH WE HAVE STOPPED ACCRUING INTEREST. WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, FOR WHICH WE CONTINUE TO ACCRUE INTEREST UNTIL THE ACCOUNTS ARE WRITTEN OFF IN THE PERIOD THAT THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE. ALTHOUGH WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST IN ADVANCE OF PAYMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST INCOME AS CASH IS COLLECTED WHEN APPROPRIATE PROVIDED THE AMOUNT DOES NOT EXCEED THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EARNED AT THE HISTORICAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DELINQUENT WHEN PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURED TERMS, BUT MAY REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A PERIOD OF SATISFACTORY PAYMENT PERFORMANCE BY THE BORROWER AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF COLLECTION.

"DELINQUENT" RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRESENTATION & POLICIES

THE SAME FINANCING RECEIVABLE MAY MEET MORE THAN ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS ABOVE. ACCORDINGLY, THESE CATEGORIES ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A PARTICULAR LOAN TO MEET THE DEFINITIONS OF A TDR, IMPAIRED LOAN AND NONACCRUAL LOAN AND BE INCLUDED IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES. THE CATEGORIZATION OF A PARTICULAR LOAN ALSO MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS.

OUR CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF SMALLER-BALANCE, HOMOGENEOUS LOANS, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. WE COLLECTIVELY EVALUATE EACH PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON THESE RECEIVABLES IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH A PROCESS THAT ESTIMATES THE PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BASED UPON STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF PORTFOLIO DATA. THESE ANALYSES INCLUDE MIGRATION ANALYSIS, IN WHICH HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IS APPLIED TO THE CURRENT AGING OF THE PORTFOLIO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER ANALYSES THAT REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS AND CONDITIONS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE TO DATE BASED ON ACTUAL DEFAULTED LOANS AND OVERALL PORTFOLIO INDICATORS INCLUDING NONACCRUAL LOANS, TRENDS IN LOAN VOLUME AND LENDING TERMS, CREDIT POLICIES AND OTHER OBSERVABLE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND HOME PRICE INDICES.

OUR COMMERCIAL LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF LOANS AND LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH LARGER-BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES AND SMALLER-BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES. LOSSES ON SUCH LOANS AND LEASES ARE RECORDED WHEN PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO FOR POTENTIAL SPECIFIC CREDIT OR COLLECTION ISSUES THAT MIGHT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT.

FOR LARGER-BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES, WE CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL STATUS, PAYMENT HISTORY, COLLATERAL VALUE, INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND GUARANTOR SUPPORT RELATED TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. ANY DELINQUENCIES OR BANKRUPTCIES ARE INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT REQUIRING FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF COLLECTABILITY. WE ROUTINELY RECEIVE FINANCIAL AS WELL AS RATING AGENCY REPORTS ON OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE ELEVATE FOR FURTHER ATTENTION THOSE CUSTOMERS WHOSE OPERATIONS WE JUDGE TO BE MARGINAL OR DETERIORATING. WE ALSO ELEVATE CUSTOMERS FOR FURTHER ATTENTION WHEN WE OBSERVE A DECLINE IN COLLATERAL VALUES FOR ASSET-BASED LOANS. WHILE COLLATERAL VALUES ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, WHEN WE OBSERVE SUCH A DECLINE, WE EVALUATE RELEVANT MARKETS TO ASSESS RECOVERY ALTERNATIVES – FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REAL ESTATE LOANS, RELEVANT MARKETS ARE LOCAL; FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT LOANS, RELEVANT MARKETS ARE GLOBAL.

MEASUREMENT OF THE LOSS ON OUR IMPAIRED COMMERCIAL LOANS IS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN'S EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OR THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, NET OF EXPECTED SELLING COSTS, IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL DEPENDENT. WE DETERMINE WHETHER A LOAN IS COLLATERAL DEPENDENT IF THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. OUR REVIEW PROCESS CAN OFTEN RESULT IN RESERVES BEING ESTABLISHED IN ADVANCE OF A MODIFICATION OF TERMS OR DESIGNATION AS A TDR. AFTER PROVIDING FOR SPECIFIC INCURRED LOSSES, WE THEN DETERMINE AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED IN THE BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BUT CANNOT YET BE IDENTIFIED TO A SPECIFIC LOAN OR LEASE. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED UPON VARIOUS STATISTICAL ANALYSES CONSIDERING HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY AND AGING, AS WELL AS OUR VIEW ON CURRENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IT IS PREPARED BY EACH RESPECTIVE LINE OF BUSINESS. FOR REAL ESTATE, THIS INCLUDES ASSESSING THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT BASED ON LOSS HISTORY OF OUR PORTFOLIO FOR LOANS WITH SIMILAR LOAN METRICS AND ATTRIBUTES.

WE CONSIDER MULTIPLE FACTORS IN EVALUATING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON REAL ESTATE FINANCING RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, COLLATERAL VALUES AT THE INDIVIDUAL LOAN LEVEL, DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS, DELINQUENCY STATUS, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND REAL ESTATE MARKET FORECASTS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, WE EVALUATE A REAL ESTATE LOAN FOR IMPAIRMENT CLASSIFICATION IF ITS PROJECTED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO AT MATURITY IS IN EXCESS OF 100%, EVEN IF THE LOAN IS CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS CONTRACTUAL TERMS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LOANS IN THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO ARE CONSIDERED COLLATERAL DEPENDENT AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL. IF FORECLOSURE IS DEEMED PROBABLE OR IF REPAYMENT IS DEPENDENT SOLELY ON THE SALE OF COLLATERAL, WE ALSO INCLUDE ESTIMATED SELLING COSTS IN OUR RESERVE. COLLATERAL VALUES FOR OUR REAL ESTATE LOANS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON INTERNAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE AND CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE. COLLATERAL VALUATIONS ARE ROUTINELY MONITORED AND UPDATED ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY FOR CHANGES IN COLLATERAL, MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE IS IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS SECTION BELOW.

EXPERIENCE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR NEW PRODUCTS; THEREFORE, WHILE WE ARE DEVELOPING THAT EXPERIENCE, WE SET LOSS ALLOWANCES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MOST CLOSELY ANALOGOUS PRODUCTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO.

OUR LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGY INTENDS TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND, AT TIMES, CAN RESULT IN RATE REDUCTIONS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, EXTENSIONS, FORBEARANCE OR OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE RELATED LOAN TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A TDR.

WE UTILIZE CERTAIN LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING TEMPORARY FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN OUR CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO. THESE LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN OUR NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND NON-U.S. INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING PORTFOLIOS AND INCLUDE SHORT-TERM (THREE MONTHS OR LESS) INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS, WHICH WERE NOT PART OF THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. WE SOLD OUR U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BUSINESS IN 2007 AND, AS SUCH, DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED MORTGAGE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS.

OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ON THESE MODIFIED CONSUMER LOANS IS DETERMINED BASED UPON A FORMULAIC APPROACH THAT ESTIMATES THE PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BASED UPON STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF THE PORTFOLIO. DATA RELATED TO REDEFAULT EXPERIENCE IS ALSO CONSIDERED IN OUR OVERALL RESERVE ADEQUACY REVIEW. ONCE THE LOAN HAS BEEN MODIFIED, IT RETURNS TO CURRENT STATUS (RE-AGED) ONLY AFTER RECEIPT OF AT LEAST THREE CONSECUTIVE MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OR THE EQUIVALENT CUMULATIVE AMOUNT, SUBJECT TO A RE-AGING LIMITATION OF ONCE A YEAR, OR TWICE IN A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL GUIDELINES ON UNIFORM RETAIL CREDIT CLASSIFICATION AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT POLICY ISSUED IN JUNE 2000. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES WOULD NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT HAD WE NOT RE-AGED THESE ACCOUNTS.

FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS, WE EVALUATE CHANGES IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE CHANGES MEET THE CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION AS A TDR ON A LOAN-BY-LOAN BASIS. IN CLL, THESE CHANGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE: CHANGES TO COVENANTS, SHORT-TERM PAYMENT DEFERRALS AND MATURITY EXTENSIONS. FOR THESE CHANGES, WE RECEIVE ECONOMIC CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL FEES AND/OR INCREASED INTEREST RATES, AND EVALUATE THEM UNDER OUR NORMAL UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND CRITERIA. CHANGES TO REAL ESTATE

'

S LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE MATURITY EXTENSIONS, PRINCIPAL PAYMENT ACCELERATION, CHANGES TO COLLATERAL TERMS, AND CASH SWEEPS, WHICH ARE IN ADDITION TO, OR SOMETIMES IN LIEU OF, FEES AND RATE INCREASES. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THESE CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR COMMERCIAL LOANS MEET THE TDR CRITERIA INCLUDES OUR CONSIDERATION OF ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN THE BORROWER IS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, WE CAREFULLY EVALUATE THESE CHANGES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE FORM OF A CONCESSION. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IF THE CHANGE IS DEEMED TO BE A CONCESSION, WE CLASSIFY THE LOAN AS A TDR.

WHEN WE REPOSSESS COLLATERAL IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN, WE WRITE DOWN THE RECEIVABLE AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. REPOSSESSED COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION "ALL OTHER ASSETS" IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

FOR CONSUMER LOANS, WE WRITE OFF UNSECURED CLOSED-END INSTALLMENT LOANS WHEN THEY ARE 120 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE AND UNSECURED OPEN-ENDED REVOLVING LOANS AT 180 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE. WE WRITE DOWN CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY COLLATERAL OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE WHEN SUCH LOANS ARE 120 DAYS PAST DUE. CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE (BOTH REVOLVING AND CLOSED-END LOANS) ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, LESS COSTS TO SELL, NO LATER THAN WHEN THEY BECOME 180 DAYS PAST DUE. UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS IN BANKRUPTCY ARE WRITTEN OFF WITHIN 60 DAYS OF NOTIFICATION OF FILING BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT OR WITHIN CONTRACTUAL WRITE-OFF PERIODS, WHICHEVER OCCURS EARLIER.

WRITE-OFFS ON LARGER-BALANCE IMPAIRED COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE BASED ON AMOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY. WRITE-OFFS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORKOUT PLAN OR RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN, VALUATION OF THE COLLATERAL AND THE PRIORITIZATION OF OUR CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY. WRITE-OFFS ARE RECOGNIZED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AT THE EARLIER OF TRANSACTION CONFIRMATION (FOR EXAMPLE, DISCOUNTED PAY-OFF, RESTRUCTURING, FORECLOSURE, ETC.) OR NOT LATER THAN 360 DAYS AFTER INITIAL RECOGNITION OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE FOR A COLLATERAL DEPENDENT LOAN. IF FORECLOSURE IS PROBABLE, THE WRITE-OFF IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL LESS COSTS TO SELL. SMALLER-BALANCE, HOMOGENEOUS COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF AT THE EARLIER OF WHEN DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE OR AT 180 DAYS PAST DUE.

PARTIAL SALES OF BUSINESS INTERESTS

GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF AFFILIATE SHARES WHERE WE RETAIN A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY. GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES THAT RESULT IN OUR LOSS OF A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS ALONG WITH REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON ANY INVESTMENTS IN THE ENTITY THAT WE RETAINED.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

DEBT SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE INCLUDED IN CASH EQUIVALENTS UNLESS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REPORT INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 21 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS

EQUITY, NET OF APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA.

FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. WE ALSO EVALUATE QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDING DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. IF WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, WE CONSIDER THE SECURITY TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AND WE RECORD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY

IF WE INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE SECURITY IS ALSO CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AND WE RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY

'

S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, WE CONSIDER THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION. IF WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, WE CONSIDER THE SECURITY TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AND WE RECORD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY'S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS.

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

ALL INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR REALIZABLE VALUES. COST FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GE U.S. INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) BASIS. COST OF OTHER GE INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS. LIFO WAS USED FOR 40% AND 39% OF GE INVENTORIES AT 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT TEST IT AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. A REPORTING UNIT IS THE OPERATING SEGMENT, OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THAT OPERATING SEGMENT (THE COMPONENT LEVEL) IF DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PREPARED AND REGULARLY REVIEWED BY SEGMENT MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, COMPONENTS ARE AGGREGATED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT IF THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL. WE USE A MARKET APPROACH, WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, OR THE INCOME APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES. WHEN A PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DISPOSED, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSITION BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESS OR BUSINESSES DISPOSED AND THE PORTION OF THE REPORTING UNIT THAT WILL BE RETAINED.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. THE COST OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET'S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE, EXCEPT THAT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED IN RELATION TO TOTAL RELATED SALES. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND, IF IMPAIRED, WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE BASED ON EITHER DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AS REQUIRED.

GECC INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS

CERTAIN ENTITIES THAT WE CONSOLIDATE PROVIDE GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY TO STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES.

OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PROVIDING INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE FOR LIFE AND HEALTH RISKS AND PROVIDING CERTAIN ANNUITY PRODUCTS. TWO PRIMARY PRODUCT GROUPS ARE PROVIDED: TRADITIONAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITH SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY AND/OR MORBIDITY RISKS, WHILE INVESTMENT CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITHOUT SUCH RISKS.

FOR SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE, WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME OVER THE TERMS OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS, GENERALLY ON A PRO-RATA BASIS. FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS INCLUDING LONG-TERM CARE, TERM, WHOLE LIFE AND ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ANNUITANT, WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME WHEN DUE.

PREMIUMS RECEIVED ON INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (INCLUDING ANNUITIES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY RISK) ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUES BUT RATHER AS DEPOSIT LIABILITIES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FOR CHARGES AND ASSESSMENTS ON THESE CONTRACTS, MOSTLY FOR MORTALITY, CONTRACT INITIATION, ADMINISTRATION AND SURRENDER. AMOUNTS CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

LIABILITIES FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE PRESENT VALUE OF SUCH BENEFITS LESS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE NET PREMIUMS BASED ON MORTALITY, MORBIDITY, INTEREST AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AT THE TIME THE POLICIES WERE ISSUED OR ACQUIRED. LIABILITIES FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS EQUAL THE ACCOUNT VALUE, THAT IS, THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES TO THE BENEFIT OF THE CONTRACT OR POLICYHOLDER INCLUDING CREDITED INTEREST AND ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. FOR GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, THE LIABILITY IS ALSO ADJUSTED AS A RESULT OF FAIR VALUE HEDGING ACTIVITY.

LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATIONS FOR REPORTED AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED CLAIMS AND THE RELATED ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES. LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED THROUGH CURRENT OPERATIONS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A MARKET PARTICIPANT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES, WHILE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT OUR MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. PREFERENCE IS GIVEN TO OBSERVABLE INPUTS. THESE TWO TYPES OF INPUTS CREATE THE FOLLOWING FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

LEVEL 1 –

QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 2 –

QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS WHOSE INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR WHOSE SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE.

LEVEL 3 –

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL ARE UNOBSERVABLE.

WE MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO VALUE INSTRUMENTS USING THE BEST AND MOST RELEVANT DATA AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT REVIEW VALUATION, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT PRICE VALIDATION FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS. WITH REGARD TO LEVEL 3 VALUATIONS (INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS VALUED BY THIRD PARTIES), WE PERFORM A VARIETY OF PROCEDURES TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE VALUATIONS. SUCH REVIEWS, WHICH MAY BE PERFORMED QUARTERLY, MONTHLY OR WEEKLY, INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FAIR VALUE CHANGE EXCEEDS PREDEFINED THRESHOLDS (AND/OR DOES NOT CHANGE) AND CONSIDER THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS OTHER PUBLISHED DATA, SUCH AS RATING AGENCY MARKET REPORTS AND CURRENT APPRAISALS. THESE REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED WITHIN EACH BUSINESS BY THE ASSET AND RISK MANAGERS, PRICING COMMITTEES AND VALUATION COMMITTEES. A DETAILED REVIEW OF METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS PERFORMED BY INDIVIDUALS INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS WITH A FAIR VALUE EXCEEDING PREDEFINED THRESHOLDS. THIS DETAILED REVIEW MAY INCLUDE THE USE OF A THIRD-PARTY VALUATION FIRM.

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE DIFFERENT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1. LEVEL 1 SECURITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES.

FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR WHICH MARKET PRICES ARE OBSERVABLE FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INVESTMENT SECURITIES BUT NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE FOR EACH OF THOSE INVESTMENTS INDIVIDUALLY (THAT IS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PRICING INFORMATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT SECURITY AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE), WE OBTAIN PRICING INFORMATION FROM AN INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDOR. THE PRICING VENDOR USES VARIOUS PRICING MODELS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE. THE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS TO THE MODEL OF THE PRICING VENDOR ARE DERIVED FROM MARKET OBSERVABLE SOURCES INCLUDING: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS, OFFERS, AND OTHER MARKET-RELATED DATA. SINCE MANY FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE METHODOLOGY OF THE PRICING VENDOR USES AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS APPLICABLE SUCH AS BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS, AND MATRIX PRICING. THE PRICING VENDOR CONSIDERS AVAILABLE MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS IN DETERMINING THE EVALUATION FOR A SECURITY. THUS, CERTAIN SECURITIES MAY NOT BE PRICED USING QUOTED PRICES, BUT RATHER DETERMINED FROM MARKET OBSERVABLE INFORMATION. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 AND PRIMARILY COMPRISE OUR PORTFOLIO OF CORPORATE FIXED INCOME, AND GOVERNMENT, MORTGAGE AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. IN INFREQUENT CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR PRICING VENDORS MAY PROVIDE US WITH VALUATIONS THAT ARE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE CLASSIFY THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN LEVEL 3.

ANNUALLY, WE CONDUCT REVIEWS OF OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR TO VALIDATE THAT THE INPUTS USED IN THAT VENDOR'S PRICING PROCESS ARE DEEMED TO BE MARKET OBSERVABLE AS DEFINED IN THE STANDARD. WHILE WE ARE NOT PROVIDED ACCESS TO PROPRIETARY MODELS OF THE VENDOR, OUR REVIEWS HAVE INCLUDED ON-SITE WALK-THROUGHS OF THE PRICING PROCESS, METHODOLOGIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR EACH ASSET CLASS AND LEVEL FOR WHICH PRICES ARE PROVIDED. OUR REVIEWS ALSO INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR A SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ACROSS ASSET CLASSES, CREDIT RATING LEVELS AND VARIOUS DURATIONS, A PROCESS WE PERFORM EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE PRICING VENDOR HAS AN ESTABLISHED CHALLENGE PROCESS IN PLACE FOR ALL SECURITY VALUATIONS, WHICH FACILITATES IDENTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF POTENTIALLY ERRONEOUS PRICES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM OUR PRICING VENDOR ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT PRICES) AND ARE CLASSIFIED APPROPRIATELY IN THE HIERARCHY.

WE USE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES AS OUR PRIMARY BASIS FOR VALUATION WHEN THERE IS LIMITED, OR NO, RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY FOR A SPECIFIC INSTRUMENT OR FOR OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT SHARE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. WE HAVE NOT ADJUSTED THE PRICES WE HAVE OBTAINED. INVESTMENT SECURITIES PRICED USING NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. AS IS THE CASE WITH OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR, THIRD-PARTY BROKERS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THEIR PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL CONDUCT REVIEWS OF VENDORS, AS APPLICABLE, SIMILAR TO THE REVIEWS PERFORMED OF OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR. IN ADDITION, WE CONDUCT INTERNAL REVIEWS OF PRICING FOR ALL SUCH INVESTMENT SECURITIES QUARTERLY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS OF VALUATIONS USED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE REVIEWS ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PRICES THAT APPEAR STALE, THOSE THAT HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRIOR VALUATIONS, AND OTHER ANOMALIES THAT MAY INDICATE THAT A PRICE MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUES PROVIDED BY THE BROKERS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT PRICES).

DERIVATIVES.

WE USE CLOSING PRICES FOR DERIVATIVES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE TRADED EITHER ON EXCHANGES OR LIQUID OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING INTERNAL MODELS. THE MODELS MAXIMIZE THE USE OF MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES AND BOTH FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 PRIMARILY REPRESENT INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 PRIMARILY REPRESENT EQUITY DERIVATIVES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY OR PREPAYMENT FEATURES.

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

CERTAIN ASSETS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS. THESE ASSETS ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AN ONGOING BASIS, BUT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE ASSETS CAN INCLUDE LOANS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE HELD FOR SALE, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE IMPAIRED AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, IF WE SELL A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND RETAIN A NONCONTROLLING STAKE IN THE ENTITY. ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN IMPAIRED AND RETAINED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS AND FOR CERTAIN ASSETS WITHIN OUR PENSION PLANS AND RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE.

WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICING ON RECENT CLOSED MARKET TRANSACTIONS, TO VALUE LOANS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2. WHEN THIS DATA IS UNOBSERVABLE, WE USE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USING CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATE DATA ADJUSTED FOR INHERENT CREDIT RISK, AND SUCH LOANS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. WHEN APPROPRIATE, LOANS MAY BE VALUED USING COLLATERAL VALUES (SEE LONG-LIVED ASSETS BELOW).

COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.

COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE. WHEN MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA IS UNAVAILABLE, INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SOURCES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE VALUED USING NET ASSET VALUES. THE NET ASSET VALUES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REDEEMABLE AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. INVESTMENTS IN COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING REAL ESTATE.

FAIR VALUES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AIRCRAFT AND REAL ESTATE, ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED INTERNALLY AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVED SALES TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR ASSETS. IN OTHER INSTANCES, FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL TYPES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE COMPARABLE OBSERVED SALES TRANSACTION DATA, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY AND CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISAL INFORMATION. ADJUSTMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY VALUATIONS MAY BE PERFORMED IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MARKET COMPARABLES ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL OR APPRAISAL INFORMATION MAY NOT BE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND THE OCCURRENCE OF MARKET EVENTS SINCE RECEIPT OF THE INFORMATION. FOR REAL ESTATE, FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES THAT REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE PROFILES AND AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT CAPITALIZATION RATES AND EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTS AND OCCUPANCY AND ARE CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISALS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3.

RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF OUR RETAINED NONCONTROLLING STAKE IS VALUED USING MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, OR IF NOT AVAILABLE, AN INCOME APPROACH, A MARKET APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE. IN APPLYING THESE METHODOLOGIES, WE RELY ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS, FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, MARKET OBSERVABLE PRICING MULTIPLES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, AND POSSIBLE CONTROL PREMIUM. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 3, AS APPROPRIATE, DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.

. THIS ASU CHANGES THE CRITERIA FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION, THE DISPOSAL OF A COMPONENT OR GROUP OF COMPONENTS MUST REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT THAT HAS, OR WILL HAVE, A MAJOR EFFECT ON AN ENTITY'S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE ASU ALSO EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE TRANSACTIONS THAT MEET THE NEW CRITERIA TO BE CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE REVISED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL DISPOSALS (OR CLASSIFICATIONS AS HELD FOR SALE) OF COMPONENTS OF AN ENTITY AND FOR BUSINESSES THAT, UPON ACQUISITION, ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE ON OR AFTER ADOPTION. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR DISPOSALS (OR CLASSIFICATIONS AS HELD FOR SALE) THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE EFFECTS OF APPLYING THE REVISED GUIDANCE WILL VARY BASED UPON THE NATURE AND SIZE OF FUTURE DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT FEWER DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS WILL MEET THE NEW CRITERIA TO BE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

NBCU

ON MARCH 19, 2013, WE CLOSED A TRANSACTION TO SELL OUR REMAINING 49% COMMON EQUITY INTEREST IN NBCUNIVERSAL LLC (NBCU LLC) TO COMCAST CORPORATION (COMCAST) FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $16,722 MILLION, CONSISTING OF $11,997 MILLION IN CASH, $4,000 MILLION IN COMCAST GUARANTEED DEBT AND $725 MILLION IN PREFERRED STOCK. THE $4,000 MILLION OF DEBT AND THE $725 MILLION OF PREFERRED SHARES WERE BOTH ISSUED BY A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF COMCAST. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013, BOTH OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE SOLD AT APPROXIMATELY PAR VALUE. IN ADDITION, COMCAST IS OBLIGATED TO SHARE WITH US POTENTIAL TAX SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH COMCAST'S PURCHASE OF OUR NBCU LLC INTEREST, IF REALIZED. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THESE POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE SALE, BUT ARE RECORDING SUCH PAYMENTS IN INCOME AS THEY ARE RECEIVED. GECC ALSO SOLD REAL ESTATE COMPRISING CERTAIN FLOORS LOCATED AT 30 ROCKEFELLER CENTER, NEW YORK AND THE CNBC PROPERTY LOCATED IN ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, NEW JERSEY TO AFFILIATES OF NBCU LLC FOR $1,430 MILLION IN CASH.

GE MONEY JAPAN

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WHICH INCLUDED OUR JAPANESE PERSONAL LOAN BUSINESS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SALE, WE REDUCED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE FOR ESTIMATED REFUND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE STATUTORY INTEREST RATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE WERE TO BE INCREASED OR DECREASED BASED ON THE ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOSS-SHARING TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE SALE AGREEMENT, WITH ALL CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF 258 BILLION JAPANESE YEN (APPROXIMATELY $3,000 MILLION) REMAINING OUR RESPONSIBILITY. ON FEBRUARY 26, 2014, WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BUYER TO PAY 175 BILLION JAPANESE YEN (APPROXIMATELY $1,700 MILLION) TO EXTINGUISH THIS OBLIGATION. WE HAVE NO REMAINING AMOUNT PAYABLE UNDER THE FEBRUARY 26, 2014 AGREEMENT AS OUR RESERVE FOR REFUND CLAIMS OF $1,836 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WAS FULLY PAID IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014.

WMC

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF WMC, OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS. WMC SUBSTANTIALLY DISCONTINUED ALL NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, AND IS NOT A LOAN SERVICER. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, WMC RETAINED CERTAIN REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO LOANS SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES PRIOR TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUSINESS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS THAT HAD AN EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT. ALL CLAIMS RECEIVED BY WMC FOR EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT HAVE EITHER BEEN RESOLVED OR ARE NO LONGER BEING PURSUED.

THE REMAINING ACTIVE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR ADMINISTRATORS SEEKING RECOVERY FROM WMC FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ON MORTGAGE LOANS THAT SERVE AS COLLATERAL FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, SUCH CLAIMS CONSISTED OF $3,694 MILLION OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS GENERALLY SUBMITTED BEFORE THE FILING OF A LAWSUIT (COMPARED TO $5,643 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013) AND $9,225 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST WMC IN LITIGATION WITHOUT MAKING A PRIOR CLAIM (LITIGATION CLAIMS) (COMPARED TO $6,780 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013). THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THESE CLAIMS, $12,919 MILLION, REFLECTS THE PURCHASE PRICE OR UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES OF THE LOANS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO PAY DOWNS OR POTENTIAL RECOVERIES BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WHICH IN MANY CASES ARE SUBSTANTIAL, NOR TO ACCRUED INTEREST OR FEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $1,070 MILLION OF REPURCHASE CLAIMS RELATING TO ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS THAT ARE NOT IN LITIGATION AND THAT ARE BEYOND THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. WMC BELIEVES THAT REPURCHASE CLAIMS BROUGHT BASED UPON REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE MORE THAN SIX YEARS BEFORE WMC WAS NOTIFIED OF THE CLAIM WOULD BE DISALLOWED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS.

GE 2014 FORM 10-K

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HELD FOR SALE & DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

RESERVES RELATED TO REPURCHASE CLAIMS MADE AGAINST WMC WERE $809 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, REFLECTING A NET INCREASE TO RESERVES IN THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 OF $9 MILLION DUE TO INCREMENTAL PROVISIONS OFFSET BY SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY.

THE RESERVE ESTIMATE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT RECENT SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY AND IS BASED UPON WMC'S EVALUATION OF THE REMAINING EXPOSURES AS A PERCENTAGE OF ESTIMATED LIFETIME MORTGAGE LOAN LOSSES WITHIN THE POOL OF LOANS SUPPORTING EACH SECURITIZATION. SETTLEMENTS IN PRIOR PERIODS REDUCED WMC'S EXPOSURE ON CLAIMS ASSERTED IN CERTAIN SECURITIZATIONS AND THE CLAIM AMOUNTS REPORTED ABOVE GIVE EFFECT TO THESE SETTLEMENTS.

GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ACTIVITY AND WMC'S CONTINUING EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE LAWSUITS INVOLVING CLAIMS MADE AGAINST WMC, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE LOSSES WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH WMC'S PAST EXPERIENCE. ADVERSE CHANGES TO WMC'S ASSUMPTIONS SUPPORTING THE RESERVE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THESE RESERVES.

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH RECENT SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY AND THE POTENTIAL VARIABILITY OF SETTLEMENTS,

WMC ESTIMATES A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FROM $0 TO APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION OVER ITS RECORDED RESERVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. THIS ESTIMATE EXCLUDES ANY POSSIBLE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION ON THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AS WMC IS UNABLE AT THIS TIME TO DEVELOP SUCH A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, THERE WERE 15 LAWSUITS INVOLVING CLAIMS MADE AGAINST WMC ARISING FROM ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ON MORTGAGE LOANS INCLUDED IN 14 SECURITIZATIONS. THE ADVERSE PARTIES IN THESE CASES ARE SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR PARTIES CLAIMING TO ACT ON THEIR BEHALF. ALTHOUGH THE ALLEGED CLAIMS FOR RELIEF VARY FROM CASE TO CASE, THE COMPLAINTS AND COUNTERCLAIMS IN THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY ASSERT CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, INDEMNIFICATION, AND/OR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, AND SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE (REPURCHASE OF DEFECTIVE MORTGAGE LOAN) AND/OR MONEY DAMAGES. ADVERSE COURT DECISIONS, INCLUDING IN CASES NOT INVOLVING WMC (SUCH AS THE NEW YORK COURT OF APPEALS' DECISION ON STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, EXPECTED IN 2015), COULD RESULT IN NEW CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS ON ADDITIONAL LOANS. HOWEVER, WMC CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, BASED ON CAUSATION AND MATERIALITY REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OR IMPACT OF THESE DEFENSES AND OTHER FACTORS, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF ANY LOSS ULTIMATELY INCURRED BY WMC ON THESE CLAIMS.

WMC HAS ALSO RECEIVED INDEMNIFICATION DEMANDS, NEARLY ALL OF WHICH ARE UNSPECIFIED, FROM DEPOSITORS/UNDERWRITERS/SPONSORS OF RMBS IN CONNECTION WITH LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY RMBS INVESTORS CONCERNING ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS IN THE SECURITIZATION OFFERING DOCUMENTS TO WHICH WMC IS NOT A PARTY OR, IN TWO CASES, INVOLVING MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE CLAIMS MADE AGAINST RMBS SPONSORS. WMC BELIEVES THAT IT HAS DEFENSES TO THESE DEMANDS.

TO THE EXTENT WMC IS REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS, WMC'S LOSS ALSO WOULD BE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PAY DOWNS, ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES, AND THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. THE RESERVE AND ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS REFLECT JUDGMENT, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, AND A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CLAIM AND SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY, PENDING AND THREATENED LITIGATION, COURT DECISIONS REGARDING WMC'S LEGAL DEFENSES, INDEMNIFICATION DEMANDS, GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY, AND OTHER VARIABLES IN THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY. ACTUAL LOSSES ARISING FROM CLAIMS AGAINST WMC COULD EXCEED THESE AMOUNTS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS COULD RESULT IF ACTUAL CLAIM RATES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, LITIGATION AND INDEMNIFICATION ACTIVITY, ADVERSE COURT DECISIONS, ACTUAL SETTLEMENT RATES OR LOSSES WMC INCURS ON REPURCHASED LOANS DIFFER FROM ITS ASSUMPTIONS.

THE MAJORITY RELATE TO DEBT SECURITIES HELD TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS OF GICS AND MORE THAN 70% ARE DEBT SECURITIES THAT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE INVESTMENT-GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI) USING BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, OUR QUALITATIVE REVIEW CONSIDERS OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. OUR QUANTITATIVE REVIEW CONSIDERS WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT LOSS THAT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN MARKET YIELDS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES. WE PRESENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE SECURITIES BEFORE ANTICIPATED RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST. THE METHODOLOGIES AND SIGNIFICANT INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT LOSS FOR OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES DURING 2014 HAVE NOT CHANGED. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, WE CONSIDER THE DURATION AND THE SEVERITY OF THE UNREALIZED LOSS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EQUITY SECURITIES WILL BE RECOVERED WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

OUR CORPORATE DEBT PORTFOLIO COMPRISES SECURITIES ISSUED BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CORPORATIONS IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES ARE RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

OUR RMBS PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED PRIMARILY BY POOLS OF INDIVIDUAL, DIRECT MORTGAGE LOANS, OF WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN A SENIOR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEALS, NOT OTHER STRUCTURED PRODUCTS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. OF THE TOTAL RMBS HELD AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, $1,191 MILLION AND $534 MILLION RELATED TO AGENCY AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, $287 MILLION WAS RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT SECURITIES, PRIMARILY SUPPORTING OUR GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SUBPRIME EXPOSURE IS RELATED TO SECURITIES BACKED BY MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND PRIOR. A MAJORITY OF SUBPRIME RMBS HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE AND ARE INSURED BY MONOLINE INSURERS (MONOLINES). WE CONTINUE TO PLACE PARTIAL RELIANCE ON MONOLINES WITH ADEQUATE CAPITAL AND CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE MONOLINE'S ANTICIPATED ABILITY TO COVER EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES.

OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS) PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED BY BOTH DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF MORTGAGES THAT WERE ORIGINATED FOR SECURITIZATION (CONDUIT CMBS) AND POOLS OF LARGE LOANS BACKED BY HIGH-QUALITY PROPERTIES (LARGE LOAN CMBS), A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE ORIGINATED IN 2007 AND PRIOR. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SECURITIES IN OUR CMBS PORTFOLIO HAVE INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATINGS.

OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ABS) PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED BY SENIOR SECURED LOANS OF HIGH-QUALITY, MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF ASSETS SUCH AS STUDENT LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS.

ALTHOUGH WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL ANY SPECIFIC SECURITIES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF MANAGING OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WE MAY SELL SECURITIES PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITIES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING DIVERSIFICATION, CREDIT QUALITY, YIELD AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND THE FUNDING OF CLAIMS AND OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS. IN SOME OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES, WE MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PURCHASES AND SALES VOLUME PRINCIPALLY OF NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES. IN THESE SITUATIONS, FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE FOR THESE SECURITIES.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013 INCLUDED $264 MILLION AND $544 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO LOANS THAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED IN A TRANSFER BUT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE ORIGINATION.

GECC FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE BOTH LOANS AND FINANCING LEASES. LOANS REPRESENT TRANSACTIONS IN A VARIETY OF FORMS, INCLUDING REVOLVING CHARGE AND CREDIT, MORTGAGES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, INTERMEDIATE-TERM LOANS AND REVOLVING LOANS SECURED BY BUSINESS ASSETS. THE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES LOANS CARRIED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT ON WHICH FINANCE CHARGES ARE BILLED PERIODICALLY, AND LOANS CARRIED AT GROSS BOOK VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES FINANCE CHARGES.

INVESTMENT IN FINANCING LEASES CONSISTS OF DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES OF AIRCRAFT, RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK, AUTOS, OTHER TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND OTHER MANUFACTURING, POWER GENERATION, AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES.

FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THE LEVERAGED LEASES AND THE MAJORITY OF THE DIRECT FINANCING LEASES ARE LEASES IN WHICH GECC DEPRECIATES THE LEASED ASSETS AND IS TAXED UPON THE ACCRUAL OF RENTAL INCOME. CERTAIN DIRECT FINANCING LEASES ARE LOANS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS, GECC IS TAXED ONLY ON THE PORTION OF EACH PAYMENT THAT CONSTITUTES INTEREST, UNLESS THE INTEREST IS TAX-EXEMPT (E.G., CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS).

INVESTMENT IN DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES REPRESENTS NET UNPAID RENTALS AND ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED EQUIPMENT, LESS RELATED DEFERRED INCOME. GECC HAS NO GENERAL OBLIGATION FOR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTING THIRD-PARTY PARTICIPATION RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES; SUCH NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES BUT HAVE BEEN OFFSET AGAINST THE RELATED RENTALS RECEIVABLE. THE GECC SHARE OF RENTALS RECEIVABLE ON LEVERAGED LEASES IS SUBORDINATE TO THE SHARE OF OTHER PARTICIPANTS WHO ALSO HAVE SECURITY INTERESTS IN THE LEASED EQUIPMENT. FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, GECC IS ENTITLED TO DEDUCT THE INTEREST EXPENSE ACCRUING ON NON-RECOURSE FINANCING RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES.

UPON CLOSING AN ACQUISITION, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED AND CONSOLIDATE THE ACQUISITION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. GIVEN THE TIME IT TAKES TO OBTAIN PERTINENT INFORMATION TO FINALIZE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET, THEN TO ADJUST THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND BOOKS AND RECORDS TO OUR STANDARDS, IT IS OFTEN SEVERAL QUARTERS BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO FINALIZE THOSE INITIAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY REVISED.

ON JUNE 20, 2014, GE'S OFFER TO ACQUIRE THE THERMAL, RENEWABLES AND GRID BUSINESSES OF ALSTOM FOR APPROXIMATELY €12,350 MILLION (TO BE ADJUSTED FOR THE ASSUMED NET CASH OR LIABILITY AT CLOSING) WAS POSITIVELY RECOMMENDED BY ALSTOM'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN ADDITION, GE, ALSTOM AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR THE FORMATION OF THREE JOINT VENTURES IN GRID TECHNOLOGY, RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND FRENCH STEAM POWER AND ALSTOM WILL INVEST APPROXIMATELY €2,600 MILLION IN THESE JOINT VENTURES. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, ALSTOM COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH THE WORKS COUNCIL AND OBTAINED APPROVAL FROM ITS SHAREHOLDERS. ALSO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, GE AND ALSTOM ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WHERE GE HAS AGREED TO PAY ALSTOM A NET AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY €260 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION AT CLOSING. IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS FUNDING, ALSTOM HAS AGREED TO EXTEND THE TRADEMARK LICENSING OF THE ALSTOM NAME FROM 5 YEARS TO 25 YEARS AS WELL AS OTHER CONTRACTUAL AMENDMENTS. THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS. THE TRANSACTION IS TARGETED TO CLOSE IN 2015.

ON JUNE 2, 2014, WE ACQUIRED CAMERON'S RECIPROCATING COMPRESSION DIVISION FOR $550 MILLION. THE DIVISION PROVIDES RECIPROCATING COMPRESSION EQUIPMENT AND AFTERMARKET SERVICES FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, GAS PROCESSING, GAS DISTRIBUTION AND INDEPENDENT POWER INDUSTRIES. THE DIVISION IS INCLUDED IN OUR OIL & GAS SEGMENT. THE PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION AND AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION. THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE FINALIZED UPON COMPLETION OF POST-CLOSING PROCEDURES.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, WE ACQUIRED SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SEGMENT. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2014, WE ACQUIRED API HEALTHCARE (API) FOR $340 MILLION IN CASH. API IS A HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS PROVIDER. THE PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION AND AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION. ON MARCH 21, 2014, WE ACQUIRED CERTAIN THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. LIFE-SCIENCE BUSINESSES FOR $1,065 MILLION IN CASH. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS ACQUIRED, HYCLONE, IS A LEADING MANUFACTURER OF PRODUCTS USED TO SUPPORT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION. THE PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION AND AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION. THE ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICES WILL BE FINALIZED UPON COMPLETION OF POST-CLOSING PROCEDURES.

GOODWILL BALANCES DECREASED BY $(1,095) MILLION IN 2014, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE EFFECTS OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR, THE RECLASSIFICATION OF GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH APPLIANCES AND BUDAPEST BANK TO ASSETS OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE, AND THE SALE OF GEMB-NORDIC AND OTHER DISPOSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ACQUISITIONS AT HEALTHCARE AND OIL & GAS.

GOODWILL BALANCES INCREASED $4,534 MILLION IN 2013, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITIONS OF AVIO AND LUFKIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DISPOSITIONS.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH YEAR USING DATA AS OF JULY 1 OF THAT YEAR. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: IN STEP ONE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS FAIR VALUE; IN STEP TWO, WHICH IS APPLIED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS DERIVED BY DEDUCTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS EQUITY, AND COMPARING THAT AMOUNT WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. WE DETERMINED FAIR VALUES FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING THE MARKET APPROACH, WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, OR THE INCOME APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WE ASSESS THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY BASED UPON THE RELEVANCE AND AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA AT THE TIME WE PERFORM THE VALUATION. IF MULTIPLE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES ARE USED, THE RESULTS ARE WEIGHTED APPROPRIATELY.

VALUATIONS USING THE MARKET APPROACH ARE DERIVED FROM METRICS OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES OR HISTORICALLY COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES IS BASED ON THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE GIVING CONSIDERATION TO RISK PROFILES, SIZE, GEOGRAPHY, AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A MARKET APPROACH IS LIMITED TO REPORTING UNITS FOR WHICH THERE ARE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO OUR BUSINESSES.

UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED RATE. WE USE OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM FUTURE GROWTH RATES BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT VIEWS OF THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EACH BUSINESS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ASSUMED IN OUR FORECASTS. WE DERIVE OUR DISCOUNT RATES USING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND ANALYZING PUBLISHED RATES FOR INDUSTRIES RELEVANT TO OUR REPORTING UNITS TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING. WE USE DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND IN OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORECASTS. DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR REPORTING UNIT VALUATIONS RANGED FROM 9.0% TO 16.0%.

ACQUISITIONS & INTANGIBLE ASSETS

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STEP ONE TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH OF THE GE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED FOR ANY OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

WHILE ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS PASSED STEP ONE OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, WE IDENTIFIED ONE REPORTING UNIT FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE. WITHIN OUR ENERGY MANAGEMENT OPERATING SEGMENT, THE POWER CONVERSION REPORTING UNIT WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE A FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 10%. THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE POWER CONVERSION REPORTING UNIT WAS $1.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 2% OF OUR TOTAL GOODWILL. WHILE THE GOODWILL OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS NOT CURRENTLY IMPAIRED, THERE COULD BE AN IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IF ACTUAL CASH FLOWS ARE BELOW ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS, THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED AT A HIGHER RISK-ADJUSTED RATE OR MARKET MULTIPLES DECREASE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOODWILL IS RECOVERABLE FOR ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE GOODWILL WILL NOT BE IMPAIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN 2013, WHILE THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT'S BOOK VALUE WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF ITS FAIR VALUE, WE FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED OUR REAL ESTATE GOODWILL BALANCE BY PERFORMING THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS IN WHICH THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SECOND STEP WAS NOT REQUIRED, AS THE RESULTS OF STEP ONE INDICATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS BOOK VALUE.

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

PENSION BENEFITS

WE SPONSOR A NUMBER OF PENSION PLANS. PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, TOGETHER WITH AFFILIATE AND CERTAIN OTHER PENSION PLANS (OTHER PENSION PLANS) DETAILED IN THIS NOTE, REPRESENT ABOUT 99% OF OUR TOTAL PENSION ASSETS. WE USE A DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR OUR PLANS.

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS

ARE THE GE PENSION PLAN AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN.

THE GE PENSION PLAN PROVIDES BENEFITS TO CERTAIN U.S. EMPLOYEES BASED ON THE GREATER OF A FORMULA RECOGNIZING CAREER EARNINGS OR A FORMULA RECOGNIZING LENGTH OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE EARNINGS. CERTAIN BENEFIT PROVISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO COMMENCE SERVICE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011 AND ANY EMPLOYEE WHO COMMENCES SERVICE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2012 WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GE PENSION PLAN, BUT WILL PARTICIPATE IN A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PROGRAM.

THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTARY RETIREMENT BENEFITS PRIMARILY TO HIGHER-LEVEL, LONGER-SERVICE U.S. EMPLOYEES.

OTHER PENSION PLANS

IN 2014 INCLUDED 40 U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS WITH PENSION ASSETS OR OBLIGATIONS GREATER THAN $50 MILLION. THESE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES BASED ON FORMULAS RECOGNIZING LENGTH OF SERVICE AND EARNINGS.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS' ASSETS, WE FORMULATE VIEWS ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD. WE EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AND HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG A NUMBER OF KEY VARIABLES THAT IMPACT ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, INFLATION, VALUATIONS, YIELDS AND SPREADS, USING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES. WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXPECTED VOLATILITY BY ASSET CLASS AND DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS CLASSES TO DETERMINE EXPECTED OVERALL PORTFOLIO RESULTS GIVEN CURRENT AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE, PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE ASSUMED A 7.5% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2015. FOR THE PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, WE APPLY OUR EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN TO A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS, WHICH STABILIZES VARIABILITY IN THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH WE APPLY THAT EXPECTED RETURN.

THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RECENTLY ISSUED NEW MORTALITY TABLES PROJECTING LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES THAT WILL RESULT IN HIGHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR U.S. COMPANIES. WE UPDATED OUR MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS' BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY $3,953 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

WE AMORTIZE EXPERIENCE GAINS AND LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PLAN PROVISIONS, OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES.

FUNDING POLICY

THE FUNDING POLICY FOR THE GE PENSION PLAN IS TO CONTRIBUTE AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AS SET FORTH IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND TAX LAWS PLUS SUCH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS AS WE MAY DETERMINE TO BE APPROPRIATE. WE DID NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2014 AND 2013. THE ERISA MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE A CONTRIBUTION IN 2015. WE EXPECT TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $265 MILLION FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS UNDER OUR GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AND EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $540 MILLION TO OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2015. IN 2014, COMPARATIVE AMOUNTS WERE $236 MILLION AND $726 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES. ACCUMULATED AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (ABO AND PBO) REPRESENT THE OBLIGATIONS OF A PENSION PLAN FOR PAST SERVICE AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. ABO IS THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS EARNED TO DATE WITH BENEFITS COMPUTED BASED ON CURRENT COMPENSATION LEVELS. PBO IS ABO INCREASED TO REFLECT EXPECTED FUTURE COMPENSATION.

PLAN FIDUCIARIES OF THE GE PENSION PLAN SET INVESTMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES FOR THE GE PENSION TRUST AND OVERSEE ITS INVESTMENT ALLOCATION, WHICH INCLUDES SELECTING INVESTMENT MANAGERS, COMMISSIONING PERIODIC ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES AND SETTING LONG-TERM STRATEGIC TARGETS. LONG-TERM STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN, A BALANCE BETWEEN RISK AND RETURN AND THE PLAN'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS. TARGET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES ARE ESTABLISHED AT AN ASSET CLASS LEVEL BY PLAN FIDUCIARIES. TARGET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE GUIDELINES, NOT LIMITATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PLAN FIDUCIARIES WILL APPROVE ALLOCATIONS ABOVE OR BELOW A TARGET RANGE.

PLAN FIDUCIARIES MONITOR THE GE PENSION PLAN'S LIQUIDITY POSITION IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEAR-TERM BENEFIT PAYMENT AND OTHER CASH NEEDS. THE GE PENSION PLAN HOLDS SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

GE PENSION TRUST ASSETS ARE INVESTED SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES.



SHORT-TERM SECURITIES PURCHASED MUST GENERALLY BE RATED A-1/P-1 OR BETTER, EXCEPT FOR 15% OF SUCH SECURITIES THAT MAY BE RATED A-2/P-2 AND OTHER SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AS MAY BE APPROVED BY THE PLAN FIDUCIARIES.



REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT EXCEED 25% OF TOTAL ASSETS.



INVESTMENTS IN RESTRICTED SECURITIES (EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS) THAT ARE NOT FREELY TRADABLE MAY NOT EXCEED 30% OF TOTAL ASSETS (ACTUAL WAS 17% OF TRUST ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014).

GE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 3.8% AND 4.5% OF TRUST ASSETS AT YEAR-END 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

THE GE PENSION PLAN HAS A BROADLY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, PRIVATE EQUITIES, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS; THESE INVESTMENTS ARE BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. IN NATURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, U.S. GOVERNMENT DIRECT AND INDIRECT OBLIGATIONS REPRESENTED 16% OF TOTAL GE PENSION PLAN ASSETS.

PROVIDE HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS AND THESE PARTICIPANTS SHARE IN THE COST OF HEALTHCARE BENEFITS. THESE PLANS COVER APPROXIMATELY 193,000 RETIREES AND DEPENDENTS. IN 2012, WE AMENDED OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS SUCH THAT, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015, OUR POST-65 RETIREE HEALTH PLANS WILL BE CLOSED TO CERTAIN SALARIED AND RETIRED SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED IN THE PLANS AS OF THAT DATE, AND WE WILL NO LONGER OFFER COMPANY-PROVIDED LIFE INSURANCE IN RETIREMENT FOR CERTAIN SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE AFTER THAT DATE. IN 2014, WE AMENDED OUR POST-65 RETIREE HEALTH PLANS FOR CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES AND ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015, THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WITH A RETIREE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT TO HELP PAY FOR COVERAGE PURCHASED THROUGH A PRIVATE EXCHANGE INSTEAD OF OFFERING OUR CURRENT POST-65 RETIREE HEALTH PLANS.

(B)

FOR 2014, ULTIMATELY DECLINING TO 5% FOR 2030 AND THEREAFTER.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON RETIREE LIFE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS, AS WELL AS EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND RESULTING ASSET LEVELS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR RETIREE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS, WE FORMULATE VIEWS ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD. WE EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AND HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG A NUMBER OF KEY VARIABLES THAT IMPACT ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, INFLATION, VALUATIONS, YIELDS AND SPREADS, USING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES. WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXPECTED VOLATILITY BY ASSET CLASS AND DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS CLASSES TO DETERMINE EXPECTED OVERALL PORTFOLIO RESULTS GIVEN CURRENT AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE, PAST RETURN RESULTS, OUR CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS AS WELL AS A SHORTER TIME HORIZON FOR RETIREE LIFE PLAN ASSETS, WE HAVE ASSUMED A 7.0% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2015. WE APPLY OUR EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN TO A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS, WHICH STABILIZES VARIABILITY IN THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH WE APPLY THAT EXPECTED RETURN.

THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RECENTLY ISSUED NEW MORTALITY TABLES PROJECTING LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES THAT WILL RESULT IN HIGHER POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR U.S. COMPANIES. WE UPDATED OUR MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS' BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY $612 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

WE AMORTIZE EXPERIENCE GAINS AND LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PLAN PROVISIONS, OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES.

FUNDING POLICY

WE FUND RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $540 MILLION IN 2015 TO FUND SUCH BENEFITS. WE FUND THE RETIREE LIFE INSURANCE TRUST AT OUR DISCRETION.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

PLAN FIDUCIARIES SET INVESTMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES FOR THE TRUST AND OVERSEE ITS INVESTMENT ALLOCATION, WHICH INCLUDES SELECTING INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND SETTING LONG-TERM STRATEGIC TARGETS. THE PRIMARY STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ARE BALANCING INVESTMENT RISK AND RETURN AND MONITORING THE PLAN'S LIQUIDITY POSITION IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEAR-TERM BENEFIT PAYMENT AND OTHER CASH NEEDS. TARGET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES ARE ESTABLISHED AT AN ASSET CLASS LEVEL BY PLAN FIDUCIARIES. TARGET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE GUIDELINES, NOT LIMITATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PLAN FIDUCIARIES WILL APPROVE ALLOCATIONS ABOVE OR BELOW A TARGET RANGE.

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES PURCHASED MUST GENERALLY BE RATED A-1/P-1 OR BETTER, EXCEPT FOR 15% OF SUCH SECURITIES THAT MAY BE RATED A-2/P-2 AND OTHER SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AS MAY BE APPROVED BY THE PLAN FIDUCIARIES. ACCORDING TO STATUTE, THE AGGREGATE HOLDINGS OF ALL QUALIFYING EMPLOYER SECURITIES (E.G., GE COMMON STOCK) AND QUALIFYING EMPLOYER REAL PROPERTY MAY NOT EXCEED 10% OF THE FAIR VALUE OF TRUST ASSETS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. GE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 3.9% AND 4.0% OF TRUST ASSETS AT YEAR-END 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

RETIREE LIFE PLAN ASSETS WERE $813 MILLION AND $903 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. PUBLIC EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES AMOUNTING TO $615 MILLION AND $727 MILLION REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 78% AND 77% OF TOTAL INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 13. ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES LIABILITIES FOR VARIOUS ITEMS INCLUDING NON-CURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, DEFERRED INCOME, INTEREST ON TAX LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS.

ACCRUALS FOR NON-CURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AMOUNTED TO $42,354 MILLION AND $27,853 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDE COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT LIABILITIES, SUCH AS POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. SEE NOTE 12.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS EXCLUDE POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND, WHEN DATES AND AMOUNTS OF SUCH COSTS ARE NOT KNOWN, ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW END OF SUCH RANGE. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION EXPOSURE WILL EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED. HOWEVER, DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE STATUS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SITES, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. TOTAL RESERVES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS, WERE $2,182 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCOME TAXES

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR TAX LIABILITY, RETURN ON INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GE'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH NON-U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH HAD EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2013, WAS REINSTATED IN DECEMBER 2014 RETROACTIVELY FOR ONE YEAR THROUGH THE END OF 2014. THE PROVISION ALSO HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAD BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS ON SEVEN PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THE PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2014, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2015.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX POSITIONS

ANNUALLY, WE FILE OVER 5,500 INCOME TAX RETURNS IN OVER 250 GLOBAL TAXING JURISDICTIONS. WE ARE UNDER EXAMINATION OR ENGAGED IN TAX LITIGATION IN MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS. DURING 2013, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) COMPLETED THE AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2008-2009, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN ISSUES THAT REMAIN UNDER EXAMINATION.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE IRS WAS AUDITING OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2010-2011.  IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER U.S. TAX DEFICIENCY ISSUES AND REFUND CLAIMS FOR PREVIOUS YEARS WERE UNRESOLVED. THE IRS HAS DISALLOWED THE TAX LOSS ON OUR 2003 DISPOSITION OF ERC LIFE REINSURANCE CORPORATION. WE HAVE CONTESTED THE DISALLOWANCE OF THIS LOSS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE UNRESOLVED ITEMS COULD BE RESOLVED DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR BALANCE OF "UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS" – THAT IS, THE AGGREGATE TAX EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TAX RETURN POSITIONS AND THE BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE OUTCOME OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES OR CLAIMS IS LIKELY TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MADE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES. RESOLUTION OF AUDIT MATTERS, INCLUDING THE IRS AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2008-2009, REDUCED OUR 2013 CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE BY 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES, AS WELL AS FROM NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, AND ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN TAXES ARE ACTUALLY PAID OR RECOVERED. DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED.

WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S. DEFERRED TAXES ON CUMULATIVE EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND, AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, WERE APPROXIMATELY $119 BILLION AND $110 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES WHEN WE PLAN TO REMIT THOSE EARNINGS.

2014 INCLUDED $440 MILLION RELATED TO THE EXCESS OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL IPO OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTEREST SOLD.

SHARES OF GE PREFERRED STOCK

ON OCTOBER 16, 2008, WE ISSUED 30,000 SHARES OF 10% CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK (PAR VALUE $1.00 PER SHARE) HAVING AN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION VALUE OF $3,000 MILLION, AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE 134,831,460 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (PAR VALUE $0.06 PER SHARE) TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. (BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY) FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $2,965 MILLION IN CASH. THE PROCEEDS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE PREFERRED SHARES ($2,494 MILLION) AND THE WARRANTS ($471 MILLION) ON A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE BASIS AND RECORDED IN OTHER CAPITAL. THE WARRANTS WERE EXERCISABLE THROUGH OCTOBER 16, 2013, AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $22.25 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK AND WERE TO BE SETTLED THROUGH PHYSICAL SHARE ISSUANCE. THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTS WERE AMENDED IN JANUARY 2013 TO ALLOW FOR NET SHARE SETTLEMENT WHERE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ISSUED SHARES IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OF GE COMMON STOCK OVER THE

20 TRADING DAYS PRECEDING THE DATE OF EXERCISE EXCEEDS THE EXERCISE PRICE OF $22.25. ON OCTOBER 16, 2013, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. (BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY) EXERCISED IN FULL THEIR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF GE COMMON STOCK AND ON OCTOBER 17, 2013, GE DELIVERED 10.7 MILLION SHARES TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. THE TRANSACTION HAD EQUAL AND OFFSETTING EFFECTS ON OTHER CAPITAL AND COMMON STOCK HELD IN TREASURY.

THE PREFERRED STOCK WAS REDEEMABLE AT OUR OPTION THREE YEARS AFTER ISSUANCE AT A PRICE OF 110% OF LIQUIDATION VALUE PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS. ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2011, WE PROVIDED NOTICE TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY THAT WE WOULD REDEEM THE SHARES FOR THE STATED REDEMPTION PRICE OF $3,300 MILLION, PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTICE, WE RECOGNIZED A PREFERRED DIVIDEND OF $806 MILLION (CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND REDEMPTION VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK), WHICH WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREOWNERS AND COMMON SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. THE PREFERRED SHARES WERE REDEEMED ON OCTOBER 17, 2011.

GE HAS 50 MILLION AUTHORIZED SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK ($1.00 PAR VALUE). NO SHARES WERE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013.

WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT AT THE DATE OF GRANT USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 WAS $5.26, $4.52 AND $3.80, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN ARRIVING AT THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY: RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES OF 2.3%, 2.5% AND 1.3%; DIVIDEND YIELDS OF 3.1%, 4.0% AND 4.0%; EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF 26%, 28% AND 29%; AND EXPECTED LIVES OF 7.3 YEARS, 7.5 YEARS AND 7.8 YEARS. RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES REFLECT THE YIELD ON ZERO-COUPON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELDS PRESUME A SET DIVIDEND RATE AND WE USED A HISTORICAL FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE FOR THE DIVIDEND YIELD. EXPECTED VOLATILITIES ARE BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITIES FROM TRADED OPTIONS AND HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK. THE EXPECTED OPTION LIVES ARE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF EMPLOYEE EXERCISE BEHAVIOR.

THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 AMOUNTED TO $360 MILLION, $392 MILLION AND $265 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, THERE WAS $739 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO NON-VESTED OPTIONS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF 2 YEARS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $185 MILLION AFTER TAX IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 2015.

STOCK OPTION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 AMOUNTED TO $215 MILLION, $231 MILLION AND $220 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CASH RECEIVED FROM OPTION EXERCISES DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 WAS $439 MILLION, $490 MILLION AND $355 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 WAS $118 MILLION, $128 MILLION AND $88 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT IS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF RSUS GRANTED DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 WAS $26.08, $24.54 AND $20.79, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF RSUS VESTED DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 AMOUNTED TO $86 MILLION, $109 MILLION AND $116 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, THERE WAS $233 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO NON-VESTED RSUS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF 2 YEARS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $54 MILLION AFTER TAX IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 2015. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, 1 MILLION PSUS WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM OF 1.5 YEARS, AN AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF $25 MILLION AND $9 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST WERE OUTSTANDING. OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND PSUS RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS AMOUNTED TO $56 MILLION, $62 MILLION AND $79 MILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS BASED ON THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR ALL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AMOUNTED TO $147 MILLION, $145 MILLION AND $153 MILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE EXCESS OF ACTUAL TAX DEDUCTIONS OVER AMOUNTS ASSUMED, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY, WERE $86 MILLION $86 MILLION AND $53 MILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

WHEN STOCK OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND RESTRICTED STOCK VESTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSUMED TAX BENEFIT AND THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT IS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED TAX BENEFIT, THAT DIFFERENCE IS RECORDED IN EQUITY, TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, OUR ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ANY FUTURE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED TAX BENEFITS FOR ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS.

EARNINGS-PER-SHARE AMOUNTS ARE COMPUTED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET EARNINGS.

SECURITIES REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS

OUR ISSUANCES OF SECURITIES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE LIMITED TO ACTIVITIES AT CERTAIN OF OUR FOREIGN BANKS PRIMARILY FOR PURPOSES OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE WERE PARTY TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TOTALING $169 MILLION, WHICH WERE REPORTED IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. NO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AS OFF-BOOK FINANCING AND WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS.

WE ALSO ENTER INTO REVERSE SECURITIES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT WITH MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE WERE PARTY TO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TOTALING $11.5 BILLION, WHICH WERE REPORTED IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER THESE REVERSE SECURITIES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE TYPICALLY LEND AVAILABLE CASH AT A SPECIFIED RATE OF INTEREST AND HOLD U.S. OR HIGHLY-RATED EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. COLLATERAL VALUE IS IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS LOANED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

AS A MATTER OF POLICY, WE USE DERIVATIVES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES AND WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVES FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. A KEY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE FOR OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES IS TO MITIGATE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK BY SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEBT MATCH THE ASSETS THEY ARE FUNDING. IF THE FORM (FIXED VERSUS FLOATING) AND CURRENCY DENOMINATION OF THE DEBT WE ISSUE DO NOT MATCH THE RELATED ASSETS, WE TYPICALLY EXECUTE DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE NATURE AND TENOR OF FUNDING TO MEET THIS OBJECTIVE WITHIN PRE-DEFINED LIMITS. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER WE ENTER INTO A DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION OR ISSUE DEBT DIRECTLY TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET RELATED FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE TYPE OF DEBT WE CAN ISSUE.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE BASIS UPON WHICH INTEREST AND OTHER PAYMENTS ARE CALCULATED AND ARE REPORTED GROSS, EXCEPT FOR OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE EXECUTED IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR CURRENCY RISK OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. OF THE OUTSTANDING NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $297,000 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 87% OR $258,000 MILLION, IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY OR MARKET RISK BETWEEN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. THE REMAINING DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATE TO HEDGING AGAINST ADVERSE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES RELATED TO ANTICIPATED SALES AND PURCHASES AND CONTRACTS CONTAINING CERTAIN CLAUSES THAT MEET THE ACCOUNTING DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE. THE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THESE ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN PRACTICABLE. WHEN WE ARE NOT ABLE TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, OR WHEN THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE BOTH RECORDED IN EARNINGS CONCURRENTLY, THE DERIVATIVES ARE DEEMED ECONOMIC HEDGES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED. THIS MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURS WHEN WE HEDGE A RECOGNIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION (E.G., A RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE) WITH A DERIVATIVE. SINCE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES ARE REFLECTED CONCURRENTLY IN EARNINGS FOR BOTH THE DERIVATIVE AND THE TRANSACTION, THE ECONOMIC HEDGE DOES NOT REQUIRE HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE USE CURRENCY EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES TO PROTECT OUR NET INVESTMENTS IN GLOBAL OPERATIONS CONDUCTED IN NON-U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCIES. FOR DERIVATIVES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION, WE ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON CHANGES IN SPOT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. CHANGES IN SPOT RATES ON THE DERIVATIVE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF AOCI UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE FOREIGN ENTITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED OR SOLD, OR UPON THE LOSS OF A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN A FOREIGN ENTITY. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD POINTS, WHICH REFLECTS THE INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES ON THE DERIVATIVE, IS EXCLUDED FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT.

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS EACH PERIOD.

IN GENERAL, THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE ITEM THAT REPRESENT THE ECONOMIC RISK EXPOSURE ARE RECORDED IN THE SAME CAPTION AS THE DERIVATIVE.

FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN OUR POSITIONS. WE MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL DEFAULT AND NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENTS) ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS. WHERE WE HAVE AGREED TO NETTING OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES WITH A COUNTERPARTY, WE NET OUR EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND APPLY THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED TO US TO DETERMINE THE EXPOSURE. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE NET EXPOSURES AGAINST DEFINED LIMITS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE, INCLUDING REQUIRING ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN CERTAIN OF OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE COUNTERPARTIES TO POST COLLATERAL (TYPICALLY, CASH OR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES) WHEN OUR RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE COUNTERPARTY, MEASURED AT CURRENT MARKET VALUE, EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED LIMIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH COLLATERAL WAS $7,070 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, OF WHICH $3,709 MILLION WAS CASH AND $3,361 MILLION WAS IN THE FORM OF SECURITIES HELD BY A CUSTODIAN FOR OUR BENEFIT. UNDER CERTAIN OF THESE SAME AGREEMENTS, WE POST COLLATERAL TO OUR COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR DERIVATIVE OBLIGATIONS, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH WAS $502 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, OUR EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES (INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST), NET OF COLLATERAL WE HOLD, WAS $487 MILLION. THIS EXCLUDES EXPOSURE RELATED TO EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

ADDITIONALLY, OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3. IN CERTAIN OF THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS, EACH PARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE SHORT-TERM RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS ALSO TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE TERMINATION RIGHTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT BY ONE OF THE PARTIES. IF AN AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED UNDER ANY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE TERMINATION AMOUNT PAYABLE WOULD BE DETERMINED ON A NET BASIS AND COULD ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY COLLATERAL POSTED. THE NET AMOUNT OF OUR DERIVATIVE LIABILITY, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY US AND OUTSTANDING INTEREST PAYMENTS WAS $514 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. THIS EXCLUDES EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.

NOTE 23. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

WE USE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES PRIMARILY TO SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW, INVESTORS IN THESE ENTITIES ONLY HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE ENTITY AND NOT TO OUR GENERAL CREDIT. WE DO NOT HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY VIE. WE DID NOT PROVIDE NON-CONTRACTUAL SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY TRANSFERRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES TO ANY VIE IN 2014 OR 2013.

IN EVALUATING WHETHER WE HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, WE CONSIDER THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE VIE WAS CREATED, THE IMPORTANCE OF EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES IN WHICH IT IS ENGAGED AND OUR DECISION-MAKING ROLE, IF ANY, IN THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DETERMINE THE ENTITY'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO OTHER ECONOMIC INTEREST HOLDERS. THIS EVALUATION REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF ALL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELEVANT TO DECISION-MAKING THAT AFFECTS THE ENTITY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND THE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN DECIDING WHICH DECISION-MAKING RIGHTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT.

IN DETERMINING WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS OR THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE, WE EVALUATE ALL OF OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE ENTITY, REGARDLESS OF FORM (DEBT, EQUITY, MANAGEMENT AND SERVICING FEES, AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS). THIS EVALUATION CONSIDERS ALL RELEVANT FACTORS OF THE ENTITY'S DESIGN, INCLUDING: THE ENTITY'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO EARNINGS (LOSSES), SUBORDINATION OF OUR INTERESTS RELATIVE TO THOSE OF OTHER INVESTORS, CONTINGENT PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE EVALUATION OF EACH OF THESE FACTORS IN REACHING A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IS A MATTER THAT REQUIRES THE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

WE CONSOLIDATE VIES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE VIE'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, TYPICALLY BECAUSE OF OUR ROLE AS EITHER SERVICER OR MANAGER FOR THE VIE. OUR CONSOLIDATED VIES FALL INTO THREE MAIN GROUPS, WHICH ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.



TRINITY COMPRISES TWO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT HOLD INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE, AND WERE FUNDED BY THE ISSUANCE OF GICS. THE GICS INCLUDE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CERTAIN HOLDERS COULD REQUIRE IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT OF THEIR INVESTMENT SHOULD THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF GECC FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1. THE OUTSTANDING GICS ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR SCHEDULED MATURITIES AND INDIVIDUAL TERMS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE PROVISIONS PERMITTING REDEMPTION UPON A DOWNGRADE OF ONE OR MORE OF GECC'S RATINGS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AND ARE REPORTED IN INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS.



CONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATION ENTITIES (CSES) WERE CREATED TO FACILITATE SECURITIZATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING THAT SERVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM MARKETS. THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED WITH THESE ENTITIES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ALL ARE NON-RECOURSE. WE PROVIDE SERVICING FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS IN THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN THESE ENTITIES HAVE SIMILAR RISKS AND CHARACTERISTICS TO OUR OTHER FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND WERE UNDERWRITTEN TO THE SAME STANDARD. ACCORDINGLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ASSETS HAS BEEN SIMILAR TO OUR OTHER FINANCING RECEIVABLES; HOWEVER, THE BLENDED PERFORMANCE OF THE POOLS OF RECEIVABLES IN THESE ENTITIES REFLECTS THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT WE APPLY TO DETERMINE WHICH RECEIVABLES ARE SELECTED FOR TRANSFER. CONTRACTUALLY THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES MUST FIRST BE USED TO PAY THIRD-PARTY DEBT HOLDERS AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES OF THE ENTITY. EXCESS CASH FLOWS ARE AVAILABLE TO GE. THE CREDITORS OF THESE ENTITIES HAVE NO CLAIM ON OTHER ASSETS OF GE.



OTHER REMAINING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES RELATE PRIMARILY TO THREE CATEGORIES OF ENTITIES: (1) JOINT VENTURES THAT LEASE EQUIPMENT WITH $1,598 MILLION OF ASSETS AND $686 MILLION OF LIABILITIES; (2) OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN POWER GENERATING AND LEASING ACTIVITIES WITH $667 MILLION OF ASSETS AND NO LIABILITIES; AND (3) INSURANCE ENTITIES THAT, AMONG OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS, PROVIDE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE FOR GE WITH $1,162 MILLION OF ASSETS AND $541 MILLION OF LIABILITIES.

COMMITMENTS, PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED VIES CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: ASSISTING IN THE FORMATION AND FINANCING OF THE ENTITY; PROVIDING RECOURSE AND/OR LIQUIDITY SUPPORT; SERVICING THE ASSETS; AND RECEIVING VARIABLE FEES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES BECAUSE THE NATURE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIES DOES NOT GIVE US POWER OVER DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THEIR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.

OUR LARGEST EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE UNCONSOLIDATED VIE AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 IS A $8,612 MILLION INVESTMENT IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE SENIOR SECURED LOAN PROGRAM ("SSLP"), A FUND THAT INVESTS IN HIGH-QUALITY SENIOR SECURED DEBT OF VARIOUS MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES. OTHER SIGNIFICANT UNCONSOLIDATED VIES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE ENTITIES ($1,564 MILLION), WHICH GENERALLY CONSIST OF PASSIVE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS IN TAX-ADVANTAGED, MULTI-FAMILY REAL ESTATE AND INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE ENTITIES; AND EXPOSURES TO JOINT VENTURES THAT PURCHASE FACTORED RECEIVABLES ($2,166 MILLION).

THE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY AND THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT WE HOLD. VARIABLE INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS AND CORPORATE ENTITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD INVESTMENTS. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ALSO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY BUT MAY HOLD A VARIABLE INTEREST SUCH AS LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS OR MEZZANINE DEBT INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED IN TWO CAPTIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: "ALL OTHER ASSETS" FOR INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AND "FINANCING RECEIVABLES – NET" FOR DEBT FINANCING PROVIDED TO THESE ENTITIES.

OUR GUARANTEES ARE PROVIDED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE UNDERWRITE THESE GUARANTEES CONSIDERING ECONOMIC, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK OF THE COUNTERPARTY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR GUARANTEES AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, GENERALLY THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVED, OR IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE A PREMIUM, THE AMOUNT BASED ON APPRAISAL, OBSERVED MARKET VALUES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY ASSOCIATED EXPECTED RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER RECEIVABLES, NOT NETTED AGAINST THE LIABILITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE WERE COMMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS BEYOND THOSE PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF VIES. SEE NOTE 23.

CREDIT SUPPORT.

WE HAVE PROVIDED $2,531 MILLION OF CREDIT SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OR ASSOCIATED COMPANIES, PREDOMINANTLY JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS, USING ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ENABLE THESE CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS OR OBTAIN DESIRED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. SHOULD THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY FAIL TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THEIR BEHALF. UNDER MOST SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, OUR GUARANTEE IS SECURED, USUALLY BY THE ASSET BEING PURCHASED OR FINANCED, OR POSSIBLY BY CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS OF THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY. THE LENGTH OF THESE CREDIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS PARALLELS THE LENGTH OF THE RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CREDIT SUPPORT WAS $38 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO FUND UP TO $28 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 UNDER RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES ON A VARIETY OF LEASED EQUIPMENT. UNDER MOST OF OUR RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES, OUR COMMITMENT IS SECURED BY THE LEASED ASSET. THE LIABILITY FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WAS $10 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE ALSO HAD $923 MILLION OF OTHER INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH RELATE TO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SALES OF BUSINESSES OR ASSETS.

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION.

THESE ARE AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO A BUYER OR SELLER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION IF CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION ARE ACHIEVED.

WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR REAL ESTATE LOANS FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. WE EVALUATE A REAL ESTATE LOAN FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE MOST RECENT VALUATION REFLECTS A PROJECTED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO AT MATURITY IN EXCESS OF 100%, EVEN IF THE LOAN IS CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

OF OUR $1,872 MILLION OF IMPAIRED LOANS AT REAL ESTATE AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, $1,641 MILLION ARE CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AND ARE TYPICALLY LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS ADEQUATE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE TO MEET CONTRACTUAL INTEREST OBLIGATIONS. IMPAIRED LOANS AT CLL PRIMARILY REPRESENT SENIOR SECURED LENDING POSITIONS.

OUR LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGY IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND, AT TIMES, CAN RESULT IN RATE REDUCTIONS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, EXTENSIONS, FORBEARANCE OR OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE RELATED LOAN TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING (TDR), AND ALSO AS IMPAIRED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THESE CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR COMMERCIAL LOANS MEET THE TDR CRITERIA INCLUDES OUR CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, TDRS INCLUDED IN IMPAIRED LOANS WERE $5,806 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING TO CONSUMER ($2,132 MILLION), CLL ($1,869 MILLION) AND REAL ESTATE ($1,757 MILLION).

FINANCING RECEIVABLES - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

IMPAIRED LOANS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS IN OUR CLL BUSINESS WERE $1,869 MILLION AND $2,961 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CLL AMERICAS ($1,031 MILLION AND $1,770 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY). AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE MODIFIED $926 MILLION OF LOANS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS, PRIMARILY IN CLL AMERICAS ($515 MILLION). CHANGES TO THESE LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDED EXTENSIONS, INTEREST ONLY PAYMENT PERIODS, DEBT TO EQUITY EXCHANGE AND FORBEARANCE OR OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH ARE IN ADDITION TO, OR SOMETIMES IN LIEU OF, FEES AND RATE INCREASES. OF OUR $926 MILLION AND $1,509 MILLION OF MODIFICATIONS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, $36 MILLION AND $71 MILLION HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY EXPERIENCED A PAYMENT DEFAULT AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

REAL ESTATE TDRS DECREASED FROM $3,625 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 TO $1,757 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY RESOLUTION OF TDRS THROUGH PAYDOWNS. FOR BORROWERS WITH DEMONSTRATED OPERATING CAPABILITIES, WE WORK TO RESTRUCTURE LOANS WHEN THE CASH FLOW AND PROJECTED VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL SUPPORT REPAYMENT OVER THE MODIFIED TERM. WE DEEM LOAN MODIFICATIONS TO BE TDRS WHEN WE HAVE GRANTED A CONCESSION TO A BORROWER EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY AND WE DO NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE THAT IS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES OF INTEREST GIVEN THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOAN OR OTHER CONSIDERATION THAT COMPENSATES US FOR THE VALUE OF THE CONCESSION. THE LIMITED LIQUIDITY AND HIGHER RETURN REQUIREMENTS IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET FOR LOANS WITH HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) RATIOS HAS TYPICALLY RESULTED IN THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MODIFIED TERMS ARE NOT AT CURRENT MARKET RATES OF INTEREST, EVEN IF THE MODIFIED LOANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE MODIFIED $672 MILLION OF LOANS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS. CHANGES TO THESE LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDED FORBEARANCE, MATURITY EXTENSIONS AND CHANGES TO COLLATERAL OR COVENANT TERMS OR OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH ARE IN ADDITION TO, OR SOMETIMES IN LIEU OF, FEES AND RATE INCREASES. WE RECEIVED THE SAME OR ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF RATE INCREASES AND FEES FOR THE MAJORITY OF THESE TDRS. OF OUR $672 MILLION AND $1,595 MILLION OF MODIFICATIONS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS DURING 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, $252 MILLION AND $197 MILLION HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY EXPERIENCED A PAYMENT DEFAULT IN 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE REAL ESTATE TDRS HAVE RESERVES DETERMINED BASED UPON COLLATERAL VALUE. OUR SPECIFIC RESERVES ON REAL ESTATE TDRS WERE $25 MILLION AND $70 MILLION AND WERE 1.4% AND 1.9%, OF REAL ESTATE TDRS, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013. IN MANY SITUATIONS THESE LOANS DID NOT REQUIRE A SPECIFIC RESERVE AS COLLATERAL VALUE ADEQUATELY COVERED OUR RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN. WHILE THESE MODIFIED LOANS HAD ADEQUATE COLLATERAL COVERAGE, WE WERE STILL REQUIRED TO COMPLETE OUR TDR CLASSIFICATION EVALUATION ON EACH OF THE MODIFICATIONS WITHOUT REGARD TO COLLATERAL ADEQUACY.

IMPAIRED LOANS IN OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS REPRESENT RESTRUCTURED SMALLER BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A TDR, AND ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT FOR IMPAIRED LOANS, AND COMMERCIAL LOANS IN OUR CONSUMER–OTHER PORTFOLIO. THE RECORDED INVESTMENT OF THESE IMPAIRED LOANS TOTALED $2,180 MILLION (WITH AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF $2,271 MILLION) AND COMPRISED $138 MILLION WITH NO SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, PRIMARILY ALL IN OUR CONSUMER–OTHER PORTFOLIO, AND $2,042 MILLION WITH A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE OF $408 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE IMPAIRED LOANS WITH A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE INCLUDED $70 MILLION WITH A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE OF $7 MILLION IN OUR CONSUMER–OTHER PORTFOLIO AND $1,972 MILLION WITH A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE OF $401 MILLION ACROSS THE REMAINING CONSUMER BUSINESS AND HAD AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND AVERAGE INVESTMENT OF $2,092 MILLION AND $2,547 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

IMPAIRED LOANS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS IN OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS WERE $2,132 MILLION AND $2,874 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. WE UTILIZE CERTAIN LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN OUR CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO. THESE LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS PRIMARILY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS IN EXCESS OF THREE MONTHS, WHICH WERE NOT PART OF THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT, AND ARE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN OUR NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE MODIFIED $981 MILLION OF CONSUMER LOANS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS TDRS, AND INCLUDED $506 MILLION OF NON-U.S. CONSUMER LOANS, PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARDS AND PERSONAL LOANS AND $475 MILLION OF U.S. CONSUMER LOANS, PRIMARILY CREDIT CARDS. WE EXPECT BORROWERS WHOSE LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED UNDER THESE PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MODIFICATION.

WE ALSO UTILIZE CERTAIN SHORT-TERM (THREE MONTHS OR LESS) LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING TEMPORARY FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN OUR CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO, WHICH ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS TDRS. THESE LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN OUR NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND NON-U.S. INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING PORTFOLIOS. WE SOLD OUR U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BUSINESS IN 2007 AND, AS SUCH, DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED MORTGAGE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE PROVIDED SHORT-TERM MODIFICATIONS OF $45 MILLION OF CONSUMER LOANS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IN OUR NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND PERSONAL LOAN PORTFOLIOS. FOR THESE MODIFIED LOANS, WE PROVIDED INSIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS, WHICH WERE NOT PART OF THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. WE EXPECT BORROWERS WHOSE LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED UNDER THESE SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION.

SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT QUALITY INFORMATION

COMMERCIAL

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO IS SECURED LENDING AND WE ASSESS THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO BASED ON THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS MEASURE. THE METRIC INCORPORATES BOTH THE BORROWER'S CREDIT QUALITY ALONG WITH ANY RELATED COLLATERAL PROTECTION.

OUR INTERNAL RISK RATINGS PROCESS IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION IN DETERMINING OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AND REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO EVALUATE RISK IN OUR FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIOS. IN DERIVING OUR INTERNAL RISK RATINGS, WE STRATIFY OUR COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIOS INTO 21 CATEGORIES OF DEFAULT RISK AND/OR SIX CATEGORIES OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT TO GROUP INTO THREE CATEGORIES: A, B AND C. OUR PROCESS STARTS BY DEVELOPING AN INTERNAL RISK RATING FOR OUR BORROWERS, WHICH IS BASED UPON OUR PROPRIETARY MODELS USING DATA DERIVED FROM BORROWER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AGENCY RATINGS, PAYMENT HISTORY INFORMATION, EQUITY PRICES AND OTHER COMMERCIAL BORROWER CHARACTERISTICS. WE THEN EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS FOR THE SPECIFIC LENDING TRANSACTION IN THE EVENT OF BORROWER DEFAULT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SUCH FACTORS AS APPLICABLE COLLATERAL VALUE, HISTORICAL LOSS AND RECOVERY RATES FOR SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS, AND OUR COLLECTION CAPABILITIES. OUR INTERNAL RISK RATINGS PROCESS AND THE MODELS WE USE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR MONITORING AND INTERNAL CONTROLS. THE FREQUENCY OF RATING UPDATES IS SET BY OUR CREDIT RISK POLICY, WHICH REQUIRES ANNUAL RISK COMMITTEE APPROVAL.

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE ASSIGNED ONE OF 21 RISK RATINGS BASED ON OUR PROCESS AND THEN THESE ARE GROUPED BY SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS INTO THREE CATEGORIES IN THE TABLE BELOW. CATEGORY A IS CHARACTERIZED BY EITHER HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY BORROWERS OR TRANSACTIONS WITH SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL COVERAGE THAT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES OR ELIMINATES THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE EVENT OF BORROWER DEFAULT. CATEGORY B IS CHARACTERIZED BY BORROWERS WITH WEAKER CREDIT QUALITY THAN THOSE IN CATEGORY A, OR TRANSACTIONS WITH MODERATELY STRONG COLLATERAL COVERAGE THAT MINIMIZES BUT MAY NOT FULLY MITIGATE THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. CATEGORY C IS CHARACTERIZED BY BORROWERS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF DEFAULT RISK RELATIVE TO OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO OR TRANSACTIONS WHERE COLLATERAL COVERAGE MAY NOT FULLY MITIGATE A LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT.

WE PRICE RISK PREMIUMS FOR WEAKER CREDITS AT ORIGINATION, CLOSELY MONITOR CHANGES IN CREDITWORTHINESS THROUGH OUR RISK RATINGS AND WATCH LIST PROCESS, AND ARE ENGAGED EARLY WITH DETERIORATING CREDITS TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS. SECURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITHIN RISK CATEGORY C ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN OUR CLL BUSINESSES AND ARE PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF SENIOR TERM LENDING FACILITIES AND FACTORING PROGRAMS SECURED BY VARIOUS ASSET TYPES INCLUDING INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, EQUIPMENT AND RELATED BUSINESS FACILITIES AS WELL AS FRANCHISE FINANCE ACTIVITIES SECURED BY UNDERLYING EQUIPMENT.

LOANS WITHIN CATEGORY C ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED REGULARLY, AND CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY WILL NOT PAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS. OUR INTERNAL RISK RATING PROCESS IDENTIFIES CREDITS WARRANTING CLOSER MONITORING; AND AS SUCH, THESE LOANS ARE NOT NECESSARILY CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL OR IMPAIRED.

OUR UNSECURED COMMERCIAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR INTERBANCA S.P.A. AND GE SANYO CREDIT ACQUISITIONS IN CLL INTERNATIONAL.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE OWNER OCCUPIED/CREDIT TENANT PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE BORROWER'S GENERAL CREDIT QUALITY, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR INTERNAL RISK RATING PROCESS, CONSISTENT WITH THE PROCESS WE USE FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE BALANCES OF OUR OWNER OCCUPIED/CREDIT TENANT PORTFOLIO WITH AN INTERNAL RISK RATING OF A, B AND C APPROXIMATED $589 MILLION, $70 MILLION AND $90 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE DECEMBER 31, 2013, BALANCES OF $571 MILLION, $179 MILLION AND $162 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITHIN OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO ARE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN LENDING PLATFORMS AND ARE SECURED BY VARIOUS PROPERTY TYPES. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR DEBT FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS GREATER THAN 95% ARE PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE LOANS AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR OWNER OCCUPIED/CREDIT TENANT FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDED IN CATEGORY C ARE IMPAIRED LOANS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE SPECIFIC RESERVE EVALUATION PROCESS. THE ULTIMATE RECOVERABILITY OF IMPAIRED LOANS IS DRIVEN BY COLLECTION STRATEGIES THAT DO NOT NECESSARILY DEPEND ON THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND INCLUDE FULL OR PARTIAL REPAYMENTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REFINANCING AND RESTRUCTURINGS.

CONSUMER

AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, OUR U.S. CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDED PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD AND SALES FINANCING FOR APPROXIMATELY 64 MILLION CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE U.S. WITH NO METROPOLITAN AREA ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 6% OF THE PORTFOLIO. OF THE TOTAL U.S. CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES, APPROXIMATELY 67% RELATE TO CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO PROFIT AND LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RETAILER (WHICH ARE RECORDED IN REVENUES), AND THE REMAINING 33% ARE SALES FINANCE RECEIVABLES THAT PROVIDE FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS IN AREAS SUCH AS ELECTRONICS, RECREATION, MEDICAL AND HOME IMPROVEMENT.

OUR CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO COMPRISES BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED LENDING. SECURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES COMPRISE RESIDENTIAL LOANS AND LENDING TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES PREDOMINANTLY SECURED BY AUTO AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY FINANCE, AND CASH FLOW LOANS. UNSECURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD FINANCING. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE CARDS ARE NOT FOR GENERAL USE AND ARE LIMITED TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD BY THE RETAILER. THE PRIVATE-LABEL PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSE WITH NO METROPOLITAN AREA ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 5% OF THE RELATED PORTFOLIO.

NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES

FOR OUR SECURED NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BOOK, WE ASSESS THE OVERALL CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO THROUGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS (THE RATIO OF THE OUTSTANDING DEBT ON A PROPERTY TO THE VALUE OF THAT PROPERTY AT ORIGINATION). IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT AND REPOSSESSION OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMARKET AND SELL THE PROPERTIES TO ELIMINATE OR MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS.

INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING CREDIT

WE ASSESS OVERALL CREDIT QUALITY USING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CREDIT SCORES. FOR OUR U.S. INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING CREDIT PORTFOLIO WE USE FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION ("FICO") SCORES. FICO SCORES ARE GENERALLY OBTAINED AT ORIGINATION OF THE ACCOUNT AND ARE REFRESHED AT A MINIMUM QUARTERLY, BUT COULD BE AS OFTEN AS WEEKLY, TO ASSIST IN PREDICTING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR. WE CATEGORIZE THESE CREDIT SCORES INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES; (A) 661 OR HIGHER, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED THE STRONGEST CREDITS; (B) 601 TO 660, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED MODERATE CREDIT RISK; AND (C) 600 OR LESS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED WEAKER CREDITS.

FOR LOWER CREDIT SCORES, WE ADEQUATELY PRICE FOR THE INCREMENTAL RISK AT ORIGINATION AND MONITOR CREDIT MIGRATION THROUGH OUR RISK RATINGS PROCESS. WE CONTINUOUSLY ADJUST OUR CREDIT LINE UNDERWRITING MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION STRATEGIES BASED ON CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES.
