300,000 PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.  SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1892, WE HAVE

DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED

CONSIDERABLY THE SCOPE OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

IN

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WE ENCOUNTER AGGRESSIVE AND

ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY

CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL

AS CUSTOMER COMMITMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE

THAT, IN GENERAL, WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IS ONE OF FOUR

MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE ALSO COMPETE IN

SYNDICATED BROADCAST TELEVISION PROGRAMMING, CABLE/SATELLITE TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES AND IN THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY. THE BUSINESSES IN

WHICH GECS ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL

-

THAT IS, STATEMENTS

RELATED TO FUTURE, NOT PAST, EVENTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

OFTEN ADDRESS OUR EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND OFTEN

CONTAIN WORDS SUCH AS “EXPECT,” “ANTICIPATE,” “INTEND,” “PLAN,” “BELIEVE,”

“SEEK,” OR “WILL.” FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR NATURE ADDRESS MATTERS

THAT ARE, TO DIFFERENT DEGREES, UNCERTAIN. FOR US, PARTICULAR UNCERTAINTIES THAT

COULD ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS INCLUDE: THE BEHAVIOR OF

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATES AND

COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRICES; THE COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER CREDIT ENVIRONMENT; THE

IMPACT OF REGULATION AND REGULATORY, INVESTIGATIVE AND LEGAL ACTIONS; STRATEGIC

ACTIONS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS; FUTURE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED

BUSINESSES; FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR INDUSTRIES WHICH WE SERVE,

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY

GENERATION, MEDIA, REAL ESTATE AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES; AND NUMEROUS OTHER

MATTERS OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALE, INCLUDING THOSE OF A POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND COMPETITIVE NATURE. THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY CAUSE OUR

ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE EXPRESSED IN OUR

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE OUR FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED GLOBAL REVENUES INCREASED TO $86.5 BILLION IN 2007, COMPARED WITH

$70.8 BILLION IN 2006 AND $60.9 BILLION IN 2005. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ABOUT OUR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS, SEE PAGES 51 AND 52 OF THE 2007 ANNUAL

OPERATING

SEGMENTS

SEGMENT

REVENUE AND PROFIT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED ON PAGE 47 OF THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREOWNERS. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL DATA AND COMMENTARY ON RECENT FINANCIAL

RESULTS FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON PAGES 46-51 OF THAT REPORT

AND IN NOTE 25 (PAGES 98 AND 99) TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

OPERATING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE REPORTED AS SEGMENTS INCLUDE INFRASTRUCTURE, COMMERCIAL

FINANCE, GE MONEY, HEALTHCARE, NBC UNIVERSAL AND INDUSTRIAL. THERE IS

APPROPRIATE ELIMINATION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF GECS AND THE EFFECT OF

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS TO ARRIVE AT TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DATA. A SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, WE TRANSFERRED THE EQUIPMENT SERVICES BUSINESS FROM

THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT TO THE COMMERCIAL FINANCE SEGMENT, WHERE A PORTION OF THE

BUSINESS IS REPORTED IN CAPITAL SOLUTIONS. PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION HAS BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION.

WE

ALSO CONTINUE OUR LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SEGMENTS.

INFRASTRUCTURE

WHITNEY DIVISION OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION. NEW ENGINES ARE ALSO BEING

DESIGNED AND MARKETED IN JOINT VENTURES WITH ROLLS-ROYCE GROUP PLC AND HONDA

AERO, INC., A DIVISION OF HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD.

INFRASTRUCTURE

IS PARTY TO COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS THAT SHARE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF CERTAIN

AIRCRAFT AND MARINE ENGINE LINES AND THEIR RELATED AERO-DERIVATIVES.

INFRASTRUCTURE COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS TAKE THE FORM OF BOTH JOINT VENTURES AND

REVENUE SHARING PROGRAMS.

·

JOINT

VENTURES MARKET AND SELL PARTICULAR AIRCRAFT ENGINE LINES, BUT REQUIRE

NEGLIGIBLE DIRECT INVESTMENT BECAUSE THE VENTURE PARTIES CONDUCT

ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, ASSEMBLY AND AFTERMARKET

SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, AVIATION SUPPLIES CERTAIN

ENGINE COMPONENTS AND RETAINS RELATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE

CFM56 ENGINE LINE IS THE PRODUCT OF CFM INTERNATIONAL AND THE GP7000

ENGINE LINE IS THE PRODUCT OF ENGINE ALLIANCE,

LLC.

·

REVENUE

SHARING PROGRAMS ARE A STANDARD FORM OF COOPERATION FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCT

PROGRAMS IN THE AVIATION AND AERO-DERIVATIVE INDUSTRIES. THESE BUSINESSES

ARE CONTROLLED BY INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT COUNTERPARTIES HAVE AN AGREED SHARE

OF REVENUES AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT AND COMPONENT PRODUCTION

RESPONSIBILITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, SUCH COUNTERPARTY INTERESTS RANGED

FROM 3% TO 49% OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS; ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS COSTS OF PRODUCTION.

ON

MAY 4, 2007, AVIATION ACQUIRED SMITHS AEROSPACE FROM SMITHS GROUP PLC FOR

OVERHAUL OF ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS. THESE MRO SERVICES ARE OFTEN

PROVIDED UNDER LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS.

THE

WORLDWIDE COMPETITION IN AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES AND MRO (INCLUDING PARTS SALES) IS

INTENSE. BOTH U.S. AND EXPORT MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES

ARE LONG AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS BUSINESS, AS ARE FOCUSED

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGIES AND PROTECTION OF KEY AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGN,

MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND PRODUCT UPGRADE TECHNOLOGIES.  OUR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REGULATORY STANDARDS.

(5)

POTENTIAL

SALES FOR ANY ENGINE ARE LIMITED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS TECHNOLOGICAL

LIFETIME, WHICH MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING UPON THE RATE OF ADVANCE IN

TECHNOLOGY, THE SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER OF

RELEVANT AIRFRAME APPLICATIONS. AIRCRAFT ENGINE ORDERS TEND TO FOLLOW MILITARY

AND AIRLINE PROCUREMENT CYCLES, ALTHOUGH THESE CYCLES DIFFER FROM EACH

OTHER.

NBC

UNIVERSAL (8.9%, 10.7% AND 10.8% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2007, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY) IS ONE OF THE WORLD’S LEADING MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT

COMPANIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF ENTERTAINMENT, NEWS

AND INFORMATION TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. FORMED IN 2004 THROUGH THE COMBINING OF

NBC AND VIVENDI UNIVERSAL ENTERTAINMENT, NBC UNIVERSAL OWNS AND OPERATES A

VALUABLE PORTFOLIO OF NEWS AND ENTERTAINMENT NETWORKS, A PREMIER MOTION PICTURE

COMPANY, SIGNIFICANT TELEVISION PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, A LEADING TELEVISION

STATIONS GROUP AND WORLD-RENOWNED THEME PARKS. NBC UNIVERSAL IS 80-PERCENT OWNED

BY GENERAL ELECTRIC AND 20-PERCENT OWNED BY VIVENDI S.A. NBC UNIVERSAL IS

PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN THE BROADCAST OF NETWORK TELEVISION SERVICES TO

AFFILIATED TELEVISION STATIONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES; THE PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION OF TELEVISION PROGRAMS AND MOTION PICTURES; THE OPERATION, UNDER

LICENSES FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC), OF TELEVISION

STATIONS; THE OPERATION OF SEVERAL CABLE/SATELLITE TELEVISION NETWORKS AROUND

THE WORLD; THE OPERATION OF THEME PARKS; AND INVESTMENT AND PROGRAMMING

ACTIVITIES IN DIGITAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IS ONE

OF FOUR MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS AND SERVES 230

AFFILIATED STATIONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. TELEMUNDO IS OUR U.S.

SPANISH-LANGUAGE BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE OWNED

AND OPERATED 26 TELEVISION STATIONS. BROADCASTING OPERATIONS OF THE NBC

TELEVISION NETWORK, THE TELEMUNDO NETWORK AND THE COMPANY’S OWNED STATIONS ARE

SUBJECT TO FCC REGULATION. OUR CABLE/SATELLITE TELEVISION NETWORK OPERATIONS

NBC

UNIVERSAL IS SUBJECT TO A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR OPERATIONS. OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS, CABLE TELEVISION NETWORKS AND TELEVISION

STATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWER TASTE AND

PREFERENCE THAT CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE OR UNFORESEEN. IN ADDITION, FUTURE REVENUES

IN THESE PROPERTIES ARE DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN, RENEW OR

RENEGOTIATE LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING CONTRACTS, INCLUDING EVENT-BASED SPORTS

PROGRAMMING AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO

CABLE/SATELLITE OPERATORS. OUR TELEVISION AND MOTION PICTURES PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES

IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION MARKETS. TECHNOLOGICAL

ADVANCES LIKE DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS, INTERNET STREAMING AND ELECTRONIC

SELL-THROUGH OFFER ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS THROUGH NEW MEDIA, INTRODUCING

UNCERTAINTY TO OUR OPERATIONS. OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ENABLE THE UNAUTHORIZED

COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MOTION PICTURES AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING,

INCREASING THE RISK OF PIRACY. WE CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO

PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE.

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL SELLS PRODUCTS THAT SHARE SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS

-

COMPETITIVE

DESIGN, EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE. STRONG

GLOBAL COMPETITION RARELY PERMITS PREMIUM PRICING, SO COST CONTROL, INCLUDING

PRODUCTIVITY, IS KEY. DESPITE PRICING PRESSURES ON MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE ALSO

INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENTIATED, PREMIUM PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE

PROFITABLE. WHILE SOME CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED

TO CONSUMER APPLICATIONS (MAJOR APPLIANCES, FOR EXAMPLE), AND SOME PRIMARILY TO

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS (SWITCHGEAR, FOR EXAMPLE), OTHERS ARE DIRECTED TO BOTH

MARKETS (LIGHTING, FOR EXAMPLE).

WE

SELL AND SERVICE MAJOR HOME APPLIANCES INCLUDING REFRIGERATORS, FREEZERS,

ELECTRIC AND GAS RANGES, COOKTOPS, DISHWASHERS, CLOTHES WASHERS AND DRYERS,

MICROWAVE OVENS, ROOM AIR CONDITIONERS, AND RESIDENTIAL WATER SYSTEMS FOR

FILTRATION, SOFTENING AND HEATING. BRANDS ARE MONOGRAM®, GE PROFILETM, GE® AND

HOTPOINT®.

WE

MANUFACTURE CERTAIN PRODUCTS, AND ALSO SOURCE FINISHED PRODUCT AND COMPONENT

PARTS FROM THIRD-PARTY GLOBAL MANUFACTURERS. A LARGE PORTION OF OUR APPLIANCES

SALES ARE THROUGH A VARIETY OF RETAIL OUTLETS FOR REPLACEMENT OF INSTALLED

UNITS. RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS INSTALLING UNITS IN NEW CONSTRUCTION ARE

OUR SECOND MAJOR U.S. CHANNEL. WE OFFER THE LARGEST OEM SERVICE ORGANIZATION IN

THE APPLIANCES INDUSTRY, PROVIDING IN-HOME REPAIR, EXTENDED SERVICE PLANS AND

WARRANTY ADMINISTRATION. WE ALSO MANUFACTURE AND SELL A VARIETY OF LAMP PRODUCTS

FOR COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER MARKETS, INCLUDING FULL LINES OF

INCANDESCENT, HALOGEN, FLUORESCENT, HIGH-INTENSITY DISCHARGE, LIGHT-EMITTING

DISTRIBUTE ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL PRODUCTS INCLUDING TRANSFORMERS,

METERS, CIRCUIT BREAKERS, PANEL BOARDS AND GENERAL PURPOSE CONTROLS THAT ARE

USED TO DISTRIBUTE AND MANAGE POWER IN A VARIETY OF RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL,

CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE

MOTORS AND CONTROL SYSTEMS USED IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS PRIMARILY FOR OIL AND

GAS EXTRACTION AND MINING. WE ALSO PROVIDE CUSTOMER-FOCUSED SOLUTIONS CENTERED

ON THE DELIVERY AND CONTROL OF ELECTRIC POWER, AND MARKET A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMMERCIAL LIGHTING SYSTEMS.

THE

AGGREGATE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN MARKETS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

GENERALLY LAGS OVERALL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES. IN

THE UNITED STATES, INDUSTRIAL MARKETS ARE UNDERGOING SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL

CHANGES REFLECTING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND

CONTINUED COMMODITY COST PRESSURES.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

TOTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WERE $4,075 MILLION, $3,480 MILLION

AND $3,235 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE AMOUNTS,

$3,009 MILLION IN 2007 WAS GE-FUNDED ($2,790 MILLION IN 2006 AND $2,551 MILLION

IN 2005); AND $1,066 MILLION IN 2007 WAS FUNDED BY CUSTOMERS ($690 MILLION IN

2006 AND $684 MILLION IN 2005), PRINCIPALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

INFRASTRUCTURE’S AVIATION BUSINESS ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF GE’S

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WITH FUNDING FROM BOTH GE AND CUSTOMER

FUNDS. HEALTHCARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE’S ENERGY BUSINESS ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT

EXPENDITURES FUNDED PRIMARILY BY GE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS.

WE

ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS

WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF

ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE

REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.2 BILLION IN BOTH 2007 AND

2006. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE

ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF $0.2 BILLION TO $0.3 BILLION OVER THE NEXT

TWO YEARS.

THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) RULED IN FEBRUARY 2002 THAT

APPROXIMATELY 150,000 POUNDS OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS) MUST BE DREDGED

FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE. ON

NOVEMBER 2, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK APPROVED A CONSENT DECREE ENTERED INTO BETWEEN GE AND THE EPA THAT

REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EPA’S 2002

DECISION TO DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE

DREDGING WILL BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES WITH AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW OF

PERFORMANCE AFTER PHASE 1. UNDER THIS CONSENT DECREE, WE HAVE COMMITTED UP

TO $0.1 BILLION TO REIMBURSE THE EPA FOR ITS PAST AND FUTURE PROJECT OVERSIGHT

COSTS AND AGREED TO PERFORM THE FIRST PHASE OF DREDGING. WE FURTHER COMMITTED

THAT, SUBJECT TO FUTURE AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA ABOUT COMPLETION OF DREDGING

AFTER COMPLETION OF PHASE 1 AND THE PEER REVIEW, WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

FURTHER COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF PHASE 2 DREDGING. OUR STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, INCLUDED

LIABILITIES FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF THIS REMEDIATION.

EMPLOYEE

RELATIONS

AT

YEAR-END 2007, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES EMPLOYED

APPROXIMATELY 327,000 PERSONS, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 155,000 WERE EMPLOYED IN

THE UNITED STATES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT EMPLOYEES, SEE PAGE 63 OF

THE 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

APPROXIMATELY

20,500 GE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

REPRESENTED FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PURPOSES BY A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 125

DIFFERENT UNION LOCALS. A MAJORITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES ARE REPRESENTED BY UNION

LOCALS THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH, AND BARGAIN IN COORDINATION WITH, THE IUE-CWA,

THE INDUSTRIAL DIVISION OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA, AFL-CIO, CLC.

DURING 2007, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY NEGOTIATED FOUR-YEAR CONTRACTS WITH UNIONS

REPRESENTING A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE UNIONIZED EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED

STATES. MOST OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL TERMINATE IN JUNE 2011.

(14)

APPROXIMATELY

3,500 STAFF EMPLOYEES (AND A LARGE NUMBER OF FREELANCE EMPLOYEES) IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE COVERED BY ABOUT 160 LABOR AGREEMENTS TO WHICH NBC UNIVERSAL IS A

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS.

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,” AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY

STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING

INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT

-

SOMETIMES

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

-

THAN WE PRESENTLY

ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESSES

ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION OF OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS AND IN THE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. OF THIS FORM 10-K.

BELOW, WE HAVE DESCRIBED CERTAIN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO

MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS’ REACTIONS TO THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS WILL DETERMINE OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

RISKS

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. GLOBAL ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN MANY WAYS. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION. OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY LOCAL

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY.

POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR

SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION.

WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE

COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL.

OUR

CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COST OF CAPITAL

THE

MAJOR DEBT AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT AND HAVE GIVEN THEIR HIGHEST

DEBT RATINGS TO US. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH

INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES

AND  TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES IS TO MAINTAIN OUR “TRIPLE A” RATINGS AS THEY SERVE TO LOWER OUR

BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATE OUR ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF LENDERS. FAILURE TO

MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE A DEBT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND

RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS.

THE

SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

WITH

RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE

CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND

OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND

TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND

BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO

SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD

DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, OR WE MAY DISPOSE OF A

BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS, WHICH ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. IN

ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE SELL A BUSINESS WHOSE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE

EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN WHICH CASE OUR DECISION WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY

SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE VALUE. CORRESPONDINGLY, WE MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A

PARTICULAR BUSINESS’S PROSPECTS, IN WHICH CASE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A BUYER

AT A PRICE ACCEPTABLE TO US AND THEREFORE MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED

ENTERPRISE VALUE.

(16)

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND FOREIGN

LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY EVEN REQUIRE

US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IF EXISTING PRACTICES BECOME MORE

RESTRICTED, SUBJECT TO ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITED OUTRIGHT. PARTICULAR RISKS

INCLUDE REGULATORY RISKS ARISING FROM LOCAL LAWS, SUCH AS LAWS THAT REDUCE THE

ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT CONSUMER BORROWING, FROM LOCAL LIQUIDITY

REGULATIONS THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISKS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS,

AND CHANGES TO TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE,

GE’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S.

RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S.

TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A

DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS

U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH FOREIGN BANKS

AND OTHER FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION,

WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF 2008, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON

FOUR PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, AND EACH TIME IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS. IF THIS

PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS.

OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE ALSO AT TIMES BEING

REVIEWED OR INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS,

FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND

DAMAGES.

CHANGES

IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

WE

PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTIES. WE ALSO CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY AND SELL PROPERTIES

WHICH MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OUTLAYS OR PROCEEDS OF CASH, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY

OR IN THE AGGREGATE. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY

DEPENDENT UPON THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED AND THE

PERCEIVED VALUE OF THAT MARKET AT THE TIME OF SALE. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY

OPTIMIZING THAT MIX AND SUCH ACTIVITY MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE YEAR TO

THE NEXT.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN JANUARY 2005 THE STAFF OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) INFORMED US THAT IT HAD COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION AND

REQUESTED CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF HEDGE

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES BY US AND GE CAPITAL. IN AUGUST 2005 THE SEC STAFF

ADVISED US THAT THE SEC HAD ISSUED A FORMAL ORDER OF INVESTIGATION IN THE

MATTER. THE SEC STAFF HAS TAKEN TESTIMONY IN THIS MATTER AND HAS REQUESTED

INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER GE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING ITEMS

RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION.

(17)

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SEC’S INVESTIGATION, WE ARE CONDUCTING AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF

REVENUE RECOGNITION MATTERS. OUR REVIEW HAS BEEN THOROUGH AND EXTENSIVE,

CONTINUING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, AND HAS BEEN CONDUCTED USING SUBSTANTIAL

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES. THESE RESOURCES HAVE INCLUDED EXTENSIVE

REDEPLOYMENT OF OUR 430 PERSON AUDIT STAFF TO FOCUS ON THIS REVIEW; SUBSTANTIAL

TIME AND RESOURCES OF OUR CONTROLLERSHIP AND FINANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR

INTERNAL LEGAL ORGANIZATION; ACCOUNTING AND EXPERT SUPPORT FROM OUR AUDITOR,

KPMG; AND EXTENSIVE RESOURCES FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL AND ACCOUNTING

EXPERTISE, WHO HAVE ADVISED US AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE. WE HAVE REGULARLY

REPORTED RESULTS OF THE REVIEW TO THE SEC STAFF AS CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN REACHED

AND IN CASES WHERE ERRORS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, WE HAVE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED THEM

IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC.

IN

A FORM 8-K FILED JANUARY 18, 2008, WE REPORTED THAT WE HAD DETERMINED THAT WE

MADE AN ERROR IN THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CHANGED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR PROFITS ON

CERTAIN AFTERMARKET SPARE PARTS. AS WE REPORTED, UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT

SERVICES AGREEMENTS, WE PROVIDE REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE FOR INSTALLED PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING SPARE PARTS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AND PROFITS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD

IN PROPORTION TO OUR CONTRACT COSTS. AN ELEMENT OF OUR CONTRACT COSTS IS THE

COST OF SPARE PARTS. BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2002, OUR AVIATION BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR

THE PROFITS ON SPARE PARTS INSTALLED PURSUANT TO LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICE

AGREEMENTS EITHER IN ITS SPARE PARTS UNIT OR IN ITS REVENUE RECOGNITION MODEL

FOR COMMERCIAL ENGINES. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF KPMG,

WE CHANGED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR SPARE PARTS IN TWO WAYS THAT LARGELY OFFSET: TO

EXCLUDE ALL SPARE PARTS FROM THE MODEL FOR ENGINE SALES AND TO INCLUDE MARGIN IN

LONG-TERM SERVICES AGREEMENTS TO THE EXTENT SPARE PARTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

AGREEMENTS.

IN

MAKING THIS CHANGE, WE CHANGED OUR ESTIMATE OF THE UNPERFORMED PORTIONS OF

LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS TO USE OUR COST INSTEAD OF CATALOGUE LIST

PRICE. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT BECAUSE WE DID NOT ALSO RE-COMPUTE OUR PRE-2002

SPARE PARTS COSTS ON THE SAME BASIS, WE OVERESTIMATED THE PERCENTAGE OF

COMPLETION OF AFFECTED AGREEMENTS AND UNDERESTIMATED THE RELATED CONTRACT PROFIT

RATES, AN ERROR THAT RESULTED IN ACCELERATING REVENUES AND PROFITS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO SUCH AGREEMENTS IN 2002 AND UNDERSTATING REVENUES AND PROFITS IN SOME FUTURE

PERIODS. SIMILAR ADJUSTMENTS IN THE ACCOUNTING METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THE COST OF

SPARE PARTS INSTALLED PURSUANT TO LONG-TERM SERVICES AGREEMENTS WERE MADE BY

AVIATION IN 2003 WITH RESPECT TO SPARE PARTS MANUFACTURED BY A JOINT VENTURE

PARTNER AND IN OUR ENERGY BUSINESS IN 2006. WE ALSO REPORTED THAT WE HAD

DETERMINED THAT FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO 2004, WE MADE AN ERROR IN OUR APPLICATION

AND DESCRIPTION OF APPROPRIATE REVENUE MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES IN CERTAIN

INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESSES. OUR ASSOCIATED ROUTINES AND CONTROLS FAILED TO

PREVENT OR DETECT THESE ERRORS.

WE

AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE COMMITTEE’S INDEPENDENT

COUNSEL, HAVE EVALUATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING AND THE EFFECT ON OUR

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ITEMS REPORTED IN OUR JANUARY

18, 2008 FORM 8-K, AND HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THESE

ITEMS, BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND TOGETHER WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE ERRORS

IDENTIFIED IN OUR FORM 10-QS FILED ON JULY 27, 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2, 2007, ARE

NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HAVE DETERMINED THAT RESTATEMENT OF

OUR PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT REQUIRED. WE HAVE INCLUDED THE

ADJUSTMENTS FOR THESE ITEMS IN PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL INFORMATION REPORTED IN

THIS FORM 10-K.

WE

ALSO HAVE CONSIDERED THESE MATTERS IN CONTEXT OF OUR REVIEW OF OUR INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE INTERNAL CONTROL

DEFICIENCIES IMPLICATED BY THE ITEMS IDENTIFIED ABOVE CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT

DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, BUT DO NOT

(INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE WITH OTHER IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES) CONSTITUTE

A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL.

(18)

WE

AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE TAKE THESE INTERNAL CONTROL MATTERS VERY SERIOUSLY AND

ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESSES AND

PROCEDURES. IN RESPONSE TO THESE MATTERS, WE AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN

ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REMEDIATION EFFORTS TO

ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS WITH RESPECT TO OUR

REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND TO ENHANCE OUR OVERALL CONTROL

ENVIRONMENT.  WE HAVE ALREADY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CONTINUING TO

IMPLEMENT, A NUMBER OF REMEDIAL ACTIONS AND INTERNAL CONTROL

ENHANCEMENTS.

INVESTIGATION AND ISSUES ARISING IN THAT INVESTIGATION AND OUR INTERNAL REVIEW

WITH THE SEC STAFF WITH A GOAL OF COMPLETING OUR REVIEW AND RESOLVING THESE

MATTERS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND AUDIT COMMITTEE ARE

MONITORING THE REVIEW CLOSELY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND

ACCOUNTING EXPERTS.  WE AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE ARE COMMITTED TO

ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT ARISE AND TO PROVIDING TRANSPARENT DISCLOSURE TO OUR

INVESTORS CONCERNING THESE MATTERS.

THE ANTITRUST

DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND THE SEC ARE CONTINUING TO

CONDUCT AN INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATION OF MARKETING AND SALES OF GUARANTEED

INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO MUNICIPALITIES. IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION, TWO SUBSIDIARIES OF GE CAPITAL RECEIVED

SUBPOENAS IN 2006: GE FUNDING CMS (TRINITY FUNDING CO.) RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM

THE DOJ REQUESTING DOCUMENTS AND GE FUNDING CAPITAL MARKET SERVICES, INC.

RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE SEC THAT REQUESTS SIMILAR INFORMATION ABOUT TRINITY

FUNDING COMPANY, LLC. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE SEC AND DOJ IN

THIS MATTER.

(19)

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN APRIL 2006 THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS CONTEMPLATING SEEKING $990,000 IN

PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AT ITS RECENTLY SOLD MT. VERNON,

INDIANA PLASTICS FACILITY. EPA HAS ASSERTED THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO

ADEQUATELY CONTROL EMISSIONS FROM VALVES AND INLET PIPES IN AN UNDERGROUND

PIPING SYSTEM. WE DISAGREE WITH THOSE ASSERTIONS AND EPA HAS ALREADY MODIFIED

ITS POSITION TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS BASED ON CONVERSATIONS

WITH GE. THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AGENCY OVER

BOTH THE NATURE AND SEVERITY OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS.
