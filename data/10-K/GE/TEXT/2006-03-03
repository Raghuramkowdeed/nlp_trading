FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND OFTEN CONTAIN WORDS SUCH AS “EXPECTS,” “ANTICIPATES,”

“INTENDS,” “PLANS,” “BELIEVES,” “SEEKS,” OR “WILL.” FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

BY THEIR NATURE ADDRESS MATTERS THAT ARE, TO DIFFERENT DEGREES, UNCERTAIN.

FOR

US, PARTICULAR UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT OUR

FUTURE RESULTS INCLUDE: THE BEHAVIOR OF FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES; STRATEGIC ACTIONS,

INCLUDING DISPOSITIONS; FUTURE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; FUTURE

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR INDUSTRIES WHICH WE SERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION, MEDIA, REAL

ESTATE AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES; UNANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN OUR

INSURANCE BUSINESSES; AND NUMEROUS OTHER MATTERS OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND

GLOBAL SCALE, INCLUDING THOSE OF A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, COMPETITIVE

AND REGULATORY NATURE. THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS

TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE EXPRESSED IN OUR FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS. WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE OUR FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED GLOBAL REVENUES INCREASED TO $77.9 BILLION IN 2005, COMPARED

WITH

OPERATING

SEGMENTS

SEGMENT

REVENUE AND PROFIT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED ON PAGE 49 OF THE 2005 ANNUAL

REPORT

TO SHAREOWNERS. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL DATA AND COMMENTARY ON RECENT FINANCIAL

RESULTS FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON PAGES 48-52 OF THAT REPORT

AND IN

NOTE 26 (PAGE 97) TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, WE ANNOUNCED THE PLANNED SALE OF THE PROPERTY

AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES AND THE EUROPEAN LIFE AND HEALTH

OPERATIONS OF GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS CORPORATION (GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS)

AND

COMPLETED A GENWORTH FINANCIAL, INC. (GENWORTH) SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERING,

WHICH

REDUCED OUR OWNERSHIP IN GENWORTH TO 18%. WE HAVE REPORTED BOTH GE INSURANCE

SOLUTIONS AND GENWORTH AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

THESE BUSINESSES WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE COMMERCIAL FINANCE SEGMENT.

ALSO, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES, PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED IN THE COMMERCIAL FINANCE SEGMENT, WERE TRANSFERRED TO CORPORATE

ITEMS

AND ELIMINATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

OPERATING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE REPORTED AS SEGMENTS INCLUDE INFRASTRUCTURE, INDUSTRIAL,

HEALTHCARE, NBC UNIVERSAL, COMMERCIAL FINANCE AND CONSUMER FINANCE. THERE

IS

APPROPRIATE ELIMINATION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF GECS AND THE IMMATERIAL EFFECT

OF

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS TO ARRIVE AT TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DATA. A SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.

WE

WILL ALSO CONTINUE OUR LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SEGMENTS.

CORPORATION.

WE

PROVIDE MAINTENANCE, COMPONENT REPAIR AND OVERHAUL SERVICES (MRO), INCLUDING

SALES OF REPLACEMENT PARTS, FOR MANY MODELS OF ENGINES, INCLUDING REPAIR

AND

OVERHAUL OF ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS.

THE

WORLDWIDE COMPETITION IN AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES AND MRO (INCLUDING PARTS SALES)

IS

INTENSE. BOTH U.S. AND EXPORT MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

CYCLES

ARE LONG AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES, BOTH CUSTOMER-FINANCED AND INTERNALLY FUNDED,

ARE

IMPORTANT IN THIS BUSINESS, AS ARE FOCUSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGIES

AND

PROTECTION OF KEY AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND PRODUCT

UPGRADE TECHNOLOGIES.

POTENTIAL

SALES FOR ANY ENGINE ARE LIMITED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS TECHNOLOGICAL

LIFETIME, WHICH MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING UPON THE RATE OF ADVANCE

IN

TECHNOLOGY, THE SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER

OF

RELEVANT AIRFRAME APPLICATIONS. AIRCRAFT ENGINE ORDERS TEND TO FOLLOW MILITARY

AND AIRLINE PROCUREMENT CYCLES, ALTHOUGH THESE CYCLES DIFFER FROM EACH

OTHER.

PILOT TRAINING, FLEET PLANNING AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES. WE OPERATE

IN A

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS,

BANKS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OTHER FINANCE AND LEASING COMPANIES.

COMPETITION IS BASED ON LEASE RATES AND TERMS, AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT DELIVERY

DATES, CONDITION AND AVAILABILITY.

THE

U.S. COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO FACE CHALLENGES AND FINANCIAL

PRESSURE THAT AFFECT A PORTION OF OUR COMMERCIAL AVIATION BUSINESS. MANY

CARRIERS ARE EXPERIENCING MAJOR RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION, INCLUDING

BANKRUPTCIES. THESE COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCED MARGINAL RETURNS AND IN SOME

CASES LOSSES RESULTING FROM COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND INCREASED FUEL COSTS.

REGULATIONS.

WORLDWIDE

COMPETITION FOR POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS INTENSE. DEMAND

FOR

MOST POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS GLOBAL AND, AS A RESULT, IS

SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH

WE

DO BUSINESS. REGIONAL LOAD GROWTH REQUIREMENTS AND DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT

ARE

IMPORTANT FACTORS. THE AVAILABILITY OF FUELS AND RELATED PRICES HAVE A LARGE

IMPACT ON DEMAND.

DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER ENTERTAINMENT CHOICES. IN ADDITION,

RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES LIKE PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS OFFER PERSONAL

ENTERTAINMENT THROUGH NEW MEDIA, INTRODUCING ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY TO FUTURE

REVENUE SOURCES. OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ENABLE COPYING CONTENT, INCREASING THE

ON

NOVEMBER 18, 2005, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH

SWISS

TOTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WERE $3,425 MILLION IN 2005. TOTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE $3,091 MILLION IN 2004 AND $2,656 MILLION IN 2003. OF THESE

AMOUNTS, $2,741 MILLION IN 2005 WAS GE-FUNDED ($2,443 MILLION IN 2004 AND

$2,103

MILLION IN 2003); AND $684 MILLION IN 2005 WAS FUNDED BY CUSTOMERS ($648

MILLION

IN 2004 AND $553 MILLION IN 2003), PRINCIPALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

INFRASTRUCTURE’S AVIATION BUSINESS ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF GE’S

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES FROM BOTH GE AND CUSTOMER FUNDS.

HEALTHCARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE’S ENERGY BUSINESS ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT

EXPENDITURES OF GE AND CUSTOMER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS.

WE

ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS

WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY

OF

ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE

REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO $0.1 BILLION IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS.

WE

PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL

EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF $0.2 BILLION TO $0.3 BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO

YEARS.

THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) RULED IN FEBRUARY 2002 THAT

APPROXIMATELY 150,000 POUNDS OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS) MUST BE

DREDGED

FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE. ON OCTOBER

6, 2005, GE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ENTERED INTO

AND

FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK A

CONSENT

DECREE THAT, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THAT COURT, REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE

FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EPA’S 2002 DECISION TO DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING

SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE DREDGING WILL BE PERFORMED IN TWO

PHASES WITH AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE AFTER PHASE 1. UNDER

THIS

CONSENT DECREE, WE HAVE COMMITTED UP TO $0.1 BILLION TO REIMBURSE THE EPA

FOR

ITS PAST AND FUTURE PROJECT OVERSIGHT COSTS AND AGREED TO PERFORM THE FIRST

PHASE OF DREDGING. WE FURTHER COMMITTED THAT, SUBJECT TO FUTURE AGREEMENT

WITH

THE EPA ABOUT COMPLETION OF DREDGING AFTER COMPLETION OF PHASE 1 AND THE

PEER

REVIEW, WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FURTHER COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF PHASE

2

DREDGING. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND

2004,

INCLUDED LIABILITIES FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF THIS REMEDIATION.

YEAR-END 2005, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES EMPLOYED

APPROXIMATELY 316,000 PERSONS, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 161,000 WERE EMPLOYED

NEGOTIATED FOUR-YEAR CONTRACTS WITH UNIONS REPRESENTING A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

OF THOSE UNITED STATES EMPLOYEES WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS. MOST OF THESE

CONTRACTS WILL TERMINATE IN JUNE 2007. NBC UNIVERSAL IS PARTY TO APPROXIMATELY

160 LABOR AGREEMENTS COVERING ABOUT 3,500 STAFF EMPLOYEES (AND A LARGE NUMBER

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,” AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING

ANY

STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING

INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE

OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT

-

SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

-

THAN WE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL

RISKS

THAT OUR BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION OF OUR 2005

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS AND IN THE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1.

OF THIS

FORM 10-K. BELOW, WE HAVE DESCRIBED OUR PRESENT VIEW OF CERTAIN IMPORTANT

STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS

OUR

COMPETITORS’ REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WILL DETERMINE OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND REGULATORY

RISKS

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. GLOBAL ECONOMIC

AND

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN MANY WAYS. OPERATIONS

ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION. PARTICULAR LOCAL JURISDICTION

RISKS INCLUDE REGULATORY RISKS ARISING FROM LOCAL LAWS AND FROM LOCAL LIQUIDITY

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING RISKS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS. OUR GLOBAL

BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF

OUR

ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED

USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE,

SUCH

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL.

OUR

CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COST OF CAPITAL

THE

MAJOR DEBT AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT AND HAVE GIVEN THEIR HIGHEST

DEBT RATINGS TO US. ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IS TO MAINTAIN THESE

“TRIPLE

A” RATINGS AS THEY SERVE TO LOWER OUR BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATE OUR ACCESS

TO A VARIETY OF LENDERS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE A DEBT RATING COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS.

THE

DISPOSITION OF BUSINESSES THAT DO NOT FIT WITH OUR EVOLVING STRATEGY CAN

BE

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

WE

WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES

THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. OUR DECISIONS TO SELL

GENWORTH AND GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS ARE RECENT EXAMPLES OF DISPOSITION

DECISIONS. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE

TERMS

IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES, OR WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS WHICH

ARE

LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE SELL A

BUSINESS WHOSE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN WHICH

CASE

OUR DECISION WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE VALUE.

CORRESPONDINGLY, WE MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A PARTICULAR BUSINESS’S

PROSPECTS, IN WHICH CASE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A BUYER AT A PRICE ACCEPTABLE

TO US AND THEREFORE MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE

VALUE.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

IN

JANUARY 2005, THE BOSTON DISTRICT OFFICE OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) INFORMED US THAT IT HAD COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION AND

REQUESTED THAT GE AND GE CAPITAL VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES BY

US

AND GE CAPITAL. THE SEC STAFF ADVISED US IN AUGUST 2005 THAT THE SEC HAD

ISSUED

A FORMAL ORDER OF INVESTIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER, WHICH WE

BELIEVE

TO BE A COMMON STEP IN THE PROCESS IN SUCH MATTERS. WE AND GE CAPITAL HAVE

CONTINUED TO VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION TO THE SEC STAFF

AND

WE ARE COOPERATING FULLY WITH ITS INVESTIGATION.

ON

JUNE 14, 2005, WE RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATING TO FINITE RISK

INSURANCE. THE SUBPOENA IS GENERAL IN NATURE. GE RECEIVED A SIMILAR SUBPOENA

FROM THE NORTHEAST REGIONAL OFFICE OF THE SEC ON APRIL 29, 2005. WE ARE

COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE SEC AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE.

ON

OCTOBER 6, 2005, GE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ENTERED

INTO AND FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW

YORK

A CONSENT DECREE THAT, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THAT COURT, REPRESENTS A

COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EPA’S 2002 DECISION TO DREDGE

PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE DREDGING WILL BE

PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES WITH AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE AFTER

PHASE 1. UNDER THIS CONSENT DECREE, WE HAVE COMMITTED UP TO $111 MILLION

TO

REIMBURSE THE EPA FOR ITS PAST AND FUTURE PROJECT OVERSIGHT COSTS AND AGREED

TO

PERFORM THE FIRST PHASE OF DREDGING. WE FURTHER COMMITTED THAT, SUBJECT TO

FUTURE AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA ABOUT COMPLETION OF DREDGING AFTER COMPLETION

OF

PHASE 1 AND THE PEER REVIEW, WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FURTHER COSTS, INCLUDING

COSTS OF PHASE 2 DREDGING. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2005, INCLUDED LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE FUTURE COSTS OF THIS

REMEDIATION.
