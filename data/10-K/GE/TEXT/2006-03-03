general
unless
otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms ge, gecs and ge
capital on the basis of consolidation described in note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements on page 70 of the 2005 annual report to shareowners
of
general electric company (the company). the financial section of such annual
report to shareowners (pages 41 through 109 of that document) is described
in
part iv item 15(a)(1) and set forth in exhibit13 of this 10-k report and
is an integral part hereof. references in parts i and ii of this 10-k report
are
to the page numbers of the 2005 annual report to shareowners. also, unless
otherwise indicated by the context, general electric means the parent company,
general electric company.
general
electrics address is 1 river road, schenectady, ny 12345-6999; we also maintain
executive offices at 3135 easton turnpike, fairfield, ct
06828-0001.
ge
is one of the largest and most diversified industrial corporations in the
world.
we have engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety
of
products for the generation, transmission, distribution, control and utilization
of electricity since our incorporation in 1892. over the years, we have
developed or acquired new technologies and services that have broadened
considerably the scope of our activities.
our
products include major appliances; lighting products; industrial automation
products; medical diagnostic imaging systems; bioscience assays and separation
technology products; electrical distribution and control equipment; locomotives;
power generation and delivery products; nuclear power support services and

assemblies; commercial and military aircraft jet engines; chemicals and
equipment for treatment of water and process systems; security equipment
and
systems; and engineered materials, such as plastics and silicones.
our
services include product services; electrical product supply houses; electrical
apparatus installation, engineering, and repair and rebuilding services.
through
our affiliate, nbc universal, inc., we produce and deliver network television
services, operate television stations, produce and distribute motion pictures,
operate cable/satellite networks, operate theme parks, and program activities
in
multimedia and the internet. through another affiliate, general electric
capital
services, inc., we offer a broad array of financial and other services including
consumer financing, commercial and industrial financing, real estate financing,
asset management and leasing, mortgage services, consumer savings and insurance
services, and reinsurance.
in
virtually all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive
and
able competition. in many instances, the competitive climate is characterized
by
changing technology that requires continuing research and development, as
well
as customer commitments. with respect to manufacturing operations, we believe
that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major
industries in which we participate. the nbc television network is one of
four
major u.s. commercial broadcast television networks. we also compete with
syndicated broadcast television programming, cable and satellite television
programming activities and in the motion picture industry. the businesses
in
which gecs engages are subject to competition from various types of financial
institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks,
broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies,
independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers,
and insurance and reinsurance companies.

this
document contains forward-looking statements -
that is, statements related to future, not past, events. in this context,
forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and
financial performance, and often contain words such as expects, anticipates,
intends, plans, believes, seeks, or will. forward-looking statements
by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.
for
us, particular uncertainties which could adversely or positively affect our
future results include: the behavior of financial markets, including
fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices; strategic actions,
including dispositions; future integration of acquired businesses; future
financial performance of major industries which we serve, including, without
limitation, the air and rail transportation, energy generation, media, real
estate and healthcare industries; unanticipated loss development in our
insurance businesses; and numerous other matters of national, regional and
global scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive
and regulatory nature. these uncertainties may cause our actual future results
to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking
statements. we do not undertake to update our forward-looking
statements.
our
consolidated global revenues increased to $77.9 billion in 2005, compared
with
$66.9 billion in 2004 and $54.3 billion in 2003. for additional information
about our global operations, see pages 52 and 53 of the 2005 annual report
to
shareowners.
operating
segments
segment
revenue and profit information is presented on page 49 of the 2005 annual
report
to shareowners. additional financial data and commentary on recent financial
results for operating segments are provided on pages 48-52 of that report
and in
note 26 (page 97) to the consolidated financial statements.
in
the fourth quarter of 2005, we announced the planned sale of the property
and
casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses and the european life and health
operations of ge insurance solutions corporation (ge insurance solutions)
and
completed a genworth financial, inc. (genworth) secondary public offering,
which
reduced our ownership in genworth to 18%. we have reported both ge insurance
solutions and genworth as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
these businesses were previously reported in the commercial finance segment.
also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, our insurance activities, previously
reported in the commercial finance segment, were transferred to corporate
items
and eliminations for all periods presented.
operating
businesses that are reported as segments include infrastructure, industrial,
healthcare, nbc universal, commercial finance and consumer finance. there
is
appropriate elimination of the net earnings of gecs and the immaterial effect
of
transactions between segments to arrive at total consolidated data. a summary
description of each of our operating segments follows.
we
will also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental
information for certain businesses within the segments.
(4)
infrastructure
infrastructure
(27.9%, 27.8% and 32.4% of consolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively) produces, sells, finances and services equipment for the air
transportation and energy generation industries. we also produce, sell and
service equipment for the rail transportation and water treatment industries.
during 2005, we made a number of acquisitions, the most significant of which
was
ionics, inc.
our
operations are located in north america, europe, asia and south
america.
aviation
and aviation financial services
aviation
produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines,
and
related replacement parts for use in military and commercial aircraft. our
military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft including fighters,
bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft and our commercial
engines power aircraft in all categories of range: short/medium, intermediate
and long-range, as well as executive and regional aircraft. we also produce
engines through cfm international, a company jointly owned by ge and snecma
moteurs of france; and a new engine is being designed and marketed in a joint
venture with the pratt & whitney division of united technologies
corporation.
we
provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (mro), including
sales of replacement parts, for many models of engines, including repair
and
overhaul of engines manufactured by competitors.
the
worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and mro (including parts sales)
is
intense. both u.s. and export markets are important. product development
cycles
are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. research
and development expenditures, both customer-financed and internally funded,
are
important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies
and
protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product
upgrade technologies.
potential
sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological
lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance
in
technology, the small number of potential customers and the limited number
of
relevant airframe applications. aircraft engine orders tend to follow military
and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each
other.
aviation
financial services is a global commercial aviation financial services business
that offers a broad range of financial products to airlines, aircraft operators,
owners, lenders, investors and airport developers. financial products include
leases, aircraft purchasing and trading, loans, engine/spare parts financing,
pilot training, fleet planning and financial advisory services. we operate
in a
highly competitive environment. our competitors include aircraft manufacturers,
banks, financial institutions, and other finance and leasing companies.
competition is based on lease rates and terms, as well as aircraft delivery
dates, condition and availability.
the
u.s. commercial aviation industry continues to face challenges and financial
pressure that affect a portion of our commercial aviation business. many
carriers are experiencing major restructuring and reorganization, including
bankruptcies. these companies have experienced marginal returns and in some
cases losses resulting from competitive pressures and increased fuel costs.

in advanced technology development that will provide more value to our customers
and more efficient solutions that comply with todays strict environmental
regulations.
worldwide
competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand
for
most power generation products and services is global and, as a result, is
sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which
we
do business. regional load growth requirements and demand side management
are
important factors. the availability of fuels and related prices have a large
impact on demand.
energy
financial services offers structured equity, leveraged leasing, partnerships,
project finance and broad-based commercial finance to the global energy and
water industries. we operate in a highly competitive environment. our
competitors include banks, financial institutions, energy companies, and
other

nbc
universal
nbc
universal, inc. (nbc universal) (9.8%, 9.6% and 6.1% of consolidated revenues
in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively) was formed in may 2004 upon the combination
of nbc with vivendi universal entertainment lllp and certain related assets.
nbc
universal is principally engaged in the broadcast of network television services
to affiliated television stations within the united states; the production
of
live and recorded television programs; the production and distribution of
motion
pictures; the operation, under licenses from the u.s. federal communications
commission (fcc), of television broadcasting stations; the ownership of several
cable/satellite networks around the world; the operation of theme parks;
and
investment and programming activities in multimedia and the internet. the
nbc
television network is one of four major u.s. commercial broadcast television
networks and serves 230 affiliated stations within the united states. telemundo
is a leading u.s. spanish-language commercial broadcast television network.
at

asia
pacific, and entertainment channels across europe and latin america; equity
investments in arts and entertainment, the history channel, the sundance
channel, valuevision media, inc.; and a non-voting interest in paxson
communications corporation. we have secured exclusive united states television
rights to the 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 olympic games.
nbc
universals broadcast ratings and advertising revenue are affected by viewer
demographics and the availability of other entertainment choices. in addition,
recent technological advances like personal video recorders offer personal
entertainment through new media, introducing additional uncertainty to future
revenue sources. other technologies enable copying content, increasing the
risk
of content piracy, particularly in international markets where the intellectual
property laws may not be clear or strictly applied.

(11)
we
operate in a highly competitive environment. our competitors include commercial
banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated
with
manufacturers, and independent finance companies. competition related to
our
lending and leasing operations is based on price, that is interest rates
and
fees, as well as deal structure and terms. profitability is affected not
only by
broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the
availability and cost of capital, but also by successful management of credit
risk, operating risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency
exchange risks. success requires high quality risk management systems, customer

(12)
our
operations are subject to a variety of bank and consumer protection regulations,
including regulations controlling data privacy. further, a number of countries
have ceilings on rates chargeable to consumers in financial service
transactions. we are subject to competition from various types of financial
institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan
companies, independent finance companies, manufacturers captive finance
companies, and insurance companies. industry participants compete on the
basis
of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and
cross selling. the markets in which we operate are also subject to the risks
from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates,
and the
consumers capacity to repay debt.
our
headquarters are in stamford, connecticut and our operations are located

discontinued
operations
on
november 18, 2005, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with
swiss
reinsurance company (swiss re) to sell the property and casualty insurance
and
reinsurance businesses and the european life and health operations of ge
insurance solutions. the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter
of 2006, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing
conditions.
in
may 2004, we completed the initial public offering of genworth, our formerly
wholly-owned subsidiary that conducted most of our consumer insurance business,
including life and mortgage insurance operations. throughout 2005, we continued
to reduce our ownership in genworth, currently at 18%. we intend to continue
to
dispose of our remaining shares in 2006, subject to market
conditions.
we
reported both the portions of ge insurance solutions described above and
genworth as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

research
and development
total
expenditures for research and development were $3,425 million in 2005. total
expenditures were $3,091 million in 2004 and $2,656 million in 2003. of these
amounts, $2,741 million in 2005 was ge-funded ($2,443 million in 2004 and
$2,103
million in 2003); and $684 million in 2005 was funded by customers ($648
million
in 2004 and $553 million in 2003), principally the u.s. government.
infrastructures aviation business accounts for the largest share of ges
research and development expenditures from both ge and customer funds.
healthcare and infrastructures energy business also made significant
expenditures of ge and customer research and development funds.
environmental
matters
our
operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses,
involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under
environmental protection laws.
we
are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous
wastes as required by federal and state laws. such statutes require that
responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality
of
original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. expenditures for site
remediation actions amounted to $0.1 billion in each of the last two years.
we
presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual
expenditures in the range of $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over the next two
years.
the
u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) ruled in february 2002 that
approximately 150,000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) must be
dredged
from a 40-mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state. on october
6, 2005, ge and the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) entered into
and
filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of new york a
consent
decree that, subject to approval of that court, represents a comprehensive
framework for implementation of the epas 2002 decision to dredge pcb-containing
sediments in the upper hudson river. the dredging will be performed in two
phases with an intervening peer review of performance after phase 1. under
this
consent decree, we have committed up to $0.1 billion to reimburse the epa
for
its past and future project oversight costs and agreed to perform the first
phase of dredging. we further committed that, subject to future agreement
with
the epa about completion of dredging after completion of phase 1 and the
peer
review, we will be responsible for further costs, including costs of phase
dredging. our statement of financial position as of december 31, 2005 and
2004,
included liabilities for the estimated costs of this remediation.
see
page 92 of the 2005 annual report to shareowners for additional discussion
of
environmental matters.
employee
relations
at
year-end 2005, general electric company and consolidated affiliates employed
approximately 316,000 persons, of whom approximately 161,000 were employed
in
the united states. for further information about employees, see page 61 of
the
2005 annual report to shareowners.
(14)
approximately
22,650 ge manufacturing and service employees in the united states are
represented for collective bargaining purposes by a total of approximately
different local collective bargaining groups. a majority of such employees
are
represented by union locals that are affiliated with, and bargain in conjunction
with, the international union of electronic, electrical, salaried, machine
and
furniture workers (iue/cwa-afl-cio). during 2003, general electric company
negotiated four-year contracts with unions representing a substantial majority
of those united states employees who are represented by unions. most of these
contracts will terminate in june 2007. nbc universal is party to approximately
160 labor agreements covering about 3,500 staff employees (and a large number
of
freelance employees) in the united states. these agreements are with various
labor unions, expire at various dates and are generally for a term ranging
from
three to five years.

because
of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic
dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the
wide
variety of raw materials needed for our operations. we have not been adversely
affected by the inability to obtain raw materials.
we
own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. new patents are continuously
being obtained through our research and development activities as existing
patents expire. patented inventions are used both within the company and
are
licensed to others, but no operating segment is substantially dependent on
any

item
1a. risk
factors
the
following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as
discussed in item 1. these risk factors may be important to understanding
any
statement in this annual report on form 10-k or elsewhere. the following
information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and
analysis (md&a), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes
incorporated by reference in this report.
our
businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause
our
future results to be different -
sometimes materially different -
than we presently anticipate. discussion about the important operational
risks
that our businesses encounter can be found in the md&a section of our 2005
annual report to shareowners and in the business descriptions in item 1.
of this
form10-k. below, we have described our present view of certain important
strategic risks. our reactions to material future developments as well as
our
competitors reactions to those developments will determine our future results.
our
global growth is subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory
risks
we
conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world. global economic
and
regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways. operations
are subject to the effects of global competition. particular local jurisdiction
risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws and from local liquidity
regulations, including risks of not being able to retrieve assets. our global
business is affected by local economic environments, including inflation,
recession and currency volatility. political changes, some of which may be
disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of
our
activities in a particular location. while some of these risks can be hedged
using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable,
such
attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful.
our
credit ratings are important to our cost of capital
the
major debt agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given their highest
debt ratings to us. one of our strategic objectives is to maintain these
triple
a ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access
to a variety of lenders. failure to maintain our triple a debt rating could
adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins.
the
disposition of businesses that do not fit with our evolving strategy can
be
highly uncertain
we
will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses
that may no longer help us meet our objectives. our decisions to sell
genworthand ge insurance solutions are recent examples of disposition
decisions. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter
difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable
terms
in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic
objectives, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms which
are
less than we had anticipated. in addition, there is a risk that we sell a
business whose subsequent performance exceeds our expectations, in which
case
our decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value.
correspondingly, we may be too optimistic about a particular businesss
prospects, in which case we may be unable to find a buyer at a price acceptable
to us and therefore may have potentially sacrificed enterprise
value.

3. legal proceedings
in
january 2005, the boston district office of the u.s. securities and exchange
commission (sec) informed us that it had commenced an investigation and
requested that ge and ge capital voluntarily provide certain documents and
information with respect to the use of hedge accounting for derivatives by
us
and ge capital. the sec staff advised us in august 2005 that the sec had
issued
a formal order of investigation in connection with this matter, which we
believe
to be a common step in the process in such matters. we and ge capital have
continued to voluntarily provide documents and information to the sec staff
and
we are cooperating fully with its investigation.
on
june 14, 2005, we received a subpoena from the u.s. attorneys office for the
southern district of new york seeking documents relating to finite risk
insurance. the subpoena is general in nature. ge received a similar subpoena
from the northeast regional office of the sec on april 29, 2005. we are
cooperating fully with the sec and the u.s. attorneys office.
on
october 6, 2005, ge and the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) entered
into and filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of new
york
a consent decree that, subject to approval of that court, represents a
comprehensive framework for implementation of the epas 2002 decision to dredge
pcb-containing sediments in the upper hudson river. the dredging will be
performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of performance after
phase 1. under this consent decree, we have committed up to $111 million
to
reimburse the epa for its past and future project oversight costs and agreed
to
perform the first phase of dredging. we further committed that, subject to
future agreement with the epa about completion of dredging after completion
of
phase 1 and the peer review, we will be responsible for further costs, including
costs of phase 2 dredging. our statement of financial position as of december
31, 2005, included liabilities for our estimates of the future costs of this
remediation.
