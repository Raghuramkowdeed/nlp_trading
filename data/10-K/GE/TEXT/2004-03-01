GE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL

CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND

MARKETING A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS FOR THE GENERATION, TRANSMISSION,

DISTRIBUTION, CONTROL AND UTILIZATION OF ELECTRICITY SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN

1892. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED CONSIDERABLY THE SCOPE OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE MAJOR APPLIANCES; LIGHTING PRODUCTS;

INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION PRODUCTS; MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING EQUIPMENT; MOTORS;

ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL EQUIPMENT; LOCOMOTIVES; POWER GENERATION AND

DELIVERY PRODUCTS; NUCLEAR POWER SUPPORT SERVICES AND FUEL ASSEMBLIES;

ENCOUNTER AGGRESSIVE AND ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE

NETWORKS. IT ALSO COMPETES WITH SYNDICATED BROADCAST TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND

CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES. THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH

IMMATERIAL EFFECT OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS TO ARRIVE AT TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED DATA. A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS

FOLLOWS.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES

AIRCRAFT ENGINES (8.0%, 8.4% AND 9.0% OF CONSOLIDATED

REVENUES IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY) PRODUCES, SELLS AND SERVICES JET

ENGINES, TURBOPROP AND TURBO SHAFT ENGINES, AND RELATED REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR

USE IN MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. OUR MILITARY ENGINES ARE USED IN A WIDE

VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT THAT INCLUDES FIGHTERS, BOMBERS, TANKERS, HELICOPTERS AND

SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT. THE CFM56TM, PRODUCED BY CFM INTERNATIONAL, A COMPANY

JOINTLY OWNED BY GE AND SNECMA MOTEURS OF FRANCE, AND GE'S CF6 AND GE90® ENGINES

POWER AIRCRAFT IN ALL CATEGORIES OF LARGE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT: SHORT/MEDIUM,

INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE. APPLICATIONS FOR THE CFM56TM ENGINE INCLUDE.

BOEING'S 737-300/-400/-500 SERIES, THE NEXT GENERATION 737-600/-700/-800/-900

SERIES, AND THE 737 BUSINESS JET; AIRBUS' A318, A319, A320, A321 AND

A340-200/-300 SERIES; AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT SUCH AS THE KC-135R, E/KE-3 AND E-6.

THE CF6 FAMILY OF ENGINES POWERS INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE AIRCRAFT SUCH AS

BOEING'S 747, 767, DC-10 AND MD-11 SERIES, AS WELL AS AIRBUS' A300, A310 AND

A330 SERIES. THE GE90® ENGINE IS USED TO POWER BOEING'S 777 SERIES TWIN-ENGINE

SOURCES, THE LATTER OF WHICH IS ALSO REPORTED AS PART OF THE POWER SYSTEMS

SEGMENT. MAINTENANCE, COMPONENT REPAIR AND OVERHAUL SERVICES (MRO), INCLUDING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF ENGINES, INCLUDING ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS, AND

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS SEGMENT'S PROFITS. IN DECEMBER 2003, WE

COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING (NDT) BUSINESS OF

AGFA-GEVAERT. THIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH AIRCRAFT ENGINES NDT BUSINESS

TO OFFER RADIOGRAPHIC, ULTRASONIC, EDDY CURRENT AND OTHER INSPECTION SOLUTIONS

THAT TEST THE STRUCTURE AND TOLERANCE OF MATERIALS WITHOUT DAMAGING THEM.

THE WORLDWIDE COMPETITION IN AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES AND MRO

(INCLUDING PARTS SALES) IS INTENSE. BOTH U.S. AND EXPORT MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES ARE LONG AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE

CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES, BOTH

CUSTOMER-FINANCED AND INTERNALLY FUNDED, ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS SEGMENT. FOCUSED

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGIES AND PROTECTION OF KEY AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGN,

MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND PRODUCT UPGRADE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT.

POTENTIAL SALES FOR ANY ENGINE ARE LIMITED BY, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, ITS TECHNOLOGICAL LIFETIME, WHICH MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING UPON

THE RATE OF ADVANCE IN THE STATE OF THE ART, BY THE SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL

CUSTOMERS AND BY THE LIMITED NUMBER OF RELEVANT AIRFRAME APPLICATIONS. AIRCRAFT

ENGINE ORDERS TEND TO FOLLOW MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PROCUREMENT CYCLES,

ALTHOUGH CYCLES FOR MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL ENGINE PROCUREMENT ARE DIFFERENT.

PROCUREMENTS OF MILITARY JET ENGINES ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GLOBAL POLITICAL

AND ECONOMIC FACTORS.

IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, AIRFRAME MANUFACTURERS

SUPPORT THEIR SALES OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH LONG-TERM

FINANCING COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, AND ENGINE MANUFACTURERS ARE OFTEN ASKED TO

PARTICIPATE IN SUCH FINANCINGS. IN MAKING SUCH COMMITMENTS, IT IS OUR POLICY TO

ESTABLISH A SECURED POSITION IN THE AIRCRAFT BEING FINANCED. UNDER SUCH AIRLINE

FINANCING PROGRAMS, WE HAD ISSUED GUARANTEES AMOUNTING TO $0.4 BILLION AT

YEAR-END 2003, AND HAD ENTERED INTO COMMITMENTS TOTALING $1.2 BILLION TO PROVIDE

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ON FUTURE SALES OF AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH OUR ENGINES. OUR

GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS ARE SECURED BY INDIVIDUAL AIRCRAFT OR POOLS OF

AIRCRAFT ENGINES RELATED TO THE SPECIFIC FINANCING ARRANGEMENT. WHEN PARTICULAR

GUARANTEES EXCEED THE VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED SECURITY, WE CONSIDER CREDIT RISK

OF THE CUSTOMER AND PROVIDE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE

TOTAL ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT SECURING THESE GUARANTEES EXCEEDED THE

GUARANTEED AMOUNTS, NET OF THE ASSOCIATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. SEE PAGE 49 OF

THE 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ORDERS AND BACKLOG.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES IS HEADQUARTERED IN EVENDALE, OHIO AND HAS

OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA.

MANUFACTURERS, AND INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES. INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF INTEREST RATES AND FEES AS WELL AS DEAL

STRUCTURES AND CREDIT TERMS. PROFITABILITY IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY BY BROAD

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT CUSTOMER CREDIT QUALITY AND THE AVAILABILITY AND

COST OF CAPITAL, BUT ALSO BY SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, OPERATING

RISK AND MARKET RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK.

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, CUSTOMER AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, DIVERSE

PORTFOLIOS, SERVICE AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, STRONG COLLATERAL AND ASSET

COMMERCIAL AVIATION IS AN INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT ONGOING INTEREST. AS HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED, THIS INDUSTRY HAS

BEEN UNDER PRESSURE, BUT HAS UNDERTAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE UNUSED CAPACITY AND

ALIGN COSTS. CONSEQUENTLY, DURING 2003, MAJOR UNITED STATES AND EUROPEAN

AIRLINES ACHIEVED MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATIONS INCLUDING TRAFFIC,

REVENUES AND LOAD FACTORS. AVIATION SERVICES, WHICH OWNED 1,239 COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, HAD 1,236 ON LEASE DESPITE PRESSURE ON THE

INDUSTRY. REGIONAL JETS, WITH CAPACITY FOR 50-90 PASSENGERS, HAVE HAD A

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS. THESE

JETS HAVE ENABLED AIRLINES TO REPLACE LESS EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT, BOTH TURBOPROP

AND OLDER, NARROW-BODIED JETS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, OUR FLEET INCLUDED 278

REGIONAL JETS, DIVERSIFYING TOTAL AIRCRAFT HOLDINGS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTINUE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISTRIBUTE THESE PRODUCTS THROUGH A FAMILY OF REGULATED

INSURANCE AFFILIATES. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCT LINES IN NORTH AMERICA ARE ANNUITIES

(DEFERRED AND IMMEDIATE, FIXED AND VARIABLE); LIFE INSURANCE (UNIVERSAL, TERM,

ORDINARY AND GROUP); GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (INCLUDING FUNDING

AGREEMENTS); LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE; SUPPLEMENTARY ACCIDENT AND HEALTH

INSURANCE; AND CONSUMER CLUB MEMBERSHIPS. PRINCIPAL EUROPEAN PRODUCT LINES AND

SERVICES ARE PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE (DESIGNED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS' LOAN

REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS) AND PERSONAL INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION IN

NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE IS ACCOMPLISHED PRIMARILY THROUGH FOUR CHANNELS.

INTERMEDIARIES (BROKERAGE GENERAL AGENCIES, BANKS AND SECURITIES BROKERAGE AND

FINANCIAL PLANNING FIRMS); DEDICATED SALES FORCES AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS;

WORKSITE DISTRIBUTION; AND DIRECT AND AFFINITY MARKETING. DURING 2003,

(CONSISTENT WITH GE'S ANNOUNCED INTENT TO REDIRECT CAPITAL TO DIFFERENT LINES OF

BUSINESS) GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE SOLD ITS JAPANESE LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL

CREATE FEWER BUT LARGER COMPETITORS. WE BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE

FACTORS IN THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCT FEATURES, PRICE, COMMISSION

STRUCTURE, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS, BRAND, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL

STRENGTH RATINGS AND SERVICE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED IN THE

CURRENT COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND WILL BENEFIT FROM A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

DEMOGRAPHIC, GOVERNMENTAL AND MARKET TRENDS, INCLUDING AN AGING UNITED STATES

POPULATION WITH GROWING RETIREMENT INCOME NEEDS, AND AN INCREASING LIFE AND

LIFESTYLE PROTECTION GAP.

MANY OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY A VARIETY OF

INSURANCE AND OTHER REGULATORS.

MORTGAGE INSURANCE

MORTGAGE INSURANCE OFFERS MORTGAGE INSURANCE PRODUCTS THAT

FACILITATE HOMEOWNERSHIP BY ENABLING BORROWERS TO BUY HOMES WITH

LOW-DOWN-PAYMENT MORTGAGES. THESE PRODUCTS ALSO AID FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

MANAGING THEIR CAPITAL EFFICIENTLY BY REDUCING THE CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR

LOW-DOWN-PAYMENT MORTGAGES. WE ALSO HAVE LEADING MORTGAGE INSURANCE OPERATIONS

IN CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND THE U.K. AND A GROWING PRESENCE IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE.

THE MORTGAGE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS SENSITIVE TO THE

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND HOUSING MARKET CONDITIONS. THE MORTGAGE INSURANCE

INDUSTRY IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AS EXCESS MARKET CAPACITY SEEKS TO UNDERWRITE

BUSINESS BEING GENERATED FROM A CONSOLIDATING CUSTOMER BASE. IN ADDITION,

CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IS EXERTED ON THE INDUSTRY BY TWO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED

ENTERPRISES, WHICH BUY THE MAJORITY OF THE LOANS INSURED BY MORTGAGE INSURERS.

DURING 2003, GENERAL ELECTRIC MORTGAGE INSURANCE

CORPORATION (GEMICO), REQUESTED THAT ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS BE LOWERED

FROM AAA/AAA TO AA/AA2 POSITIONING OUR UNITED STATES BUSINESS TO OPERATE AT

LOWER CAPITAL LEVELS. THIS CHANGE IMPROVES MORTGAGE INSURANCE'S CAPITAL

EFFICIENCY AND RETURN ON EQUITY WHILE RETAINING A CONSERVATIVE RISK-TO-CAPITAL

RATIO.

GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING (EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE CORPORATION)

THROUGH OUR PRINCIPAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANY

AFFILIATES – EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE CORPORATION, GE REINSURANCE CORPORATION, THE

GE FRANKONA GROUP AND THE MEDICAL PROTECTIVE CORPORATION – WE WRITE

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL LINES OF REINSURANCE (WHERE THE INSURED PARTY IS ANOTHER

INSURANCE COMPANY) AND SELECT LINES OF DIRECT PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

(WHERE THE INSURED PARTY IS A NON-INSURANCE COMPANY OR AN INDIVIDUAL).

(11)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE REINSURANCE OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE REINSURANCE OF

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RISKS WRITTEN BY MORE THAN 1,000 INSURERS AROUND THE

WORLD. DIRECT INSURANCE OPERATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON NICHE LINES OF BUSINESS,

PRINCIPALLY MEDICAL MALPRACTICE COVERAGE FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS, MEDICAL

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY FOR HOSPITALS, ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGE FOR

INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR ATTORNEYS,

EXCESS INDEMNITY FOR SELF-INSURERS OF MEDICAL BENEFITS AND EXCESS WORKERS'

COMPENSATION FOR SELF-INSURERS. THE LIFE REINSURANCE AFFILIATES ARE ENGAGED IN

THE REINSURANCE OF LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING TERM, WHOLE AND UNIVERSAL

LIFE, ANNUITIES, CERTAIN HEALTH-RELATED COVERAGES AND THE PROVISION OF FINANCIAL

REINSURANCE TO LIFE INSURERS. DURING 2003, WE ANNOUNCED OUR INTENT TO SCALE BACK

ON LIFE REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE OVERALL RETURNS, WE CEASED WRITING NEW

LIFE REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SOLD OUR UNITED STATES LIFE

REINSURANCE BUSINESS–ERC LIFE REINSURANCE CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, WE COMPETE IN THE REINSURANCE MARKETPLACE

PRINCIPALLY ON THE BASIS OF OUR EXPERTISE, RELATIONSHIPS, FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

PRICE AND CREATIVITY IN DEVELOPING CUSTOMIZED SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS.

WITHIN THE DIRECT INSURANCE MARKETPLACE, WE BELIEVE WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY ON

THE BASIS OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND

KEY DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS, PRICE AND EASE OF DOING BUSINESS.

EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE CORPORATION IS ONE OF THE LARGEST

COMPETITORS IN ITS MARKETPLACE. OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE OPERATIONS

ARE RANKED FIFTH IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND WE COMPETE

WITH THE WORLD'S LARGEST REINSURERS AS WELL AS DOZENS OF SMALLER NICHE

COMPETITORS. OUR LIFE REINSURANCE OPERATIONS ARE RANKED IN THE TOP FOUR LIFE

REINSURERS IN THE WORLD.

MAINTAINING STRONG FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS IS AN

IMPORTANT FACTOR IN REMAINING COMPETITIVE IN BOTH THE REINSURANCE AND DIRECT

INSURANCE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. DURING 2003, CERTAIN EXTERNAL CREDIT

RATING AGENCIES ANNOUNCED THE LOWERING OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS WITH

RESPECT TO GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING AND SUBSIDIARIES, CITING POOR RECENT

OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS THE PRINCIPAL FACTOR. RATING AGENCIES TOOK SIMILAR

ACTIONS TO LOWER THE RATINGS OF MANY INSURERS AND REINSURERS IN RECENT YEARS.

DEBT RATINGS FOR GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING AFFECT $1.7 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING

DEBT. WHILE THESE RATINGS WERE LOWERED IN 2003, THEY REMAIN INVESTMENT GRADE. WE

DO NOT BELIEVE THESE ACTIONS WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OR THE ABILITY TO WRITE FUTURE BUSINESS.
