TO MEDICAL IMAGING, BUSINESS AND CONSUMER FINANCING, MEDIA CONTENT AND

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS, WE SERVE CUSTOMERS IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES AND EMPLOY

ABOUT 300,000 PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.  SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1892, WE

HAVE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED AND

CHANGED CONSIDERABLY THE SCOPE OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

IN

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WE ENCOUNTER AGGRESSIVE AND

ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY

CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WITH

RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT, IN GENERAL, WE ARE ONE OF

THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. THE

CONDITION, AND OFTEN CONTAIN WORDS SUCH AS “EXPECT,” “ANTICIPATE,” “INTEND,”

“PLAN,” “BELIEVE,” “SEEK,” “SEE,” OR “WILL.” FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR

NATURE ADDRESS MATTERS THAT ARE, TO DIFFERENT DEGREES, UNCERTAIN. FOR US,

PARTICULAR UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO BE MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT THAN THOSE EXPRESSED IN OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE: THE

SEVERITY AND DURATION OF CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING

VOLATILITY IN INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRICES AND THE

VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS; THE IMPACT OF U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TO

RESTORE LIQUIDITY AND STIMULATE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES; THE IMPACT OF

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF

GE CAPITAL’S FUNDING AND ON OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE GE CAPITAL’S ASSET LEVELS AS

PLANNED; THE IMPACT OF CONDITIONS IN THE HOUSING MARKET AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES

ON THE LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER CREDIT DEFAULTS; OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATING AND THE IMPACT ON OUR FUNDING COSTS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION IF WE DO NOT DO SO; THE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH

WHICH GE CAPITAL DOES BUSINESS; THE ADEQUACY OF OUR CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS AND

OTHER CONDITIONS WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND

AT THE CURRENT LEVEL; THE LEVEL OF DEMAND AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE MAJOR

INDUSTRIES WE SERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION,

ENERGY GENERATION, NETWORK TELEVISION, REAL ESTATE AND HEALTHCARE; THE IMPACT OF

REGULATION AND REGULATORY, INVESTIGATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL

COMPLIANCE RISKS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PROPOSED FINANCIAL SERVICES

REGULATION; STRATEGIC ACTIONS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND OUR

SUCCESS IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND NUMEROUS OTHER MATTERS OF

NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALE, INCLUDING THOSE OF A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC,

WORLDWIDE

COMPETITION FOR POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS INTENSE. DEMAND FOR

POWER GENERATION IS GLOBAL AND, AS A RESULT, IS SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THE BALANCE OF

REGIONAL GROWTH AND DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO EVALUATE AS

WE PLAN FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

WITHIN

OUR CAPITAL FINANCE OPERATING SEGMENT, WE OPERATE THE BUSINESSES DESCRIBED BELOW

ALONG PRODUCT LINES.

OUR

OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND

ASIA.

CAPITAL

FINANCE HAS COMMUNICATED ITS GOAL OF REDUCING ITS ENDING NET INVESTMENT (ENI)

OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE ARE MORE AGGRESSIVELY

FOCUSING OUR BUSINESSES ON SELECTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS WHERE WE HAVE

DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, BROAD DISTRIBUTION, AND THE ABILITY TO EARN A CONSISTENT

RETURN ON CAPITAL, WHILE MANAGING OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET SIZE AND RISK. WE

HAVE A STRATEGY OF EXITING THOSE BUSINESSES WHERE WE ARE UNDERPERFORMING OR THAT

ARE DEEMED TO BE NON-STRATEGIC. WE HAVE COMPLETED A NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS IN

OUR BUSINESSES IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPTIONS GOING

FORWARD.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2010, THE CAPITAL FINANCE SEGMENT WAS RENAMED GE CAPITAL AND INCLUDES

ALL OF THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION. IN

ADDITION, THE TRANSPORTATION FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN

GE CAPITAL AVIATION SERVICES (GECAS), WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMMERCIAL LENDING AND

LEASING (CLL) AND OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS IN ITALY, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN

CONSUMER, WILL BE INCLUDED IN CLL. RESULTS FOR 2009 AND PRIOR PERIODS ARE

REPORTED ON THE BASIS UNDER WHICH WE MANAGED OUR BUSINESS IN 2009 AND DO NOT

REFLECT THE JANUARY 2010 REORGANIZATION.

LENDING AND LEASING

CLL

PROVIDES CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD WITH A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCING SOLUTIONS.

WE HAVE PARTICULAR MID-MARKET EXPERTISE, AND OFFER LOANS, LEASES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND

END-USERS FOR A VARIETY OF EQUIPMENT AND MAJOR CAPITAL ASSETS. THESE ASSETS

INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL-RELATED FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT; VEHICLES; CORPORATE

AIRCRAFT; AND EQUIPMENT USED IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION,

MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, MEDIA, COMMUNICATIONS, ENTERTAINMENT AND

INTERBANCA S.P.A., AN ITALIAN CORPORATE BANK IN EXCHANGE FOR THE CONSUMER

BUSINESSES IN AUSTRIA AND FINLAND, THE CREDIT CARD AND AUTO BUSINESSES IN THE

U.K. AND THE CREDIT CARD BUSINESS IN IRELAND.

HISTORICALLY,

WE HAVE OPERATED IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE

COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, LEASING COMPANIES, FINANCING COMPANIES

ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURERS, AND INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES. COMPETITION

RELATED TO OUR LENDING AND LEASING OPERATIONS IS BASED ON PRICE, THAT IS,

INTEREST RATES AND FEES, AS WELL AS DEAL STRUCTURE AND TERMS. MORE RECENTLY,

COMPETITION HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO

AND AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL AND A REDUCED NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. PROFITABILITY

IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY BY BROAD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT CUSTOMER CREDIT

QUALITY AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL, BUT ALSO BY SUCCESSFUL

MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, OPERATING RISK AND MARKET RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE

AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS. SUCCESS REQUIRES HIGH QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT

SYSTEMS, CUSTOMER AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, DIVERSIFICATION, SERVICE AND

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, STRONG COLLATERAL AND ASSET MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE, DEAL

STRUCTURING EXPERTISE AND THE ABILITY TO REDUCE COSTS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND

PRODUCTIVITY.

IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE DECONSOLIDATED PENSKE TRUCK LEASING CO., L.P. (PTL)

FOLLOWING OUR SALE OF A PARTIAL INTEREST IN A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IN

FINANCIAL SERVICE TRANSACTIONS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES

OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, LEASING COMPANIES,

CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES, INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES, MANUFACTURERS’ CAPTIVE

FINANCE COMPANIES, AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS COMPETE ON THE

BASIS OF PRICE, SERVICING CAPABILITY, PROMOTIONAL MARKETING, RISK MANAGEMENT,

FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN RETAIL SALES, INTEREST AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND THE

CONSUMER’S CAPACITY TO REPAY DEBT.

OPERATIONS, WE SELL CERTAIN REAL ESTATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS WHEN IT IS

ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US TO DO SO. HOWEVER, AS REAL ESTATE VALUES ARE

AFFECTED BY CERTAIN FORCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL (E.G., MARKET FUNDAMENTALS AND

DEMOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS), IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE LEVEL OF

FUTURE SALES, SALES PRICES, IMPAIRMENTS OR WRITE-OFFS.

OUR

COMPETITORS INCLUDE BANKS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REAL ESTATE COMPANIES, REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENT FUNDS AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES. COMPETITION IN OUR EQUITY

ORDERS

BACKLOG

GE’S

TOTAL BACKLOG

OF FIRM UNFILLED ORDERS AT THE END OF 2009 WAS

$67.3 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 4% FROM YEAR-END 2008, REFLECTING DECREASED DEMAND

AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DEMAND AT TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE. OF THIS BACKLOG, $46.3 BILLION RELATED TO PRODUCTS, OF WHICH 61%

WAS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2010. PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS, INCLUDED IN THIS

REPORTED BACKLOG FOR ONLY THE SUCCEEDING 12 MONTHS, WERE $21.0 BILLION AT THE

END OF 2009. PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS BEYOND THE SUCCEEDING 12 MONTHS WERE

APPROXIMATELY $108 BILLION, WHICH COMBINED WITH THE FIRM UNFILLED ORDERS

DESCRIBED ABOVE RESULTED IN A TOTAL BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $175 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. ORDERS CONSTITUTING BACKLOG MAY BE CANCELLED OR DEFERRED BY

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

GE-FUNDED

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $3.3 BILLION, $3.1 BILLION AND $3.0

BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FROM CUSTOMERS, PRINCIPALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TOTALED

$1.1 BILLION, $1.3 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE’S AVIATION BUSINESS ACCOUNTS FOR THE

LARGEST SHARE OF GE’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WITH FUNDING FROM

BOTH GE AND CUSTOMER FUNDS. ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE’S ENERGY BUSINESS AND

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE’S HEALTHCARE BUSINESS ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT

EXPENDITURES FUNDED PRIMARILY BY GE.

EXPENDITURES

REPORTED ABOVE REFLECT THE DEFINITION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED BY

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. FOR OPERATING AND MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES, WE ALSO MEASURE AMOUNTS SPENT ON PRODUCT AND SERVICES TECHNOLOGY.

THESE TECHNOLOGY EXPENDITURES WERE $5.2 BILLION IN 2009 AND INCLUDED OUR

REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT SPENT TO

IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR

PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF

REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION

ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A

DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO

APPROXIMATELY $0.3 BILLION IN BOTH 2009 AND 2008. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH

REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $0.4

BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

IN

NOVEMBER 2006, THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT APPROVED A CONSENT

DECREE, WHICH HAD BEEN AGREED TO BY GE AND THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), THAT REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR

IMPLEMENTATION OF EPA'S 2002 RECORD OF DECISION TO DREDGE POLYCHLORINATED

BIPHENYL (PCB)-CONTAINING SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. UNDER THE CONSENT

DEGREE, THE DREDGING IS TO BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES AND PHASE I WAS COMPLETED

IN MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009. BETWEEN PHASE I AND PHASE II THERE WILL BE AN

INTERVENING PEER REVIEW BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF NATIONAL EXPERTS. THE PANEL

WILL EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF PHASE I DREDGING OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

PHASE I ENGINEERING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, EVALUATE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM PHASE

I AND MAY SET FORTH PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE STANDARDS. THIS EVALUATION IS

EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE IN THE SUMMER OF 2010 AFTER WHICH EPA, CONSIDERING THE PEER

REVIEW PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS, GE'S PROPOSED CHANGES, AND ITS OWN ANALYSIS,

WILL ISSUE ITS REGULATORY DECISION SETTING FORTH ANY CHANGES TO THE SCOPE OF, OR

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR, PHASE II. FOLLOWING EPA'S DECISION, GE HAS 90 DAYS TO

EITHER ELECT TO PERFORM PHASE II OR TO OPT OUT OF THE PROJECT, AT WHICH POINT GE

MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FURTHER COSTS. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, INCLUDED LIABILITIES FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS OF

THE PROJECT UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,” AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. “BUSINESS”. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO

UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE

FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART II, ITEM 7.

“MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS” (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED

NOTES IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS

FORM 10-K REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT – SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT – THAN WE

PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR

BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION AND IN THE BUSINESS

DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. “BUSINESS” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. BELOW, WE DESCRIBE

CERTAIN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS’ REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS

WILL AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS.

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. IN 2009,

APPROXIMATELY 54% OF OUR REVENUES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION.

THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR

ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED

USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR

ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION HAS DECREASED OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS

A RESULT OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY CHANGE IN

SIGNIFICANT WAYS.

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL AND

STATE AND NON-U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES.

(14)

THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN WAYS THAT

WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR

RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS BY MAKING EXISTING PRACTICES MORE RESTRICTED, SUBJECT TO

ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITED OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR, U.S. AND NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERTAKING A SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE REGULATION

AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CONSUMER LENDING,

THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKET AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON GE CAPITAL’S STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND

PERFORMANCE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF TRADE CONTROL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN GLOBAL MARKETS.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RISKS FROM LAWS THAT REDUCE THE

ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT CONSUMER BORROWING, LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS, AND CHANGES TO

TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GE’S EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW

THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS

PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH NON-U.S. BANKS AND OTHER

NON-U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH EXPIRED

AT THE END OF 2009, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY

CONGRESS ON FIVE PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN OCTOBER OF 2008. A ONE-YEAR

EXTENSION WAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN 2009 AND THE SENATE

FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MEMBER HAVE INDICATED AN INTENTION TO

EXTEND THE PROVISION FOR ONE YEAR RETROACTIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF 2010, BUT

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THE PROVISION

IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2009, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF

THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2010. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT RECENTLY

PROPOSED THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CRISIS FEE, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO PAY

A FEE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 15 BASIS POINTS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF COVERED

LIABILITIES (DEFINED AS ASSETS LESS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND FEDERAL

DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC)-ASSESSED DEPOSITS). THIS PROPOSAL IS AT AN

EARLY STAGE, AND ITS IMPACT ON THE COMPANY, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF

FACTORS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL. IF ADOPTED, THIS

FEE COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF OUR EARNINGS GOING FORWARD. IN ADDITION, THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING BROAD-BASED LEGISLATION TO CHANGE

HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, THAT INCLUDES PROVISIONS FOR A FEE ON MEDICAL DEVICES,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE BUSINESS AND

INCREASE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO OUR EMPLOYEES. FURTHERMORE, WE

HAVE BEEN, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE, PARTICIPATING IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAMS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH STRICT GOVERNMENTAL

REGULATIONS. INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR STATUS IN THESE PROJECTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE

RISKS.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. WE AND OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE AT TIMES

BEING REVIEWED OR INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND

DAMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER

OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. THESE INCLUDE THE DREDGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS FROM A

40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE, AS DESCRIBED IN

ITEM 1. “BUSINESS” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT

AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS

THAT LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED

WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

(15)

THE

SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.

WITH

RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE

CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND

OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION CHALLENGES,

SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL

DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR

OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS

IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS

THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. EVEN UPON REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH A

BUYER OR SELLER FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF A BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT

TO NECESSARY REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WHICH

MAY PREVENT US FROM COMPLETING THE TRANSACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECENTLY ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH COMCAST CORPORATION TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS OF THE NBCU

BUSINESS TO A NEWLY FORMED ENTITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE CASH AND

WILL OWN A 49% INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED ENTITY. THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT

TO RECEIPT OF VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE

MAY SELL A BUSINESS WHOSE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN

WHICH CASE OUR DECISION WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE

VALUE.

SUSTAINED

INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF

INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME

OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY

CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR 2010 ARE

THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLANS ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A

REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED GAINS (LOSSES) – NET, BENEFIT PLANS. AT THE

END OF 2009, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF OUR U.S. PRINCIPAL PENSION

PLANS WAS $48.1 BILLION AND ASSETS WERE $42.1 BILLION. FOR A DISCUSSION

REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION PLAN

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES – PENSION ASSUMPTIONS IN

PART II, ITEM 7. “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” AND NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT

DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO

LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS

REQUIRED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). FAILURE TO

ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS COULD ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE

AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS. IN ADDITION,

UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO CURRENT

EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE

COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

(16)

CONDITIONS

IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF GE

CAPITAL’S FUNDING.

A LARGE

PORTION OF GE CAPITAL’S BORROWINGS IS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

LONG-TERM DEBT. GE CAPITAL’S OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT WAS

$42 BILLION AND $399 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE WE

HAVE FULLY PREFUNDED OUR PLANNED 2010 LONG-TERM DEBT REQUIREMENTS, WE CONTINUE

TO RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR

TERM MATURITIES BEYOND 2010. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS TO REFINANCE MATURING SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER DEBT

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN ORDER TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES, WE ALSO

PLAN TO EXPAND OUR RELIANCE ON ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING BANK

DEPOSITS, SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER ASSET-BASED FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN DIVERSIFYING OUR FUNDING SOURCES OR THAT THE

SHORT AND LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS WILL BE AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE

COST OF FUNDING WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE AND AFFECT THE OVERALL

PROFITABILITY OF GE CAPITAL. FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING

COSTS INCLUDE: A DECREASED RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM FUNDING, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL

PAPER, IN FAVOR OF LONGER-TERM FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS; REFINANCING OF FUNDING THAT

WE HAVE OBTAINED UNDER THE FDIC TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP) AT

MARKET RATES AT THE TIME SUCH FUNDING MATURES; DECREASED CAPACITY AND INCREASED

COMPETITION AMONG DEBT ISSUERS; AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF

REFINANCING. IF GE CAPITAL’S COST OF FUNDING WERE TO INCREASE, IT MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND RESULT IN LOWER LENDING MARGINS, EARNINGS

AND CASH FLOWS AS WELL AS LOWER RETURNS ON ITS SHAREOWNER’S EQUITY AND INVESTED

CAPITAL. WHILE WE CURRENTLY DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY EQUITY OFFERINGS, OTHER

SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT INVOLVE THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES

WOULD BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING SHAREOWNERS.

DIFFICULT

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS HAVE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF GE CAPITAL AND THESE

CONDITIONS MAY PERSIST.

DECLINES

IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS, INCREASED PAYMENT DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES AND

SUSTAINED LEVELS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT WRITE-DOWNS

OF ASSET VALUES BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GE CAPITAL. IF THESE

CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND

TAX ASSETS. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE ESTABLISHED

ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES IN GE CAPITAL’S PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE, FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND

RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE THESE ALLOWANCES AND WRITE-OFFS,

WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS

,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. TO REDUCE GE’S EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE CONDITIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND REBALANCE THE RELATIVE SIZE OF ITS FINANCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WE HAVE DECIDED TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF GE CAPITAL, AS

MEASURED BY ITS ENDING NET INVESTMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE

ABLE TO TIMELY EXECUTE ON OUR REDUCTION TARGETS AND FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD

RESULT IN GREATER EXPOSURE TO FINANCIAL MARKETS THAN CONTEMPLATED UNDER OUR

STRATEGIC FUNDING PLAN OR MAY RESULT IN THE NEED FOR US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL

CONTRIBUTIONS TO GE CAPITAL.

THE

SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GE

CAPITAL.

GE

CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND

ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO

CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION,

GE CAPITAL’S CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD CANNOT BE

REALIZED UPON SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL

AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS

EXPOSURE TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF UNSECURED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING

TO INITIAL CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES

(AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT),

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY LOSSES OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITAL’S

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

(17)

THE

REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES ARE HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN.

GE

CAPITAL PARTICIPATES IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IN TWO WAYS: IT

PROVIDES FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTIES, AND IT ALSO ACQUIRES EQUITY POSITIONS IN VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTIES. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT

UPON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH THE

PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED AND THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF THOSE MARKETS AT THE TIME OF

SALE. THE LEVEL OF TRANSACTIONS FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY

FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. CONTINUED HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, SLOWDOWN IN

BUSINESS ACTIVITY, EXCESS INVENTORY CAPACITY AND LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT

ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND

COLLATERAL TO REAL ESTATE LOANS GE CAPITAL HOLDS. UNDER CURRENT MARKET AND

CREDIT CONDITIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES GE CAPITAL

WILL COMPLETE OR THE NET SALES PROCEEDS IT WILL REALIZE. ALSO, OCCUPANCY RATES

AND MARKET RENTALS MAY WORSEN, WHICH MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING

VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS.

GE

CAPITAL IS ALSO A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDER IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES AND HOME SALE VOLUMES, JOB LOSSES,

CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CREDIT

PERFORMANCE OF OUR MORTGAGE LOANS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THESE

MORTGAGE LOANS IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF CURRENT AND HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY

AND LOAN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS OTHER MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY BE

INACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL NOT BE

MATERIALLY WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED AND, AS A RESULT, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT GE CAPITAL’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

FAILURE

TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND

RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS.

THE

MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY

WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN MARCH 2009,

STANDARD & POOR’S (S&P) DOWNGRADED GE AND GE CAPITAL’S LONG-TERM RATING

BY ONE NOTCH FROM “AAA” TO “AA+” AND, AT THE SAME TIME, REVISED THE OUTLOOK FROM

NEGATIVE TO STABLE. IN ADDITION, MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY’S) DOWNGRADED

GE AND GE CAPITAL’S LONG-TERM RATING BY TWO NOTCHES FROM “AAA” TO “AA2” WITH A

STABLE OUTLOOK. THE SHORT-TERM RATINGS OF “A-1+/P-1” WERE AFFIRMED BY BOTH

RATING AGENCIES AT THE SAME TIME WITH RESPECT TO GE, GE CAPITAL SERVICES AND GE

CAPITAL. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT

RATINGS AND FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND

RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

VARIOUS DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, WHICH,

DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION.

(18)

CURRENT

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ALSO MAY

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR

NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES.

THE

BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL AND MEDIA BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE, AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CONDITIONS

IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION, HEALTHCARE, MEDIA AND

OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. AS A RESULT OF SLOWING GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH,

THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, INCREASED

UNEMPLOYMENT, REDUCED LEVELS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY

PRICES, BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY, SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION OF THEIR

BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A

RESULT, EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY FASHION. IN PARTICULAR,

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL

IS CORRELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES. A

PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONALLY THAT CONTINUES TO

RESULT IN THE LOSS OF BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAFFIC COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. SERVICE

CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR CONTRACT

COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR

CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US.

IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN CONTINUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS

SIGNIFICANT FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WE

ARE DEPENDENT ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND PRODUCT

INNOVATIONS FOR CONTINUED REVENUE GROWTH.

THE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. OUR LONG-TERM

OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP,

INTRODUCE, AND MARKET NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, TO MODIFY EXISTING PRODUCTS,

TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TO CUSTOMIZE CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO MEET

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THIS PROCESS,

INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE THE DIRECTION OF

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE OR THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW

PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION TO SATISFY CUSTOMER

DEMANDS.

OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY

DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO OURS, AND WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

OUR

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM

INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE OF

OURS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY US TO PROTECT

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR

TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC

ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES.

REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF SUCH CLAIMS, RESPONDING TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS CAN BE

EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. IF GE IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS,

WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR WE COULD BE ENJOINED FROM

OFFERING SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES

THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR RE-NEW FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES WE NEED

IN THE FUTURE, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON

REASONABLE TERMS.

SIGNIFICANT

RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION

DISRUPTIONS, SUPPLIER QUALITY ISSUES OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR

OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR

PRODUCTS.

OUR

RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS

AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS

USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF

THESE MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. A DISRUPTION IN

DELIVERIES FROM OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR SERVICE

PROVIDERS, CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE INCREASES, OR

DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR

OPERATING COSTS. QUALITY ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS CAN ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

RESULT IN LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

(19)

THERE

ARE RISKS INHERENT IN OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE

MARKET PRICE AND VOLUME OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE,

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. THESE MAY ARISE FROM GENERAL STOCK MARKET

CONDITIONS, THE IMPACT OF THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, A CHANGE IN SENTIMENT IN THE MARKET

REGARDING US OR OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR FROM OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THE

AMOUNTS AND FREQUENCY OF SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDENDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN JULY AND SEPTEMBER 2008, SHAREHOLDERS FILED TWO

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT NAMING US AS DEFENDANT, AS WELL

AS OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THESE TWO ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED, AND IN JANUARY 2009, A CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED

ALLEGING THAT WE AND OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS THAT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED OUR STOCK PRICE BETWEEN MARCH 12, 2008 AND

APRIL 10, 2008, WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008

WOULD NOT MEET OUR PREVIOUS GUIDANCE AND WE ALSO LOWERED OUR FULL YEAR GUIDANCE

FOR 2008. THE CASE SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE

CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN MARCH 2009 AND IS CURRENTLY UNDER

CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT. WE INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELVES

VIGOROUSLY.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN OCTOBER 2008, SHAREHOLDERS FILED A PURPORTED CLASS

ACTION UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK NAMING US AS DEFENDANT, AS WELL AS OUR CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT DURING

A CONFERENCE CALL WITH ANALYSTS ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND

MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING (I) THE STATE OF GE’S FUNDING, CASH FLOWS, AND

LIQUIDITY AND (II) THE QUESTION OF ISSUING ADDITIONAL EQUITY, WHICH CAUSED

ECONOMIC LOSS TO THOSE SHAREHOLDERS WHO PURCHASED GE STOCK BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 25,

2008 AND OCTOBER 2, 2008, WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THE PRICING OF A COMMON STOCK

OFFERING. THE CASE SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE SECOND

AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN JANUARY 2010 AND IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION

BY THE COURT. WE INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELVES VIGOROUSLY.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN MARCH AND APRIL 2009, SHAREHOLDERS FILED PURPORTED CLASS

ACTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK NAMING AS DEFENDANTS GE, A NUMBER OF GE

OFFICERS (INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER) AND

OUR DIRECTORS. THE COMPLAINTS, WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN CONSOLIDATED, SEEK

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES BASED ON ALLEGATIONS RELATED TO STATEMENTS REGARDING THE GE

DIVIDEND AND PROJECTED LOSSES AND EARNINGS FOR GE CAPITAL IN 2009. OUR MOTION TO

DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN NOVEMBER 2009 AND IS CURRENTLY

UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT. A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION HAS BEEN FILED

IN FEDERAL COURT IN CONNECTICUT IN MAY 2009 MAKING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

ALLEGATIONS AS THE NEW YORK ACTIONS. WE HAVE MOVED TO CONSOLIDATE THE

CONNECTICUT DERIVATIVE ACTION WITH THE RECENTLY CONSOLIDATED NEW YORK ACTIONS.

WE INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELVES VIGOROUSLY.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ)

AND THE SEC ARE CONDUCTING AN INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATION OF MARKETING AND SALES

OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO

MUNICIPALITIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION, TWO SUBSIDIARIES OF GE

CAPITAL HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH

THE INVESTIGATION: GE FUNDING CMS (TRINITY FUNDING CO.) AND GE FUNDING CAPITAL

MARKET SERVICES, INC. (GE FCMS). GE CAPITAL HAS COOPERATED AND CONTINUES TO

COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE SEC AND DOJ IN THIS MATTER. IN JULY 2008, GE FCMS

RECEIVED A “WELLS NOTICE” ADVISING THAT THE SEC STAFF IS CONSIDERING

RECOMMENDING THAT THE SEC BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION OR INSTITUTE AN

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE BIDDING FOR VARIOUS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES OF

GE FCMS. GE FCMS IS ONE OF SEVERAL INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS THAT RECEIVED WELLS

NOTICES DURING 2008. GE FCMS DISAGREES WITH THE SEC STAFF REGARDING THIS

RECOMMENDATION AND HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STAFF, INCLUDING DISCUSSION

OF POTENTIAL RESOLUTION OF THE MATTER. GE FCMS INTENDS TO CONTINUE THESE

DISCUSSIONS AND UNDERSTANDS THAT IT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ANY

DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE SEC STAFF WITH RESPECT TO ITS RECOMMENDATION THROUGH THE

WELLS PROCESS WITH THE FULL COMMISSION. IN MARCH 2008, GE FCMS AND TRINITY

FUNDING CO., LLC (TRINITY FUNDING) WERE SERVED WITH A FEDERAL CLASS ACTION

COMPLAINT ASSERTING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. THIS ACTION HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH

OTHER RELATED ACTIONS IN A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PROCEEDING IN THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN ADDITION, GE

FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING ALSO RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF

THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT AND FLORIDA ON BEHALF OF A WORKING GROUP OF STATE

ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN JUNE 2008. GE FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING ARE COOPERATING WITH

THOSE INVESTIGATIONS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEC REQUIREMENTS TO DISCLOSE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS POTENTIALLY INVOLVING MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000

OR GREATER, IN JUNE 2008, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ISSUED A

NOTICE OF VIOLATION ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT AT A POWER

COGENERATION PLANT IN HOMER CITY, PA. THE PLANT IS OPERATED EXCLUSIVELY BY EME

HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P., AND IS OWNED AND LEASED TO EME HOMER CITY GENERATION

L.P. BY SUBSIDIARIES OF GE CAPITAL. THE NOTICE OF VIOLATION DOES NOT INDICATE A

SPECIFIC PENALTY AMOUNT BUT MAKES REFERENCE TO STATUTORY FINES. WE BELIEVE THAT

WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES AND THAT EME HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P. IS

OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY GE CAPITAL’S SUBSIDIARIES AND PAY ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THIS MATTER.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OPERATIONS

OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMBINE THE INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING, SERVICES

AND MEDIA BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (GE) WITH THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. (GECS OR

FINANCIAL SERVICES).

IN THE

ACCOMPANYING ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WE SOMETIMES USE INFORMATION

DERIVED FROM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BUT NOT PRESENTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). CERTAIN OF THESE DATA ARE CONSIDERED “NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES” UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

RULES. FOR SUCH MEASURES, WE HAVE PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL EXPLANATIONS AND

RECONCILIATIONS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SECTION.

WE

PRESENT MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS IN FIVE PARTS: OVERVIEW OF OUR

EARNINGS FROM 2007 THROUGH 2009, GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT, SEGMENT OPERATIONS,

GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, WE

REFER TO CAPTIONS SUCH AS REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY SIMPLY AS “REVENUES” AND “EARNINGS” THROUGHOUT THIS

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. SIMILARLY, DISCUSSION OF OTHER MATTERS IN

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS UNLESS

OTHERWISE INDICATED.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2010, WE REORGANIZED OUR SEGMENTS TO BETTER ALIGN OUR CONSUMER &

INDUSTRIAL AND ENERGY BUSINESSES FOR GROWTH. AS A RESULT OF THIS REORGANIZATION,

WE CREATED A NEW SEGMENT CALLED HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDES THE

APPLIANCES AND LIGHTING BUSINESSES FROM OUR PREVIOUS CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL

SEGMENT AND THE RETAINED PORTION OF THE GE FANUC INTELLIGENT PLATFORMS BUSINESS

OF OUR PREVIOUS ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS (FORMERLY WITHIN OUR TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT). IN ADDITION, THE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS OF OUR PREVIOUS

CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT AND THE SENSING & INSPECTION TECHNOLOGIES

AND DIGITAL ENERGY BUSINESSES OF OUR PREVIOUS ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS ARE

NOW PART OF THE ENERGY BUSINESS WITHIN THE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT. THE

SECURITY BUSINESS OF ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS WILL BE REPORTED IN CORPORATE ITEMS

AND ELIMINATIONS PENDING ITS EXPECTED SALE. ALSO, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE

CAPITAL FINANCE SEGMENT WAS RENAMED GE CAPITAL AND INCLUDES ALL OF THE

CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION. IN ADDITION, THE

TRANSPORTATION FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN GE CAPITAL

AVIATION SERVICES (GECAS), WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMMERCIAL LENDING AND LEASING

(CLL) AND OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS IN ITALY, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN CONSUMER, WILL

BE INCLUDED IN CLL.

RESULTS

FOR 2009 AND PRIOR PERIODS ARE REPORTED ON THE BASIS UNDER WHICH WE MANAGED OUR

BUSINESS IN 2009 AND DO NOT REFLECT THE JANUARY 2010 REORGANIZATION DESCRIBED

ABOVE.

OVERVIEW

OF OUR EARNINGS FROM 2007 THROUGH 2009

NET

EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY DECREASED 37% IN 2009 AND 22% IN 2008,

REFLECTING THE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AND THE

EFFECT ON BOTH OUR INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. OUR FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES WERE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED AS GECS NET EARNINGS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY FELL 80% IN 2009 AND 32% IN 2008. EXCLUDING THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, OUR NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY

DECREASED 7% IN 2009 AND 13% IN 2008, REFLECTING THE WEAKENED GLOBAL ECONOMY AND

CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE SIGNS OF

STABILIZATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. WE HAVE A STRONG BACKLOG ENTERING 2010 AND

ARE POSITIONED FOR GLOBAL GROWTH IN 2011 AND 2012.

ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE (21% AND 24% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL

SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

YEARS AS THE WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR ENERGY, AND FOR ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF POWER,

SUCH AS WIND AND THERMAL, ROSE TO NEW LEVELS. REVENUES DECREASED 4% IN 2009

AFTER INCREASING 26% IN 2008, AND SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED 13% AND 26% IN 2009

AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND

SERVICES AT ENERGY AND OIL & GAS.

(26)

TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE (26% AND 31% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL

SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) REVENUES AND EARNINGS BOTH FELL 8% IN 2009 AFTER

RISING 8% AND 3%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2008. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING

TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES AT AVIATION, HEALTHCARE AND TRANSPORTATION. AVIATION

GENERATED STRONG REVENUES AND EARNINGS AS ONE OF THE WORLD’S LEADING PROVIDERS

OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND SERVICES. HEALTHCARE REVENUES AND EARNINGS TRENDED DOWN

IN 2009, REFLECTING THE GENERALLY WEAK GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONTINUED

UNCERTAINTY IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKETS. TRANSPORTATION REVENUES AND EARNINGS FELL

24% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2009 AFTER RISING 11% AND 3%, RESPECTIVELY, IN

2008 AS THE WEAKENED ECONOMY HAS DRIVEN OVERALL REDUCTIONS IN U.S. FREIGHT

TRAFFIC AND WE UPDATED OUR ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICE

COSTS.

NBC

UNIVERSAL (NBCU) (9% AND 11% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL

SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) IS A DIVERSIFIED MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY

THAT HAS GROWN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THROUGH BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIC

DIVERSITY. NBCU REVENUES FELL 9% AND EARNINGS DECREASED 28% IN 2009 COMPARED

WITH A 10% INCREASE IN REVENUES AND FLAT EARNINGS IN 2008. WHILE THE TELEVISION

AND FILM BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGED BY THE EFFECTS OF A DIFFICULT

ECONOMY, OUR CABLE BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW AND BECOME MORE PROFITABLE. IN

2010, WE EXPECT TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS OF THE NBCU BUSINESS TO A NEWLY FORMED

ENTITY, WHICH WILL CONSIST OF OUR NBCU BUSINESSES AND COMCAST CORPORATION'S

CABLE NETWORKS, REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORKS, CERTAIN DIGITAL PROPERTIES AND CERTAIN

UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS. PURSUANT TO THE TRANSACTION, WE WILL RECEIVE CASH

AND WILL OWN A 49% INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED ENTITY. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE

CLASSIFIED NBCU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS HELD FOR SALE IN OUR STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION.

CAPITAL

FINANCE (36% AND 31% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT

PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) EARNINGS DECLINED TO $2.3 BILLION AND $8.6 BILLION IN 2009

AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, IN A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING

DISRUPTIONS IN CAPITAL MARKETS, CHALLENGING CREDIT MARKETS AND RISING

UNEMPLOYMENT. THROUGHOUT 2008 AND 2009, WE TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS,

SHIFTED TEAMS FROM ORIGINATION TO COLLECTION AND MAINTAINED A PROACTIVE RISK

MANAGEMENT FOCUS. WE ALSO REDUCED OUR ENDING NET INVESTMENT (ENI), EXCLUDING THE

EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, FROM $525 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TO

$472 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE CURRENT CREDIT CYCLE HAS BEGUN TO SHOW

SIGNS OF STABILIZATION AND WE EXPECT FURTHER SIGNS OF STABILIZATION AS WE ENTER

2010. OUR FOCUS IS TO CONTINUE TO MANAGE THROUGH THE CURRENT CHALLENGING CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT AND CONTINUE TO REPOSITION GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GE

CAPITAL) AS A DIVERSELY FUNDED AND SMALLER, MORE FOCUSED FINANCE COMPANY WITH

STRONG POSITIONS IN SEVERAL MID-MARKET, CORPORATE AND CONSUMER FINANCING

SEGMENTS.

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL (7% AND 2% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL

SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) IS ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. REFLECTIVE OF THE DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET, CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL REVENUES HAVE DECLINED 17% IN 2009 AND 7% IN 2008. OVER THE

PAST TWO YEARS, CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL HAS WORKED TO REPOSITION ITS BUSINESS

BY ELIMINATING CAPACITY IN ITS INCANDESCENT LIGHTING MANUFACTURING SITES AND

INVESTING IN ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCT MANUFACTURING IN LOCATIONS SUCH AS

LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY AND BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA. SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED 10% IN

2009 ON HIGHER PRICES AND LOWER MATERIAL COSTS AND REFLECTS THESE COST REDUCTION

EFFORTS AFTER DECLINING 65% IN 2008, PRIMARILY ON HIGHER MATERIAL AND OTHER

COSTS.

OVERALL,

ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED $3.4 BILLION, $7.4 BILLION AND $7.7 BILLION TO

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING THE

EFFECTS OF ACQUISITION GAINS FOLLOWING OUR ADOPTION OF AN AMENDMENT TO FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 810,

CONSOLIDATION

. OUR

CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $0.5 BILLION, $0.8 BILLION AND

$0.5 BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. WE

INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ONLY REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM

THE DATE WE COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION THROUGH THE END OF THE FOURTH FOLLOWING

QUARTER ARE ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH BUSINESSES. DISPOSITIONS ALSO AFFECTED OUR

ONGOING RESULTS THROUGH LOWER REVENUES OF $4.7 BILLION IN 2009, HIGHER REVENUES

OF $0.1 BILLION IN 2008 AND LOWER REVENUES OF $3.6 BILLION IN 2007. THE EFFECTS

OF DISPOSITIONS ON NET EARNINGS WERE INCREASES OF $0.6 BILLION IN 2009 AND $0.4

BILLION IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007.

SIGNIFICANT

MATTERS RELATING TO OUR STATEMENT OF EARNINGS ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.

(27)

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

IN

SEPTEMBER 2007, WE COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL OUR JAPANESE PERSONAL LOAN

BUSINESS (LAKE) UPON DETERMINING THAT, DESPITE RESTRUCTURING, JAPANESE

REGULATORY LIMITS FOR INTEREST CHARGES ON UNSECURED PERSONAL LOANS DID NOT

PERMIT US TO EARN AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN. DURING 2008, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE

MONEY JAPAN, WHICH INCLUDED LAKE, ALONG WITH OUR JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD

BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP IN GE NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD. IN

DECEMBER 2007, WE COMPLETED THE EXIT OF WMC AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED PRESSURES

IN THE U.S. SUBPRIME MORTGAGE INDUSTRY. BOTH OF THESE BUSINESSES WERE PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED IN THE CAPITAL FINANCE SEGMENT.

IN

AUGUST 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR PLASTICS BUSINESS. WE SOLD THIS

BUSINESS BECAUSE OF ITS CYCLICALITY, RISING COSTS OF NATURAL GAS AND RAW

MATERIALS, AND THE DECISION TO REDEPLOY CAPITAL RESOURCES INTO HIGHER-GROWTH

BUSINESSES.

WE

REPORTED THE BUSINESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SEE

NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

WE DECLARED $6.8 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS

IN 2009.

COMMON PER-SHARE DIVIDENDS OF $0.61 WERE DOWN 51% FROM 2008,

FOLLOWING AN 8% INCREASE FROM THE PRECEDING YEAR. IN FEBRUARY 2009, WE ANNOUNCED

THE REDUCTION OF THE QUARTERLY GE STOCK DIVIDEND BY 68% FROM $0.31 PER SHARE TO

$0.10 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN JUNE 2009,

WHICH WAS PAID IN THE THIRD QUARTER. THIS REDUCTION HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING

CASH OUTFLOWS OF THE COMPANY BY APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION IN THE SECOND HALF OF

2009 AND WILL SAVE APPROXIMATELY $9 BILLION ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. ON FEBRUARY 12,

2010, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.10 PER

SHARE OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS PAYABLE APRIL 26, 2010, TO SHAREOWNERS OF RECORD

AT CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 1, 2010. IN 2009, WE DECLARED $0.3 BILLION IN

PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS COMPARED WITH $0.1 BILLION IN 2008.

EXCEPT

AS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE ANALYSIS IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION PRESENTS THE

RESULTS OF GE (WITH GECS INCLUDED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS) AND GECS. SEE THE SEGMENT

OPERATIONS SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESSES WITHIN GE

AND GECS.

GE SALES OF PRODUCT SERVICES

WERE $35.4 BILLION IN 2009, ABOUT FLAT COMPARED WITH 2008. INCREASES IN PRODUCT

SERVICES AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE WERE OFFSET BY DECREASES AT TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL. OPERATING PROFIT FROM PRODUCT

SERVICES WAS $10.0 BILLION IN 2009, UP 7% FROM 2008.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

COSTS WERE $2.6 BILLION, $2.2 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. COSTS INCREASED IN 2009 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF LOWER

DISCOUNT RATES (PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED FROM 6.34% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 TO 6.11% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008) AND INCREASES IN EARLY

RETIREMENTS RESULTING FROM RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL

REQUIREMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR-YEARS' INVESTMENT GAINS

AND BENEFITS FROM NEW HEALTHCARE SUPPLIER CONTRACTS. COSTS DECREASED IN 2008

PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEARS' INVESTMENT GAINS, HIGHER

DISCOUNT RATES AND BENEFITS FROM NEW HEALTHCARE SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL COSTS OF PLAN BENEFITS RESULTING FROM UNION NEGOTIATIONS

AND A PENSIONER INCREASE IN 2007.

CONSIDERING

THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED

RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF ASSETS IN WHICH OUR PLANS ARE INVESTED, WE HAVE

ASSUMED THAT LONG-TERM RETURNS ON OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL BE 8.5%

FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2010, THE SAME LEVEL AS WE ASSUMED IN 2009, 2008 AND

2007. GAAP PROVIDES RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSUMED AND ACTUAL

RETURNS OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF

EMPLOYEES.

WE

EXPECT THE COSTS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF 2009

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, TO INCREASE IN 2010 BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION AS

COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR-YEAR INVESTMENT

LOSSES AND LOWER DISCOUNT RATES.

(28)

OUR

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS WERE UNDERFUNDED BY $6.0 BILLION AT THE END OF 2009 AS

COMPARED TO $4.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE GE

PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED BY $2.2 BILLION AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION

PLAN, WHICH IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD A PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $3.8

BILLION. THE INCREASE IN UNDERFUNDING FROM YEAR-END 2008 WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER DISCOUNT RATES (PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS DISCOUNT RATE

DECREASED FROM 6.11% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TO 5.78% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH

INCREASED THE PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT YEAR-END 2009 BY APPROXIMATELY $1.7

BILLION). OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS’ ASSETS INCREASED FROM $40.7 BILLION AT

THE END OF 2008 TO $42.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, A 10.0% INCREASE IN

INVESTMENT VALUES DURING THE YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFIT PAYMENTS. ASSETS

OF THE GE PENSION PLAN ARE HELD IN TRUST, SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF PLAN

PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL COMPANY OPERATIONS.

ON AN

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) BASIS, THE GE PENSION PLAN

REMAINS FULLY FUNDED AT JANUARY 1, 2010. WE WILL NOT MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2010. ASSUMING OUR 2010 ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT

WITH OUR CURRENT BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS (E.G., EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AND

INTEREST RATES), WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION

PLAN IN 2011.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS FOR OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS WAS $2.7

BILLION LESS THAN THE RESPECTIVE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPARABLE

AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WAS $2.4 BILLION. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.6

BILLION TO OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2010, COMPARED WITH ACTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS

OF $0.7 BILLION AND $0.6 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. WE FUND OUR

RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS. THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR OUR

PRINCIPAL RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE PLANS WAS $11.6 BILLION AND $10.8 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER DISCOUNT RATES (RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE PLANS DISCOUNT

RATE DECREASED FROM 6.15% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TO 5.67% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009),

WHICH INCREASED THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $0.6 BILLION. WE EXPECT

TO CONTRIBUTE $0.7 BILLION TO THESE PLANS IN 2010 COMPARED WITH ACTUAL

CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.6 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008.

THE

FUNDED STATUS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLANS AND FUTURE EFFECTS ON

OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. SEE

NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT FUNDED STATUS, COMPONENTS OF EARNINGS EFFECTS AND ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS.

GE OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES

ARE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THESE COSTS WERE 14.3%, 12.9%

AND 14.2% OF TOTAL GE SALES IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

INTEREST ON BORROWINGS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL CHARGES

AMOUNTED TO $18.8 BILLION, $26.2 BILLION AND $23.8

BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

BORROWINGS ARE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHERE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $17.9 BILLION,

$25.1 BILLION AND $22.7 BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. GECS

AVERAGE BORROWINGS DECLINED FROM 2008 TO 2009 AFTER INCREASING FROM 2007 TO

2008, IN LINE WITH CHANGES IN AVERAGE GECS ASSETS. INTEREST RATES HAVE DECREASED

OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINING GLOBAL BENCHMARK INTEREST

RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE CREDIT SPREADS. GECS AVERAGE

BORROWINGS WERE $499.2 BILLION, $521.2 BILLION AND $456.4 BILLION IN 2009, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE GECS AVERAGE COMPOSITE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE WAS

3.6% IN 2009, 4.8% IN 2008 AND 5.0% IN 2007. IN 2009, GECS AVERAGE ASSETS OF

$649.6 BILLION WERE 3% LOWER THAN IN 2008, WHICH IN TURN WERE 13% HIGHER THAN IN

2007. WE ANTICIPATE THAT GECS COMPOSITE EFFECTIVE RATES WILL BEGIN TO RISE IN

2010 AS BENCHMARK RATES BEGIN TO RISE GLOBALLY. SEE THE LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS

SECTION FOR A DISCUSSION OF LIQUIDITY, BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE RISK

MANAGEMENT.

INCOME TAXES

HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR NET EARNINGS. AS A GLOBAL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, OUR

TAX RATES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MIX OF EARNINGS,

THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE GLOBAL EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES, LEGISLATION, ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND TAX

CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR INCOME. OUR TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED AND

SETTLEMENTS OF ISSUES RAISED IN THESE AUDITS SOMETIMES AFFECT OUR TAX

PROVISIONS.

(29)

INCOME

TAXES (BENEFIT) ON CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE (10.5)%

IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 5.3% IN 2008 AND 15.1% IN 2007. OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME

TAX RATE IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF BENEFITS

FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE USE OF GLOBAL FUNDING

STRUCTURES, AND OUR 2009 AND 2008 DECISIONS TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR

EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2008 TO 2009 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A

REDUCTION DURING 2009 OF INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCREASED

THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF OUR TAX BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING THE DECISION, DISCUSSED BELOW, TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR

EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THESE EFFECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE FROM

2008 TO 2009 IN THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL

OPERATIONS.

CASH

TAXES PAID IN 2009 WERE $2.5 BILLION, REFLECTING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES TO

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

THEIR TAX BASES, INCLUDING THE DECISION, DISCUSSED BELOW, TO INDEFINITELY

REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A

REDUCTION DURING 2008 OF INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCREASED

THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF TAX BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS ON THE

TAX RATE. IN ADDITION, EARNINGS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCREASED

FROM 2007 TO 2008. THE INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL

OPERATIONS INCLUDES A BENEFIT FROM THE 2008 DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST

PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S., BECAUSE THE USE OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS NO

LONGER REQUIRED THE REPATRIATION OF THOSE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS.

A MORE

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND THE

CONSOLIDATED RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS,

IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM

8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. THE

NATURE OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ASSOCIATED INCOME TAXES DIFFER FOR GE AND FOR

GECS AND A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF EACH IS PRESENTED IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT

FOLLOW.

BECAUSE

GE TAX EXPENSE DOES NOT INCLUDE TAXES ON GECS EARNINGS, THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE IS BEST ANALYZED IN RELATION TO GE EARNINGS EXCLUDING GECS. GE PRE-TAX

EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING GECS EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS, WERE $12.6 BILLION, $14.2 BILLION AND $13.5 BILLION FOR 2009, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. ON THIS BASIS, GE’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 21.8% IN

2009, 24.2% IN 2008 AND 20.6% IN 2007.

RESOLUTION

OF AUDIT MATTERS REDUCED THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD. THE

EFFECTS OF SUCH RESOLUTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING CAPTIONS IN NOTE 14 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

THE GE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2008 TO 2009 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE 3.6

PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL

OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.

THE GE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008 BECAUSE OF THE 4.3 PERCENTAGE

POINT LOWER 2008 BENEFIT FROM FAVORABLE AUDIT RESOLUTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

1.2 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT IN LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL

OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.

THE 2007

GE RATE REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE AUDIT RESOLUTIONS SHOWN ABOVE AND THE BENEFIT OF

LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS.

(30)

THE GECS

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 173.4% IN 2009, COMPARED WITH (42.2)% IN 2008 AND 9.7% IN

2007. GE AND GECS FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN THAT

ENABLES GE TO USE GECS TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS TO REDUCE THE TAX THAT

OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE BY GE. THE GECS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR EACH

PERIOD REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF THESE TAX REDUCTIONS. GE MAKES CASH PAYMENTS TO

GECS FOR THESE TAX REDUCTIONS AT THE TIME GE’S TAX PAYMENTS ARE

DUE.

COMPARING

A TAX BENEFIT TO PRE-TAX INCOME RESULTED IN A NEGATIVE GECS TAX RATE IN 2008 AND

COMPARING A TAX BENEFIT TO PRE-TAX LOSS RESULTS IN THE POSITIVE GECS TAX RATE IN

2009. THE GECS TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 2008 TO 2009 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A

REDUCTION DURING 2009 OF INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS HAD THE

EFFECT OF INCREASING THE RELATIVE IMPACT ON THE RATE OF TAX BENEFITS FROM

LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCREASING THE RATE 253.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THIS

MORE THAN OFFSET THE DECLINE IN THOSE BENEFITS DECREASING THE RATE 68.1

PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE DECLINE IN TAX BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL

OPERATIONS INCLUDES AN OFFSET OF 15.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR INCREASED BENEFITS

FROM MANAGEMENT’S DECISION (DISCUSSED BELOW) IN 2009 TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST

PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT WAS LARGER THAN THE 2008 DECISION TO

INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

DURING

2009, FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN OUR EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS, FUNDING ACTIONS TAKEN

AND OUR CONTINUED REVIEW OF OUR OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING, WE DETERMINED

THAT UNDISTRIBUTED PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF GECS, ON

WHICH WE HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. TAXES, WOULD NOW BE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF PRIOR-YEAR

EARNINGS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION,

RESULTING IN AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $0.7 BILLION IN 2009.

THE GECS

RATE DECREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A REDUCTION DURING 2008 OF

INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCREASED THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF TAX

BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS ON THE TAX RATE, REDUCING THE RATE

30.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION, EARNINGS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS

INCREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008, CAUSING AN ADDITIONAL 19.9 PERCENTAGE POINT RATE

REDUCTION. THE INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS

INCLUDES 6.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE 2008 DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST

PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. BECAUSE THE USE OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS NO

LONGER REQUIRED THE REPATRIATION OF THOSE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS.

GLOBAL

RISK MANAGEMENT

A

DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO RISK IS IMPORTANT IN A DIVERSIFIED ORGANIZATION SUCH AS

OURS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

EXECUTING

ACCORDING TO OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND THAT WE ONLY ACCEPT RISK FOR WHICH WE

ARE ADEQUATELY

COMPENSATED.

WE EVALUATE RISK AT THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION LEVEL, AND EVALUATE AGGREGATE

RISK AT THE CUSTOMER, INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AND COLLATERAL-TYPE LEVELS, WHERE

APPROPRIATE.

THE GE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOARD) HAS OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISK OVERSIGHT WITH A

FOCUS ON THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS FACING THE COMPANY. AT THE END OF EACH YEAR,

MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD JOINTLY DEVELOP A LIST OF MAJOR RISKS THAT GE PLANS TO

PRIORITIZE IN THE NEXT YEAR. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, THE BOARD AND THE COMMITTEES

TO WHICH IT HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY DEDICATE A PORTION OF THEIR MEETINGS TO

REVIEW AND DISCUSS SPECIFIC RISK TOPICS IN GREATER DETAIL. STRATEGIC AND

OPERATIONAL RISKS ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CEO’S REPORT

ON OPERATIONS TO THE BOARD AT REGULARLY SCHEDULED BOARD MEETINGS AND AT

PRESENTATIONS TO THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES BY THE VICE CHAIRMEN, GENERAL

COUNSEL AND OTHER OFFICERS. THE BOARD HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

OVERSIGHT OF SPECIFIC RISKS TO BOARD COMMITTEES AS FOLLOWS.

(31)

·

THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSEES GE’S RISK POLICIES AND PROCESSES RELATING TO THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES, AND KEY CREDIT

RISKS, LIQUIDITY RISKS, MARKETS RISKS, COMPLIANCE AND THE GUIDELINES,

POLICIES AND PROCESSES FOR MONITORING AND MITIGATING THOSE RISKS. AS PART

OF ITS RISK OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR GE OVERALL, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

ALSO OVERSEES RISKS RELATED TO GECS. AT LEAST TWO TIMES A YEAR, THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE RECEIVES A RISK UPDATE, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE PRINCIPAL RISKS

AFFECTING GE AS WELL AS REPORTING ON THE COMPANY’S RISK ASSESSMENT AND

RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND PROCESSES; AND THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE ANNUALLY CONDUCTS AN ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND

PROGRAMS.

·

THE

PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES COMMITTEE OVERSEES RISKS RELATED TO GE’S PUBLIC

POLICY INITIATIVES, THE ENVIRONMENT AND SIMILAR

MATTERS.

·

THE

MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MONITORS THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGEMENT RESOURCES, STRUCTURE, SUCCESSION PLANNING,

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION PROCESSES, INCLUDING EVALUATING THE EFFECT

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE MAY HAVE ON RISK

DECISIONS.

·

THE

NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE OVERSEES RISKS RELATED TO

THE COMPANY’S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES AND RISKS ARISING FROM

RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS.

THE GE

BOARD’S RISK OVERSIGHT PROCESS BUILDS UPON MANAGEMENT’S RISK ASSESSMENT AND

MITIGATION PROCESSES, WHICH INCLUDE STANDARDIZED REVIEWS OF LONG-TERM STRATEGIC

AND OPERATIONAL PLANNING; EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION; REGULATORY AND

LITIGATION COMPLIANCE; HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE; FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND CONTROLLERSHIP; AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY. IN AUGUST

2009, GE APPOINTED A CHIEF RISK OFFICER (CRO) WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING

AND COORDINATING RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION ON AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE BASIS. THE

CRO LEADS THE CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION

OF KEY BUSINESS RISKS, ENSURING APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT OF THESE RISKS WITHIN

STATED LIMITS, AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. MANAGEMENT HAS

TWO COMMITTEES TO FURTHER ASSIST IT IN ASSESSING AND MITIGATING RISK. THE POLICY

COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD (PCRB) MEETS BETWEEN 12 AND 14 TIMES A YEAR, IS CHAIRED

BY THE COMPANY’S GENERAL COUNSEL AND INCLUDES THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND

OTHER SENIOR LEVEL FUNCTIONAL LEADERS. IT HAS PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

MONITORING COMPLIANCE MATTERS ACROSS THE COMPANY. THE CORPORATE RISK COMMITTEE

(CRC) MEETS AT LEAST FOUR TIMES A YEAR, IS CHAIRED BY THE CRO AND COMPRISES THE

CHAIRMAN AND CEO AND OTHER SENIOR LEVEL BUSINESS AND FUNCTIONAL LEADERS. IT HAS

PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVALUATING AND ADDRESSING RISKS ESCALATED TO THE

CRO AND CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION AND ALSO REPORTS TO THE BOARD ON

RISK.

GE'S

CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION LEVERAGES THE RISK INFRASTRUCTURES IN EACH OF OUR

BUSINESSES, WHICH HAVE ADOPTED AN APPROACH THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE COMPANY’S

OVERALL RISK POLICIES, GUIDELINES AND REVIEW MECHANISMS. OUR RISK INFRASTRUCTURE

IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY, EVALUATE AND MITIGATE RISKS WITHIN EACH OF THE

FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

(32)

·

STRATEGIC.

STRATEGIC

RISK RELATES TO THE COMPANY’S FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS AND STRATEGIES,

INCLUDING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, COMPETITIVE THREATS,

TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT INNOVATION, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND PUBLIC

POLICY.

·

OPERATIONAL.

OPERATIONAL

RISK RELATES TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PEOPLE, INTEGRITY OF OUR INTERNAL

SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, AS WELL AS EXTERNAL EVENTS THAT AFFECT THE

OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESSES. IT INCLUDES PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE AND EXECUTION,

PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND DATA SECURITY, BUSINESS

DISRUPTION, HUMAN RESOURCES AND

REPUTATION.

·

FINANCIAL.

FINANCIAL

RISK RELATES TO OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND EXPOSURE TO BROAD MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY

PRICES. LIQUIDITY RISK IS THE RISK OF BEING UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE

LIABILITY MATURITIES, FUND ASSET GROWTH AND MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THROUGH ACCESS TO FUNDING AT REASONABLE MARKET RATES AND CREDIT RISK IS

THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS ARISING FROM A CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY FAILURE

TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE FACE CREDIT RISK IN OUR INDUSTRIAL

BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS IN OUR GECS INVESTING, LENDING AND LEASING

ACTIVITIES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ACTIVITIES.

·

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS WITH POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO FINANCIAL REPORTING, ENVIRONMENTAL

HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS. GOVERNMENT AND

REGULATORY RISK IS THE RISK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR REGULATORY ACTIONS WILL

CAUSE US TO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS OR

PRACTICES.

RISKS

IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES ARE PRIORITIZED AND, DEPENDING

ON THE PROBABILITY AND SEVERITY OF THE RISK, ESCALATED TO THE CRO. THE CRO, IN

COORDINATION WITH THE CRC, ASSIGNS RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RISKS TO THE BUSINESS

OR FUNCTIONAL LEADER MOST SUITED TO MANAGE THE RISK. ASSIGNED OWNERS ARE

REQUIRED TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR, EVALUATE AND REPORT ON RISKS FOR WHICH THEY

BEAR RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE GENERAL RESPONSE STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING RISKS,

WHICH CATEGORIZE RISKS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL AVOID, TRANSFER,

REDUCE OR ACCEPT THE RISK. THESE RESPONSE STRATEGIES ARE TAILORED TO ENSURE THAT

RISKS ARE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE GE BOARD TOLERANCE LEVELS.

DEPENDING

ON THE NATURE OF THE RISK INVOLVED AND THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR FUNCTION

AFFECTED, WE USE A WIDE VARIETY OF RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES, INCLUDING

HEDGING, STANDARDIZED PROCESSES, APPROVALS AND OPERATING REVIEWS, INSURANCE AND

STRATEGIC PLANNING REVIEWS. AS A MATTER OF POLICY, WE GENERALLY HEDGE THE RISK

OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY

PRICES. OUR SERVICE BUSINESSES EMPLOY A COMPREHENSIVE TOLLGATE PROCESS LEADING

UP TO AND THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF A CONTRACTUAL SERVICE AGREEMENT TO MITIGATE

LEGAL, FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS. FURTHERMORE, WE CENTRALLY MANAGE CERTAIN

RISKS THROUGH INSURANCE DETERMINED BY THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF RISK

RETAINED OR ASSUMED AND THE COST OF TRANSFERRING RISK TO OTHERS. WE COUNTERACT

THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND CUSTOMER DEMAND BY MONITORING

INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDING BY ADJUSTING CAPACITY,

IMPLEMENTING COST REDUCTIONS AND ENGAGING IN MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS.

GECS

RISK MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT

GECS HAS

DEVELOPED A ROBUST RISK INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO

ITS BUSINESSES AND THE GE CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION RELIES UPON THEM IN

FULFILLMENT OF ITS MISSION. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE GE AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSEES

GECS’ RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

AT THE

GECS LEVEL, THE GECS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OVERSEES THE GECS RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESS, AND APPROVES ALL SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AS WELL AS

SIGNIFICANT BORROWINGS AND INVESTMENTS. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE GECS RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESS MUST COMPLY WITH APPROVAL LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE GECS

BOARD.

(33)

GE

CAPITAL HAS ESTABLISHED AN ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (ERMC),

COMPRISING THE MOST SENIOR LEADERS IN GE CAPITAL, WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT

RESPONSIBILITY FOR IDENTIFYING, ASSESSING, MITIGATING AND MONITORING RISK ACROSS

THE ENTIRE GE CAPITAL ENTERPRISE, INCLUDING CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL

& COMPLIANCE, LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK. GE CAPITAL, IN COORDINATION WITH

AND UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE GE CRO, PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE RISK REPORTS TO

THE GE AUDIT COMMITTEE. AT THESE MEETINGS, WHICH WILL OCCUR AT LEAST FOUR TIMES

A YEAR, GE CAPITAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT WILL FOCUS ON THE RISK STRATEGY AND

FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE RISK OVERSIGHT PROCESSES USED TO

MANAGE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF RISK MANAGED BY THE ERMC.

GE

CAPITAL'S RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH RESTS UPON THREE MAJOR TENETS: A BROAD SPREAD

OF RISK BASED ON MANAGED EXPOSURE LIMITS; SENIOR, SECURED COMMERCIAL FINANCINGS;

AND A HOLD TO MATURITY MODEL WITH TRANSACTIONS UNDERWRITTEN TO “ON-BOOK”

STANDARDS.

DEDICATED

RISK PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE BUSINESSES INCLUDE UNDERWRITERS, PORTFOLIO

MANAGERS, COLLECTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING SPECIALISTS, AND SPECIALIZED

ASSET MANAGERS WHO EVALUATE LEASED ASSET RESIDUALS AND REMARKET OFF-LEASE

EQUIPMENT. THE SENIOR RISK OFFICERS HAVE, ON AVERAGE, OVER 25 YEARS OF

EXPERIENCE.

ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR LIQUIDITY AND HOW WE MANAGE THIS RISK CAN BE FOUND IN THE

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN NOTES 10 AND 22 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. ADDITIONAL

SEGMENT

OPERATIONS

OUR FIVE

SEGMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON THE BROAD MARKETS THEY SERVE: ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE,

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, NBC UNIVERSAL, CAPITAL FINANCE AND CONSUMER &

INDUSTRIAL. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING INFORMATION ON SEGMENTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY,

WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITHIN THE

SEGMENTS FOR GREATER CLARITY.

SEGMENT

PROFIT IS DETERMINED BASED ON INTERNAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY THE CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.

IN CONNECTION WITH THAT ASSESSMENT, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MAY EXCLUDE

MATTERS SUCH AS CHARGES FOR RESTRUCTURING; RATIONALIZATION AND OTHER SIMILAR

EXPENSES; IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER

ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES AND BALANCES; TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

COSTS; CERTAIN GAINS AND LOSSES FROM ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS; AND

LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS OR OTHER CHARGES, RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHICH PRECEDED THE

CURRENT MANAGEMENT TEAM.

SEGMENT

PROFIT ALWAYS EXCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, RESULTS REPORTED

AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES. SEGMENT PROFIT EXCLUDES OR

INCLUDES INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES AND INCOME TAXES ACCORDING TO HOW

A PARTICULAR SEGMENT’S MANAGEMENT IS MEASURED – EXCLUDED IN DETERMINING SEGMENT

PROFIT, WHICH WE SOMETIMES REFER TO AS “OPERATING PROFIT,” FOR ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, NBC UNIVERSAL AND CONSUMER &

AND ORDERS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO POWER AND AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT, HIGHER LOCAL

CURRENCY FINANCING COSTS AND SLOWDOWN IN ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL SERVICES

ACTIVITIES. NEW PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MORE

OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER COST OUTSOURCING, EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL

SERVICES ACTIVITIES THROUGH PURCHASES OF COMPANIES OR ASSETS AT REDUCED PRICES

AND LOWER U.S. DEBT FINANCING COSTS.

REVENUES

ARE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE REGION TO WHICH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD.

FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ANALYSIS, U.S. IS PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM THE REMAINDER

FINANCIAL

RESULTS OF OUR GLOBAL ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS ARE AFFECTED BY

CURRENCY EXCHANGE. WE USE A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES TO MANAGE THE EFFECTS OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE, INCLUDING SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND

SELECTIVE HEDGING OF SIGNIFICANT CROSS-CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. SUCH PRINCIPAL

CURRENCIES ARE THE POUND STERLING, THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE CANADIAN

DOLLAR.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF

REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION

ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A

DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO

APPROXIMATELY $0.3 BILLION IN BOTH 2009 AND 2008. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH

REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $0.4

BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

IN

NOVEMBER 2006, THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT APPROVED A CONSENT

DECREE, WHICH HAD BEEN AGREED TO BY GE AND THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), THAT REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR

IMPLEMENTATION OF EPA'S 2002 RECORD OF DECISION TO DREDGE POLYCHLORINATED

BIPHENYL (PCB)-CONTAINING SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. UNDER THE CONSENT

DEGREE, THE DREDGING IS TO BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES AND PHASE I WAS COMPLETED

IN MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009. BETWEEN PHASE I AND PHASE II THERE WILL BE AN

INTERVENING PEER REVIEW BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF NATIONAL EXPERTS. THE PANEL

WILL EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF PHASE I DREDGING OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

PHASE I ENGINEERING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, EVALUATE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM PHASE

I AND MAY SET FORTH PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE STANDARDS. THIS EVALUATION IS

EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE IN THE SUMMER OF 2010 AFTER WHICH EPA, CONSIDERING THE PEER

REVIEW PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS, GE'S PROPOSED CHANGES, AND ITS OWN ANALYSIS,

WILL ISSUE ITS REGULATORY DECISION SETTING FORTH ANY CHANGES TO THE SCOPE OF, OR

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR, PHASE II. FOLLOWING EPA'S DECISION, GE HAS 90 DAYS TO

EITHER ELECT TO PERFORM PHASE II OR TO OPT OUT OF THE PROJECT, AT WHICH POINT GE

MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FURTHER COSTS. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, INCLUDED LIABILITIES FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS OF

THE PROJECT UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE.

AND GECS ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO PERMIT MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL

CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

COMPRISE

MAINLY INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES SUPPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO ANNUITANTS AND

POLICYHOLDERS IN OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND HOLDERS OF GUARANTEED

INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (GICS), AND RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION ENTITIES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES INCREASED TO $51.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, FROM $41.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECREASES

IN UNREALIZED LOSSES DUE TO MARKET IMPROVEMENTS, INVESTMENT OF CASH INTO

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS SUCH AS MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITS,

AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. OF THE

AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HELD DEBT SECURITIES WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF $41.7 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS) AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

(CMBS) WITH ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $25.5 BILLION, $3.3 BILLION AND $2.7

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON DEBT SECURITIES WERE $2.6 BILLION

AND $5.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT

INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, RMBS AND CMBS OF $0.8

BILLION, $0.8 BILLION AND $0.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS

COMPARED WITH $2.6 BILLION, $1.1 BILLION AND $0.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

OF THE

$3.3 BILLION OF RMBS, OUR EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME CREDIT WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.9

BILLION. THESE SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY HELD TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS

OF GICS. WE PURCHASED NO SUCH SECURITIES IN 2009 AND 2008. THESE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED PRIMARILY BY POOLS OF INDIVIDUAL DIRECT MORTGAGE

LOANS, AND DO NOT INCLUDE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, A MAJORITY OF EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT

RELATED TO INVESTMENT SECURITIES BACKED BY MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND

2005.

THE VAST

MAJORITY OF OUR CMBS HAVE INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR RATING

AGENCIES AND ARE IN A SENIOR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL. OUR

CMBS INVESTMENTS ARE COLLATERALIZED BY BOTH DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF MORTGAGES THAT

WERE ORIGINATED FOR SECURITIZATION (CONDUIT CMBS) AND POOLS OF LARGE LOANS

BACKED BY HIGH QUALITY PROPERTIES (LARGE LOAN CMBS), A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE

ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND 2007.

WE

REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT. OUR REVIEW USES BOTH

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2009, THE FASB AMENDED

ASC 320,

INVESTMENTS – DEBT

AND EQUITY SECURITIES

, AND MODIFIED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNIZING AND

MEASURING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT FOR DEBT SECURITIES. THIS DID NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE PRESENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO

SELL OUR DEBT SECURITIES AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE

WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS

POSITION BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST. IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE

SECURITY AND IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE

SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE

CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH

OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA

INCLUDE DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS. WITH RESPECT TO CORPORATE BONDS, WE PLACED GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE ISSUER. WITH RESPECT TO RMBS AND CMBS, WE PLACED GREATER

EMPHASIS ON OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CASH FLOWS FROM THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL AND WITH RESPECT TO RMBS, WE CONSIDERED OTHER FEATURES OF THE

SECURITY, PRINCIPALLY MONOLINE INSURANCE. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR CRITERIA

INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN

AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION. OUR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INVOLVE

OUR FINANCE, RISK AND ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY ASSET

MANAGERS.

(45)

MONOLINE

INSURERS (MONOLINES) PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENT

SECURITIES. THE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS A FEATURE OF EACH SPECIFIC SECURITY THAT

GUARANTEES THE PAYMENT OF ALL CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS, AND IS NOT PURCHASED

SEPARATELY BY GE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES INSURED BY

MONOLINES TOTALED $2.7 BILLION, INCLUDING $0.8 BILLION OF OUR $0.9 BILLION

INVESTMENT IN SUBPRIME RMBS. THE MONOLINE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE

FINANCIAL STRESS FROM INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL

LOANS UNDERLYING INSURED SECURITIES. IN EVALUATING WHETHER A SECURITY WITH

MONOLINE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WE FIRST

EVALUATE WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS. IF

THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN EVALUATE THE

OVERALL CREDIT WORTHINESS OF THE MONOLINE USING AN ANALYSIS THAT IS SIMILAR TO

THE APPROACH WE USE FOR CORPORATE BONDS. THIS INCLUDES AN EVALUATION OF THE

FOLLOWING FACTORS: SUFFICIENCY OF THE MONOLINE’S CASH RESERVES AND CAPITAL,

RATINGS ACTIVITY, WHETHER THE MONOLINE IS IN DEFAULT OR DEFAULT APPEARS

IMMINENT, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR INTERVENTION BY AN INSURANCE OR OTHER REGULATOR.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES SUBJECT TO

MONOLINE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS AN EXPECTED LOSS WAS $0.3

BILLION, OF WHICH $0.2 BILLION RELATES TO EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND THE

REMAINING $0.1 BILLION RELATES TO OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

TOTAL

PRE-TAX OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES DURING THE PERIOD APRIL 1, 2009,

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009, WERE $0.8 BILLION, OF WHICH $0.5 BILLION WAS

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AND PRIMARILY RELATES TO CREDIT LOSSES ON CORPORATE DEBT

SECURITIES, RMBS AND RETAINED INTERESTS IN OUR SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS, AND

$0.3 BILLION PRIMARILY RELATES TO NON-CREDIT RELATED LOSSES ON RMBS AND IS

INCLUDED WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

OUR

QUALITATIVE REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY ISSUERS’ SECURITIES THAT ARE “AT-RISK”

OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THAT IS, FOR SECURITIES THAT WE DO NOT

INTEND TO SELL AND IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO

SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WHETHER THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF

CREDIT LOSS THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNITION

IN THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS. SECURITIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS “AT-RISK” PRIMARILY

RELATE TO INVESTMENTS IN RMBS SECURITIES AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES ACROSS A

BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIES. THE AMOUNT OF ASSOCIATED UNREALIZED LOSS ON THESE

SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IS $0.6 BILLION. CREDIT LOSSES THAT WOULD BE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS ARE CALCULATED WHEN WE DETERMINE THE SECURITY TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS

MAY CAUSE INCREASED LEVELS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES TOTALED $2.6

BILLION, INCLUDING $2.4 BILLION AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER, COMPARED WITH

UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $5.7 BILLION, INCLUDING $3.5 BILLION AGED 12 MONTHS OR

LONGER, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. OF THE AMOUNT AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, MORE THAN 70% OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE INVESTMENT

GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, OF THE AMOUNT AGED 12 MONTHS OR

LONGER, $1.5 BILLION AND $0.7 BILLION RELATED TO STRUCTURED SECURITIES

(MORTGAGE-BACKED, ASSET-BACKED AND SECURITIZATION RETAINED INTERESTS) AND

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENT

SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE

VAST MAJORITY RELATE TO DEBT SECURITIES HELD TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS

OF GICS AND ANNUITANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS IN OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE OPERATIONS. WE

PRESENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO SELL OUR DEBT SECURITIES AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT

MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES THAT ARE

IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST. THE FAIR

VALUES USED TO DETERMINE THESE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE THOSE DEFINED BY

RELEVANT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND ARE NOT A FORECAST OF FUTURE GAINS OR LOSSES.

WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THOSE CHANGES OCCUR. AS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS,

PRIMARILY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES, CARRIED AT

$3.7 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2009, WHICH REPRESENTS THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL IS LOWER THAN CARRYING VALUE, ANY FAVORABLE OR

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL BE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR.

WORKING CAPITAL

, REPRESENTING

GE CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, LESS GE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND PROGRESS

COLLECTIONS, WAS $(1.6) BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, DOWN $5.5 BILLION FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE EFFECTS OF OPERATING INITIATIVES AND

THE CLASSIFICATION OF NBCU AND OUR SECURITY BUSINESS AS HELD FOR SALE. AS ENERGY

DELIVERS UNITS OUT OF ITS BACKLOG OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PROGRESS COLLECTIONS

OF $13.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WILL BE EARNED, WHICH, ALONG WITH

PROGRESS COLLECTIONS ON NEW ORDERS, WILL IMPACT WORKING CAPITAL. THROUGHOUT THE

LAST THREE YEARS, WE HAVE EXECUTED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THROUGH

OUR OPERATING COUNCIL, SUCH AS LEAN CYCLE TIME PROJECTS, WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN

WORKING CAPITAL DECREASES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THESE INITIATIVES IN 2010,

WHICH SHOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF

DECREASES IN PROGRESS COLLECTIONS.

WE

DISCUSS CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, TWO IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF WORKING

CAPITAL, IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

CURRENT RECEIVABLES

FOR GE

TOTALED TO $9.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2009 AND $15.1 BILLION AT THE END OF 2008,

AND INCLUDED $7.5 BILLION DUE FROM CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF 2009 COMPARED WITH

$11.3 BILLION AT THE END OF 2008. GE CURRENT RECEIVABLES TURNOVER, INCLUDING

NBCU, WAS 8.0 IN 2009, COMPARED WITH 7.5 IN 2008. THE OVERALL REDUCTION IN

CURRENT RECEIVABLES WAS DUE TO THE OPERATING COUNCIL INITIATIVES AND LOWER

VOLUME ACROSS OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF NBCU AND OUR

SECURITY BUSINESS AS HELD FOR SALE. SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF

THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

INVENTORIES

FOR GE TOTALED TO

$11.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, DOWN $1.7 BILLION FROM THE END OF 2008. THIS

DECREASE REFLECTED LOWER INVENTORIES AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

CLASSIFICATION OF OUR SECURITY BUSINESS AND NBCU AS HELD FOR SALE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER INVENTORIES AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING THE SIGNIFICANT

BACKLOG. GE INVENTORY TURNOVER, INCLUDING NBCU, WAS 7.9 AND 8.0 IN 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART

II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

IS OUR

LARGEST CATEGORY OF ASSETS AND REPRESENTS ONE OF OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF

REVENUES. A DISCUSSION OF THE QUALITY OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE FINANCING

RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO FOLLOWS.

OUR

PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS DIVERSE AND NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO

MAJOR U.S. BANKS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE HAD LESS CONSUMER EXPOSURE, WHICH OVER

TIME HAS HAD HIGHER LOSS RATES THAN COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE.

OUR

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS LARGELY NON-U.S. AND PRIMARILY COMPRISES MORTGAGE, SALES

FINANCE, AUTO AND PERSONAL LOANS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN AND ASIAN COUNTRIES. OUR

U.S. CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES COMPRISE 7% OF OUR TOTAL PORTFOLIO. OF

THOSE, APPROXIMATELY 36% RELATE PRIMARILY TO CREDIT CARDS, WHICH ARE OFTEN

SUBJECT TO PROFIT AND LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RETAILER (THE RESULTS

OF WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN GECS REVENUES), AND HAVE A SMALLER AVERAGE BALANCE AND

LOWER LOSS SEVERITY AS COMPARED TO BANK CARDS. THE REMAINING 64% ARE SALES

FINANCE RECEIVABLES, WHICH PROVIDE ELECTRONICS, RECREATION, MEDICAL AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS. IN 2007, WE EXITED THE U.S. MORTGAGE

BUSINESS AND WE HAVE NO U.S. AUTO OR STUDENT LOANS.

(47)

OUR

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY COMPRISES SENIOR, SECURED POSITIONS WITH

COMPARATIVELY LOW LOSS HISTORY. THE SECURED RECEIVABLES IN THIS PORTFOLIO ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF ASSET CLASSES, INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL-RELATED

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT; COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE; VEHICLES,

AIRCRAFT, AND EQUIPMENT USED IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION,

MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES. WE

ARE IN A SECURED POSITION FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THIS PORTFOLIO.

OVERALL,

WE BELIEVE THAT THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC MARKETS ARE BEGINNING TO STABILIZE AND WE

EXPECT THAT OUR FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO WILL BEGIN TO REFLECT THIS OVER

THE COURSE OF 2010. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMMERCIAL FINANCING MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE (EXCLUDING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE LIKEWISE

BECOMING MORE STABLE, AND LOSS SEVERITY REMAINS WITHIN AN EXPECTED

RANGE.  DELINQUENCY AND NON-EARNINGS RATES IN THESE BUSINESSES ARE

BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT AND ORIGINATIONS, WHILE DOWN, ARE AT

GENERALLY HIGHER MARGINS. IN OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES, WE CONTINUED THROUGHOUT

2009 TO RAISE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, REDUCE OPEN CREDIT COMMITMENTS AND

MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE IN COLLECTIONS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS BUSINESS HAS

HISTORICALLY BEEN LINKED TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND WE

EXPECT 2010 LOSSES TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS OUR EXPERIENCE IN 2009. REAL ESTATE

CONTINUES TO BE UNDER PRESSURE, WITH LIMITED MARKET LIQUIDITY AND CHALLENGING

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AN INTENSE FOCUS ON

OPERATIONS AND RISK MANAGEMENT; HOWEVER, WE EXPECT CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

TO PERSIST IN 2010, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN HIGHER LOSSES FOR REAL ESTATE

COMPARED WITH 2009.

LOSSES

ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES

US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. SUCH

ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR

CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT

OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY

RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL

VALUES (INCLUDING HOUSING PRICE INDICES AS APPLICABLE), AND THE PRESENT AND

EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES

STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS,

AND EVALUATES RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR INDIVIDUAL LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR

ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, LOANS ACQUIRED

IN A BUSINESS ACQUISITION ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCORPORATES OUR

ESTIMATE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE OF THE CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF

THE PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS NOT CARRIED OVER AT

ACQUISITION. THIS MAY RESULT IN LOWER RESERVE COVERAGE RATIOS

PROSPECTIVELY.

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS, “DELINQUENT” RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT

ARE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS; AND “NONEARNING”

RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE (OR FOR WHICH COLLECTION

HAS OTHERWISE BECOME DOUBTFUL). NONEARNING RECEIVABLES EXCLUDE LOANS PURCHASED

AT A DISCOUNT (UNLESS THEY HAVE DETERIORATED POST ACQUISITION). UNDER ASC 310,

RECEIVABLES,

THESE

LOANS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ACCRETE INTEREST INCOME OVER THE

ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE LOAN BASED ON REASONABLY ESTIMABLE CASH FLOWS EVEN IF THE

UNDERLYING LOANS ARE CONTRACTUALLY DELINQUENT AT ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION,

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES EXCLUDE LOANS THAT ARE PAYING CURRENTLY UNDER A CASH

ACCOUNTING BASIS, BUT CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED.  RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED

FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DELINQUENT WHEN PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT

CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURED TERMS, BUT MAY REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS

NONEARNING UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A PERIOD OF SATISFACTORY PAYMENT PERFORMANCE BY

THE BORROWER AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF

COLLECTION.

FURTHER

INFORMATION ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING

RECEIVABLES IS PROVIDED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION OF THIS

ITEM AND NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

“FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

THE

PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, WAS $345.0

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND $377.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. FINANCING

RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, DECREASED $32.8 BILLION FROM DECEMBER

31, 2008, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CORE DECLINES OF $52.1 BILLION MAINLY FROM

COLLECTIONS EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS ($44.0 BILLION) (WHICH INCLUDES

SECURITIZATION AND SALES), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR ($17.8

BILLION) AND ACQUISITIONS ($11.9 BILLION).

RELATED

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES TOTALED $13.3 BILLION (3.8% OF OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $8.0 BILLION (2.1% OF OUTSTANDING

RECEIVABLES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CHALLENGING GLOBAL ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, INCREASED DETERIORATION IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS AND RISING

UNEMPLOYMENT.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, TOTALED $8.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH

$5.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, REPRESENTING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO AND REFLECTING THE THEN-CURRENT CREDIT AND

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES INCREASED $2.8 BILLION FROM DECEMBER

31, 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND NONEARNING RECEIVABLES,

REFLECTING THE CONTINUED WEAKENED ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

(50)

“IMPAIRED”

LOANS IN THE TABLE BELOW ARE DEFINED AS LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR

WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE

ACCORDING TO ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT.  THE

VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CONSUMER AND A PORTION OF OUR CLL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES

ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS DEFINITION, AS THEY REPRESENT SMALLER BALANCE HOMOGENOUS

LOANS THAT WE EVALUATE COLLECTIVELY BY PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT.

IMPAIRED

LOANS INCLUDE NONEARNING RECEIVABLES ON LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS,

LOANS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY PAYING INTEREST UNDER THE CASH BASIS (BUT ARE EXCLUDED

FROM THE NONEARNING CATEGORY), AND LOANS PAYING CURRENTLY BUT WHICH HAVE BEEN

PREVIOUSLY RESTRUCTURED.

SPECIFIC

RESERVES ARE RECORDED FOR INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED LOANS TO THE EXTENT WE JUDGE

PRINCIPAL TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE. CERTAIN LOANS CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED MAY NOT

REQUIRE A RESERVE. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY

COLLECT THE UNPAID BALANCE (THROUGH COLLECTION OR COLLATERAL

REPOSSESSION).

IMPAIRED

LOANS INCREASED BY $9.3 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO DECEMBER 31, 2009,

PRIMARILY RELATING TO INCREASES AT REAL ESTATE ($5.7 BILLION) AND CLL ($2.7

BILLION). WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR REAL ESTATE LOANS FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE AND

LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. WE CLASSIFY REAL ESTATE LOANS AS IMPAIRED WHEN THE MOST

RECENT VALUATION REFLECTS A PROJECTED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO AT MATURITY IN EXCESS

OF 100%, EVEN IF THE LOAN IS CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL

TERMS. THE INCREASE IN IMPAIRED LOANS AND RELATED SPECIFIC RESERVES AT REAL

ESTATE REFLECTS OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF COLLATERAL VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING

PROPERTIES, AND OUR ESTIMATE OF LOANS WHICH ARE NOT PAST DUE, BUT FOR WHICH IT

IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT THE FULL PRINCIPAL BALANCE AT

MATURITY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE UNDERLYING VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. OF OUR $6.5

BILLION IMPAIRED LOANS AT REAL ESTATE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY $4.4

BILLION ARE CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE

LOAN. IMPAIRED LOANS AT CLL PRIMARILY REPRESENT SENIOR SECURED LENDING

POSITIONS.

OUR LOSS

MITIGATION STRATEGY INTENDS TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND, AT TIMES, CAN RESULT

IN RATE REDUCTIONS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, FORBEARANCE OR OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH

MAY CAUSE THE RELATED LOAN TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING

(TDR). AS REQUIRED BY GAAP, TDRS ARE INCLUDED IN IMPAIRED LOANS. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2009, TDRS INCLUDED IN IMPAIRED LOANS WERE $3.0 BILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING

TO REAL ESTATE ($1.1 BILLION), CLL ($1.0 BILLION) AND CONSUMER ($0.9

BILLION).

RECEIVABLES DECLINED FROM 42.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO 37.4% AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN SECURED EXPOSURES REQUIRING RELATIVELY LOWER

SPECIFIC RESERVE LEVELS, BASED UPON THE STRENGTH OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL

VALUES. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AS A PERCENT OF FINANCING

RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 1.9% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO 3.6% AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES IN OUR SENIOR SECURED

RECEIVABLES DECLINED FROM 53.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO 42.4% AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES IN SECURED

EXPOSURES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT SPECIFIC RESERVES BASED UPON THE

STRENGTH OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL VALUES. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING

RECEIVABLES AS A PERCENT OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 1.8% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO 4.4% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN

31, 2008, TO 20.9% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN 2009, OUR NONEARNING RECEIVABLES

INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE U.K. HOUSING

MARKET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED FORECLOSURES. OUR NON-U.S. MORTGAGE

PORTFOLIO HAS A LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO OF APPROXIMATELY 75% AT ORIGINATION AND THE

VAST MAJORITY ARE FIRST LIEN POSITIONS. OUR U.K. AND FRANCE PORTFOLIOS, WHICH

COMPRISE A MAJORITY OF OUR TOTAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, HAVE REINDEXED

LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OF 82% AND 68%, RESPECTIVELY. LESS THAN 4% OF THESE LOANS

ARE WITHOUT MORTGAGE INSURANCE AND HAVE A REINDEXED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO EQUAL TO

OR GREATER THAN 100%. LOAN-TO-VALUE INFORMATION IS UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS

INCREASED FROM 4.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO 4.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS

NONEARNING

RECEIVABLES OF $1.3 BILLION REPRESENTED 9.4% OF TOTAL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE $1.1 BILLION INCREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED DELINQUENCIES IN THE U.S.

APARTMENT AND OFFICE LOAN PORTFOLIOS, WHICH HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RENT

AND OCCUPANCY DECLINES. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL

FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 0.6% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO 3.3% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED ECONOMIC DETERIORATION IN THE

U.S. AND THE U.K. MARKETS, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN BOTH SPECIFIC AND

GENERAL CREDIT LOSS PROVISIONS. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT

OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DECLINED FROM 155.2% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO 119.3%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, REFLECTING A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THE ALLOWANCE BEING

ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPECIFIC RESERVES AND OUR ESTIMATE OF UNDERLYING COLLATERAL

GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, DELINQUENCY RATES ON

EQUIPMENT FINANCING LOANS AND LEASES INCREASED NINE BASIS POINTS FROM DECEMBER

31, 2008, TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS A RESULT OF THE INCLUSION OF THE CITICAPITAL

ACQUISITION. THE CHALLENGING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT MAY CONTINUE TO LEAD TO A HIGHER

LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL DELINQUENCIES AND PROVISIONS FOR FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT CLL.

DELINQUENCY

RATES ON CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, A

CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND LOWER VOLUME. IN RESPONSE, WE CONTINUED TO

TIGHTEN UNDERWRITING STANDARDS GLOBALLY, INCREASED FOCUS ON COLLECTION

EFFECTIVENESS AND WILL CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF REGULARLY REVIEWING AND ADJUSTING

RESERVE LEVELS. WE EXPECT THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, ALONG WITH U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT

LEVELS, TO FURTHER SHOW SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN 2010; HOWEVER, A CONTINUED

CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN HIGHER PROVISIONS FOR

LOAN LOSSES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT CONSUMER. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, ROUGHLY 39% OF OUR U.S. MANAGED PORTFOLIO (EXCLUDING

DELINQUENT OR IMPAIRED), WHICH CONSISTED OF CREDIT CARDS, INSTALLMENT AND

REVOLVING LOANS, WAS RECEIVABLE FROM SUBPRIME BORROWERS. WE HAD NO U.S. SUBPRIME

$103.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, A DECREASE OF $3.5 BILLION, REFLECTING THE

CLASSIFICATION OF NBCU AS HELD FOR SALE AND DECREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $5.8 BILLION EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENT IN PTL FOLLOWING OUR PARTIAL SALE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 AND

INCREASES IN CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. WE RECOGNIZED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS OF $0.9

BILLION AND $0.5 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 9 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

INCLUDED

IN OTHER ASSETS ARE REAL ESTATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF $32.2 BILLION AND $32.8

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. OUR PORTFOLIO IS

DIVERSIFIED, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY ASSET TYPE. HOWEVER, THE GLOBAL REAL

ESTATE MARKET IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC CYCLES THAT CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT

FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUE. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, THESE MARKETS HAVE BEEN

INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, A SLOWDOWN IN GENERAL BUSINESS

ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED CHALLENGING CONDITIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. WE EXPECT

THESE MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED WHILE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

REMAINS CHALLENGING.

WE

REVIEW THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

SEMI-ANNUALLY. AS OF OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATE PERFORMED IN 2009, THE CARRYING

VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THEIR ESTIMATED VALUE BY ABOUT $7

BILLION. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO REFLECTS THE CONTINUED

DETERIORATING REAL ESTATE VALUES AND MARKET  FUNDAMENTALS, INCLUDING

REDUCED MARKET OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENTS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF

LIMITED REAL ESTATE MARKET LIQUIDITY. GIVEN THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED CHALLENGING

MARKET CONDITIONS, THERE CONTINUES TO BE RISK AND UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES AND OUR UNREALIZED LOSS ON REAL ESTATE EQUITY

PROPERTIES MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE. DECLINES IN ESTIMATED VALUE OF REAL ESTATE

BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WHEN THE AGGREGATE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE MEASUREMENT ARE

BELOW THE CARRYING AMOUNT. AS SUCH, ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL NOT

NECESSARILY RESULT IN RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN

IMPAIRMENT, THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSET WHICH IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET DATA, INCLUDING CURRENT

CAPITALIZATION RATES. DURING 2009, REAL ESTATE RECOGNIZED PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENTS OF

$0.8 BILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, COMPARED WITH $0.3 BILLION FOR THE

COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2008. CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY RESULT IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENTS BEING RECOGNIZED.

CONTRACT

COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS REFLECT REVENUES EARNED IN EXCESS OF BILLINGS ON

OUR LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO CONSTRUCT TECHNICALLY COMPLEX EQUIPMENT (SUCH AS

POWER GENERATION, AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND AERODERIVATIVE UNITS) AND LONG-TERM

PRODUCT MAINTENANCE OR EXTENDED WARRANTY ARRANGEMENTS. OUR TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS

AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, WERE $7.4 BILLION

AND $6.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING THE TIMING OF BILLING IN RELATION TO

WORK PERFORMED, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES AND COSTS.

OUR TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO CUSTOMERS IN OUR ENERGY, AVIATION AND TRANSPORTATION

BUSINESSES. FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

SECTION OF THIS ITEM.

LIQUIDITY

AND BORROWINGS

WE

MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY TO HELP ENSURE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT FUNDING AT ACCEPTABLE

COSTS TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGHOUT BUSINESS

CYCLES. OUR OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS,

INTEREST ON BORROWINGS, PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS FOR INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT AND

GENERAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS COLLATERAL DEPOSITS HELD OR COLLATERAL REQUIRED TO

BE POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES, PAYROLL AND GENERAL EXPENSES. WE RELY ON CASH

GENERATED THROUGH OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS UNSECURED AND SECURED

FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, TERM DEBT, BANK BORROWINGS,

SECURITIZATION AND OTHER RETAIL FUNDING PRODUCTS.

(55)

SOURCES

FOR PAYMENT OF OUR OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED THROUGH OUR ANNUAL FINANCIAL AND

STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES. OUR 2010 FUNDING PLAN ANTICIPATES REPAYMENT OF

PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ($133.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009) THROUGH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES; CASH ON HAND; LONG-TERM DEBT

ISSUANCES; COLLECTIONS OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS; AND

DEPOSIT FUNDING AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING.

INTEREST

ON BORROWINGS IS PRIMARILY FUNDED THROUGH INTEREST EARNED ON EXISTING FINANCING

RECEIVABLES. DURING 2009, GECS EARNED INTEREST INCOME ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

OF $23.4 BILLION, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET INTEREST EXPENSE OF $17.9 BILLION.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER GENERAL OBLIGATIONS ARE FUNDED THROUGH CUSTOMER

SALES REVENUES (INDUSTRIAL) OR COLLECTION OF PRINCIPAL ON OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO

OF LOANS AND LEASES (FINANCIAL SERVICES), CASH ON HAND AND OPERATING CASH

FLOW.

WE

MAINTAIN A STRONG FOCUS ON OUR LIQUIDITY. SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE

HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN AND MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY,

INCLUDING.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $72.3 BILLION AND

COMMITTED CREDIT LINES WERE $51.7 BILLION, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE WERE

MORE THAN TWICE OUR GECS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS BALANCE. WE INTEND TO

MAINTAIN COMMITTED CREDIT LINES AND CASH IN EXCESS OF GECS COMMERCIAL

PAPER BORROWINGS GOING FORWARD.

·

IN

2009, WE REDUCED ENI (EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES) IN

OUR CAPITAL FINANCE BUSINESS BY APPROXIMATELY $53 BILLION, PRIMARILY

THROUGH SLOWING ORIGINATIONS.

·

GECS

COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS WERE $47.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009,

COMPARED WITH $71.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008.

·

WE

HAVE COMPLETED OUR LONG-TERM DEBT FUNDING TARGET OF $38 BILLION FOR 2010,

AND IN 2010 HAVE ISSUED $5.1 BILLION (THROUGH FEBRUARY 15, 2010) TOWARDS

OUR LONG-TERM DEBT FUNDING TARGET FOR

2011.

·

DURING

2009, WE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE OF $23.2 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING

$3.2 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER) THAT IS NOT GUARANTEED UNDER THE

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION’S (FDIC) TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY

GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP).

·

AT

GECS, WE ARE MANAGING COLLECTIONS VERSUS ORIGINATIONS TO HELP SUPPORT

LIQUIDITY NEEDS. IN 2009, COLLECTIONS EXCEEDED ORIGINATIONS BY

APPROXIMATELY $44.0 BILLION.

·

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD ISSUED NOTES FROM OUR SECURITIZATION

PLATFORMS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $14.0 BILLION; $4.3 BILLION OF THESE

NOTES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INVESTORS TO USE AS COLLATERAL UNDER THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK’S TERM ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES LOAN FACILITY

(TALF).

·

IN

FEBRUARY 2009, WE ANNOUNCED THE REDUCTION OF THE QUARTERLY GE STOCK

DIVIDEND BY 68%, FROM $0.31 PER SHARE TO $0.10 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH

THE DIVIDEND APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN JUNE 2009, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE

THIRD QUARTER. THIS REDUCTION HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING CASH OUTFLOWS OF

THE COMPANY BY APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2009 AND

WILL SAVE APPROXIMATELY $9 BILLION ANNUALLY

THEREAFTER.

·

IN

SEPTEMBER 2008, WE REDUCED THE GECS DIVIDEND TO GE AND SUSPENDED OUR STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2009, WE FULLY SUSPENDED THE GECS

DIVIDEND TO GE.

·

IN

OCTOBER 2008, WE RAISED $15 BILLION IN CASH THROUGH COMMON AND PREFERRED

STOCK OFFERINGS AND WE CONTRIBUTED $15 BILLION TO GECS, INCLUDING $9.5

BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 (OF WHICH $8.8 BILLION WAS FURTHER

CONTRIBUTED TO GE CAPITAL THROUGH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND SHARE

ISSUANCE), IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TANGIBLE CAPITAL AND REDUCE

LEVERAGE.

(56)

CASH

AND EQUIVALENTS

WE HAVE

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS OF $72.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH IS AVAILABLE

TO MEET COMPANY NEEDS. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THIS IS FREELY AVAILABLE. ABOUT

$8 BILLION IS IN REGULATED ENTITIES AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

ABOUT $9 BILLION IS HELD OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND IS AVAILABLE TO FUND OPERATIONS

AND OTHER GROWTH OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES; IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO FUND COMPANY

NEEDS IN THE U.S. ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS (WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO U.S. TAX). WE

ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN

THE FUTURE, WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HELP MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS. WE ALSO

GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH FROM THE PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS OF LOANS AND RENTALS

FROM LEASED ASSETS.

WE HAVE

COMMITTED, UNUSED CREDIT LINES TOTALING $51.7 BILLION THAT HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO

US BY 59 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THESE LINES INCLUDE $36.8

BILLION OF REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH WE CAN BORROW FUNDS FOR

PERIODS EXCEEDING ONE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, $14.4 BILLION ARE 364-DAY LINES THAT

CONTAIN A TERM-OUT FEATURE THAT ALLOWS US TO EXTEND BORROWINGS FOR ONE YEAR FROM

THE DATE OF EXPIRATION OF THE LENDING AGREEMENT.

FUNDING

PLAN

IN 2009,

GECS ISSUED $69.7 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING $46.5 BILLION ISSUED

UNDER THE TLGP AND $23.2 BILLION IN NON-GUARANTEED SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT WITH

MATURITIES UP TO 30 YEARS. INCLUDED IN OUR 2009 ISSUANCES IS $38 BILLION THAT

REPRESENTS THE PRE-FUNDING OF OUR 2010 LONG-TERM DEBT FUNDING PLAN. IN 2010, WE

HAVE ISSUED $5.1 BILLION (THROUGH FEBRUARY 15, 2010) TOWARD OUR 2011 LONG-TERM

FUNDING PLAN.

UNDER

THE TLGP, THE FDIC GUARANTEED CERTAIN SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED ON OR BEFORE

OCTOBER 31, 2009. OUR TLGP-GUARANTEED DEBT MATURES IN 2010 ($6 BILLION), 2011

($18 BILLION) AND 2012 ($35 BILLION). WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING OF THESE AND OUR

OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITIES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF NEW DEBT ISSUANCES,

COLLECTIONS EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS, ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES AND USE OF

EXISTING CASH.

WE

CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE EXPIRATION OF THE TLGP WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. IF, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN THE CREDIT

MARKETS WERE TO RETURN OR IF THE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUE, OUR

ABILITY TO ISSUE UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT MAY BE AFFECTED. IN THE EVENT WE

CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCESS OUR NORMAL SOURCES OF FUNDING AS A RESULT OF THE

ONGOING CREDIT MARKET TURMOIL, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO ENHANCE

LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING.

·

CONTROLLING

NEW ORIGINATIONS IN GE CAPITAL TO REDUCE CAPITAL AND FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS

·

USING

PART OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH BALANCE

·

PURSUING

ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING BANK DEPOSITS AND ASSET-BACKED

FUNDINGS

·

USING

OUR BANK CREDIT LINES WHICH, WITH OUR CASH, WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN IN

EXCESS OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL

PAPER

·

GENERATING

ADDITIONAL CASH FROM INDUSTRIAL

OPERATIONS

·

CONTRIBUTING

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM GE TO GE CAPITAL, INCLUDING FROM FUNDS RETAINED AS

A RESULT OF THE REDUCTION IN OUR DIVIDEND ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY 2009 OR

FUTURE DIVIDEND REDUCTIONS

WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING FUNDS, COMBINED WITH OUR ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO ENHANCE

LIQUIDITY, PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MEET OUR NEEDS AND FINANCIAL

OBLIGATIONS.

(57)

WE

MAINTAIN SECURITIZATION CAPABILITY IN MOST OF THE ASSET CLASSES WE HAVE

TRADITIONALLY SECURITIZED. HOWEVER, IN 2008 AND 2009 THESE CAPABILITIES HAVE

BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, MORE LIMITED THAN IN 2007. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO

EXECUTE NEW SECURITIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD USING BANK ADMINISTERED

COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS, AND MORE RECENTLY HAVE EXECUTED NEW SECURITIZATIONS

IN BOTH THE PUBLIC TERM MARKETS AND IN THE PRIVATE MARKETS. IN 2009, WE HAVE

COMPLETED ISSUANCES FROM THESE PLATFORMS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $14.0

BILLION. $4.3 BILLION OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INVESTORS TO USE AS

COLLATERAL UNDER TALF. TOTAL PROCEEDS, INCLUDING SALES TO REVOLVING FACILITIES,

FROM OUR SECURITIZATIONS WERE $18.7 BILLION AND $71.4 BILLION DURING THE THREE

MONTHS AND YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARABLE AMOUNTS FOR

2008 WERE $17.8 BILLION AND $76.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

WE HAVE

DEPOSIT-TAKING CAPABILITY AT 18 BANKS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND TWO BANKS IN THE

U.S. – GE MONEY BANK, A FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK (FSB), AND GE CAPITAL FINANCIAL

INC., AN INDUSTRIAL BANK (IB). THE FSB AND IB CURRENTLY ISSUE CERTIFICATES OF

DEPOSIT (CDS) DISTRIBUTED BY BROKERS IN MATURITY TERMS FROM THREE MONTHS TO TEN

YEARS. BANK DEPOSITS, WHICH ARE A LARGE COMPONENT OF OUR ALTERNATIVE FUNDING,

WERE $38.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, INCLUDING CDS OF $17.7 BILLION. TOTAL

ALTERNATIVE FUNDING INCREASED FROM $55 BILLION TO $57 BILLION DURING 2009,

PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN BANK DEPOSITS MAINLY FROM THE

ACQUISITIONS OF BAC AND INTERBANCA S.P.A., PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PLANNED

REDUCTION IN BANK BORROWINGS.

EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE

RISKS

ARE MANAGED WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MATCH FUNDING

AND SELECTIVE USE OF DERIVATIVES. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND MARKET RISKS BECAUSE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN DIVERSE

MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND LOCAL FUNDING IS NOT ALWAYS EFFICIENT. IN ADDITION,

WE USE DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE DEBT WE ARE ISSUING TO MATCH THE FIXED OR

FLOATING NATURE OF THE ASSETS WE ARE ORIGINATING. WE APPLY STRICT POLICIES TO

MANAGE EACH OF THESE RISKS, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS ON SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES.

FOLLOWING IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES

AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USING SO-CALLED “SHOCK” TESTS THAT MODEL EFFECTS OF

SHIFTS IN RATES. THESE ARE NOT FORECASTS.

·

IT

IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. WE FUND OUR

FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS USING DEBT OR A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS SO THAT THE INTEREST RATES OF OUR BORROWINGS MATCH THE

EXPECTED YIELDS ON OUR ASSETS. TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR POSITIONS,

WE ASSUMED THAT, ON JANUARY 1, 2010, INTEREST RATES INCREASED BY 100 BASIS

POINTS ACROSS THE YIELD CURVE (A “PARALLEL SHIFT” IN THAT CURVE) AND

FURTHER ASSUMED THAT THE INCREASE REMAINED IN PLACE FOR 2010. WE

ESTIMATED, BASED ON THE YEAR-END 2009 PORTFOLIO AND HOLDING ALL OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT, THAT OUR 2010 CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS WOULD

DECLINE BY $0.1 BILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD

CURVE.

·

IT

IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS

EITHER WITHIN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OR USING THE PROTECTION OF HEDGE

STRATEGIES. WE ANALYZED YEAR-END 2009 CONSOLIDATED CURRENCY EXPOSURES,

INCLUDING DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, TO IDENTIFY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THEIR RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES. FOR SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE THEN EVALUATED THE EFFECTS

OF A 10% SHIFT IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THOSE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S.

DOLLAR. THIS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INCONSEQUENTIAL

EFFECT ON 2010 EARNINGS OF SUCH A SHIFT IN EXCHANGE

RATES.

DEBT

INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS

CREDIT

RATINGS

THE

MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY

WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. ON MARCH 12, 2009,

STANDARD & POOR’S (S&P) DOWNGRADED GE AND GE CAPITAL’S LONG-TERM RATING

BY ONE NOTCH FROM “AAA” TO “AA+” AND, AT THE SAME TIME, REVISED THE OUTLOOK FROM

NEGATIVE TO STABLE. UNDER S&P’S DEFINITIONS, AN OBLIGATION RATED “AAA” HAS

THE HIGHEST RATING ASSIGNED BY S&P. THE OBLIGOR'S CAPACITY TO MEET ITS

FINANCIAL COMMITMENT ON THE OBLIGATION IS EXTREMELY STRONG. AN OBLIGATION RATED

“AA” DIFFERS FROM AN OBLIGATION RATED “AAA” ONLY TO A SMALL DEGREE IN THAT THE

OBLIGOR'S CAPACITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL COMMITMENT ON THE OBLIGATION IS VERY

STRONG. AN S&P RATING OUTLOOK ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL DIRECTION OF A

LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OVER THE INTERMEDIATE TERM. IN DETERMINING A RATING

OUTLOOK, CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO ANY CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC AND/OR

FUNDAMENTAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS. STABLE MEANS THAT A RATING IS NOT LIKELY TO

CHANGE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO TWO YEARS.

(58)

ON MARCH

23, 2009, MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY’S) DOWNGRADED GE AND GE CAPITAL’S

LONG-TERM RATING BY TWO NOTCHES FROM “AAA” TO “AA2” WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK AND

REMOVED US FROM REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE. UNDER MOODY’S DEFINITIONS,

OBLIGATIONS RATED “AAA” ARE JUDGED TO BE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY, WITH MINIMAL

CREDIT RISK. OBLIGATIONS RATED “AA” ARE JUDGED TO BE OF HIGH QUALITY AND ARE

SUBJECT TO VERY LOW CREDIT RISK.

IN 2009,

THE SHORT-TERM RATINGS OF “A-1+/P-1” WERE AFFIRMED BY BOTH RATING AGENCIES AT

THE SAME TIME WITH RESPECT TO GE, GE CAPITAL SERVICES AND GE CAPITAL. THESE

SHORT-TERM RATINGS ARE IN THE HIGHEST RATING CATEGORIES AVAILABLE FROM S&P

AND MOODY'S. UNDER THE S&P DEFINITIONS, A SHORT-TERM OBLIGATION RATED "A-1+"

INDICATES THAT THE OBLIGOR'S CAPACITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL COMMITMENT IS

EXTREMELY STRONG. UNDER THE MOODY'S DEFINITIONS, AN ISSUER THAT IS RATED "P-1"

HAS A SUPERIOR ABILITY TO REPAY SHORT-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

WE DO

NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DOWNGRADES BY S&P AND MOODY’S HAVE HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON OUR COST OF FUNDING OR LIQUIDITY AS THE DOWNGRADES HAD BEEN WIDELY

ANTICIPATED IN THE MARKET AND WERE ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE SPREADS ON OUR

DEBT.

GE, GECS

AND GE CAPITAL HAVE DISTINCT BUSINESS CHARACTERISTICS THAT THE MAJOR DEBT RATING

AGENCIES EVALUATE BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY.

QUANTITATIVE

MEASURES INCLUDE.

·

EARNINGS

AND PROFITABILITY, REVENUE GROWTH, THE BREADTH AND DIVERSITY OF SOURCES OF

INCOME AND RETURN ON ASSETS

·

ASSET

QUALITY, INCLUDING DELINQUENCY AND WRITE-OFF RATIOS AND RESERVE

COVERAGE

·

FUNDING

AND LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES,

LEVERAGE RATIOS SUCH AS DEBT-TO-CAPITAL, RETAINED CASH FLOW TO DEBT,

MARKET ACCESS, BACK-UP LIQUIDITY FROM BANKS AND OTHER SOURCES, COMPOSITION

OF TOTAL DEBT AND INTEREST COVERAGE

·

CAPITAL

ADEQUACY, INCLUDING REQUIRED CAPITAL AND TANGIBLE LEVERAGE

RATIOS

QUALITATIVE

MEASURES INCLUDE.

·

FRANCHISE

STRENGTH, INCLUDING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND

POSITION

·

STRENGTH

OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING EXPERIENCE, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND STRATEGIC

THINKING

·

FINANCIAL

REPORTING QUALITY, INCLUDING CLARITY, COMPLETENESS AND TRANSPARENCY OF ALL

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

COMMUNICATIONS

PRINCIPAL DEBT CONDITIONS

ARE

DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE

FOLLOWING CONDITIONS RELATE TO GE AND GECS.

·

SWAP,

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE EXECUTED UNDER STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS

THAT TYPICALLY CONTAIN MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE

ABILITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT

RATING OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3. IN CERTAIN OF

THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS, THE COUNTERPARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE

TERMINATION IF THE SHORT-TERM RATING OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO

FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. THE NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITY AFTER CONSIDERATION OF

NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTED BY US UNDER THESE MASTER

AGREEMENTS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $1.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. SEE NOTE

22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

(59)

·

IF

GE CAPITAL'S RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES WERE TO DETERIORATE TO

BELOW 1.10:1, GE HAS COMMITTED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL. SEE INCOME

MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT SECTION OF THIS ITEM FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. GE ALSO

GUARANTEED CERTAIN ISSUANCES OF GECS SUBORDINATED DEBT HAVING A FACE

AMOUNT OF $0.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008.

·

IN

CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FOR WHICH GECC RECEIVES

EQUITY CREDIT BY RATING AGENCIES, GE HAS AGREED TO PROMPTLY RETURN TO GECC

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS OR OTHER PAYMENTS IT RECEIVES FROM GECC DURING

EVENTS OF DEFAULT OR INTEREST DEFERRAL PERIODS UNDER SUCH SUBORDINATED

DEBENTURES. THERE WERE $7.6 BILLION OF SUCH DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS

FORM 10-K REPORT.

THE

FOLLOWING CONDITIONS RELATE TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.

·

IF

THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL OR CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES WERE TO BE REDUCED BELOW A-1/P-1, GE CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE LIQUIDITY FOR THOSE ENTITIES OR PROVIDE FUNDS TO RETIRE

THE OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT GE CAPITAL

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS

DETERMINED BY CONTRACT, AND AMOUNTED TO $2.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

SEE NOTE 23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

“FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

·

ONE

GROUP OF CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HOLDS INVESTMENT SECURITIES FUNDED BY THE

ISSUANCE OF GICS. IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO

FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW

A-1+/P-1, GE CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY $2.4

BILLION TO SUCH ENTITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, PURSUANT TO LETTERS OF

CREDIT ISSUED BY GE CAPITAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ENTITIES’ LIABILITIES

EXCEED THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THEIR ASSETS

AND THE AMOUNT DRAWN UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT, GE CAPITAL COULD BE

REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUCH EXCESS AMOUNT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE VALUE

OF THESE ENTITIES’ LIABILITIES WAS $8.5 BILLION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

THEIR ASSETS WAS $7.3 BILLION (WHICH INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON

INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $1.4 BILLION). WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, WE INTEND TO HOLD THEM AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEIR

INDIVIDUAL FAIR VALUES EXCEED THEIR AMORTIZED COST AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY

TO HOLD ALL SUCH DEBT SECURITIES UNTIL

MATURITY.

·

ANOTHER

CONSOLIDATED ENTITY ALSO ISSUES GICS WHERE PROCEEDS ARE LOANED TO GE

CAPITAL. IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO FALL BELOW

AA-/AA3 OR ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GE

CAPITAL COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UP TO APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, TO REPAY HOLDERS OF GICS. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE

INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION.

·

IF

THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE REDUCED BELOW A-1/P-1, GE

CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PARTIALLY CASH COLLATERALIZE CERTAIN COVERED

BONDS. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED IN THE

EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS DETERMINED BY CONTRACT AND AMOUNTED TO $0.8

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION.

RATIO

OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

AS SET

FORTH IN EXHIBIT 99(E) HERETO, GE CAPITAL’S RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

DECLINED TO 0.85:1 DURING 2009 DUE TO LOWER PRE-TAX EARNINGS AT GE CAPITAL,

WHICH WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING

RECEIVABLES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT.

(60)

INCOME

MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT

ON MARCH

28, 1991, GE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH GE CAPITAL TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO GE

CAPITAL, CONSTITUTING ADDITIONS TO PRE-TAX INCOME UNDER THE AGREEMENT, TO THE

EXTENT NECESSARY TO CAUSE THE RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES OF GE CAPITAL

AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (DETERMINED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS) TO BE NOT LESS

THAN 1.10:1 FOR THE PERIOD, AS A SINGLE AGGREGATION, OF EACH GE CAPITAL FISCAL

YEAR COMMENCING WITH FISCAL YEAR 1991. ON OCTOBER 29, 2009, GE AND GE CAPITAL

AMENDED THIS AGREEMENT (WHICH IS FILED AS EXHIBIT 10(V) HERETO) TO EXTEND THE

NOTICE PERIOD FOR TERMINATION FROM THREE YEARS TO FIVE YEARS. IT WAS FURTHER

AMENDED TO PROVIDE THAT ANY FUTURE AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT THAT COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITAL REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE HOLDERS

OF THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT

SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY GE CAPITAL (WITH AN ORIGINAL STATED MATURITY

IN EXCESS OF 270 DAYS), UNLESS THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT TRIGGER A DOWNGRADE OF GE

CAPITAL’S LONG-TERM RATINGS.

GE MADE

A $9.5 BILLION PAYMENT TO GECS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 (OF WHICH $8.8

BILLION WAS FURTHER CONTRIBUTED TO GE CAPITAL THROUGH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND

SHARE ISSUANCE) TO IMPROVE TANGIBLE CAPITAL AND REDUCE LEVERAGE. THIS PAYMENT

CONSTITUTES AN ADDITION TO PRE-TAX INCOME UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND THEREFORE

INCREASED THE RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES OF GE CAPITAL FOR THE FISCAL

YEAR 2009 FOR PURPOSES OF THE AGREEMENT TO 1.33:1. AS A RESULT, NO FURTHER

PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN 2010 ARE REQUIRED RELATED TO 2009. SHOULD THIS

RATIO FALL BELOW 1.10:1 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2010, FURTHER PAYMENTS WOULD BE

REQUIRED BY GE TO GE CAPITAL. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO MAKE A PAYMENT FROM GE TO

GE CAPITAL IN 2011 OF ABOUT $2 BILLION PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

ANY

PAYMENT MADE UNDER THE INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT WILL NOT AFFECT THE RATIO OF

EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CURRENT SEC RULES

BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ADDITION TO PRE-TAX INCOME UNDER CURRENT U.S.

GAAP.

TLGP

ON

NOVEMBER 12, 2008, THE FDIC APPROVED GE CAPITAL’S APPLICATION FOR DESIGNATION AS

AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY UNDER THE FDIC’S TLGP. QUALIFYING DEBT ISSUED BY GE CAPITAL

ON OR BEFORE OCTOBER 31, 2009, IS GUARANTEED UNDER THE DEBT GUARANTEE PROGRAM OF

THE TLGP AND IS BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE

FDIC’S GUARANTEE UNDER THE TLGP IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE MATURITY

OF THE DEBT OR DECEMBER 31, 2012. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, GE CAPITAL HAD ISSUED

AND OUTSTANDING, $59.3 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT THAT WAS GUARANTEED BY

THE FDIC UNDER THE TLGP. WE HAVE INCURRED $2.3 BILLION OF FEES FOR OUR

PARTICIPATION IN THE TLGP THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009. THESE FEES ARE AMORTIZED

INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERMS OF THE RELATED BORROWINGS. GE CAPITAL AND

GE ARE PARTIES TO AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY DESIGNATION AGREEMENT AND GE CAPITAL IS

SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF A MASTER AGREEMENT, EACH ENTERED INTO WITH THE FDIC. THE

TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A REQUIREMENT THAT GE AND

GE CAPITAL REIMBURSE THE FDIC FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT THE FDIC PAYS TO HOLDERS OF

GE CAPITAL DEBT THAT IS GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC.

CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY

GE

SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY INCREASED BY $12.6 BILLION IN 2009, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE

OF $10.9 BILLION IN 2008 AND AN INCREASE OF $4.1 BILLION IN 2007.

NET

EARNINGS INCREASED GE SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY BY $11.0 BILLION, $17.4 BILLION AND

$22.2 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF $6.8 BILLION, $12.6

BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION IN 2009, 2008, 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

ELEMENTS

OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INCREASED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $6.7 BILLION IN

2009, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF $30.2 BILLION IN 2008 AND AN INCREASE OF $4.9

BILLION IN 2007, INCLUSIVE OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPONENTS

OF THESE CHANGES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

(61)

·

CHANGES

IN BENEFIT PLANS REDUCED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $1.8 BILLION IN 2009,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO VALUE PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THIS COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF

$13.3 BILLION AND AN INCREASE OF $2.6 BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN 2008 PRIMARILY RELATED TO DECLINES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AS A RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND ADVERSE

CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN

BENEFIT PLANS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

·

CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS INCREASED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $4.1 BILLION IN

2009, DECREASED EQUITY BY $11.0 BILLION IN 2008 AND INCREASED EQUITY BY

$4.5 BILLION IN 2007. CHANGES IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS REFLECT

THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT HAVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S.

DOLLAR. AT THE END OF 2009, THE U.S. DOLLAR WAS WEAKER AGAINST MOST MAJOR

CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE POUND STERLING, THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND THE

EURO, COMPARED WITH A STRONGER DOLLAR AGAINST THOSE CURRENCIES AT THE END

OF 2008 AND A WEAKER DOLLAR AGAINST THOSE CURRENCIES AT THE END OF 2007.

THE DOLLAR WAS WEAKER AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN IN 2008 AND

2007.

·

THE

CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES INCREASED SHAREOWNERS’

EQUITY BY $2.7 BILLION IN 2009, REFLECTING IMPROVED MARKET CONDITIONS

RELATED TO SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE, PRIMARILY

CORPORATE DEBT AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES DECREASED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $3.2 BILLION AND

$1.5 BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

INVESTMENT SECURITIES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

·

CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES INCREASED

SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $1.6 BILLION IN 2009, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

EFFECT OF HIGHER U.S. INTEREST RATES ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND LOWER

FOREIGN RATES ON CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES DECREASED EQUITY BY $2.7

BILLION AND $0.5 BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 22 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

AS

DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY IN THE LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS SECTION OF THIS ITEM, WE

TOOK A NUMBER OF ACTIONS IN 2008 AND 2009 TO STRENGTHEN OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR

CREDIT RATING. SUCH ACTIONS ALSO HAD AN EFFECT ON SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY, WHICH

INCLUDED A $15 BILLION ADDITION TO EQUITY THROUGH COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK

OFFERINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 AND REDUCTION IN THE DIVIDEND ON GE

STOCK, WHICH HAD A $4 BILLION POSITIVE EFFECT ON EQUITY IN 2009.

OVERVIEW

OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM 2007 THROUGH 2009

CONSOLIDATED

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $72.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AN INCREASE OF

$24.1 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $48.2 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AN INCREASE OF $32.5 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31,

2007.

WE

EVALUATE OUR CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE BY REVIEWING OUR INDUSTRIAL (NON-FINANCIAL

SERVICES) BUSINESSES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES SEPARATELY. CASH FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES (CFOA) IS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH GENERATION FOR OUR

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES ALSO HAVE LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE

VIA THE PUBLIC CAPITAL MARKETS. OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES USE A VARIETY

OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS. CASH FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES

BUSINESSES IS PRIMARILY PROVIDED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKETS, AS WELL AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES

COLLECTIONS, SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS.

GE

CASH FLOW

GE CASH

AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $8.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $12.1

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. GE CFOA TOTALED $16.6 BILLION IN 2009 COMPARED

WITH $19.1 BILLION AND $23.3 BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. WITH

RESPECT TO GE CFOA, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS USEFUL TO SUPPLEMENT OUR GE STATEMENT

OF CASH FLOWS AND TO EXAMINE IN A BROADER CONTEXT THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT

PROVIDE AND REQUIRE CASH.

(A)

GE

SELLS CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES TO GECS IN PART TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN RESULT IN CASH GENERATION OR

CASH USE. DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, GE RECEIVES CASH FROM THE SALE OF

RECEIVABLES TO GECS. IT ALSO FOREGOES COLLECTION OF CASH ON RECEIVABLES

SOLD. THE INCREMENTAL AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED FROM SALE OF RECEIVABLES IN

EXCESS OF THE CASH GE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE COLLECTED HAD THOSE RECEIVABLES

NOT BEEN SOLD, REPRESENTS THE CASH GENERATED OR USED IN THE PERIOD

RELATING TO THIS ACTIVITY. THE INCREMENTAL CASH GENERATED IN GE CFOA FROM

SELLING THESE RECEIVABLES TO GECS INCREASED GE CFOA BY AN INSIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 26 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. "FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA" FOR THIS FORM 10-K REPORT FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN GE AND GECS.

THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CASH IN GE CFOA IS CUSTOMER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, THE

LARGEST OF WHICH IS COLLECTING CASH FOLLOWING A PRODUCT OR SERVICES SALE. GE

OPERATING CASH COLLECTIONS DECREASED BY $11.4 BILLION IN 2009 AND INCREASED BY

$12.7 BILLION IN 2008. THESE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN

COMPARABLE GE OPERATING SEGMENT REVENUES. ANALYSES OF OPERATING SEGMENT REVENUES

DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING SEGMENT OPERATIONS SECTION ARE THE BEST WAY OF

UNDERSTANDING THEIR CUSTOMER-RELATED CFOA.

THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT OPERATING USE OF CASH IS TO PAY OUR SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, TAX

AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES. GE OPERATING

CASH PAYMENTS DECREASED IN 2009 BY $11.3 BILLION AND INCREASED BY $12.0 BILLION

IN 2008. THESE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN GE TOTAL COSTS AND

EXPENSES.

GE CFOA

DECREASED $2.5 BILLION COMPARED WITH 2008, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE LACK OF A

CURRENT-YEAR DIVIDEND FROM GECS ($2.4 BILLION). IN 2008, GE CFOA DECREASED $4.2

BILLION COMPARED WITH 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN THE DIVIDEND FROM

GECS OF $4.9 BILLION.

DIVIDENDS

FROM GECS REPRESENTED THE DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTION OF GECS RETAINED EARNINGS

AND ARE DISTINCT FROM CASH FROM CONTINUING OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN GE CFOA ARE THE TOTAL

DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING NORMAL DIVIDENDS AS WELL AS ANY SPECIAL DIVIDENDS FROM

EXCESS CAPITAL, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM GECS BUSINESS SALES. BEGINNING IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, GECS FULLY SUSPENDED ITS NORMAL DIVIDEND TO

GE.

GECS

CASH FLOW

GECS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $64.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH

$37.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. GECS CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED

$7.6 BILLION IN 2009, COMPARED WITH CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $31.2

BILLION IN 2008. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN OVERALL DECLINE IN NET

EARNINGS, A CURRENT-YEAR REDUCTION IN CASH COLLATERAL HELD FROM COUNTERPARTIES

ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS OF $6.9 BILLION AND DECLINES IN TAXES PAYABLE ($2.7

BILLION). IN ADDITION, 2008 GECS CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES BENEFITED FROM

AN INCREASE IN CASH COLLATERAL POSTED BY COUNTERPARTIES.

CONSISTENT

WITH OUR PLAN TO REDUCE GECS ASSET LEVELS, CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS

$45.7 BILLION IN 2009; $44.0 BILLION RESULTED FROM A REDUCTION IN FINANCING

RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY FROM COLLECTIONS EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS AND $9.1 BILLION

RESULTED FROM PROCEEDS FROM BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS, INCLUDING THE CONSUMER

BUSINESSES IN AUSTRIA AND FINLAND, THE CREDIT CARD AND AUTO BUSINESSES IN THE

U.K., THE CREDIT CARD BUSINESS IN IRELAND, A PORTION OF OUR AUSTRALIAN

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BUSINESS AND THE THAILAND BUSINESS. THESE SOURCES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF $5.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY FOR

THE ACQUISITION OF INTERBANCA S.P.A.

GECS

CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 REFLECTED OUR CONTINUED REDUCTION IN

ENDING NET INVESTMENT. CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $26.4 BILLION

RELATED PRIMARILY TO A $26.9 BILLION REDUCTION IN BORROWINGS (MATURITIES 90 DAYS

OR LESS), PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL PAPER, REDUCTIONS IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PRE-FUNDING OF OUR 2010 LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITIES, AND A

$4.0 BILLION DECREASE IN BANK DEPOSITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CAPITAL

CONTRIBUTION FROM GE TO GECS OF $9.5 BILLION.

(63)

GECS

PAYS DIVIDENDS TO GE THROUGH A DISTRIBUTION OF ITS RETAINED EARNINGS, INCLUDING

SPECIAL DIVIDENDS FROM PROCEEDS OF CERTAIN BUSINESS SALES. THERE WERE NO

DIVIDENDS PAID TO GE IN 2009 COMPARED WITH $2.4 BILLION AND $7.3 BILLION IN 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WERE NO SPECIAL DIVIDENDS PAID TO GE IN 2009 AND

2008, COMPARED WITH $2.4 BILLION IN 2007.

INCLUDED

PAYMENTS FOR OTHER LIABILITIES.

VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE

SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO IMPROVE SHAREOWNER RETURNS AND AS AN

ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING. THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WE ENGAGE IN ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED USING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES), PRINCIPALLY

QSPES.

(64)

CERTAIN

OF OUR VIES ARE CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE WE ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF THE ENTITY. OUR INTERESTS IN OTHER VIES FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND QSPES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES,

FINANCING RECEIVABLES OR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF

OUR INVOLVEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE $17.0 BILLION AND $15.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, A

DECREASE OF $9.9 BILLION AND $6.2 BILLION FROM 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009, WE DECONSOLIDATED PTL AND REMOVED $7.0 BILLION OF ASSETS AND

$0.8 BILLION OF LIABILITIES FROM OUR BALANCE SHEET. THE DECONSOLIDATION WAS A

RESULT OF OUR REDUCING OUR INVESTMENT IN PTL BY SELLING A 1% LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

INTEREST TO PENSKE TRUCK LEASING CORPORATION, THE GENERAL PARTNER OF PTL, WHOSE

MAJORITY SHAREOWNER IS A MEMBER OF GE’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COUPLED WITH OUR

RESULTING MINORITY POSITION ON THE PTL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND RELATED CHANGES IN

OUR CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS. WE RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF $0.3

BILLION, INCLUDING A GAIN ON THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR RETAINED INVESTMENT OF

$0.2 BILLION.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, VARIABLE INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED VIES OTHER THAN QSPES

WERE $9.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $5.7 BILLION FROM 2008, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PTL. IN ADDITION TO OUR EXISTING INVESTMENTS, WE HAVE

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO FUND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE UNCONSOLIDATED

VIES OF $1.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $0.2 BILLION FROM 2008. TOGETHER, THESE

REPRESENT OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IF THE ASSETS OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES

WERE TO HAVE NO VALUE.

QSPES

THAT WE USE FOR SECURITIZATION ARE FUNDED WITH ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

TERM DEBT. THE ASSETS WE SECURITIZE INCLUDE: RECEIVABLES SECURED BY EQUIPMENT,

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, FLOORPLAN INVENTORY

RECEIVABLES, GE TRADE RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS ORIGINATED AND UNDERWRITTEN

BY US IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES HELD $46.9 BILLION IN TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS, A DECREASE OF $5.7

BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2008. ASSETS HELD BY THESE ENTITIES ARE OF EQUIVALENT

CREDIT QUALITY TO OUR ON-BOOK ASSETS. WE MONITOR THE UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY

IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR ROLE AS SERVICER AND APPLY RIGOROUS CONTROLS TO THE

EXECUTION OF SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CREDIT AND

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT DISCUSSED BELOW, INVESTORS IN THESE ENTITIES HAVE RECOURSE

ONLY TO THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION INCLUDED $11.8 BILLION IN

RETAINED INTERESTS RELATED TO THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE HELD BY QSPES AND VIES FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND TAKE TWO FORMS: (1) SELLERS’ INTERESTS, WHICH ARE

CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES, AND (2) SUBORDINATED INTERESTS, DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT TO SENIOR INTERESTS, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED

AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES WAS $3.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, A DECREASE

OF  $1.2 BILLION FROM 2008. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RETAINED

INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES WAS $8.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, AN INCREASE OF $2.5 BILLION FROM 2008. CERTAIN OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. DURING 2009,

WE RECOGNIZED INCREASES IN FAIR VALUES ON THESE RETAINED INTERESTS OF $0.3

BILLION COMPARED WITH DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE ON THESE RETAINED INTERESTS OF $0.1

BILLION IN 2008. FOR THOSE RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, WE RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $0.1 BILLION IN

2009, COMPARED WITH $0.3 BILLION IN 2008. OUR RECOURSE LIABILITY IN THESE

ARRANGEMENTS WAS AN INCONSEQUENTIAL AMOUNT IN BOTH 2009 AND 2008.

WE ARE

PARTY TO VARIOUS CREDIT ENHANCEMENT POSITIONS WITH SECURITIZATION ENTITIES,

INCLUDING LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEE AND

REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS, AND HAVE PROVIDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE

OF ESTIMATED LOSSES ON SUCH POSITIONS. THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON

PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. SHOULD MARKET CONDITIONS

DETERIORATE, ACTUAL LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER. OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS UNDER SUCH

AGREEMENTS WAS LIMITED TO $2.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

WE DO

NOT HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY VIE OR QSPE. WE DID NOT PROVIDE

NON-CONTRACTUAL SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY TRANSFERRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES TO ANY

VIE OR QSPE IN EITHER 2009 OR 2008.

(65)

IN 2009,

THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2009-16 AND ASU 2009-17 AMENDMENTS TO ASC 860,

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING

, AND

ASC 810,

CONSOLIDATION

,

RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JANUARY 1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 WILL

ELIMINATE THE QSPE CONCEPT, AND ASU 2009-17 WILL REQUIRE THAT ALL SUCH ENTITIES

BE EVALUATED FOR CONSOLIDATION AS VIES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN OUR CONSOLIDATING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FORMER QSPES. UPON ADOPTION WE WILL RECORD ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AT CARRYING AMOUNTS CONSISTENT AS IF THEY HAD

ALWAYS BEEN CONSOLIDATED, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE REVERSAL OF A PORTION OF

PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SECURITIZATION GAINS AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO

RETAINED EARNINGS. SEE THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SECTION OF THIS ITEM FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE THAT WE CONSIDER

TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE

THEY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY OF THESE ESTIMATES

INCLUDE DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES REFLECT OUR BEST JUDGMENT

ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND

THEIR EFFECTS BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. IF THESE CONDITIONS CHANGE FROM THOSE EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD CHANGE, WHICH

MAY RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES

AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES,

ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX

LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER EFFECTS. ALSO SEE NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES THAT WE HAVE SELECTED FROM ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES.

LOSSES ON FINANCING

RECEIVABLES

ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO

MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THIS

ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR

CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT

OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY

RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL

VALUES, AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK

EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS, AND WE EVALUATE RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR

INDIVIDUAL LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS

APPROPRIATE.

FURTHER

INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION AND FINANCIAL

RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY – FINANCING RECEIVABLES SECTION OF THIS ITEM, THE ASSET

IMPAIRMENT SECTION THAT FOLLOWS AND IN NOTES 1 AND 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM

PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS

REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF PROFITS OVER THE

MULTIPLE-YEAR TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENTS, CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE

FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF FUTURE MONITORING, MAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL EVENTS; THE

AMOUNT OF PERSONNEL, SPARE PARTS AND OTHER RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE

SERVICES; AND FUTURE BILLING RATE AND COST CHANGES. WE ROUTINELY REVIEW

ESTIMATES UNDER PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS AND REGULARLY REVISE THEM TO ADJUST

FOR CHANGES IN OUTLOOK. WE ALSO REGULARLY ASSESS CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK INHERENT

IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED

EARNINGS, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT CONTRACTUAL PENALTIES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO

OFFSET OUR ACCUMULATED INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF CUSTOMER TERMINATION. WE GAIN

INSIGHT INTO FUTURE UTILIZATION AND COST TRENDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT RISK, THROUGH

OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE CLOSE INTERACTION WITH

OUR CUSTOMERS THAT COMES WITH SUPPLYING CRITICAL SERVICES AND PARTS OVER

EXTENDED PERIODS. REVISIONS THAT AFFECT A PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENT’S TOTAL

ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY RESULT IN AN ADJUSTMENT OF EARNINGS; SUCH ADJUSTMENTS

INCREASED EARNINGS BY $0.2 BILLION IN 2009, DECREASED EARNINGS BY $0.2 BILLION

IN 2008 AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY $0.4 BILLION IN 2007. WE PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE

LOSSES WHEN THEY BECOME EVIDENT.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENT

INVOLVES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENTS.

WE REGULARLY

REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2009, THE FASB AMENDED ASC 320 AND

MODIFIED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT FOR DEBT SECURITIES. IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY AND IT

IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE

RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO

DETERMINE WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND

SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE

WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE

DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR CRITERIA INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND

MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION.

OUR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INVOLVE OUR FINANCE, RISK AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGERS. SEE NOTE 21 IN PART

II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT

SECURITIES.

FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IS PROVIDED IN THE

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY – INVESTMENT SECURITIES SECTION OF THIS ITEM

AND IN NOTES 1, 3 AND 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

WE REVIEW

LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING

WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED TYPICALLY REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DETERMINING WHICH UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE DIRECTLY

RELATED TO THE POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED ASSET, THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS

WILL OCCUR, THEIR AMOUNT, AND THE ASSET’S RESIDUAL VALUE, IF ANY. IN TURN,

MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS REQUIRES A DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH

IS BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE. WE DERIVE THE REQUIRED UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FROM OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS

PLANS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, OUR

INTERNAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATE AND

INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE.

OUR

OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION

OF ASSETS IN CAPITAL FINANCE, AND IS PARTICULARLY SUBJECT TO MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS. THEREFORE, WE TEST RECOVERABILITY OF EACH AIRCRAFT IN OUR

OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO AT LEAST ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, WE PERFORM QUARTERLY

EVALUATIONS IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN AIRCRAFT ARE RE-LEASED, CURRENT LEASE

TERMS HAVE CHANGED OR A SPECIFIC LESSEE’S CREDIT STANDING CHANGES. WE CONSIDER

MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS GLOBAL DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES OF

FUTURE RENTALS AND RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND

INFORMATION RECEIVED ROUTINELY FROM INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS. ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS

FROM FUTURE LEASES ARE REDUCED FOR EXPECTED DOWNTIME BETWEEN LEASES AND FOR

ESTIMATED TECHNICAL COSTS REQUIRED TO PREPARE AIRCRAFT TO BE REDEPLOYED. FAIR

VALUE USED TO MEASURE IMPAIRMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATE. IN

DETERMINING ITS BEST ESTIMATE, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES AVERAGE CURRENT MARKET

VALUES (OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES) OF SIMILAR TYPE AND AGE AIRCRAFT, WHICH ARE

ADJUSTED FOR THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT UNDER LEASE.

WE

RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT OF $0.1 BILLION IN BOTH 2009 AND 2008. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON

FINANCING RECEIVABLES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT WERE $0.1 BILLION IN 2009

AND INSIGNIFICANT IN 2008.

FURTHER

INFORMATION ON IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AND OUR EXPOSURE TO THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION

INDUSTRY IS PROVIDED IN THE OPERATIONS – OVERVIEW SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN

NOTES 7 AND 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

“FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

(67)

REAL ESTATE.

WE REVIEW THE

ESTIMATED VALUE OF OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE

CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED FOR BOTH ESTIMATING VALUE AND THE RECOVERABILITY

ANALYSIS ARE INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL, AND REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE

PROFILES, AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTAL,

OCCUPANCY AND CAPITALIZATION RATES AND EXPECTED BUSINESS PLANS, WHICH INCLUDE

OUR ESTIMATED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE ASSET. OUR PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED, BOTH

GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY ASSET TYPE. HOWEVER, THE GLOBAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IS

SUBJECT TO PERIODIC CYCLES THAT CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET

VALUES. AS OF OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATE PERFORMED IN 2009, THE CARRYING VALUE OF

OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THEIR ESTIMATED VALUE BY ABOUT $7 BILLION.

THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO REFLECTS THE CONTINUED DETERIORATING REAL

ESTATE VALUES AND MARKET FUNDAMENTALS, INCLUDING REDUCED MARKET OCCUPANCY RATES

AND MARKET RENTS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF LIMITED REAL ESTATE MARKET LIQUIDITY.

GIVEN THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS, THERE CONTINUES TO

BE RISK AND UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES AND OUR

UNREALIZED LOSS ON REAL ESTATE EQUITY PROPERTIES MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE.

DECLINES IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF REAL ESTATE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT RESULT IN

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WHEN THE AGGREGATE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED IN

THE ESTIMATED VALUE MEASUREMENT ARE BELOW THE CARRYING AMOUNT. AS SUCH,

ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN RECOGNIZED

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT, THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED

BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET, WHICH IS BASED UPON CURRENT

MARKET DATA, INCLUDING CURRENT CAPITALIZATION RATES. DURING 2009, CAPITAL

FINANCE REAL ESTATE RECOGNIZED PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENTS OF $0.8 BILLION IN ITS REAL

ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT, AS COMPARED TO $0.3 BILLION IN 2008. CONTINUED

DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR PROLONGED MARKET ILLIQUIDITY MAY RESULT

IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENTS BEING RECOGNIZED. FURTHERMORE, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND

UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO FORECASTED VALUATION TRENDS, ESPECIALLY IN ILLIQUID

MARKETS, RESULTS IN INHERENT IMPRECISION IN REAL ESTATE VALUE ESTIMATES. FURTHER

INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND

IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

“FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND MORE

FREQUENTLY IF CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUES FOR EACH OF THE

REPORTING UNITS USING AN INCOME APPROACH. WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE, WE

USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW RESULTS.

FOR PURPOSES OF THE INCOME APPROACH, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE

PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE

RISK-ADJUSTED RATE. WE USE OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM FUTURE GROWTH RATES BASED ON OUR MOST

RECENT VIEWS OF THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EACH BUSINESS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY

DIFFER FROM THOSE ASSUMED IN OUR FORECASTS. WE DERIVE OUR DISCOUNT RATES BY

APPLYING THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL (I.E., TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY

FINANCING) AND ANALYZING PUBLISHED RATES FOR INDUSTRIES RELEVANT TO OUR

REPORTING UNITS. WE USE DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND IN OUR INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED FORECASTS. VALUATIONS USING THE MARKET APPROACH REFLECT PRICES AND

OTHER RELEVANT OBSERVABLE INFORMATION GENERATED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

COMPARABLE BUSINESSES.

COMPARED

TO THE MARKET APPROACH, THE INCOME APPROACH MORE CLOSELY ALIGNS THE REPORTING

UNIT VALUATION TO A COMPANY’S OR BUSINESS’ SPECIFIC BUSINESS MODEL, GEOGRAPHIC

MARKETS AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AS IT IS BASED ON SPECIFIC PROJECTIONS OF THE

BUSINESS. REQUIRED RATES OF RETURN, ALONG WITH UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE

FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ARE REFLECTED IN THE SELECTION OF THE DISCOUNT

RATE. EQUALLY IMPORTANT, UNDER THIS APPROACH, REASONABLY LIKELY SCENARIOS AND

ASSOCIATED SENSITIVITIES CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR ALTERNATIVE FUTURE CIRCUMSTANCES

THAT MAY NOT BE REFLECTED IN AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE. A MARKET APPROACH

ALLOWS FOR COMPARISON TO ACTUAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND MULTIPLES. IT CAN BE

SOMEWHAT MORE LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATION BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF POTENTIAL

COMPARABLES (OR PURE PLAYS) IS OFTEN LIMITED TO PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES WHERE

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPARATIVE BUSINESS AND OURS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY

DIFFERENT, MARKET DATA IS USUALLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR DIVISIONS WITHIN LARGER

CONGLOMERATES OR NON-PUBLIC SUBSIDIARIES THAT COULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY AS

COMPARABLE, AND THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING A MARKET TRANSACTION

(E.G., SYNERGIES BETWEEN THE PARTIES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TRANSACTION,

ETC.) MAY BE DIFFERENT OR IRRELEVANT WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS. IT CAN ALSO

BE DIFFICULT UNDER THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS TO IDENTIFY ORDERLY

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN SIMILAR FINANCIAL SERVICES

BUSINESSES. WE ASSESS THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY BASED UPON THE RELEVANCE AND

AVAILABILITY OF DATA AT THE TIME OF PERFORMING THE VALUATION AND WEIGHT THE

METHODOLOGIES APPROPRIATELY.

(68)

GIVEN

THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 AND

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AT THAT TIME, WE CONDUCTED

AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF THE CAPITAL FINANCE REPORTING UNITS DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 USING DATA AS OF JANUARY 1, 2009. AS A RESULT OF THESE

TESTS, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

WE

PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AT ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS

IN THE THIRD QUARTER USING DATA AS OF JULY 1, 2009. IN PERFORMING THE

VALUATIONS, WE USED CASH FLOWS, WHICH REFLECTED MANAGEMENT’S FORECASTS AND

DISCOUNT RATES WHICH REFLECT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT MARKET. BASED

ON THE RESULTS OF OUR TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES AT EACH OF THE GE INDUSTRIAL

REPORTING UNITS AND THE CLL, CONSUMER, ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GECAS

REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR BOOK VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE

IMPAIRMENT TEST (IN WHICH FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IS MEASURED) WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED AND NO GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED. DUE TO THE VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

CURRENT COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT, WE USED A RANGE OF VALUATIONS TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE FOR OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT. WHILE THE REAL

ESTATE REPORTING UNIT’S BOOK VALUE WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF ITS FAIR VALUE, WE

FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED OUR REAL ESTATE GOODWILL BALANCE BY PERFORMING THE SECOND

STEP ANALYSIS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AS A RESULT OF OUR TESTS FOR REAL ESTATE, NO

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED. OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT HAD A

GOODWILL BALANCE OF $1.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

ESTIMATING

THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS INVOLVES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING

RESULTS. IF CURRENT CONDITIONS CHANGE FROM THOSE EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

WE

REVIEW IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINED USEFUL LIVES AND SUBJECT TO

AMORTIZATION FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS OCCURRED REQUIRES COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT TO THE SUM OF

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. WE TEST

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR

VALUE METHOD SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FOR OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES

REMAINING IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WE PERIODICALLY TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT OUR

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS AND PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS.

FURTHER

INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY – GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN NOTES 1 AND 8 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS

ARE

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE ACTUARIAL MODELS THAT MEASURE PENSION BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED EFFECTS ON OPERATIONS. TWO ASSUMPTIONS – DISCOUNT RATE

AND EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS – ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF PLAN EXPENSE AND

ASSET/LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST

ANNUALLY ON A PLAN AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC BASIS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, SUCH AS RETIREMENT AGE, MORTALITY AND

TURNOVER, AND UPDATE THEM TO REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE

FUTURE. ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WILL OFTEN DIFFER FROM ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

ACCUMULATED

AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE

CASH PAYMENTS. WE DISCOUNT THOSE CASH PAYMENTS USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF

MARKET-OBSERVED YIELDS FOR HIGH QUALITY FIXED INCOME SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES

THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. LOWER DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE

PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE; HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES

DECREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE.

OUR

DISCOUNT RATES FOR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND

2007 WERE 5.78%, 6.11% AND 6.34%, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING MARKET INTEREST

RATES.

(69)

TO

DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE

CONSIDER CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND

EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE

RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL BENEFIT PLANS’ ASSETS, WE EVALUATE GENERAL

MARKET TRENDS AS WELL AS KEY ELEMENTS OF ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED

EARNINGS GROWTH, YIELDS AND SPREADS ACROSS A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL SCENARIOS.

ASSETS IN OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS EARNED 10.0% IN 2009, AND HAD AVERAGE

ANNUAL EARNINGS OF  3.1%, 8.5% AND 10.0% PER YEAR IN THE 10-, 15- AND

25-YEAR PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF

FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE, PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT

AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE ASSUMED AN 8.5% LONG-TERM EXPECTED

RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS.

SENSITIVITY

TO CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS

FOLLOWS.

·

DISCOUNT

RATE – A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE PENSION

COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2 BILLION AND WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT YEAR-END BY ABOUT $1.3

BILLION.

·

EXPECTED

RETURN ON ASSETS – A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

ASSETS WOULD INCREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.3

BILLION.

INCOME TAXES

. OUR ANNUAL TAX

RATE IS BASED ON OUR INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES

AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. TAX LAWS ARE

COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS BY THE TAXPAYER AND RESPECTIVE

GOVERNMENTAL TAXING AUTHORITIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING

OUR TAX EXPENSE AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING EVALUATING

UNCERTAINTIES. WE REVIEW OUR TAX POSITIONS QUARTERLY AND ADJUST THE BALANCES AS

NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. OUR INCOME TAX RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED

BY THE TAX RATE ON OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, THIS RATE DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT IS DETERMINED BY

MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT ABOUT AND INTENTIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF

THE COMPANY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, $84 BILLION OF EARNINGS HAVE BEEN

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE

BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO

REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS. DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS

REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN

FUTURE YEARS. SUCH ASSETS ARISE BECAUSE OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS FROM NET

OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF

THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE

EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING

STRATEGIES. THESE SOURCES OF INCOME RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES. WE USE OUR

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR SHORT AND LONG-RANGE BUSINESS FORECASTS TO PROVIDE

INSIGHT. FURTHER, OUR GLOBAL AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO GIVES US THE

OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY VARIOUS PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES TO

FACILITATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF FUTURE DEDUCTIONS. AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATED TO NON-U.S. NET OPERATING LOSSES, NET OF VALUATION

ALLOWANCES, WERE $3.6 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $1.2 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, REPORTED IN ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO OUR LOSS ON THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN. SUCH YEAR-END 2009 AMOUNTS

ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY RECOVERABLE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY EXPIRATION

PERIODS. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A

DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS

ESTABLISHED.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.

WE

USE DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO

INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY PRICES. ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVES AS HEDGES REQUIRES THAT, AT INCEPTION AND OVER THE TERM OF THE

ARRANGEMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND RELATED DERIVATIVE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES

ACCOUNTING ARE COMPLEX. FAILURE TO APPLY THIS COMPLEX GUIDANCE CORRECTLY WILL

RESULT IN ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE BEING REPORTED IN

EARNINGS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGED ITEM.

IN

EVALUATING WHETHER A PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, WE

TEST EFFECTIVENESS AT INCEPTION AND EACH REPORTING PERIOD THEREAFTER BY

DETERMINING WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OFFSET, WITHIN A

SPECIFIED RANGE, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM. IF FAIR VALUE

CHANGES FAIL THIS TEST, WE DISCONTINUE APPLYING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO THAT

RELATIONSHIP PROSPECTIVELY. FAIR VALUES OF BOTH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND

THE HEDGED ITEM ARE CALCULATED USING INTERNAL VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATING

MARKET-BASED ASSUMPTIONS, SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY CONFIRMATION.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE $8.0 BILLION AND

$3.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES IS

PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 9, 21 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EVERY REPORTING PERIOD INCLUDE

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EVERY REPORTING PERIOD BUT THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE LOANS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT

HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE HELD FOR SALE, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT

HAVE BEEN REDUCED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR

VALUE WHEN THEY ARE IMPAIRED AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN

FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN

DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, IF WE SELL A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND RETAIN A

NONCONTROLLING STAKE IN THE ENTITY. ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE

WHEN IMPAIRED AND RETAINED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR

VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

A FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT IS DETERMINED AS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET

OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET

PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE

IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING

ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA,

INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE

IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OFTEN INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS ABOUT

ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE THAT FACTORS IN

BOTH RISK AND LIQUIDITY PREMIUMS, IDENTIFYING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES

IN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, WEIGHTING THOSE DIFFERENCES ACCORDINGLY AND THEN MAKING

THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE MARKET TRANSACTIONS TO REFLECT THE RISKS

SPECIFIC TO OUR ASSET BEING VALUED. FURTHER INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 21 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF

THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES

ARE

RECORDED AS LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED WHEN

THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED

THE RECORDED PROVISION. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE OFTEN RESOLVED OVER LONG TIME

PERIODS. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FORECASTS THAT

OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS

REGULATORS.

NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN 2009,

THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2009-16 AND ASU 2009-17, WHICH AMENDED ASC 860,

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING

, AND

ASC 810,

CONSOLIDATION

,

RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JANUARY 1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 WILL

ELIMINATE THE QSPE CONCEPT, AND ASU 2009-17 WILL REQUIRE THAT ALL SUCH ENTITIES

BE EVALUATED FOR CONSOLIDATION AS VIES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN OUR CONSOLIDATING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FORMER QSPES.

AMONG

OTHER CHANGES, THE AMENDMENTS TO ASC 810 REPLACE THE EXISTING QUANTITATIVE

APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING THE PARTY THAT SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A VIE, WHICH WAS

BASED ON EXPOSURE TO A MAJORITY OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS, WITH A QUALITATIVE

APPROACH, BASED ON DETERMINATION OF WHICH PARTY HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE MOST

ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY. THE REVISED GUIDANCE WILL

SOMETIMES CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF ENTITIES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A VIE

AND THE DETERMINATION ABOUT WHICH PARTY SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A VIE, AS WELL AS

REQUIRING THE LATTER TO BE EVALUATED CONTINUOUSLY.

WE HAVE

EVALUATED ALL ENTITIES THAT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AMENDED ASC 810 TO

DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE OR DECONSOLIDATE THESE

ENTITIES ON JANUARY 1, 2010. IN ADDITION TO THE FORMER QSPES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE

WILL CONSOLIDATE ASSETS OF VIES RELATED TO DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT

HOLD LOANS AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, A MEDIA JOINT VENTURE AND A SMALL NUMBER

OF COMPANIES TO WHICH WE HAVE EXTENDED LOANS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS

AND HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN SUBJECT TO A TROUBLED DEBT

RESTRUCTURING.

UPON

ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2010, WE WILL CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AT THE AMOUNT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAD WE ALWAYS CONSOLIDATED THEM. WE WILL ALSO

DECONSOLIDATE CERTAIN ENTITIES WHERE WE DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY UNDER THE REVISED GUIDANCE, THE EFFECT OF WHICH WILL BE

INSIGNIFICANT. THE INCREMENTAL EFFECT OF CONSOLIDATION ON TOTAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, NET OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE ENTITIES, WILL BE AN INCREASE OF

APPROXIMATELY $32 BILLION AND $34 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THERE ALSO WILL BE A

NET REDUCTION OF EQUITY OF APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE

REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SECURITIZATION GAINS AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT

ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS, WHICH WILL BE EARNED BACK OVER THE LIFE OF THE

ASSETS.

THE

ASSETS OF QSPES THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY

$29 BILLION, NET OF OUR EXISTING RETAINED INTERESTS OF APPROXIMATELY $9 BILLION,

AND LIABILITIES WILL BE $31 BILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010. SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OF

THE QSPES WILL INCLUDE NET FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND TRADE RECEIVABLES OF

APPROXIMATELY $39 BILLION AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION.

SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES WILL INCLUDE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS OF $19

BILLION EACH. THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF OTHER VIES WE WILL CONSOLIDATE WILL

BE APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION EACH.

THE

AMENDED GUIDANCE ON ASC 860 ALSO MODIFIES EXISTING DERECOGNITION CRITERIA IN A

MANNER THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY NARROW THE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WILL

QUALIFY AS SALES. THE REVISED CRITERIA WILL APPLY PROSPECTIVELY TO TRANSFERS OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2009.

ON

SEPTEMBER 23, 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING STANDARDS FOR REVENUE

ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS. THE AMENDMENTS GENERALLY REQUIRE THE

ALLOCATION OF CONSIDERATION TO SEPARATE COMPONENTS BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING

PRICE OF EACH COMPONENT IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO REQUIRE

CERTAIN SOFTWARE-ENABLED PRODUCTS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE GENERAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR MULTIPLE COMPONENT ARRANGEMENTS AS OPPOSED TO

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SPECIFICALLY APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS. THE

AMENDMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR

MATERIALLY MODIFIED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF

ADOPTING THESE AMENDMENTS IS EXPECTED TO BE INSIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

WE REFER

TO CASH GENERATED BY OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AS "INDUSTRIAL CFOA," WHICH WE

DEFINE AS GE’S CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING GE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES SOLD TO GECS; GECS SERVICES FOR

TRADE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT AND MATERIAL PROCUREMENT; BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

(INCLUDING AUTOMOBILES) LEASED BETWEEN GE AND GECS; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)

AND OTHER SERVICES SOLD TO GECS BY GE; AIRCRAFT ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT

ARE INSTALLED ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY GECS FROM THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS FOR LEASE

TO OTHERS; AND VARIOUS INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ALLOCATIONS OF GE CORPORATE

OVERHEAD COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO COMPARE GE’S

OPERATING CASH FLOWS WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF GECS DIVIDENDS, SINCE THESE DIVIDENDS

ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES

AND CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THIS MEASURE MAY NOT BE

COMPARABLE TO CASH FLOW RESULTS OF COMPANIES WHICH CONTAIN BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, BUT BELIEVES THAT THIS COMPARISON IS AIDED BY THE

PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS OF DIVIDENDS PAID BY OUR

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS AND THE SEPARATE PRESENTATION IN OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES (GECS) CASH FLOWS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

MEASURE OF INDUSTRIAL CFOA PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH A USEFUL

MEASURE TO COMPARE THE CAPACITY OF OUR INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS TO GENERATE

OPERATING CASH FLOW WITH THE OPERATING CASH FLOW OF OTHER NON-FINANCIAL

BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES AND AS SUCH PROVIDES A USEFUL MEASURE TO SUPPLEMENT THE

REPORTED GAAP CFOA MEASURE.

OUR ROTC

CALCULATION EXCLUDES EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM THE

NUMERATOR BECAUSE U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO DISPLAY THOSE EARNINGS (LOSSES) IN

THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. WE EXCLUDE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF EARNINGS (LOSSES)

OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM THE DENOMINATOR IN OUR ROTC CALCULATION (1) FOR

EACH OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH RELATED DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE PRESENTED,

AND (2) FOR OUR AVERAGE NET INVESTMENT IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS SINCE JULY 1,

2005. HAD WE DISPOSED OF THESE OPERATIONS BEFORE JULY 1, 2005, WE WOULD HAVE

APPLIED THE PROCEEDS TO REDUCE PARENT-SUPPORTED DEBT AT GE CAPITAL. HOWEVER,

SINCE PARENT-SUPPORTED DEBT AT GE CAPITAL WAS RETIRED BY JUNE 30, 2005, WE HAVE

ASSUMED THAT WE WOULD HAVE DISTRIBUTED THE PROCEEDS AFTER THAT TIME TO

SHAREOWNERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES, THUS REDUCING AVERAGE GE SHAREOWNERS’

EQUITY. OUR CALCULATION OF AVERAGE GE SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY

COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE

THAT IT IS A CLEARER WAY TO MEASURE THE ONGOING TREND IN RETURN ON TOTAL CAPITAL

FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES GIVEN THE EXTENT THAT

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS HAVE AFFECTED OUR REPORTED RESULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

RESULTS IN A MORE RELEVANT MEASURE FOR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO EVALUATE

PERFORMANCE OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, AND TO EVALUATE

AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS WITH THE ONGOING

OPERATIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES.

GAAP-BASED RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY BECAUSE CASH BALANCES MAY BE USED TO REDUCE

DEBT AND BECAUSE THIS LONG-TERM DEBT HAS EQUITY-LIKE CHARACTERISTICS. THE

USEFULNESS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE MAY BE LIMITED, HOWEVER, AS THE TOTAL

AMOUNT OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AT ANY POINT IN TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE

AMOUNT THAT COULD PRACTICALLY BE APPLIED TO REDUCE OUTSTANDING DEBT, AND IT MAY

NOT BE ADVANTAGEOUS OR PRACTICAL TO REPLACE CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT WITH EQUITY.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, GE MADE A $9.5 BILLION PAYMENT TO GECS (OF WHICH

$8.8 BILLION WAS FURTHER CONTRIBUTED TO GE CAPITAL THROUGH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION

MEASURE, CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE, PROVIDES

INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY BE MORE COMPARABLE TO OTHER

OPERATIONS, AS GE TAX EXPENSE DOES NOT INCLUDE TAXES ON GECS EARNINGS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IN ADDITION TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND GECS TAX RATES

SHOWN IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

“FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, THIS

SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION AS IT PRESENTS

THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE THAT CAN BE USED IN COMPARING THE GE RESULTS TO OTHER

DELINQUENCY

RATES ON ON-BOOK AND OFF-BOOK EQUIPMENT FINANCING LOANS AND LEASES INCREASED

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS A RESULT

OF CONTINUING WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. IN

ADDITION, DELINQUENCY RATES ON ON-BOOK EQUIPMENT FINANCING LOANS AND LEASES

INCREASED NINE BASIS POINTS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008 TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS A

RESULT OF THE INCLUSION OF THE CITICAPITAL ACQUISITION.

(76)

THE

INCREASE IN ON-BOOK DELINQUENCIES FOR CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN THE U.S.

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, PRIMARILY

REFLECTS THE CONTINUED RISE IN DELINQUENCIES ACROSS THE U.S. CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES PLATFORMS. THE INCREASE IN ON-BOOK DELINQUENCIES FOR CONSUMER

FINANCING RECEIVABLES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER

31, 2007, TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, REFLECTS THE EFFECTS OF THE DECLINING U.K.

HOUSING MARKET. THE INCREASE IN OFF-BOOK DELINQUENCIES FOR CONSUMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES IN THE U.S. FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007 TO DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY

REFLECTS THE RISE IN DELINQUENCIES ACROSS THE U.S. CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

PLATFORM. THE DECREASE IN OFF-BOOK DELINQUENCIES FOR CONSUMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES IN THE U.S. FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008 TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, REFLECTED

THE REPLACEMENT OF CERTAIN LOWER-CREDIT QUALITY RECEIVABLES FROM A

SECURITIZATION TRUST IN 2009.

WE

BELIEVE THAT DELINQUENCY RATES ON MANAGED FINANCING RECEIVABLES PROVIDE A USEFUL

PERSPECTIVE OF OUR PORTFOLIO QUALITY AND ARE KEY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. WE USE THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES

INFORMATION THAT ENABLES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF CERTAIN FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND

FACILITATES A COMPARISON WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPETITORS. THE SAME

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND ONGOING RISK MONITORING ARE USED FOR BOTH ON-BOOK AND

OFF-BOOK PORTFOLIOS AS THE CUSTOMER’S CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH LOANS

RETAINED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND SECURITIZED LOANS. WE

BELIEVE THAT MANAGED BASIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS,

ENABLING THEM TO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOANS

REPORTED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND OUR RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZED LOANS.

COMMERCIAL PAPER

UNSECURED,

UNREGISTERED PROMISE TO REPAY BORROWED FUNDS IN A SPECIFIED PERIOD RANGING FROM

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT OR CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER PARTY (COUNTERPARTY) THAT IS

DESIGNED TO MEET ANY OF A VARIETY OF RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OR COMMODITY

PRICES. OPTIONS, FORWARDS AND SWAPS ARE THE MOST COMMON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

WE EMPLOY. SEE “HEDGE.”

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

CERTAIN BUSINESSES WE HAVE SOLD OR COMMITTED TO SELL WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR AND

THEREFORE WILL NO LONGER BE PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. THE NET EARNINGS,

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CASH FLOWS OF SUCH BUSINESSES ARE SEPARATELY

CLASSIFIED ON OUR STATEMENT OF EARNINGS, STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

PROVISION

FOR INCOME TAXES AS A PERCENTAGE OF EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE

INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES. DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH PAID FOR INCOME

TAXES IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING PERIOD. ALSO REFERRED TO AS “ACTUAL TAX RATE” OR

“TAX RATE.”

ENDING NET INVESTMENT (ENI)

IS

THE TOTAL CAPITAL WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. IT IS THE

SUM OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND EQUITY (EXCLUDING

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) ADJUSTED FOR UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENT

SECURITIES AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IT IS THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS OF

VALUE OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR CERTAIN TYPES OF FIRM COMMITMENTS. CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS, BUT ARE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. SEE “HEDGE.”

SECURITIES).

(78)

FORWARD CONTRACT

WHICH MAY BE FIXED OR FLOATING.

HEDGE

A TECHNIQUE DESIGNED TO

ELIMINATE RISK. OFTEN REFERS TO THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO

OFFSET CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OR COMMODITY PRICES,

ALTHOUGH MANY BUSINESS POSITIONS ARE “NATURALLY HEDGED” – FOR EXAMPLE, FUNDING A

U.S. FIXED-RATE INVESTMENT WITH U.S. FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS IS A NATURAL INTEREST

RATE HEDGE.

INTANGIBLE ASSET

A

NON-FINANCIAL ASSET LACKING PHYSICAL SUBSTANCE, SUCH AS GOODWILL, PATENTS,

LICENSES, TRADEMARKS AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENT

UNDER WHICH TWO COUNTERPARTIES AGREE TO EXCHANGE ONE TYPE OF INTEREST RATE CASH

FLOW FOR ANOTHER. IN A TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT, ONE PARTY PERIODICALLY WILL PAY A

FIXED AMOUNT OF INTEREST, IN EXCHANGE FOR WHICH THAT PARTY WILL RECEIVE VARIABLE

PAYMENTS COMPUTED USING A PUBLISHED INDEX. SEE “HEDGE.”

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

GENERALLY, AN INSTRUMENT THAT PROVIDES AN OWNERSHIP POSITION IN A CORPORATION (A

STOCK), A CREDITOR RELATIONSHIP WITH A CORPORATION OR GOVERNMENTAL BODY (A

BOND), RIGHTS TO CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS BACKED BY POOLS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS OR

RIGHTS TO OWNERSHIP SUCH AS THOSE REPRESENTED BY OPTIONS, SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS

AND SUBSCRIPTION WARRANTS.

MATCH FUNDING

A RISK CONTROL

POLICY THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR A PARTICULAR FINANCIAL ASSET HAVING THE SAME

CURRENCY, MATURITY AND INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS AS THAT ASSET. MATCH

FUNDING IS EXECUTED DIRECTLY, BY ISSUING DEBT, OR SYNTHETICALLY, THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF DEBT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE

LEND AT A FIXED INTEREST RATE IN THE U.S., WE CAN BORROW THOSE U.S. DOLLARS

EITHER AT A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST OR AT A FLOATING RATE EXECUTED CONCURRENTLY

WITH A PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP. SEE “HEDGE.”

MONETIZATION

SALE OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY FOR CASH. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SELL CERTAIN LOANS, CREDIT

CARD RECEIVABLES AND TRADE RECEIVABLES TO THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL BUYERS,

TYPICALLY PROVIDING AT LEAST SOME CREDIT PROTECTION AND OFTEN AGREEING TO

PROVIDE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING SERVICES FOR A FEE. MONETIZATION NORMALLY

RESULTS IN GAINS ON INTEREST-BEARING ASSETS AND LOSSES ON NON-INTEREST BEARING

ASSETS. SEE “SECURITIZATION” AND “VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY.”

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST

PRODUCT SERVICES

FOR PURPOSES

OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISPLAY OF SALES AND COSTS OF SALES IN OUR STATEMENT

OF EARNINGS, “GOODS” IS REQUIRED BY U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

REGULATIONS TO INCLUDE ALL SALES OF TANGIBLE PRODUCTS, AND “SERVICES” MUST

INCLUDE ALL OTHER SALES, INCLUDING BROADCASTING AND OTHER SERVICES ACTIVITIES.

IN OUR MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS WE REFER TO SALES

UNDER PRODUCT SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND SALES OF BOTH GOODS (SUCH AS SPARE PARTS

AND EQUIPMENT UPGRADES) AND RELATED SERVICES (SUCH AS MONITORING, MAINTENANCE

AND REPAIRS) AS SALES OF “PRODUCT SERVICES,” WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

OPERATIONS.

PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, WITH MULTIPLE-YEAR TERMS, TO PROVIDE SPECIFIED SERVICES

FOR PRODUCTS IN OUR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

INSTALLED BASE – FOR EXAMPLE, MONITORING, MAINTENANCE, SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS

THESE

ENTITIES ARE A SPECIFIC TYPE OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY DEFINED IN ASC 860,

TRANSFERS AND

SERVICING.

THE ACTIVITIES OF QSPES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED AND ENTIRELY

SPECIFIED IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT ESTABLISHED THE ENTITY. THERE ALSO ARE

SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES OF ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THEY

MAY HOLD AND THE TYPES AND EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES AND DECISION-MAKING THEY MAY

ENGAGE IN.

RETAINED INTEREST

A TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSET RETAINED BY THE TRANSFEROR THAT PROVIDES RIGHTS TO

RECEIVE PORTIONS OF THE CASH INFLOWS FROM THAT ASSET.

RETURN ON AVERAGE GE SHAREOWNERS’

EQUITY

EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGES

DIVIDED BY AVERAGE GE SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY, EXCLUDING EFFECTS OF DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS (ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, CALCULATED USING A FIVE-POINT AVERAGE). AVERAGE

GE SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY, EXCLUDING EFFECTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AS OF THE

END OF EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, IS

DESCRIBED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SECTION.

RETURN ON AVERAGE TOTAL CAPITAL

INVESTED

FOR GE, EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE ACCOUNTING

CHANGES PLUS THE SUM OF AFTER-TAX INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES AND

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF THE AVERAGES OF TOTAL

SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY (EXCLUDING EFFECTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS), BORROWINGS,

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS, CALCULATED USING A FIVE-POINT AVERAGE). AVERAGE TOTAL SHAREOWNERS’

EQUITY, EXCLUDING EFFECTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AS OF THE END OF EACH OF

THE YEARS IN THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, IS DESCRIBED IN THE

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SECTION.

SECURITIZATION

A PROCESS

WHEREBY LOANS OR OTHER RECEIVABLES ARE PACKAGED, UNDERWRITTEN AND SOLD TO

INVESTORS. IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION, ASSETS ARE SOLD TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE

ENTITY, WHICH PURCHASES THE ASSETS WITH CASH RAISED THROUGH ISSUANCE OF

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS (USUALLY DEBT INSTRUMENTS) TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS.

WHETHER OR NOT CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITIZED ASSETS IS RETAINED BY

THE SELLER DEPENDS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION. SEE “MONETIZATION”

AND “VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY.”

SUBPRIME

FOR PURPOSES OF

CONSUMER RELATED DISCUSSION, SUBPRIME INCLUDES CONSUMER FINANCE PRODUCTS LIKE

MORTGAGE, AUTO, CARDS, SALES FINANCE AND PERSONAL LOANS TO U.S. AND GLOBAL

BORROWERS WHOSE CREDIT SCORE IMPLIES A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT BASED UPON

GE CAPITAL'S PROPRIETARY SCORING MODELS AND DEFINITIONS, WHICH ADD VARIOUS

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS TO A BASE CREDIT SCORE SUCH AS A FICO SCORE

OR GLOBAL BUREAU SCORE. ALTHOUGH, FICO AND GLOBAL BUREAU CREDIT SCORES ARE A

WIDELY ACCEPTED RATING OF INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER CREDITWORTHINESS, THE INTERNALLY

MODELED SCORES ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE BEHAVIOR AND DEFAULT RISKS IN THE

PORTFOLIO COMPARED TO STAND-ALONE GENERIC BUREAU SCORES.

(80)

TURNOVER

BROADLY BASED ON THE

NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WORKING CAPITAL IS REPLACED DURING A YEAR. CURRENT

RECEIVABLES TURNOVER IS TOTAL SALES DIVIDED BY THE FIVE-POINT AVERAGE BALANCE OF

GE CURRENT RECEIVABLES. INVENTORY TURNOVER IS TOTAL SALES DIVIDED BY A

FIVE-POINT AVERAGE BALANCE OF INVENTORIES. SEE “WORKING CAPITAL.”

UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES

CLAIMS RESERVES FOR EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED, INCLUDING BOTH

REPORTED AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED (IBNR) RESERVES, AND THE EXPENSES OF

SETTLING SUCH CLAIMS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY

ENTITY DEFINED BY ASC 810,

CONSOLIDATION

, AND THAT MUST

BE CONSOLIDATED BY ITS PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY HAS ONE

OR BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: (1) ITS EQUITY AT RISK IS NOT

SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES, OR (2) AS A GROUP, THE EQUITY

INVESTORS LACK ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: (A) DIRECT OR

INDIRECT ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS, (B) OBLIGATION TO ABSORB EXPECTED LOSSES, OR

(C) RIGHT TO RECEIVE EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS.

WORKING CAPITAL

REPRESENTS GE

MANAGEMENT’S

ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. WITH OUR PARTICIPATION, AN EVALUATION OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS CONDUCTED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK AND CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED ON

THIS EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

OUR

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT ON OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THEIR REPORT FOLLOWS.

REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

SHAREOWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY.

WE HAVE

AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC

COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (“GE”) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, AND

THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY AND CASH

FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED GE’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL- INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION (“COSO”). GE MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATE­MENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON GE’S

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN

AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASON­ABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND

EVALUAT­ING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED

ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES

AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A

COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO

PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF

THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASON­ABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR

OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING ON PAGES 84, 86, 87,

89, 91-167 AND THE SUMMARY OF OPERATING SEGMENTS TABLE ON PAGE 35 PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GE AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2009 AND 2008, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH

OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, IN CONFORMITY

WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, GE

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY COSO.

(82)

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, GE, IN 2009,

CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR IMPAIRMENT OF DEBT SECURITIES, BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS; IN 2008, CHANGED ITS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES; AND, IN 2007, CHANGED ITS

METHODS OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES AND FOR A CHANGE OR

PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED

BY LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS.

OUR

AUDITS OF GE’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF

FORMING AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATING INFOR­MATION APPEARING ON PAGES 85, 88 AND 90

IS PRESENTED FOR PURPOSES OF ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS RATHER THAN TO PRESENT THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND CASH FLOWS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES. THE CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION HAS

BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE AUDITING PROCEDURES APPLIED IN THE AUDITS OF THE

CON­SOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND, IN OUR OPINION, IS FAIRLY STATED IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS IN RELATION TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN

AS A WHOLE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES

OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP).

CONSOLIDATION

OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR AFFILIATES – ENTITIES THAT WE

CONTROL, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. ASSOCIATED

COMPANIES ARE ENTITIES THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL BUT OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A VOTING INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%. RESULTS

OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND

ADVANCES TO ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS IN THE

CAPTION “ALL OTHER ASSETS” IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, NET OF

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES THAT REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES

INHERENT IN SUCH ASSETS.

FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION

WE HAVE

RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT-YEAR’S

PRESENTATION.

FINANCIAL

DATA AND RELATED MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING

CATEGORIES.

GE

– THIS REPRESENTS THE

ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OTHER THAN GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES,

INC. (GECS), WHOSE OPERATIONS ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS.

GECS

– THIS AFFILIATE OWNS ALL

OF THE COMMON STOCK OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GE CAPITAL). GE

CAPITAL AND ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE ACCOMPANYING GECS

COLUMNS AND CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF ITS BUSINESS.

CONSOLIDATED

– THIS REPRESENTS

THE ADDING TOGETHER OF GE AND GECS, GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

– THESE

COMPRISE OUR FIVE BUSINESSES, FOCUSED ON THE BROAD MARKETS THEY SERVE: ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, NBC UNIVERSAL (NBCU), CAPITAL FINANCE

AND CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL. PRIOR-PERIOD INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO

BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION.

UNLESS

OTHERWISE INDICATED, INFORMATION IN THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN

PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED. SEE NOTE 2.

THE

EFFECTS OF TRANSLATING TO U.S. DOLLARS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S.

AFFILIATES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN

SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY. ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END

EXCHANGE RATES, WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR

THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS.

PREPARING

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES

BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, UNEMPLOYMENT, MARKET LIQUIDITY, THE REAL ESTATE

MARKET, ETC.), WHICH AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES CONTEMPLATE CURRENT

CONDITIONS AND HOW WE EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, AS APPROPRIATE, IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IN 2010 ACTUAL CONDITIONS COULD BE WORSE THAN

ANTICIPATED IN THOSE ESTIMATES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, SUCH CHANGES COULD

RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, ESTABLISHMENT OF

VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX

LIABILITIES.

(91)

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

WE

RECORD ALL SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES ONLY WHEN A FIRM SALES AGREEMENT IS IN

PLACE, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED AND COLLECTIBILITY

OF THE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE SALES PRICE IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

ARRANGEMENTS

FOR THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOMETIMES INCLUDE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS. MOST

OF OUR MULTIPLE COMPONENT ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN

THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS

USUALLY INVOLVE FUTURE SERVICE DELIVERABLES SUCH AS INSTALLATION, TRAINING OR

THE FUTURE DELIVERY OF ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT. IN SUCH AGREEMENTS, THE AMOUNT

ASSIGNED TO EACH COMPONENT IS BASED ON THE TOTAL PRICE AND THE UNDELIVERED

COMPONENT’S OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED FAIR VALUE, DETERMINED FROM SOURCES SUCH AS

THE SEPARATE SELLING PRICE FOR THAT OR A SIMILAR COMPONENT OR FROM COMPETITOR

PRICES FOR SIMILAR COMPONENTS. IF FAIR VALUE OF AN UNDELIVERED COMPONENT CANNOT

BE SATISFACTORILY DETERMINED, WE DEFER REVENUE UNTIL ALL MULTIPLE COMPONENTS ARE

DELIVERED.

EXCEPT

FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF GOODS UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN (SAB) 104,

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

. WE OFTEN SELL CONSUMER PRODUCTS, HOME VIDEOS AND COMPUTER

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN. WE USE OUR ACCUMULATED

EXPERIENCE TO ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR SUCH RETURNS WHEN WE RECORD THE SALE. IN

SITUATIONS WHERE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS BASED ON

SELLER OR CUSTOMER-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE CRITERIA, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OCCURS OR WE HAVE RELIABLY DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL SPECIFIED

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. IN ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE PROVIDE GOODS FOR

TRIAL AND EVALUATION PURPOSES, WE ONLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE AFTER CUSTOMER

ACCEPTANCE OCCURS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, WE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR ANTICIPATED

LOSSES BEFORE WE RECORD SALES.

CERTAIN

OF OUR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES INVOLVE INCONSEQUENTIAL OR PERFUNCTORY

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS CAN INCLUDE NON-ESSENTIAL

INSTALLATION OR TRAINING, AND IN SOME INSTANCES PROVISION OF PRODUCT MANUALS AND

LIMITED TECHNICAL PRODUCT SUPPORT. WHEN THE ONLY REMAINING UNDELIVERED

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION UNDER AN ARRANGEMENT IS INCONSEQUENTIAL OR PERFUNCTORY,

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE TOTAL CONTRACT AND PROVIDE FOR THE COST OF THE

UNPERFORMED OBLIGATION.

WE

RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON AGREEMENTS FOR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES UNDER POWER

GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS; NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES; LARGER OIL

DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS; AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS; MILITARY DEVELOPMENT

CONTRACTS; AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, USING LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION AND

PRODUCTION CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. WE ESTIMATE TOTAL LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUE NET

OF PRICE CONCESSIONS AS WELL AS TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS. FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER POWER

GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS, NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES, AERODERIVATIVE

UNIT CONTRACTS AND MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES AS WE

COMPLETE MAJOR CONTRACT-SPECIFIED DELIVERABLES, MOST OFTEN WHEN CUSTOMERS

RECEIVE TITLE TO THE GOODS OR ACCEPT THE SERVICES AS PERFORMED. FOR LARGER OIL

DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, WE RECOGNIZE

SALES BASED ON OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS

INCURRED IN RELATION TO OUR ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE MEASURE

LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUES BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN

RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR

AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN

CURRENT OPERATIONS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE

AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

(92)

WE

RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY FOR SALES OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES, MILITARY

PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND RELATED SPARE PARTS NOT SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT

SERVICES AGREEMENTS. DELIVERY OF COMMERCIAL ENGINES, NON-U.S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT

AND ALL RELATED SPARE PARTS OCCURS ON SHIPMENT; DELIVERY OF MILITARY PROPULSION

EQUIPMENT SOLD TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AGENCIES THEREOF OCCURS UPON RECEIPT OF

A MATERIAL INSPECTION AND RECEIVING REPORT, DD FORM 250 OR MEMORANDUM OF

SHIPMENT. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES ARE COMPLEX AEROSPACE EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURED TO CUSTOMER ORDER UNDER A VARIETY OF SOMETIMES-COMPLEX, LONG-TERM

AGREEMENTS. WE MEASURE SALES OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES BY APPLYING OUR

CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE

OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINE AGREEMENTS IN

PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT

OPERATIONS. WE MEASURE REVENUE FOR MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS

NOT SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC

CONTRACT ON A SPECIFICALLY-MEASURED OUTPUT BASIS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT

WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE; CONSISTENT

WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, WE MAKE SUCH PROVISION

ONLY IF SUCH LOSSES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE HIGHLY PROBABLE SALES OF

SPARE PARTS FOR THOSE ENGINES.

WE SELL

PRODUCT SERVICES UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT MAINTENANCE OR EXTENDED WARRANTY

AGREEMENTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENTS,

PRINCIPALLY IN AVIATION, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION, WHERE COSTS OF PERFORMING

SERVICES ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. WE ALSO SELL PRODUCT

SERVICES IN HEALTHCARE, WHERE SUCH COSTS GENERALLY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. FOR THE AVIATION, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENTS, WE

RECOGNIZE RELATED SALES BASED ON THE EXTENT OF OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION

MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE

ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND

REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. FOR THE

HEALTHCARE AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS AND

EXPENSE RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO

INCUR ON ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

NBC

UNIVERSAL RECORDS BROADCAST AND CABLE TELEVISION AND INTERNET ADVERTISING SALES

WHEN ADVERTISEMENTS ARE AIRED, NET OF PROVISION FOR ANY VIEWER SHORTFALLS (MAKE

GOODS). WE RECORD SALES FROM THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF FILMS AS THE FILMS ARE

EXHIBITED; SALES OF HOME VIDEOS, NET OF A RETURN PROVISION, WHEN THE VIDEOS ARE

DELIVERED TO AND AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS; FEES FROM CABLE/SATELLITE

OPERATORS WHEN SERVICES ARE PROVIDED; AND LICENSING OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING WHEN WE MAKE THE MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR AIRING.

GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME)

WE USE

THE INTEREST METHOD TO RECOGNIZE INCOME ON ALL LOANS. INTEREST ON LOANS INCLUDES

ORIGINATION, COMMITMENT AND OTHER NON-REFUNDABLE FEES RELATED TO FUNDING

(RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD). WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT

THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR

THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST INCOME ON NONEARNING

LOANS EITHER AS CASH IS COLLECTED OR ON A COST-RECOVERY BASIS AS CONDITIONS

WARRANT. WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONEARNING, NON-RESTRUCTURED COMMERCIAL

LOANS ONLY WHEN (A) PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE LOAN’S

ORIGINAL TERMS AND (B) FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED. WHEN WE AGREE TO

RESTRUCTURED TERMS WITH THE BORROWER, WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ONLY WHEN

REASONABLY ASSURED THAT WE WILL RECOVER FULL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS, AND SUCH

LOANS PASS UNDERWRITING REVIEWS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE APPLIED TO NEW LOANS. WE

RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONEARNING CONSUMER LOANS WHEN THE CUSTOMER’S

ACCOUNT IS LESS THAN 90 DAYS PAST DUE.

WE

RECOGNIZE FINANCING LEASE INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD TO PRODUCE A LEVEL YIELD

ON FUNDS NOT YET RECOVERED. ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED

UPON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF THE LEASED ASSET AT THE END OF

THE LEASE TERM. WE USE VARIOUS SOURCES OF DATA IN DETERMINING THIS ESTIMATE,

INCLUDING INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED FOR THE

ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC ASSET UNDER LEASE. GUARANTEES OF RESIDUAL VALUES BY

UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES ARE CONSIDERED PART OF MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS.

SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN ESTIMATING RESIDUAL VALUES INCLUDE ESTIMATED

NET CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERM, ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF FUTURE

REMARKETING, AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COMPONENT PART AND SCRAP METAL PRICES,

DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE.

WE

RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF

UNDERLYING LEASES.

(93)

FEES

INCLUDE COMMITMENT FEES RELATED TO LOANS THAT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO FUND AND

LINE-OF-CREDIT FEES. WE RECORD THESE FEES IN EARNED INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER THE PERIOD TO WHICH THEY RELATE. WE RECORD SYNDICATION FEES IN EARNED

INCOME AT THE TIME RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED, UNLESS SIGNIFICANT

CONTINGENCIES EXIST.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COST

OF GE MANUFACTURING PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED

ECONOMIC LIFE. U.S. ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED USING AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED ON

A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA; NON-U.S. ASSETS ARE GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON

A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

THE COST

OF GECS EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS ON OPERATING LEASES IS DEPRECIATED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER THE LEASE TERM OR OVER THE

ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT.

THE COST

OF GECS ACQUIRED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

TO THE ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OVER THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OR THE ESTIMATED

PROCEEDS UPON SALE OF THE INVESTMENT AT THE END OF THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD

IF THAT APPROACH PRODUCES A HIGHER MEASURE OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

THE COST

OF INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS IS AMORTIZED IN PROPORTION TO

ESTIMATED TOTAL RELATED SALES; COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET’S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. WE

REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SEE NOTES 7 AND 8.

NBC UNIVERSAL FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

WE DEFER

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION COSTS, INCLUDING DIRECT COSTS, PRODUCTION

OVERHEAD, DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND INTEREST. WE DO NOT DEFER COSTS OF EXPLOITATION,

WHICH PRINCIPALLY COMPRISE COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PROGRAM MARKETING AND

DISTRIBUTION. WE AMORTIZE DEFERRED FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION COSTS, AS WELL

AS ASSOCIATED PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS, ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION

BASIS USING THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD’S GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED TOTAL

REMAINING GROSS REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES; WE STATE SUCH COSTS AT THE LOWER OF

AMORTIZED COST OR FAIR VALUE. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL REVENUES AND COSTS ARE BASED ON

ANTICIPATED RELEASE PATTERNS, PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AND HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR

SIMILAR PRODUCTS. WE DEFER THE COSTS OF ACQUIRED BROADCAST MATERIAL, INCLUDING

RIGHTS TO MATERIAL FOR USE ON NBC UNIVERSAL’S BROADCAST AND CABLE/SATELLITE

TELEVISION NETWORKS, AT THE EARLIER OF ACQUISITION OR WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD

BEGINS AND THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. WE AMORTIZE ACQUIRED BROADCAST

MATERIAL AND RIGHTS WHEN WE BROADCAST THE ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS; WE STATE SUCH

COSTS AT THE LOWER OF AMORTIZED COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

OUR

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF

PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. OUR METHOD OF CALCULATING ESTIMATED

LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED

RECEIVABLES. WRITE-OFFS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AND

SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES ARE ADDED. IMPAIRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE WRITTEN DOWN

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE JUDGE PRINCIPAL TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE.

OUR

PORTFOLIO CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF HOMOGENOUS CONSUMER LOANS AND OF COMMERCIAL LOANS

AND LEASES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO

PROVIDE FOR LOSSES ARE CONTINUALLY UPDATED TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT

CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND

PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE

DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES.

OUR

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF SMALLER BALANCE, HOMOGENOUS LOANS INCLUDING

CARD RECEIVABLES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES AND RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGES. WE COLLECTIVELY EVALUATE EACH PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON THESE RECEIVABLES IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH A PROCESS THAT

ESTIMATES THE PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BASED UPON STATISTICAL

ANALYSES OF PORTFOLIO DATA. THESE ANALYSES INCLUDE MIGRATION ANALYSIS, IN WHICH

HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IS APPLIED TO THE CURRENT

AGING OF THE PORTFOLIO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER ANALYSES THAT REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS

AND CONDITIONS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OVERALL PORTFOLIO INDICATORS INCLUDING

NONEARNING LOANS, TRENDS IN LOAN VOLUME AND LENDING TERMS, CREDIT POLICIES AND

OTHER OBSERVABLE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND HOME PRICE

INDICES.

(94)

WE WRITE

OFF UNSECURED CLOSED-END INSTALLMENT LOANS AT 120 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE

AND UNSECURED OPEN-ENDED REVOLVING LOANS AT 180 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE. WE

WRITE DOWN CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY COLLATERAL OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE WHEN SUCH LOANS ARE 120 DAYS PAST DUE. CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE (BOTH REVOLVING AND CLOSED-END LOANS) ARE WRITTEN DOWN

TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, LESS COSTS TO SELL, NO LATER THAN WHEN THEY

BECOME 360 DAYS PAST DUE. UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS IN BANKRUPTCY ARE WRITTEN OFF

WITHIN 60 DAYS OF NOTIFICATION OF FILING BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT OR WITHIN

CONTRACTUAL WRITE-OFF PERIODS, WHICHEVER OCCURS EARLIER.

OUR

COMMERCIAL LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF LOANS AND LEASES,

INCLUDING BOTH LARGER BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENOUS LOANS AND LEASES AND SMALLER

BALANCE HOMOGENOUS COMMERCIAL AND EQUIPMENT LOANS AND LEASES. LOSSES ON SUCH

LOANS AND LEASES ARE RECORDED WHEN PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE

OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO FOR POTENTIAL SPECIFIC CREDIT OR COLLECTION ISSUES THAT

MIGHT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT. FOR LARGER BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENOUS LOANS AND

LEASES, THIS SURVEY FIRST CONSIDERS THE FINANCIAL STATUS, PAYMENT HISTORY,

COLLATERAL VALUE, INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND GUARANTOR SUPPORT RELATED TO SPECIFIC

CUSTOMERS. ANY DELINQUENCIES OR BANKRUPTCIES ARE INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENT REQUIRING FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF COLLECTIBILITY. WE ROUTINELY RECEIVE

FINANCIAL AS WELL AS RATING AGENCY REPORTS ON OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE ELEVATE FOR

FURTHER ATTENTION THOSE CUSTOMERS WHOSE OPERATIONS WE JUDGE TO BE MARGINAL OR

DETERIORATING. WE ALSO ELEVATE CUSTOMERS FOR FURTHER ATTENTION WHEN WE OBSERVE A

DECLINE IN COLLATERAL VALUES FOR ASSET-BASED LOANS. WHILE COLLATERAL VALUES ARE

NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, WHEN WE OBSERVE SUCH A DECLINE, WE EVALUATE RELEVANT

MARKETS TO ASSESS RECOVERY ALTERNATIVES – FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REAL ESTATE LOANS,

RELEVANT MARKETS ARE LOCAL; FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT LOANS, RELEVANT MARKETS ARE

GLOBAL. WE PROVIDE ALLOWANCES BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF ALL AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, INCLUDING EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, NET

OF EXPECTED DISPOSAL COSTS, AND THE SECONDARY MARKET VALUE OF THE FINANCING

RECEIVABLES. AFTER PROVIDING FOR SPECIFIC INCURRED LOSSES, WE THEN DETERMINE AN

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED IN THE BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BUT

CANNOT YET BE IDENTIFIED TO A SPECIFIC LOAN OR LEASE. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON

HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY, AND IT IS PREPARED BY

EACH RESPECTIVE LINE OF BUSINESS.

THE

REMAINDER OF OUR COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LEASES ARE PORTFOLIOS OF SMALLER BALANCE

HOMOGENOUS COMMERCIAL AND EQUIPMENT POSITIONS THAT WE EVALUATE COLLECTIVELY BY

PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED UPON VARIOUS STATISTICAL ANALYSES CONSIDERING

HISTORICAL LOSSES AND AGING, AS WELL AS OUR VIEW ON CURRENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS.

EXPERIENCE

IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR NEW PRODUCTS; THEREFORE, WHILE WE ARE DEVELOPING THAT

EXPERIENCE, WE SET LOSS ALLOWANCES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MOST CLOSELY

ANALOGOUS PRODUCTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO.

"IMPAIRED"

LOANS ARE DEFINED AS LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR WHICH IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO

THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. TROUBLED DEBT

RESTRUCTURINGS ARE THOSE LOANS IN WHICH WE HAVE GRANTED A CONCESSION TO A

BORROWER EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES WHERE WE DO NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE

COMPENSATION. SUCH LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED, AND ARE INDIVIDUALLY

REVIEWED FOR SPECIFIC RESERVES.

WHEN WE

REPOSSESS COLLATERAL IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN, WE WRITE DOWN THE RECEIVABLE

AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. REPOSSESSED COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN THE

CAPTION “ALL OTHER ASSETS” IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CARRIED AT

THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

RECORDED IN EQUITY. GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES THAT RESULT IN OUR LOSS OF CONTROL

ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS ALONG WITH REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON ANY

INVESTMENTS IN THE ENTITY THAT WE RETAINED. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2009, WE

RECORDED GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF THEIR OWN SHARES BY AFFILIATES EXCEPT WHEN

REALIZATION OF GAINS WAS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, IN WHICH CASE WE RECORDED THE

RESULTS IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY. WE RECORDED GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF

INTERESTS IN COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY ENGINE AND AERODERIVATIVE EQUIPMENT

PROGRAMS.

(95)

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

DEBT

SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS ARE INCLUDED IN CASH EQUIVALENTS UNLESS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

AND CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE

REPORT INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER

EQUITY SECURITIES, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 21 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON FAIR

VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES

ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY, NET OF APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER

ADJUSTMENTS. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2009, THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) AMENDED ASC 320,

INVESTMENTS – DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

THIS AMENDMENT MODIFIED THE EXISTING MODEL FOR RECOGNITION

AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPAIRMENT FOR DEBT SECURITIES. THE TWO PRINCIPAL CHANGES TO

THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR SECURITIES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

·

RECOGNITION

OF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR DEBT SECURITIES IS

REQUIRED IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE MET: (1) WE DO NOT EXPECT TO

RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, (2) WE INTEND TO

SELL THE SECURITY OR (3) IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE

REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE WE RECOVER ITS AMORTIZED COST

BASIS.

·

IF

THE FIRST CONDITION ABOVE IS MET, BUT WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL AND IT IS

NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY

BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECORD THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY’S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS RECOVERABLE

AMOUNT IN EARNINGS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY’S RECOVERABLE

AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. IF EITHER THE SECOND

OR THIRD CRITERION IS MET, THEN WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY’S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS FAIR VALUE

IN EARNINGS.

IF WE DO

NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL

BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE

EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS,

SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING

WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE

SECURITY. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN

ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING AND

CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

ALL

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR REALIZABLE VALUES. COST FOR A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GE U.S. INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT

(LIFO) BASIS. COST OF OTHER GE INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS. LIFO WAS USED FOR 39% AND 40% OF GE INVENTORIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. GECS INVENTORIES CONSIST OF FINISHED

PRODUCTS HELD FOR SALE; COST IS DETERMINED ON A FIFO BASIS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE DO

NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT TEST IT AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE

REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. A REPORTING UNIT IS THE OPERATING SEGMENT, OR A BUSINESS

ONE LEVEL BELOW THAT OPERATING SEGMENT (THE COMPONENT LEVEL) IF DISCRETE

FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PREPARED AND REGULARLY REVIEWED BY SEGMENT MANAGEMENT.

HOWEVER, COMPONENTS ARE AGGREGATED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT IF THEY HAVE

SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IF THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT

GOODWILL. WE USE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES. WHEN AVAILABLE

AND AS APPROPRIATE, WE USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW RESULTS. WHEN ALL OR A PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT IS

DISPOSED OF, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSITION BASED ON

THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESS DISPOSED OF AND THE PORTION OF THE

REPORTING UNIT THAT WILL BE RETAINED.

(96)

WE

AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES UNLESS

SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. THE COST OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET’S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE,

EXCEPT THAT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

AMORTIZED IN RELATION TO TOTAL RELATED SALES. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND, IF IMPAIRED, WRITTEN

DOWN TO FAIR VALUE BASED ON EITHER DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND

WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AS REQUIRED.

GECS INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE

ANNUITY BENEFITS

CERTAIN

ENTITIES, WHICH WE CONSOLIDATE, PROVIDE GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS TO

STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES.

OUR

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDE PROVIDING INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE FOR LIFE

AND HEALTH RISKS AND PROVIDING CERTAIN ANNUITY PRODUCTS. THREE PRODUCT GROUPS

ARE PROVIDED: TRADITIONAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND

UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITH

SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY AND/OR MORBIDITY RISKS, WHILE INVESTMENT CONTRACTS ARE

CONTRACTS WITHOUT SUCH RISKS. UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE A

PARTICULAR TYPE OF LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACT WHOSE TERMS ARE NOT FIXED

AND GUARANTEED.

FOR

SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE, WE

REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME OVER THE TERMS OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS,

GENERALLY ON A PRO-RATA BASIS. FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS

INCLUDING TERM, WHOLE LIFE AND ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ANNUITANT,

WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME WHEN DUE.

PREMIUMS

RECEIVED ON INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (INCLUDING ANNUITIES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

MORTALITY RISK) AND UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUES BUT

RATHER AS DEPOSIT LIABILITIES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FOR CHARGES AND ASSESSMENTS

ON THESE CONTRACTS, MOSTLY FOR MORTALITY, CONTRACT INITIATION, ADMINISTRATION

AND SURRENDER. AMOUNTS CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNTS ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE.

LIABILITIES

FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE PRESENT VALUE OF

SUCH BENEFITS LESS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE NET PREMIUMS BASED ON MORTALITY,

MORBIDITY, INTEREST AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AT THE TIME THE POLICIES WERE ISSUED

OR ACQUIRED. LIABILITIES FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES

EQUAL THE ACCOUNT VALUE, THAT IS, THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES TO THE BENEFIT OF THE

CONTRACT OR POLICYHOLDER INCLUDING CREDITED INTEREST AND ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE.

LIABILITIES

FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF

THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATIONS FOR REPORTED AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED CLAIMS AND

THE RELATED ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES. LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS

AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED THROUGH

CURRENT OPERATIONS.

FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE

ADOPTED ASC 820 IN TWO STEPS; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, WE ADOPTED IT FOR ALL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE

ON A RECURRING BASIS AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, FOR ALL NON-FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS.

FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FAIR VALUED ON A RECURRING BASIS, FAIR VALUE IS

THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A MARKET PARTICIPANT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE

ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH

MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND,

IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE.

OBSERVABLE

INPUTS REFLECT MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES, WHILE UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS REFLECT OUR MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. PREFERENCE IS GIVEN TO OBSERVABLE INPUTS.

THESE TWO TYPES OF INPUTS CREATE THE FOLLOWING FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY.

LEVEL

1 –

QUOTED

PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE

MARKETS.

(97)

LEVEL

2 –

QUOTED

PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR

IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE; AND

MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS WHOSE INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR WHOSE SIGNIFICANT

VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE.

LEVEL

3 –

SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL ARE

UNOBSERVABLE.

WE

MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO VALUE INSTRUMENTS USING THE BEST AND MOST

RELEVANT DATA AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT REVIEW

VALUATION, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT PRICE VALIDATION FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS.

FURTHER, IN OTHER INSTANCES, WE RETAIN INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDORS TO ASSIST IN

VALUING CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS.

THE

FOLLOWING SECTION DESCRIBES THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE

DIFFERENT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES TO DETERMINE THE

FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1. LEVEL 1

SECURITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES.

WHEN

QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNOBSERVABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INFORMATION FROM AN

INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDOR. THE PRICING VENDOR USES VARIOUS PRICING MODELS FOR

EACH ASSET CLASS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD

USE. THE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS TO THE MODEL OF THE PRICING VENDOR ARE DERIVED

FROM MARKET OBSERVABLE SOURCES INCLUDING: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES,

BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS, OFFERS, AND

OTHER MARKET-RELATED DATA. SINCE MANY FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DO NOT TRADE ON A

DAILY BASIS, THE METHODOLOGY OF THE PRICING VENDOR USES AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS

APPLICABLE SUCH AS BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR

GROUPINGS, AND MATRIX PRICING. THE PRICING VENDOR CONSIDERS AVAILABLE MARKET

OBSERVABLE INPUTS IN DETERMINING THE EVALUATION FOR A SECURITY. THUS, CERTAIN

SECURITIES MAY NOT BE PRICED USING QUOTED PRICES, BUT RATHER DETERMINED FROM

MARKET OBSERVABLE INFORMATION. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 AND

PRIMARILY COMPRISE OUR PORTFOLIO OF CORPORATE FIXED INCOME, AND GOVERNMENT,

MORTGAGE AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. IN INFREQUENT CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR PRICING

VENDORS MAY PROVIDE US WITH VALUATIONS THAT ARE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE CLASSIFY THE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES IN LEVEL 3.

ANNUALLY,

WE CONDUCT REVIEWS OF OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR TO VALIDATE THAT THE INPUTS

USED IN THAT VENDOR’S PRICING PROCESS ARE DEEMED TO BE MARKET OBSERVABLE AS

DEFINED IN THE STANDARD. WHILE WE WERE NOT PROVIDED ACCESS TO PROPRIETARY MODELS

OF THE VENDOR, OUR REVIEWS HAVE INCLUDED ON-SITE WALK-THROUGHS OF THE PRICING

PROCESS, METHODOLOGIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR EACH ASSET CLASS AND LEVEL FOR

WHICH PRICES ARE PROVIDED. OUR REVIEW ALSO INCLUDED AN EXAMINATION OF THE

UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR A SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ACROSS

ASSET CLASSES, CREDIT RATING LEVELS AND VARIOUS DURATIONS, A PROCESS WE CONTINUE

TO PERFORM FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE PRICING VENDOR HAS AN

ESTABLISHED CHALLENGE PROCESS IN PLACE FOR ALL SECURITY VALUATIONS, WHICH

FACILITATES IDENTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF POTENTIALLY ERRONEOUS PRICES. WE

BELIEVE THAT THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM OUR PRICING VENDOR ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF

PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT

PRICES) AND ARE CLASSIFIED APPROPRIATELY IN THE HIERARCHY.

WE USE

NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AS OUR PRIMARY BASIS FOR VALUATION WHEN THERE IS

LIMITED, OR NO, RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY FOR A SPECIFIC INSTRUMENT OR FOR OTHER

INSTRUMENTS THAT SHARE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. WE HAVE NOT ADJUSTED THE PRICES

WE HAVE OBTAINED. INVESTMENT SECURITIES PRICED USING NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES

ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. AS IS THE CASE WITH OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR,

THIRD-PARTY BROKERS DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THEIR PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS,

INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL CONDUCT

INTERNAL REVIEWS OF PRICING FOR ALL SUCH INVESTMENT SECURITIES QUARTERLY TO

ENSURE REASONABLENESS OF VALUATIONS USED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE

REVIEWS ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PRICES THAT APPEAR STALE, THOSE THAT HAVE

CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRIOR VALUATIONS, AND OTHER ANOMALIES THAT MAY

INDICATE THAT A PRICE MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE,

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUES PROVIDED BY THE BROKERS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF

PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT

PRICES).

(98)

RETAINED

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT

CONSIDERS THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION AND ESTIMATED NET

CREDIT EXPOSURE, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DISCOUNT RATES AND EXPECTED

LIFE.

DERIVATIVES.

WE USE CLOSING

PRICES FOR DERIVATIVES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE TRADED EITHER ON EXCHANGES

OR LIQUID OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

THE

MAJORITY OF OUR DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING INTERNAL MODELS. THE MODELS

MAXIMIZE THE USE OF MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES AND

BOTH FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. DERIVATIVE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 PRIMARILY REPRESENT INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY FORWARD AND OPTION

CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 PRIMARILY REPRESENT INTEREST RATE

PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY OR PREPAYMENT FEATURES.

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS

. CERTAIN ASSETS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

NON-RECURRING BASIS. THESE ASSETS ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AN ONGOING

BASIS BUT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

THESE ASSETS CAN INCLUDE LOANS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO

FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE HELD FOR SALE, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED

BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY

ARE IMPAIRED AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN

DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, IF WE SELL A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND RETAIN A

NONCONTROLLING STAKE IN THE ENTITY. ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE

WHEN IMPAIRED AND RETAINED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR

VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

THE

FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL AND

NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS

AND FOR ASSETS WITHIN OUR PENSION PLANS AND RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS AT EACH

REPORTING PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE.

LOANS

. WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICING ON RECENT CLOSED MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

TO VALUE LOANS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2. WHEN THIS DATA IS UNOBSERVABLE, WE

USE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USING CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATE DATA ADJUSTED FOR

INHERENT CREDIT RISK, AND SUCH LOANS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. WHEN APPROPRIATE,

LOANS ARE VALUED USING COLLATERAL VALUES AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT.

COST AND EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS

. COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING MARKET

OBSERVABLE DATA SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE. WHEN MARKET OBSERVABLE

DATA IS UNAVAILABLE, INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL,

COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE.

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

INVESTMENTS

IN PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE VALUED USING NET ASSET

VALUES. THE NET ASSET VALUES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE

UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL

ESTATE FUNDS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REDEEMABLE

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. INVESTMENTS IN COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL

2.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

. LONG-LIVED

ASSETS, INCLUDING AIRCRAFT AND REAL ESTATE, ARE VALUED USING THE BEST

INFORMATION AVAILABLE, INCLUDING QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR MARKET PRICES FOR

SIMILAR ASSETS WHEN AVAILABLE OR INTERNAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES DISCOUNTED AT AN

APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATE OR INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR REAL

ESTATE, CASH FLOW ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON CURRENT MARKET ESTIMATES THAT REFLECT

CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE PROFILES AND AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT

EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTAL, OCCUPANCY AND CAPITALIZATION RATES. THESE INVESTMENTS

ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

(99)

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND

FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS

IN EITHER CONSOLIDATION OR DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT OF OUR PREVIOUS EQUITY INVESTMENT OR RETAINED NONCONTROLLING STAKE

IN THE FORMER SUBSIDIARY, RESPECTIVELY, ARE VALUED USING AN INCOME APPROACH, A

MARKET APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE. IN APPLYING

THESE METHODOLOGIES, WE RELY ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING

RESULTS, FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, MARKET OBSERVABLE PRICING

MULTIPLES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, AND POSSIBLE

CONTROL PREMIUM. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

THE FASB

HAS MADE THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15,

2009. THE ASC COMBINES ALL PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GAAP INTO ONE

CODIFIED SET OF GUIDANCE ORGANIZED BY SUBJECT AREA. IN THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, REFERENCES TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN

REPLACED WITH THE RELEVANT ASC REFERENCES. SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS TO GAAP BY THE

FASB WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ASC THROUGH ISSUANCE OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

UPDATES (ASU).

WE

ADOPTED ASC 820,

FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES

, IN TWO STEPS; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, WE

ADOPTED IT FOR ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED

FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, FOR ALL

NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS.

THIS GUIDANCE ESTABLISHES A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS

RELATED DISCLOSURES. SEE NOTE 21.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2008, WE ADOPTED ASC 825,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

. UPON

ADOPTION, WE ELECTED TO REPORT $172 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AT FAIR

VALUE IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THEM ON THE SAME ACCOUNTING BASIS (MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS) AS THE DERIVATIVES ECONOMICALLY HEDGING THESE LOANS. SEE

NOTE 21.

ON

JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 805,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

. THIS

AMENDMENT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS BOTH

DURING THE PERIOD OF THE ACQUISITION AND IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. AMONG THE MORE

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS ARE THE

FOLLOWING.

·

ACQUIRED

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN

ASSET, WITH THE COST RECOGNIZED AS THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS

REALIZED OR ABANDONED. IPR&D WAS PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED AT THE TIME OF

THE ACQUISITION.

·

CONTINGENT

CONSIDERATION IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS AN ELEMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE

WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS RECOGNIZED IN OPERATIONS. CONTINGENT

CONSIDERATION WAS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENT OF

PURCHASE PRICE.

·

SUBSEQUENT

DECREASES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON ACQUIRED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN OPERATIONS AFTER THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SUCH CHANGES WERE

PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED TO BE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN CONSIDERATION AND WERE

RECORDED AS DECREASES IN GOODWILL.

·

TRANSACTION

COSTS ARE EXPENSED. THESE COSTS WERE PREVIOUSLY TREATED AS COSTS OF THE

ACQUISITION.

·

UPON

GAINING CONTROL OF AN ENTITY IN WHICH AN EQUITY METHOD OR COST BASIS

INVESTMENT WAS HELD, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT INVESTMENT IS ADJUSTED TO

FAIR VALUE WITH THE RELATED GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED IN EARNINGS. PREVIOUSLY,

THIS FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

MADE.

IN APRIL

2009, THE FASB AMENDED ASC 805 AND CHANGED THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING FOR ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE ADOPTED

THIS AMENDMENT RETROSPECTIVELY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009. THE AMENDMENT REQUIRES

PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES TO BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE, IF FAIR VALUE CAN

BE DETERMINED OR REASONABLY ESTIMATED DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. IF FAIR

VALUE CANNOT BE DETERMINED OR REASONABLY ESTIMATED, THE STANDARD REQUIRES

MEASUREMENT BASED ON THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT CRITERIA OF ASC 450,

CONTINGENCIES.

(100)

ON

JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 810, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAKE

CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT

REQUIRES US TO CLASSIFY EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

(PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS “MINORITY INTEREST”) AS PART OF CONSOLIDATED NET

EARNINGS ($216 MILLION AND $641 MILLION FOR 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY) AND TO

INCLUDE THE ACCUMULATED AMOUNT OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AS PART OF

SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY ($7,845 MILLION AND $8,947 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY). THE NET EARNINGS AMOUNTS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ARE

NOW PRESENTED AS "NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY" AND, AS REQUIRED,

EARNINGS PER SHARE CONTINUES TO REFLECT AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE ONLY TO THE

COMPANY. SIMILARLY, IN OUR PRESENTATION OF SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY, WE DISTINGUISH

BETWEEN EQUITY AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GE SHAREOWNERS AND AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS – PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS MINORITY INTEREST

OUTSIDE OF SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009, DIVIDENDS TO

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ($548 MILLION IN 2009) ARE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING CASH

FLOWS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FINANCIAL REPORTING CHANGES, THIS GUIDANCE PROVIDES

FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS;

SPECIFICALLY, INCREASES AND DECREASES IN OUR CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE REPORTED IN EQUITY SIMILAR TO TREASURY STOCK

TRANSACTIONS. IF A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY RESULTS IN

LOSS OF CONTROL AND DECONSOLIDATION, ANY RETAINED OWNERSHIP INTERESTS ARE

REMEASURED WITH THE GAIN OR LOSS REPORTED IN NET EARNINGS.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED ASC 808,

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

,

WHICH REQUIRES GROSS BASIS PRESENTATION OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES FOR PRINCIPAL

PARTICIPANTS IN COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND

ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENTS ENTER INTO COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS USED TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN CERTAIN

ENGINES, AERO-DERIVATIVES, AND TURBINES, UNDER WHICH GE AND THESE PARTICIPANTS

SHARE IN RISKS AND REWARDS OF THESE PRODUCT PROGRAMS. ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD

HAD NO EFFECT AS OUR HISTORICAL PRESENTATION HAD BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW

REQUIREMENTS.

WE

ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO ASC 320,

INVESTMENTS – DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES

, AND RECORDED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO INCREASE

RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF APRIL 1, 2009, OF $62 MILLION.

ON

JANUARY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO ASC 740,

INCOME TAXES

. AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE APPLICATION OF A “MORE LIKELY THAN NOT” THRESHOLD

TO THE RECOGNITION AND DERECOGNITION OF TAX POSITIONS AND REQUIRE RECALCULATION

OF RETURNS ON LEVERAGED LEASES WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OR PROJECTED

TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LEASES. THE

JANUARY 1, 2007 TRANSITION REDUCED OUR RETAINED EARNINGS BY $126 MILLION, $49

MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICATION OF A "MORE LIKELY THAN NOT" THRESHOLD TO

THE RECOGNITION AND DERECOGNITION OF TAX PROVISIONS AND $77 MILLION WITH THE

RECALCULATION OF RETURNS ON LEVERAGED LEASES. OF THIS TOTAL, $89 MILLION WAS A

DECREASE IN GOODWILL AND $77 MILLION WAS A DECREASE IN FINANCING RECEIVABLES –

NET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $40 MILLION DECREASE IN INCOME TAX

LIABILITIES.

NOTE 2. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AND

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE

ON

DECEMBER 3, 2009, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH COMCAST CORPORATION TO

TRANSFER THE ASSETS OF THE NBCU BUSINESS TO A NEWLY FORMED ENTITY, WHICH WILL

CONSIST OF OUR NBCU BUSINESSES AND COMCAST CORPORATION'S CABLE NETWORKS,

REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORKS, CERTAIN DIGITAL PROPERTIES AND CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED

INVESTMENTS. PURSUANT TO THE TRANSACTION, WE WILL RECEIVE $6,500 MILLION IN CASH

(SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON VARIOUS EVENTS BETWEEN CONTRACT SIGNING

AND CLOSING) AND WILL OWN A 49% INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED ENTITY. THE

TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS AND IS

EXPECTED TO CLOSE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR.

WE ALSO

ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WHEREBY WE WILL ACQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 38% OF VIVENDI’S

INTEREST IN NBCU FOR $2,000 MILLION ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2010, IF THE TRANSACTION

DESCRIBED ABOVE HAS NOT YET CLOSED. PROVIDED THE TRANSACTION SUBSEQUENTLY

CLOSES, WE WILL ACQUIRE THE REMAINING VIVENDI NBCU INTEREST FOR $3,578 MILLION

AND MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OF $222 MILLION RELATED TO THE PREVIOUSLY

PURCHASED SHARES. IF THE ENTITY FORMATION TRANSACTION CLOSES BEFORE SEPTEMBER

26, 2010, WE WILL PURCHASE VIVENDI’S ENTIRE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN NBCU (20%) FOR

$5,800 MILLION.

(101)

PRIOR TO

THE SALE, NBCU WILL BORROW APPROXIMATELY $9,100 MILLION FROM THIRD-PARTY LENDERS

AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH TO US. WE EXPECT TO REALIZE APPROXIMATELY $8,000 MILLION

IN CASH AFTER DEBT REDUCTION, TRANSACTION FEES AND THE BUYOUT OF THE VIVENDI

INTEREST IN NBCU.

WITH

RESPECT TO OUR 49% INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED ENTITY, WE WILL HOLD REDEMPTION

RIGHTS WHICH, IF EXERCISED, CAUSE THE ENTITY TO PURCHASE HALF OF OUR OWNERSHIP

INTEREST AFTER 3.5 YEARS AND THE REMAINING HALF AFTER 7 YEARS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

EXCEPTIONS, CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS. OUR INTEREST WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO

CALL PROVISIONS WHICH, IF EXERCISED, ALLOW COMCAST CORPORATION TO PURCHASE OUR

INTEREST AT SPECIFIED TIMES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THE REDEMPTION PRICE

FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS IS DETERMINED PURSUANT TO A FORMULA SPECIFIED IN THE

AGREEMENT.

WE HAVE

CLASSIFIED THE NBCU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $32,150 MILLION AND $5,751

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE MAJOR CLASSES

OF ASSETS ARE CURRENT RECEIVABLES ($2,136 MILLION), PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT – NET ($1,805 MILLION), GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS – NET

($21,574 MILLION) AND ALL OTHER ASSETS ($6,514 MILLION), INCLUDING FILM AND

TELEVISION PRODUCTION COSTS OF $4,507 MILLION. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF LIABILITIES

ARE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ($398 MILLION), OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES ($4,051 MILLION)

AND ALL OTHER LIABILITIES ($1,300 MILLION).

ON

NOVEMBER 12, 2009, WE COMMITTED TO SELL OUR SECURITY BUSINESS (WITHIN ENTERPRISE

SOLUTIONS), AND EXPECT TO COMPLETE THIS SALE IN EARLY 2010. ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF $1,780 MILLION AND $282 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

ON

JANUARY 7, 2009, WE EXCHANGED OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES IN AUSTRIA AND FINLAND,

THE CREDIT CARD AND AUTO BUSINESSES IN THE U.K., AND THE CREDIT CARD BUSINESS IN

IRELAND FOR A 100% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN INTERBANCA S.P.A., AN ITALIAN CORPORATE

BANK. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $7,887 MILLION AND $636 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008; WE RECOGNIZED A $184

MILLION LOSS, NET OF TAX, RELATED TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSETS HELD FOR

SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO

SELL.

ON

DECEMBER 24, 2008, WE COMMITTED TO SELL A PORTION OF OUR AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE BUSINESS, INCLUDING CERTAIN UNDERLYING MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES, AND

COMPLETED THIS SALE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. ASSETS OF $2,669 MILLION

WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 (LIABILITIES WERE

INSIGNIFICANT); WE RECOGNIZED A $38 MILLION LOSS, NET OF TAX, RELATED TO THE

CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS PRIMARILY COMPRISED GE MONEY JAPAN (OUR JAPANESE PERSONAL LOAN

BUSINESS, LAKE, AND OUR JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR

INVESTMENT IN GE NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD.), OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS (WMC) AND

PLASTICS. ASSOCIATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS

ARE SEPARATELY REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS

PRESENTED.

GE

MONEY JAPAN

DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL LAKE UPON DETERMINING

THAT, DESPITE RESTRUCTURING, JAPANESE REGULATORY LIMITS FOR INTEREST CHARGES ON

UNSECURED PERSONAL LOANS DID NOT PERMIT US TO EARN AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN. DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WHICH

INCLUDED LAKE, ALONG WITH OUR JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING

OUR INVESTMENT IN GE NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AN

AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $908 MILLION IN 2007 AND AN INCREMENTAL LOSS IN 2008 OF $361

MILLION. GE MONEY JAPAN REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $1 MILLION,

$763 MILLION AND $1,307 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. IN TOTAL,

GE MONEY JAPAN LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE $158

MILLION, $651 MILLION AND $1,220 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

WMC

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, WMC RETAINED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO

LOANS SOLD PRIOR TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WMC’S CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TO REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS AS TO WHICH THERE WAS AN EARLY

PAYMENT DEFAULT OR WITH RESPECT TO WHICH CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES WERE NOT MET. RESERVES RELATED TO THESE OBLIGATIONS WERE $205 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND $244 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE AMOUNT OF THESE

RESERVES IS BASED UPON PENDING AND ESTIMATED FUTURE LOAN REPURCHASE REQUESTS,

THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF LOANS VALIDLY TENDERED FOR REPURCHASE, AND OUR

ESTIMATED LOSSES ON LOANS REPURCHASED. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE

ESTIMATE THAT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL LOANS WE ORIGINATED AND SOLD WILL

BE TENDERED FOR REPURCHASE, AND OF THOSE TENDERED, ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT WILL

QUALIFY AS “VALIDLY TENDERED,” MEANING THE LOANS SOLD DID NOT SATISFY SPECIFIED

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THE AMOUNT OF OUR CURRENT RESERVE REPRESENTS OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF LOSSES WITH RESPECT TO OUR REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. HOWEVER, ACTUAL

LOSSES COULD EXCEED OUR RESERVE AMOUNT IF ACTUAL CLAIM RATES, VALID TENDERS OR

LOSSES WE INCUR ON REPURCHASED LOANS ARE HIGHER THAN HISTORICALLY OBSERVED. WMC

REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $2 MILLION, $(71) MILLION AND

$(1,424) MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. IN TOTAL, WMC’S LOSS FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WAS $1 MILLION, $41 MILLION AND $987

MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

GE

INDUSTRIAL EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE

$(18) MILLION, $40 MILLION AND $1,867 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

ASSETS

OF GE INDUSTRIAL DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $50 MILLION AND $64 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. LIABILITIES OF GE INDUSTRIAL

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $163 MILLION AND $189 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRIMARILY REPRESENT TAXES PAYABLE AND PENSION

LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE SALE OF OUR PLASTICS BUSINESS IN 2007.

WE ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO ASC 320 AND RECORDED A CUMULATIVE

EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO INCREASE RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF APRIL 1, 2009, OF $62

MILLION.

WE

REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUALITATIVE AND

QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA. WE PRESENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO SELL OUR DEBT SECURITIES

AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL

THESE SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR

AMORTIZED COST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EQUITY

SECURITIES WILL BE RECOVERED WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE VAST

MAJORITY OF OUR U.S. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES ARE RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE

MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. WE EVALUATE U.S. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES BASED ON A

VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR

THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND

COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. IN THE EVENT A U.S. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITY IS DEEMED

TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WE ISOLATE THE CREDIT PORTION OF THE

IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS TO

THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE SECURITY. WE DISCOUNT THE CASH FLOWS USING THE

ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF THE SECURITY.

(106)

THE VAST

MAJORITY OF OUR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS) HAVE

INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES AND ARE IN A

SENIOR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL. OF OUR TOTAL RMBS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, APPROXIMATELY $897 MILLION AND $1,310 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, RELATE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT, PRIMARILY SUPPORTING OUR

GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. THESE ARE COLLATERALIZED PRIMARILY BY POOLS OF

INDIVIDUAL, DIRECT MORTGAGE LOANS (A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE ORIGINATED IN 2006

AND 2005), NOT OTHER STRUCTURED PRODUCTS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, OF THE TOTAL RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT EXPOSURE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, APPROXIMATELY $768 MILLION AND $1,093 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WAS INSURED BY MONOLINE INSURERS (MONOLINES).

THE VAST

MAJORITY OF OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS) ALSO HAVE

INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES AND ARE IN A

SENIOR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL. OUR CMBS INVESTMENTS ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY BOTH DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF MORTGAGES THAT WERE ORIGINATED FOR

SECURITIZATION (CONDUIT CMBS) AND POOLS OF LARGE LOANS BACKED BY HIGH QUALITY

PROPERTIES (LARGE LOAN CMBS), A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND

2007.

FOR

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, INCLUDING RMBS, WE ESTIMATE THE PORTION OF LOSS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS

ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. ESTIMATES OF

CASH FLOWS CONSIDER INTERNAL CREDIT RISK, INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT

ASSUMPTIONS THAT INCORPORATE MANAGEMENT’S BEST ESTIMATE OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS,

INCLUDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITY AND PREPAYMENT RATES. FOR CMBS, WE

ESTIMATE THE PORTION OF LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT BY EVALUATING POTENTIAL

LOSSES ON EACH OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS IN THE SECURITY. COLLATERAL CASH FLOWS

ARE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE

DEAL. ASSUMPTIONS CAN VARY WIDELY DEPENDING UPON THE COLLATERAL TYPE, GEOGRAPHIC

CONCENTRATIONS AND VINTAGE.

IF THERE

HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN CASH FLOWS FOR RMBS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS SUCH AS MONOLINE INSURANCE (WHICH ARE FEATURES OF A SPECIFIC

SECURITY). IN EVALUATING THE OVERALL CREDIT WORTHINESS OF THE MONOLINE, WE USE

AN ANALYSIS THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH WE USE FOR CORPORATE BONDS,

INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE MONOLINE’S CASH RESERVES AND

CAPITAL, RATINGS ACTIVITY, WHETHER THE MONOLINE IS IN DEFAULT OR DEFAULT APPEARS

IMMINENT, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR INTERVENTION BY AN INSURANCE OR OTHER

REGULATOR.

DURING

THE PERIOD APRIL 1, 2009, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE RECORDED PRE-TAX,

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $780 MILLION, OF WHICH $455 MILLION WAS

RECORDED THROUGH EARNINGS ($42 MILLION RELATES TO EQUITY SECURITIES), AND $325

MILLION WAS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(AOCI).

PRIOR TO

APRIL 1, 2009, WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENTS IN EARNINGS OF $423 MILLION ASSOCIATED

WITH DEBT SECURITIES STILL HELD. AS OF APRIL 1, 2009, WE REVERSED PREVIOUSLY

RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENTS OF $99 MILLION ($62 MILLION AFTER TAX) AS AN ADJUSTMENT

TO RETAINED EARNINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO ASC 320. SUBSEQUENT TO

APRIL 1, 2009, WE RECOGNIZED FIRST TIME IMPAIRMENTS OF $108 MILLION AND

INCREMENTAL CHARGES ON PREVIOUSLY IMPAIRED SECURITIES OF $257 MILLION. THESE

AMOUNTS INCLUDED $124 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY

SOLD.

CONSISTED

OF LOANS AND FINANCING LEASES RELATED TO CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED, LIQUIDATING

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES.

GECS

FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE BOTH LOANS AND FINANCING LEASES. LOANS REPRESENT

TRANSACTIONS IN A VARIETY OF FORMS, INCLUDING REVOLVING CHARGE AND CREDIT,

MORTGAGES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, INTERMEDIATE-TERM LOANS AND REVOLVING LOANS

SECURED BY BUSINESS ASSETS. THE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES LOANS CARRIED AT THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT ON WHICH FINANCE CHARGES ARE BILLED PERIODICALLY, AND LOANS

CARRIED AT GROSS BOOK VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES FINANCE CHARGES.

INVESTMENT

IN FINANCING LEASES CONSISTS OF DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES OF

AIRCRAFT, RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK, AUTOS, OTHER TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, DATA

PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND OTHER

MANUFACTURING, POWER GENERATION, AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT AND

FACILITIES.

FOR

FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THE LEVERAGED LEASES AND THE MAJORITY OF THE DIRECT

FINANCING LEASES ARE LEASES IN WHICH GECS DEPRECIATES THE LEASED ASSETS AND IS

TAXED UPON THE ACCRUAL OF RENTAL INCOME. CERTAIN DIRECT FINANCING LEASES ARE

LOANS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS, GECS IS TAXABLE

ONLY ON THE PORTION OF EACH PAYMENT THAT CONSTITUTES INTEREST, UNLESS THE

INTEREST IS TAX-EXEMPT (E.G., CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF STATE

GOVERNMENTS).

INVESTMENT

IN DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES REPRESENTS NET UNPAID RENTALS AND

ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED EQUIPMENT, LESS RELATED

DEFERRED INCOME. GECS HAS NO GENERAL OBLIGATION FOR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTING THIRD-PARTY PARTICIPATION RELATED TO

LEVERAGED LEASES; SUCH NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN

LIABILITIES BUT HAVE BEEN OFFSET AGAINST THE RELATED RENTALS RECEIVABLE. THE

GECS SHARE OF RENTALS RECEIVABLE ON LEVERAGED LEASES IS SUBORDINATE TO THE SHARE

OF OTHER PARTICIPANTS WHO ALSO HAVE SECURITY INTERESTS IN THE LEASED

EQUIPMENT.

(110)

FOR

FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, GECS IS ENTITLED TO DEDUCT THE INTEREST EXPENSE

ACCRUING ON NONRECOURSE FINANCING RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES.

LOANS INCREASED BY $9,303 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO DECEMBER 31, 2009

PRIMARILY RELATING TO INCREASES AT REAL ESTATE ($5,678 MILLION) AND CLL ($2,697

MILLION). WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR REAL ESTATE LOANS FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE AND

LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS.  WE CLASSIFY REAL ESTATE LOANS AS IMPAIRED WHEN

THE MOST RECENT VALUATION REFLECTS A PROJECTED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO AT MATURITY

IN EXCESS OF 100%, EVEN IF THE LOAN IS CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH

CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE INCREASE IN IMPAIRED LOANS AND RELATED SPECIFIC RESERVES

AT REAL ESTATE REFLECTS OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF COLLATERAL VALUES OF THE

UNDERLYING PROPERTIES, AND OUR ESTIMATE OF LOANS WHICH ARE NOT PAST DUE, BUT FOR

WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT THE FULL PRINCIPAL

BALANCE AT MATURITY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE UNDERLYING VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL.

OF OUR $6,519 MILLION IMPAIRED LOANS AT REAL ESTATE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, $4,396

MILLION ARE CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE

LOAN. IMPAIRED LOANS AT CLL PRIMARILY REPRESENT SENIOR SECURED LENDING

POSITIONS.

INTERBANCA S.P.A. ($1,394 MILLION) AT CAPITAL FINANCE AND AIRFOILS TECHNOLOGIES

INTERNATIONAL – SINGAPORE PTE. LTD. (ATI-SINGAPORE) ($342 MILLION) AT TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE. DURING 2009, THE GOODWILL BALANCE INCREASED BY $128 MILLION

RELATED TO ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRIOR-YEAR ACQUISITIONS. THE

MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS WAS AN INCREASE OF $180 MILLION ASSOCIATED

WITH THE 2008 ACQUISITION OF CITICAPITAL AT CAPITAL FINANCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

A DECREASE OF $141 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2008 ACQUISITION OF HYDRIL

PRESSURE CONTROL BY ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. ALSO DURING 2009, GOODWILL BALANCES

DECREASED $19,730 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF NBCU AND OUR SECURITY

BUSINESS BEING CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE ($19,001 MILLION) AND ($1,077

MILLION), RESPECTIVELY, BY THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PTL ($634 MILLION) AT CAPITAL

FINANCE AND THE DISPOSITION OF 81% OF GE HOMELAND PROTECTION, INC. ($423

MILLION) AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR

($1,666 MILLION).

ON MARCH

20, 2009, WE INCREASED OUR OWNERSHIP IN ATI-SINGAPORE FROM 49% TO 100% AND

CONCURRENTLY ACQUIRED FROM THE SAME SELLER A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN

CERTAIN AFFILIATES. WE REMEASURED OUR PREVIOUS EQUITY INTERESTS TO FAIR VALUE,

RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $254 MILLION, WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER

INCOME.

ON JUNE

25, 2009, WE INCREASED OUR OWNERSHIP IN BAC FROM 49.99% TO 75% FOR A PURCHASE

PRICE OF $623 MILLION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS OF A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT. WE

REMEASURED OUR PREVIOUSLY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENT TO FAIR VALUE, RESULTING IN A

PRE-TAX GAIN OF $343 MILLION, WHICH IS REPORTED IN GECS REVENUES FROM

SERVICES.

GOODWILL

BALANCES INCREASED $3,694 MILLION IN 2008 FROM NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OF HYDRIL PRESSURE CONTROL ($725

MILLION) AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL ($643 MILLION) AT

CAPITAL FINANCE, VITAL SIGNS ($594 MILLION) AND WHATMAN PLC. ($592 MILLION) AT

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, BANK BPH ($470 MILLION) AT CAPITAL FINANCE, CDM

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, LTD. ($229 MILLION) AT CAPITAL FINANCE AND CITICAPITAL

($166 MILLION) AT CAPITAL FINANCE. DURING 2008, THE GOODWILL BALANCE INCREASED

BY $599 MILLION RELATED TO ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRIOR-YEAR

ACQUISITIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS WERE INCREASES OF $267

MILLION AND $171 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2007 ACQUISITIONS OF OXYGEN MEDIA

CORP. BY NBC UNIVERSAL AND SANYO ELECTRIC CREDIT CO., LTD. BY CAPITAL FINANCE,

RESPECTIVELY. IN 2008, GOODWILL BALANCES DECREASED $2,639 MILLION AS A RESULT OF

THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR.

UPON

CLOSING AN ACQUISITION, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ACQUIRED AND CONSOLIDATE THE ACQUISITION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. GIVEN THE TIME

IT TAKES TO OBTAIN PERTINENT INFORMATION TO FINALIZE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY’S

BALANCE SHEET, THEN TO ADJUST THE ACQUIRED COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES,

PROCEDURES, AND BOOKS AND RECORDS TO OUR STANDARDS, IT IS OFTEN SEVERAL QUARTERS

BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO FINALIZE THOSE INITIAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. ACCORDINGLY,

IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY

REVISED.

GIVEN

THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 AND

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AT THAT TIME, WE CONDUCTED

AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF THE CAPITAL FINANCE REPORTING UNITS DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 USING DATA AS OF JANUARY 1, 2009. AS A RESULT OF THESE

TESTS, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

WE

PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AT ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS

IN THE THIRD QUARTER USING DATA AS OF JULY 1, 2009. IN PERFORMING THE

VALUATIONS, WE USED CASH FLOWS THAT REFLECTED MANAGEMENT’S FORECASTS AND

DISCOUNT RATES THAT REFLECT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT MARKET. BASED

ON THE RESULTS OF OUR TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES AT EACH OF THE GE INDUSTRIAL

REPORTING UNITS AND THE CLL, CONSUMER, ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GECAS

REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR BOOK VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE

IMPAIRMENT TEST (IN WHICH FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED) WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED AND NO GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED. DUE TO THE VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

CURRENT COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT, WE USED A RANGE OF VALUATIONS TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE FOR OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT. WHILE THE REAL

ESTATE REPORTING UNIT’S BOOK VALUE WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF ITS FAIR VALUE, WE

FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED OUR REAL ESTATE GOODWILL BALANCE BY PERFORMING THE SECOND

STEP ANALYSIS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AS A RESULT OF OUR TESTS FOR REAL ESTATE, NO

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED. OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT HAD A

GOODWILL BALANCE OF $1,189 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

(118)

ESTIMATING

THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS INVOLVES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING

RESULTS. IF CURRENT CONDITIONS CHANGE FROM THOSE EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION

PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS

HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN

DEVELOPING FUTURE RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL BENEFIT PLANS' ASSETS,

WE EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AS WELL AS KEY ELEMENTS OF ASSET CLASS RETURNS

SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, YIELDS AND SPREADS ACROSS A NUMBER OF

POTENTIAL SCENARIOS. FOR THE PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, WE APPLY OUR EXPECTED RATE

OF RETURN TO A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS, WHICH STABILIZES VARIABILITY IN

THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH WE APPLY THAT EXPECTED RETURN.

WE

AMORTIZE EXPERIENCE GAINS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PLAN PROVISIONS OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE

AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES.

FUNDING POLICY

FOR THE GE

PENSION PLAN IS TO CONTRIBUTE AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET MINIMUM FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS AS SET FORTH IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND TAX LAWS PLUS SUCH ADDITIONAL

AMOUNTS AS WE MAY DETERMINE TO BE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE NOT MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THE GE PENSION PLAN SINCE 1987 AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2010.

IN 2010, WE EXPECT TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS UNDER

OUR GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF OUR PRINCIPAL

PENSION PLANS AND EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION TO OTHER

PENSION PLANS. IN 2009, COMPARATIVE AMOUNTS WERE $168 MILLION AND $676 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE GE PENSION TRUST AND OVERSEE ITS INVESTMENT ALLOCATION, WHICH INCLUDES

SELECTING INVESTMENT MANAGERS, COMMISSIONING PERIODIC ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES

AND SETTING LONG-TERM STRATEGIC TARGETS. LONG-TERM STRATEGIC INVESTMENT

OBJECTIVES INCLUDE PRESERVING THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN AND BALANCING RISK

AND RETURN. TARGET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES ARE ESTABLISHED AT AN ASSET CLASS

LEVEL BY PLAN FIDUCIARIES. TARGET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE GUIDELINES, NOT

LIMITATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PLAN FIDUCIARIES WILL APPROVE ALLOCATIONS ABOVE OR

BELOW A TARGET RANGE.

GE

PENSION TRUST ASSETS ARE INVESTED SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL

GUIDELINES.

·

SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES MUST GENERALLY BE RATED A1/P1 OR BETTER, EXCEPT FOR 15% OF SUCH

SECURITIES THAT MAY BE RATED A2/P2.

·

REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT EXCEED 25% OF TOTAL

ASSETS.

·

INVESTMENTS

IN RESTRICTED SECURITIES (EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS) THAT ARE NOT

FREELY TRADABLE MAY NOT EXCEED 30% OF TOTAL ASSETS (ACTUAL WAS 17% OF

TRUST ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009).

ACCORDING

TO STATUTE, THE AGGREGATE HOLDINGS OF ALL QUALIFYING EMPLOYER SECURITIES (E.G.,

GE COMMON STOCK) AND QUALIFYING EMPLOYER REAL PROPERTY MAY NOT EXCEED 10% OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF TRUST ASSETS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. GE SECURITIES REPRESENTED

3.3% AND 3.5% OF TRUST ASSETS AT YEAR-END 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE GE

PENSION PLAN HAS A BROADLY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES,

FIXED INCOME, PRIVATE EQUITIES, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS; THESE INVESTMENTS

ARE BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. IN NATURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, NO ONE SECTOR

CONCENTRATION OF ASSETS EXCEEDED 15% OF TOTAL GE PENSION PLAN

NOTE 13. ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

THIS

CAPTION INCLUDES LIABILITIES FOR VARIOUS ITEMS INCLUDING NON-CURRENT

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, DEFERRED INCOME, INTEREST ON TAX LIABILITIES,

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, ACCRUED PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUALS, ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION, ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRODUCT

WARRANTIES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS.

ACCRUALS

FOR NON-CURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AMOUNTED TO $24,921 MILLION AND

$22,543 MILLION FOR YEAR-END 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDE

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, PENSION ACCRUALS, AND OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT

ACCRUALS SUCH AS DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. THE INCREASE IN 2009 WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN PENSION ACCRUALS.

WE ARE

INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS

REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS EXCLUDE

POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND, WHEN DATES AND AMOUNTS OF SUCH COSTS ARE NOT

KNOWN, ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS

WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW END OF SUCH RANGE.

UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE STATUS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION

RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SITES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE

OF THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

EXPOSURE.

GE AND GECS FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.

THE GECS PROVISION FOR CURRENT TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES ITS EFFECT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED RETURN. THE EFFECT OF GECS ON THE CONSOLIDATED LIABILITY IS SETTLED

IN CASH AS GE TAX PAYMENTS ARE DUE.

CONSOLIDATED

U.S. EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES WERE $(498)

MILLION IN 2009, $2,659 MILLION IN 2008 AND $9,078 MILLION IN 2007. THE

CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS FOR NON-U.S.-BASED OPERATIONS WERE $10,842 MILLION IN

2009, $17,123 MILLION IN 2008 AND $18,450 MILLION IN 2007.

CONSOLIDATED

CURRENT TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES OF

A BENEFIT OF $886 MILLION AND $723 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND

EXPENSE OF $64 MILLION IN 2007, AND AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS

OF $2,416 MILLION, $3,060 MILLION AND $3,042 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. CONSOLIDATED DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

WERE A BENEFIT OF $2,423 MILLION AND $827 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY, AND EXPENSE OF $776 MILLION IN 2007.

DEFERRED

INCOME TAX BALANCES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES, AS WELL AS FROM

NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, AND ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX

RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN TAXES ARE ACTUALLY PAID OR RECOVERED.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES

PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF

THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE

EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING

STRATEGIES. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A

DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS

ESTABLISHED.

(133)

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE

AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO THESE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR TAX LIABILITY, RETURN ON INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS

OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GE’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE

BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS

TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION

DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX

ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO

THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL

TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE

EFFECTIVELY WITH FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2009, HAS BEEN

SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS ON FIVE PREVIOUS

OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN OCTOBER OF 2008. A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION WAS PASSED BY THE

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN 2009 AND THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND

RANKING MEMBER HAVE INDICATED AN INTENTION TO EXTEND THE PROVISION FOR ONE YEAR

RETROACTIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF 2010, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL

BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THE PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2009, THE CURRENT

U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE

EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2010.

WE HAVE

NOT PROVIDED U.S. DEFERRED TAXES ON CUMULATIVE EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES

AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS

RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WERE APPROXIMATELY $84

BILLION. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S.

OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT

PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE

PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. DEFERRED TAXES ARE

PROVIDED FOR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES WHEN WE

PLAN TO REMIT THOSE EARNINGS.

DURING

2009, FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN OUR EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS, FUNDING ACTIONS TAKEN

AND REVIEW OF OUR OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING, WE DETERMINED THAT

UNDISTRIBUTED PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF GECS, ON WHICH WE

HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. TAXES, WOULD BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED

OUTSIDE THE U.S. THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION, RESULTING

IN AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $700 MILLION IN 2009.

DURING

2008, BECAUSE THE USE OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS NO LONGER REQUIRED THE REPATRIATION

OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS, WE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS THAT WERE

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION,

RESULTING IN A DECREASE TO THE INCOME TAX PROVISION OF APPROXIMATELY $350

MILLION.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1, ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO ASC 740,

RESULTING IN A $49 MILLION DECREASE IN RETAINED EARNINGS, AN $89 MILLION

DECREASE IN GOODWILL AND A $40 MILLION DECREASE IN INCOME TAX

LIABILITY.

ANNUALLY,

WE FILE OVER 7,000 INCOME TAX RETURNS IN OVER 250 GLOBAL TAXING JURISDICTIONS.

WE ARE UNDER EXAMINATION OR ENGAGED IN TAX LITIGATION IN MANY OF THESE

JURISDICTIONS. DURING 2007, THE IRS COMPLETED THE AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S.

INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2000-2002. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE IRS WAS AUDITING OUR

CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2003-2007. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER

U.S. TAX DEFICIENCY ISSUES AND REFUND CLAIMS FOR PREVIOUS YEARS WERE UNRESOLVED.

IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE 2003-2005 U.S. AUDIT CYCLE WILL BE COMPLETED

DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR BALANCE OF

“UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS” – THAT IS, THE AGGREGATE TAX EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN TAX RETURN POSITIONS AND THE BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE

OUTCOME OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES OR CLAIMS IS LIKELY TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

MADE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES.

THE

BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, THE AMOUNT OF RELATED INTEREST AND

PENALTIES WE HAVE PROVIDED AND WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE RANGE OF REASONABLY

POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WERE.

TO ACCRETION OF REDEEMABLE SECURITIES TO THEIR REDEMPTION

(H)

ON

JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 810 THAT REQUIRES US TO

CLASSIFY NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS "MINORITY

INTEREST") AS PART OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND TO DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT OF

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.

CHANGES TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS DURING 2009 RESULTED FROM NET EARNINGS

$216 MILLION, DIVIDENDS PAID $(548) MILLION, DECONSOLIDATION OF PTL $(331)

MILLION, DISSOLUTION OF THE JOINT VENTURE IN FANUC LTD. $(376) MILLION,

AOCI $(95) MILLION AND OTHER CHANGES OF $32 MILLION. CHANGES TO THE

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF OTHER AOCI ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS WERE INSIGNIFICANT.

SHARES

OF GE PREFERRED STOCK

ON

OCTOBER 16, 2008, WE ISSUED 30,000 SHARES OF 10% CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

STOCK (PAR VALUE $1.00 PER SHARE) HAVING AN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION VALUE OF $3.0

BILLION, AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE 134,831,460 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (PAR VALUE

$0.06 PER SHARE) FOR AGGREGATE PROCEEDS OF $3.0 BILLION IN CASH. THE PROCEEDS

WERE ALLOCATED TO THE PREFERRED SHARES ($2.5 BILLION) AND THE WARRANTS ($0.5

BILLION) ON A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE BASIS AND RECORDED IN OTHER CAPITAL. THE

PREFERRED STOCK IS REDEEMABLE AT OUR OPTION THREE YEARS AFTER ISSUANCE AT A

PRICE OF 110% OF LIQUIDATION VALUE PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS. THE

WARRANTS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR FIVE YEARS AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $22.25 PER SHARE

OF COMMON STOCK AND ARE SETTLED THROUGH PHYSICAL SHARE ISSUANCE. UPON REDEMPTION

OF THE PREFERRED SHARES, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REDEMPTION AMOUNT AND THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE PREFERRED STOCK WILL BE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF

RETAINED EARNINGS AND CONSIDERED A DEEMED DIVIDEND FOR PURPOSES OF COMPUTING

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

WE

MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT AT THE DATE OF GRANT USING A

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE

OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $3.81, $5.26 AND $9.28,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN ARRIVING AT THE FAIR VALUE

OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY: RISK-FREE INTEREST

RATES OF 3.2%, 3.4% AND 4.2%; DIVIDEND YIELDS OF 3.9%, 4.4% AND 2.9%; EXPECTED

VOLATILITY OF 49%, 27% AND 25%; AND EXPECTED LIVES OF SIX YEARS AND TEN MONTHS,

SIX YEARS AND NINE MONTHS, AND SIX YEARS AND TEN MONTHS. RISK-FREE INTEREST

RATES REFLECT THE YIELD ON ZERO-COUPON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. EXPECTED

DIVIDEND YIELDS PRESUME A SET DIVIDEND RATE. FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2009

AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE USED A HISTORICAL FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE FOR THE

DIVIDEND YIELD. EXPECTED VOLATILITIES ARE BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITIES FROM

TRADED OPTIONS AND HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK. THE EXPECTED OPTION LIVES

ARE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF EMPLOYEE EXERCISE

BEHAVIOR.

THE

TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007 AMOUNTED

TO AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT, $45 MILLION AND $375 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WAS $597 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION

COST RELATED TO NONVESTED OPTIONS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A

WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF TWO YEARS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $191 MILLION, PRE

TAX, IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 2010.

(140)

STOCK

OPTION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS AMOUNTED TO $120 MILLION IN 2009 AND

$69 MILLION IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007. CASH RECEIVED FROM OPTION EXERCISES DURING

2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT, $353 MILLION AND $747 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2009,

2008 AND 2007 WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT, $15 MILLION AND $131 MILLION,

TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 2010. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, 1.0 MILLION PSUS WITH A

VALUE OF $14 MILLION AND $7 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST WERE

OUTSTANDING.

OTHER

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS AMOUNTED TO $127

THE

TOTAL INCOME TAX BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR ALL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS AMOUNTED TO $118 MILLION, $106 MILLION AND $118 MILLION IN 2009,

2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

WHEN

STOCK OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND RESTRICTED STOCK VESTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ASSUMED TAX BENEFIT AND THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT IS LOWER

THAN THE ESTIMATED TAX BENEFIT, THAT DIFFERENCE IS RECORDED IN EQUITY, TO THE

EXTENT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, OUR ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ANY FUTURE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED TAX BENEFITS FOR ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING

OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS.

ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND, THEREFORE, ARE INCLUDED IN THE

OF THIS TREATMENT HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT.

(A)

INCLUDED

AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS

PRESENTED AND AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT RELATED TO ACCRETION OF REDEEMABLE

FOR THE

MILLION, 204 MILLION AND 77 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUTSTANDING STOCK AWARDS

THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE

THEIR EFFECT WAS ANTIDILUTIVE.

(143)

EARNINGS-PER-SHARE

AMOUNTS ARE COMPUTED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, LOSS

FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET EARNINGS. AS A RESULT, THE SUM OF PER-SHARE

AMOUNTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MAY NOT EQUAL THE

TOTAL PER-SHARE AMOUNTS FOR NET EARNINGS.

NOTE 21. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE

ADOPTED ASC 820 IN TWO STEPS; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, WE ADOPTED IT FOR ALL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE

ON A RECURRING BASIS AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, FOR ALL NON-FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS. THIS GUIDANCE

ESTABLISHES A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS RELATED

DISCLOSURES. BROADLY, THE FRAMEWORK REQUIRES FAIR VALUE TO BE DETERMINED BASED

ON THE EXCHANGE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY (AN EXIT PRICE) IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET FOR THE

ASSET OR LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. IT

ALSO ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY BASED UPON OBSERVABLE AND

NON-OBSERVABLE INPUTS.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS. INCLUDED IN THE TABLES ARE INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $25,729

MILLION AND $21,967 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY,

PRIMARILY SUPPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO ANNUITANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS IN OUR RUN-OFF

INSURANCE OPERATIONS, AND $6,629 MILLION AND $8,190 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

AS A

MATTER OF POLICY, WE USE DERIVATIVES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, AND WE DO NOT

USE DERIVATIVES FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. A KEY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE FOR

OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES IS TO MITIGATE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK

BY SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEBT MATCH THE ASSETS THEY

ARE FUNDING. IF THE FORM (FIXED VERSUS FLOATING) AND CURRENCY DENOMINATION OF

THE DEBT WE ISSUE DO NOT MATCH THE RELATED ASSETS, WE TYPICALLY EXECUTE

DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE NATURE AND TENOR OF FUNDING TO MEET THIS OBJECTIVE.

THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER WE ENTER INTO A DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION OR ISSUE

DEBT DIRECTLY TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING CUSTOMER NEEDS FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF FINANCING, AND MARKET RELATED

FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE TYPE OF DEBT WE CAN ISSUE.

(149)

OF THE

OUTSTANDING NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $353,000 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 87% OR $307,000

MILLION, IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY

OR MARKET RISK BETWEEN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES. THE REMAINING DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATE TO

HEDGING AGAINST ADVERSE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES

RELATED TO ANTICIPATED SALES AND PURCHASES, PROVIDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVES AND/OR

SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTS CONTAINING CERTAIN CLAUSES

WHICH MEET THE ACCOUNTING DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE. THE INSTRUMENTS USED IN

THESE ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN PRACTICABLE. WHEN WE ARE NOT ABLE

TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, OR WHEN THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE BOTH

RECORDED IN EARNINGS CURRENTLY, THE DERIVATIVES ARE DEEMED ECONOMIC HEDGES AND

HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED. THIS MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURS WHEN WE HEDGE A

RECOGNIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION (E.G., A RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE) WITH A

DERIVATIVE. SINCE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES ARE REFLECTED

CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS FOR BOTH THE DERIVATIVE AND THE TRANSACTION, THE ECONOMIC

HEDGE DOES NOT REQUIRE HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES, BY

CONTRACT TYPE, SEPARATING THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES AND THOSE THAT ARE

NOT.

FAIR

VALUE HEDGES

WE USE

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE EFFECTS

OF INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON LOCAL AND NON-FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS. FOR RELATIONSHIPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS

ALONG WITH OFFSETTING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED DEBT.

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009, SUCH ADJUSTMENTS INCREASED THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF

DEBT OUTSTANDING BY $3,675 MILLION. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION

CASH

FLOW HEDGES AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE USE

INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE THE

VARIABILITY OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABLE RATE

BORROWINGS AND COMMERCIAL PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING COMMODITIES.

FOR DERIVATIVES THAT ARE DESIGNATED IN A CASH FLOW HEDGING RELATIONSHIP, THE

EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF AOCI AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE

EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE DERIVATIVE

AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME CAPTION IN THE STATEMENT OF

EARNINGS. HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS AND COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED

IN EARNINGS EACH REPORTING PERIOD.

WE USE

CURRENCY EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES TO PROTECT OUR NET INVESTMENTS IN GLOBAL

OPERATIONS CONDUCTED IN NON-U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCIES. FOR DERIVATIVES THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION, WE ASSESS

EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON CHANGES IN SPOT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. CHANGES IN SPOT

RATES ON THE DERIVATIVE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF AOCI UNTIL SUCH TIME AS

THE FOREIGN ENTITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED OR SOLD. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE

OF THE FORWARD POINTS, WHICH REFLECTS THE INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE

TWO COUNTRIES ON THE DERIVATIVE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT

AND ARE RECORDED CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS.

OF THE TOTAL PRE-TAX AMOUNT RECORDED IN AOCI, $2,587 MILLION

RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS OF WHICH WE EXPECT TO

TRANSFER $1,402 MILLION TO EARNINGS AS AN EXPENSE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS

CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE RELATED FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS. IN 2009, WE RECOGNIZED INSIGNIFICANT GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO

HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT DID NOT OCCUR BY THE

END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE MAXIMUM TERM

OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS WAS 26 YEARS AND

RELATED TO HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL

DEBT.

FOR CASH

FLOW HEDGES, THE AMOUNT OF INEFFECTIVENESS IN THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AND

AMOUNT OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

THE MEASUREMENT OF INEFFECTIVENESS ARE BOTH REFLECTED IN EARNINGS EACH REPORTING

PERIOD. THESE AMOUNTS TOTALED $49 MILLION, OF WHICH $(18) MILLION REPRESENTS

AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND PRIMARILY APPEAR IN "GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES."

INEFFECTIVENESS FROM NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WAS $(899) MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE FORWARD

POINTS. THESE AMOUNTS APPEAR IN THE “INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES”

CAPTION IN THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.

FREE-STANDING

DERIVATIVES

CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED

IN EARNINGS EACH PERIOD. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THESE DERIVATIVES ARE TYPICALLY

ENTERED INTO AS ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES, COMMODITY PRICES AND OTHER RISKS. GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE

DERIVATIVE ARE RECORDED IN PREDEFINED CAPTIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS,

TYPICALLY “GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES” OR “OTHER INCOME,” BASED ON OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICY. IN GENERAL, THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE ITEM THAT REPRESENT

THE ECONOMIC RISK EXPOSURE ARE RECORDED IN THE SAME CAPTION AS THE DERIVATIVE.

GAINS FOR 2009 ON DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WERE $1,018 MILLION AND

RELATED TO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS OF $208 MILLION, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

OF $499 MILLION, AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OF $311 MILLION. THE VAST

MAJORITY OF THE $1,018 MILLION WAS OFFSET BY THE EARNINGS EFFECTS FROM THE

UNDERLYING ITEMS THAT WERE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED.

(152)

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

FAIR

VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED

ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN OUR

POSITIONS.  ACCORDINGLY, WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE EXPOSURES AND TAKE

APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE.  WE MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

(THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL DEFAULT AND NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING

TO THE TERMS OF OUR STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS) ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY

BASIS. WHERE WE HAVE AGREED TO NETTING OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES WITH A

COUNTERPARTY, WE OFFSET OUR EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND APPLY THE VALUE

OF COLLATERAL POSTED TO US TO DETERMINE THE EXPOSURE. WHEN NET EXPOSURE TO A

COUNTERPARTY, BASED ON THE CURRENT MARKET VALUES OF AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL,

EXCEEDS CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS (SEE FOLLOWING TABLE), WE TYPICALLY TAKE ACTION

TO REDUCE SUCH EXPOSURES. THESE ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PROHIBITING ADDITIONAL

TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, REQUIRING ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM THE

COUNTERPARTY (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND TERMINATING OR RESTRUCTURING

TRANSACTIONS.

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN CERTAIN OF OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT

REQUIRE COUNTERPARTIES TO POST COLLATERAL (TYPICALLY, CASH OR U.S. TREASURIES)

WHEN OUR RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE COUNTERPARTY, MEASURED AT CURRENT MARKET VALUE,

EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED LIMIT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES,

NET OF COLLATERAL WE HOLD, WAS $1,196 MILLION.  THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH

COLLATERAL WAS $8,454 MILLION, OF WHICH $2,387 MILLION WAS CASH AND $6,067

MILLION WAS IN THE FORM OF SECURITIES HELD BY A CUSTODIAN FOR OUR BENEFIT. UNDER

CERTAIN OF THESE SAME AGREEMENTS, WE POST COLLATERAL TO OUR COUNTERPARTIES FOR

OUR DERIVATIVE OBLIGATIONS, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH WAS $1,855 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

ADDITIONALLY,

OUR STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS

THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM

CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3. IN CERTAIN OF THESE

MASTER AGREEMENTS, EACH PARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE

SHORT-TERM RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. THE NET AMOUNT

RELATING TO OUR DERIVATIVE LIABILITY OF $3,657 MILLION SUBJECT TO THESE

PROVISIONS, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY US, WAS $1,281 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

(153)

SUPPORT

OF CUSTOMER DERIVATIVES

WE DO

NOT SELL PROTECTION UNDER CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS; HOWEVER, AS PART OF OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT SERVICES, WE PROVIDE CERTAIN SUPPORT AGREEMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING PLAIN VANILLA INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES TO OUR

CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH VARIABLE RATE LOANS WE HAVE EXTENDED TO THEM. THE

UNDERWRITING RISK TO OUR CUSTOMERS INHERENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS, TOGETHER WITH

THE RELATED LOANS, IS ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF A FIXED RATE LOAN. UNDER

THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATION TO US IS SECURED, USUALLY BY THE

ASSET BEING PURCHASED OR FINANCED, OR BY OTHER ASSETS OF THE CUSTOMER. IN

ADDITION, THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE UNDERWRITTEN TO PROVIDE FOR COLLATERAL VALUE

THAT EXCEEDS THE COMBINATION OF THE LOAN AMOUNT AND THE INITIAL EXPECTED FUTURE

EXPOSURE OF THE DERIVATIVE. THESE SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS MATURE ON THE SAME DATE

AS THE RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS AND ARE ACROSS A BROAD

SPECTRUM OF DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES. THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS WAS $24 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. BECAUSE WE ARE SUPPORTING THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE CUSTOMER UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS AT

ANY POINT IN TIME IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CUSTOMER’S DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE IN A LIABILITY POSITION. THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF CUSTOMER

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN A LIABILITY POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WAS $260

MILLION BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF ANY OFFSETTING EFFECT OF COLLATERAL. AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, COLLATERAL VALUE WAS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE LOAN AMOUNT AND THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE CUSTOMER’S DERIVATIVE, IN THE EVENT WE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO

PERFORM UNDER THE DERIVATIVE. IF WE ASSUMED THAT, ON JANUARY 1, 2010, INTEREST

RATES MOVED UNFAVORABLY BY 100 BASIS POINTS ACROSS THE YIELD CURVE (A “PARALLEL

SHIFT” IN THAT CURVE), THE EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH CONTRACTS, WITHOUT

CONSIDERING ANY POTENTIAL OFFSET OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WOULD HAVE BEEN

AN INCREASE OF $120 MILLION. GIVEN OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, WE BELIEVE THAT

THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS IS

REMOTE.

NOTE 23. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE

SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO IMPROVE SHAREOWNER RETURNS. THE

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WE ENGAGE IN ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BEYOND IMPROVING RETURNS, THESE SECURITIZATION

TRANSACTIONS SERVE AS ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES FOR A VARIETY OF DIVERSIFIED

LENDING AND SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE USED BOTH

GE-SUPPORTED AND THIRD-PARTY VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) TO EXECUTE

OFF-BALANCE SHEET SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS FUNDED IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

TERM MARKETS. THE LARGEST SINGLE CATEGORY OF VIES THAT WE ARE INVOLVED WITH ARE

QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES), WHICH HAVE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS

THAT EXCLUDE THEM FROM THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION STANDARDS. INVESTORS IN THESE

ENTITIES ONLY HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE ENTITY AND NOT TO OUR

GENERAL CREDIT, UNLESS NOTED BELOW. WE DO NOT HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS

WITH ANY VIE OR QSPE. WE DID NOT PROVIDE NON-CONTRACTUAL SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY

TRANSFERRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES TO ANY VIE OR QSPE IN 2009 OR

2008.

VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES

WHEN

EVALUATING WHETHER WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE, AND MUST THEREFORE

CONSOLIDATE THE ENTITY, WE PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE

DESIGN OF THE VIE, THE NATURE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT AND THE VARIABLE INTERESTS HELD

BY OTHER PARTIES. IF THAT EVALUATION IS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHICH PARTY ABSORBS A

MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY’S EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS, A QUANTITATIVE

ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHO IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

IN 2009,

THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2009-16 AND ASU 2009-17 AMENDMENTS TO ASC 860,

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING

, AND

ASC 810,

CONSOLIDATION

,

RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JANUARY 1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 WILL

ELIMINATE THE QSPE CONCEPT, AND ASU 2009-17 WILL REQUIRE THAT ALL SUCH ENTITIES

BE EVALUATED FOR CONSOLIDATION AS VIES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN OUR CONSOLIDATING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FORMER QSPES. UPON ADOPTION WE WILL RECORD ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AT CARRYING AMOUNTS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY

WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSOLIDATED, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE

REVERSAL OF A PORTION OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SECURITIZATION GAINS AS A

CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

(154)

CONSOLIDATED

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

ON JULY

1, 2003 AND JANUARY 1, 2004, WE WERE REQUIRED, AS A RESULT OF AMENDMENTS TO U.S.

GAAP, TO CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN VIES WITH AGGREGATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $54.0

BILLION AND $52.6 BILLION RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE VIES, AND ADDITIONAL VIES

CONSOLIDATED AS A RESULT OF SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS OF FINANCIAL COMPANIES,

TOTALED $16,994 MILLION AND $15,231 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE $26,865 MILLION AND $21,428 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY).

THE

CONSOLIDATED VIES INCLUDED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.

·

SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES THAT HOLD FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS. SINCE

THEY WERE CONSOLIDATED IN 2003, THESE ASSETS HAVE CONTINUED TO RUN OFF;

TOTALED $2,608 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009; AND ARE PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN

NOTE 6 ($4,000 MILLION IN 2008). THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND OUR ON-BOOK

RECEIVABLES ON A BLENDED BASIS. THE LIABILITIES OF THESE SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, TOTALED $2,504

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND ARE INCLUDED IN NOTE 10 ($3,868 MILLION

IN 2008). CONTRACTUALLY THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES

MUST FIRST BE USED TO PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND INTEREST

THEREON AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES OF THE ENTITY. EXCESS CASH FLOWS ARE

AVAILABLE TO GE. THE CREDITORS OF THESE ENTITIES HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE

OTHER ASSETS OF GE.

IF

THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL OR THESE ENTITIES WERE REDUCED

BELOW A–1/P–1, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE LIQUIDITY FOR

THOSE ENTITIES OR PROVIDE FUNDS TO RETIRE THE OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL

PAPER. THE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IN THE

EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS DETERMINED BY CONTRACT, AND TOTALED $2,497

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE BORROWINGS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE

REFLECTED IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION.

·

TRINITY,

A GROUP OF SPONSORED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, HOLDS INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE INVESTMENT GRADE, FUNDED BY THE

ISSUANCE OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THESE

ENTITIES HELD $6,629 MILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, INCLUDED IN NOTE 3,

AND $716 MILLION OF CASH AND OTHER ASSETS ($8,190 MILLION AND $1,001

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008). THE ASSOCIATED GUARANTEED

INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES, INCLUDED IN NOTE 11, WERE $8,310 MILLION

AND $10,828 MILLION AT THE END OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

IF

THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR

ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GE CAPITAL WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY $2,383 MILLION TO SUCH ENTITIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 PURSUANT TO LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY GE CAPITAL. TO

THE EXTENT THAT THE ENTITIES’ LIABILITIES EXCEED THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF THE

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THEIR ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT DRAWN UNDER THE

LETTERS OF CREDIT, GE CAPITAL COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUCH EXCESS

AMOUNT. AS THE BORROWINGS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE ALREADY REFLECTED IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN

OUR DEBT IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE VALUE OF

THESE ENTITIES’ LIABILITIES WAS $8,519 MILLION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THEIR

ASSETS WAS $7,345 MILLION (WHICH INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENT

SECURITIES OF $1,448 MILLION). WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, WE INTEND TO HOLD THEM AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEIR

INDIVIDUAL FAIR VALUES EXCEED THEIR AMORTIZED COST AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY

TO HOLD ALL SUCH DEBT SECURITIES UNTIL

MATURITY.

THE

REMAINING ASSETS ($7,040 MILLION) AND LIABILITIES ($4,208 MILLION) OF

CONSOLIDATED VIES ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TRANSACTIONS BY ACQUIRED ENTITIES;

ASSET-BACKED FINANCING INVOLVING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND EQUIPMENT COLLATERAL

AND ON-BALANCE SHEET SECURITIZATIONS BY GE. WE HAVE NO RECOURSE ARRANGEMENTS

WITH THESE ENTITIES.

(155)

UNCONSOLIDATED

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

OUR

INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED VIES CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.

ASSISTING IN THE FORMATION AND FINANCING OF AN ENTITY, PROVIDING RECOURSE AND/OR

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT, SERVICING THE ASSETS AND RECEIVING VARIABLE FEES FOR SERVICES

PROVIDED. THE CLASSIFICATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OUR VARIABLE

INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY. AS DESCRIBED

BELOW, OUR RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION-RELATED VIES AND QSPES IS

REPORTED IN FINANCING RECEIVABLES OR INVESTMENT SECURITIES DEPENDING ON ITS

LEGAL FORM. VARIABLE INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS AND CORPORATE ENTITIES WOULD BE

CLASSIFIED AS EITHER EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD INVESTMENTS.

IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES IN WHICH WE ARE NOT

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, BUT MAY HOLD A VARIABLE INTEREST SUCH AS LIMITED

PARTNER EQUITY INTERESTS OR MEZZANINE DEBT INVESTMENT. THESE INVESTMENTS TOTALED

$9,680 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2009 AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN TWO CAPTIONS IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: “ALL OTHER ASSETS” FOR INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

EQUITY METHOD, AND “GECS FINANCING RECEIVABLES” FOR DEBT FINANCING PROVIDED TO

THESE ENTITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, “ALL OTHER ASSETS” TOTALED $8,911 MILLION

($2,919 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008) AND FINANCING RECEIVABLES, INCLUDED IN

NOTE 6, TOTALED $769 MILLION ($1,045 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008). IN ADDITION

TO OUR EXISTING INVESTMENTS, WE HAVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO FUND ADDITIONAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES OF $1,396 MILLION ($1,159 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008). TOGETHER, THESE REPRESENT OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IF

THE ASSETS OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES WERE TO HAVE NO VALUE.

THE

LARGEST UNCONSOLIDATED VIE WITH WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED IS PTL, WHICH IS A RENTAL

TRUCK LEASING JOINT VENTURE. THE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

PTL AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WERE $7,444 MILLION AND $1,339 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE SOLD A 1% LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN PTL, A PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED VIE, TO PENSKE TRUCK

LEASING CORPORATION, THE GENERAL PARTNER OF PTL, WHOSE MAJORITY SHAREOWNER IS A

MEMBER OF GE’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE DISPOSITION OF THE SHARES, COUPLED WITH

OUR RESULTING MINORITY POSITION ON THE PTL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND RELATED

CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS, RESULTED IN THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PTL. WE

RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF $296 MILLION, INCLUDING A GAIN ON THE

REMEASUREMENT OF OUR RETAINED INVESTMENT OF $189 MILLION. THE MEASUREMENT OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INVESTMENT IN PTL WAS BASED ON A METHODOLOGY THAT

INCORPORATED BOTH DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW INFORMATION AND MARKET DATA. IN APPLYING

THIS METHODOLOGY, WE UTILIZED DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING ACTUAL

OPERATING RESULTS, FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS AND MARKET

OBSERVABLE PRICING MULTIPLES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES. THE RESULTING FAIR VALUE

REFLECTED OUR POSITION AS A NONCONTROLLING SHAREOWNER AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE

TRANSACTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT IN PTL OF $5,751

MILLION COMPRISED A 49.9% PARTNERSHIP INTEREST OF $923 MILLION AND LOANS AND

ADVANCES OF $4,828 MILLION.

OTHER

THAN THOSE ENTITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ALSO HOLD PASSIVE INVESTMENTS IN RMBS,

CMBS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY ENTITIES THAT MAY BE EITHER VIES OR

QSPES. SUCH INVESTMENTS WERE, BY DESIGN, INVESTMENT GRADE AT ISSUANCE AND HELD

BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF INVESTORS. AS WE HAVE NO FORMAL INVOLVEMENT IN SUCH

ENTITIES BEYOND OUR INVESTMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT WE

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THEM. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH

INVESTMENTS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 3.

SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES

WE

TRANSFER ASSETS TO QSPES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS PART OF OUR

ONGOING SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. IN OUR SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, WE

TRANSFER ASSETS TO A QSPE AND RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF CASH AND RETAINED

INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED. THE QSPE SELLS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE

ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS, TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE

ASSETS.

THE

FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN OUR QSPES HAVE SIMILAR RISKS AND CHARACTERISTICS TO OUR

ON-BOOK FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND WERE UNDERWRITTEN TO THE SAME STANDARD.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ASSETS HAS BEEN SIMILAR TO OUR ON-BOOK

FINANCING RECEIVABLES; HOWEVER, THE BLENDED PERFORMANCE OF THE POOLS OF

RECEIVABLES IN OUR QSPES REFLECTS THE ELIGIBILITY SCREENING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE

APPLY TO DETERMINE WHICH RECEIVABLES ARE SELECTED FOR SALE. THEREFORE, THE

BLENDED PERFORMANCE CAN DIFFER FROM THE ON-BOOK PERFORMANCE.

(156)

WHEN WE

SECURITIZE FINANCING RECEIVABLES WE RETAIN INTERESTS IN THE TRANSFERRED

RECEIVABLES IN TWO FORMS: A SELLER’S INTEREST IN THE ASSETS OF THE QSPE, WHICH

WE CLASSIFY AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES, AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS

OF THE QSPE, WHICH WE CLASSIFY AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES. IN CERTAIN CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES TRUSTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM FREE EQUITY

(SUBORDINATED INTEREST) OF 4% OR 7% DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT RATING OF GE

CAPITAL.

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES

IN

CONNECTION WITH SOME SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, THE QSPES USE DERIVATIVES TO

MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK BETWEEN THE ASSETS THEY OWN AND LIABILITIES THEY

ISSUE. IN SUCH INSTANCES, AT THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, THE QSPE WILL

ENTER INTO A DERIVATIVE THAT GENERALLY REQUIRES THE PAYMENT OF A FIXED RATE OF

INTEREST TO A COUNTERPARTY IN EXCHANGE FOR A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST IN ORDER

TO ELIMINATE INTEREST RATE, AND IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, PAYMENT SPEED VOLATILITY.

IN SOME CASES, A GE ENTITY IS THE COUNTERPARTY TO A QSPE'S DERIVATIVE; THE FAIR

VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVES WAS A NET ASSET OF $454 MILLION AND $752 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IN SUCH CASES, A SECOND DERIVATIVE IS

EXECUTED WITH A THIRD PARTY TO MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE THE EXPOSURE CREATED BY THE

FIRST DERIVATIVE.

SERVICING ACTIVITIES

AS PART

OF A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION, WE MAY PROVIDE SERVICING IN EXCHANGE FOR A

MARKET-BASED FEE THAT IS DETERMINED ON PRINCIPAL BALANCES. WHERE THE FEE DOES

NOT REPRESENT MARKET-BASED COMPENSATION FOR THESE SERVICES, A SERVICING ASSET OR

LIABILITY IS RECORDED, AS APPROPRIATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SERVICING ASSET OR

LIABILITY IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT, PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. SERVICING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS IN PROPORTION TO AND OVER THE

PERIOD OF SERVICING ACTIVITY. THE AMOUNT OF OUR SERVICING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. WE RECEIVED SERVICING FEES FROM

QSPES OF $608 MILLION, $641 MILLION AND $566 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

WHEN WE

PROVIDE SERVICING WE ARE CONTRACTUALLY PERMITTED TO COMMINGLE CASH COLLECTED

FROM CUSTOMERS ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES SOLD TO INVESTORS WITH OUR OWN CASH

PRIOR TO PAYMENT TO A QSPE PROVIDED OUR CREDIT RATING DOES NOT FALL BELOW LEVELS

SPECIFIED IN EACH OF OUR SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. BASED ON OUR CURRENT CREDIT

RATING WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY RESTRICTION TO COMMINGLING CASH UNDER THESE

ARRANGEMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCLUDED $5,007

MILLION AND $4,446 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING OBLIGATIONS TO QSPES FOR

COLLECTIONS RECEIVED IN OUR CAPACITY AS SERVICER FROM OBLIGORS OF THE

QSPES.

INCLUDED

IN OTHER GECS RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, WERE $3,526 MILLION AND

$2,346 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO AMOUNTS OWED BY QSPES TO GE,

PRINCIPALLY FOR THE PURCHASE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS.

GUARANTEES

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE WERE COMMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS

BEYOND THOSE PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF QSPES AND VIES. SEE NOTE 23.

·

CREDIT SUPPORT.

WE HAVE

PROVIDED $7,597 MILLION OF CREDIT SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

OR ASSOCIATED COMPANIES, PREDOMINANTLY JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS,

USING ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE

GUARANTEES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ENABLE THESE CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATED

COMPANIES TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS OR OBTAIN DESIRED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

WITH THIRD PARTIES. SHOULD THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY FAIL TO

PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, WE

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THEIR BEHALF. UNDER MOST SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS, OUR GUARANTEE IS SECURED, USUALLY BY THE ASSET BEING

PURCHASED OR FINANCED, OR POSSIBLY BY CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS OF THE CUSTOMER

OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY. THE LENGTH OF THESE CREDIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS

PARALLELS THE LENGTH OF THE RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR

TRANSACTIONS. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CREDIT SUPPORT WAS $43 MILLION FOR

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

·

INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS.

THESE ARE AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO FUND UP TO $353

MILLION UNDER RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES ON A VARIETY OF LEASED EQUIPMENT.

UNDER MOST OF OUR RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES, OUR COMMITMENT IS SECURED BY

THE LEASED ASSET AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE LIABILITY FOR THESE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WAS $15 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE HAD

$1,532 MILLION OF OTHER INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS ARISING PRIMARILY FROM

SALES OF BUSINESSES OR ASSETS.

(160)

·

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION.

THESE ARE AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION TO THE SELLER IF CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED CONDITIONS

RELATED TO THE ACQUIRED ENTITY ARE ACHIEVED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD

TOTAL MAXIMUM EXPOSURE, EXCLUDING GE MONEY JAPAN, FOR FUTURE ESTIMATED

PAYMENTS OF $58 MILLION, OF WHICH NONE WAS EARNED AND

PAYABLE.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WE REDUCED THE PROCEEDS ON THE

SALE FOR ESTIMATED INTEREST REFUND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE STATUTORY

INTEREST RATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE MAY BE INCREASED OR DECREASED BASED

ON THE ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE

AGREEMENT, AND WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED UNLESS TOTAL CLAIMS AS CALCULATED

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT EXCEED APPROXIMATELY $3,000 MILLION.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, WE ACCRUED $132 MILLION, WHICH

REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH WE EXPECT CLAIMS TO EXCEED THOSE LEVELS AND

IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL AND RECENT CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AND THE ESTIMATED

FUTURE REQUESTS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE ABILITY AND LIKELIHOOD OF

CUSTOMERS TO MAKE CLAIMS AND OTHER INDUSTRY RISK FACTORS. UNCERTAINTIES

AROUND THE STATUS OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND LACK OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A

MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE POSSIBLE CLAIMS EXPOSURE. WE WILL

CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR ESTIMATED EXPOSURE QUARTERLY, AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

WHEN REQUIRED.

OUR

GUARANTEES ARE PROVIDED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE UNDERWRITE THESE

GUARANTEES CONSIDERING ECONOMIC, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK OF THE COUNTERPARTY.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

LIQUIDITY. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR GUARANTEES AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE,

GENERALLY THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVED, OR IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE A PREMIUM,

THE AMOUNT BASED ON APPRAISAL, OBSERVED MARKET VALUES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

ANY ASSOCIATED EXPECTED RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER

RECEIVABLES, NOT NETTED AGAINST THE LIABILITIES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE CALLED UPON TO

PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IS REMOTE.
