JANUARY 28, 2011, WE HOLD A 49% INTEREST IN A MEDIA ENTITY THAT INCLUDES THE NBC UNIVERSAL BUSINESSES. SEE THE NBC UNIVERSAL SECTION OF THIS ITEM FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1892, WE HAVE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW

TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED AND CHANGED CONSIDERABLY THE SCOPE OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES,

WE ENCOUNTER AGGRESSIVE AND ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT, IN

GENERAL, WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK, WHICH BECAME PART OF THE MEDIA ENTITY REFERRED TO ABOVE AS OF JANUARY 28, 2011, IS A MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST

TELEVISION NETWORK. NBC UNIVERSAL ALSO COMPETES WITH OTHER FILM AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, CABLE/SATELLITE TELEVISION NETWORKS AND THEME PARK OPERATORS. THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH GECS ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM

VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, THRIFTS, INVESTMENT BANKS, BROKER-DEALERS, CREDIT UNIONS, LEASING COMPANIES, CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES, INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES AND FINANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH

MANUFACTURERS.

GE CAPITAL HAS COMMUNICATED

ITS GOAL OF REDUCING ITS ENDING NET INVESTMENT (ENI). TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE ARE MORE AGGRESSIVELY FOCUSING OUR BUSINESSES ON SELECTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS WHERE WE HAVE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, BROAD DISTRIBUTION, AND THE ABILITY TO EARN A

CONSISTENT RETURN ON CAPITAL, WHILE MANAGING OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET SIZE AND RISK. WE HAVE A STRATEGY OF EXITING THOSE BUSINESSES WHERE WE ARE UNDERPERFORMING OR THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE NON-STRATEGIC. WE HAVE COMPLETED A NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS IN

OUR BUSINESSES IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPTIONS GOING FORWARD.

THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES IN AUSTRIA AND FINLAND, OUR CREDIT CARD AND AUTO BUSINESSES IN THE U.K. AND OUR CREDIT CARD BUSINESS IN IRELAND.

HISTORICALLY,

WE HAVE OPERATED IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, LEASING COMPANIES, FINANCING COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURERS, AND INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES. COMPETITION RELATED TO OUR

LENDING AND LEASING OPERATIONS IS BASED ON PRICE, THAT IS, INTEREST RATES AND FEES, AS WELL AS DEAL STRUCTURE AND TERMS. MORE RECENTLY, COMPETITION HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO AND AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL AND A

REDUCED NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. PROFITABILITY IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY BY BROAD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT CUSTOMER CREDIT QUALITY AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL FUNDING, BUT ALSO BY SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, OPERATING RISK AND

MARKET RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS. SUCCESS REQUIRES HIGH QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, CUSTOMER AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, DIVERSIFICATION, SERVICE AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, STRONG COLLATERAL AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE, DEAL STRUCTURING EXPERTISE AND THE ABILITY TO REDUCE COSTS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTIVITY.

REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT SPENT TO IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

OUR OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE

THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.2 BILLION IN 2010, $0.3 BILLION IN 2009 AND

$0.2 BILLION IN 2008. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $0.4 BILLION FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO

DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENT FROM THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE CONSENT DECREE PROVIDED THAT THE DREDGING WOULD BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES. PHASE 1 WAS COMPLETED IN MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009. BETWEEN PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 THERE WAS AN INTERVENING

PEER REVIEW BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF NATIONAL EXPERTS. THE PANEL EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF PHASE 1 DREDGING OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO PHASE 1 ENGINEERING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE STANDARDS. ON

DECEMBER 17, 2010, EPA ISSUED ITS DECISIONS SETTING FORTH THE FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR PHASE 2 OF THE DREDGING PROJECT, INCORPORATING ASPECTS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW PANEL AND FROM GE. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE

AGREED WITH EPA TO PERFORM PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS SET BY EPA. WE HAVE REVIEWED EPAS FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR PHASE 2 TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL SCOPE AND DURATION OF PHASE 2, AS WELL AS

OPERATIONAL AND ENGINEERING CHANGES THAT COULD BE REQUIRED. BASED ON THIS REVIEW AND OUR BEST PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING JUDGMENT, WE INCREASED OUR RESERVE FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS FOR COMPLETING THE HUDSON RIVER DREDGING PROJECT BY $0.8

BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT YEAR-END 2010, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 287,000 PERSONS, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 133,000 WERE EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

EMPLOYEES, SEE PART II, ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

APPROXIMATELY 15,200 GE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE

EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE REPRESENTED FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PURPOSES BY A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 105 DIFFERENT UNION LOCALS. A MAJORITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES ARE REPRESENTED BY UNION LOCALS THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH, AND BARGAIN IN

COORDINATION WITH, THE IUE-CWA, THE INDUSTRIAL DIVISION OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA, AFL-CIO, CLC. DURING 2007, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY NEGOTIATED FOUR-YEAR CONTRACTS WITH UNIONS REPRESENTING A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE UNIONIZED

EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES. MOST OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL TERMINATE IN JUNE 2011, AND WE WILL BE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS TO ATTAIN NEW AGREEMENTS. WHILE RESULTS OF 2011 UNION NEGOTIATIONS CANNOT BE PREDICTED, OUR RECENT PAST NEGOTIATIONS HAVE

RESULTED IN AGREEMENTS THAT INCREASED COSTS.

APPROXIMATELY 3,500 STAFF EMPLOYEES (AND A LARGE NUMBER OF FREELANCE EMPLOYEES) IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

COVERED BY ABOUT 175 LABOR AGREEMENTS TO WHICH NBC UNIVERSAL IS A PARTY. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE WITH VARIOUS LABOR UNIONS, EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES AND ARE GENERALLY FOR A TERM RANGING FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. OTHER GE AFFILIATES ARE PARTIES TO LABOR

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR

ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

OUR BUSINESSES

ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT  SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT  THAN WE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER

CAN BE FOUND IN THE MD&A SECTION AND IN THE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. BELOW, WE DESCRIBE CERTAIN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WILL AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL RISKS.

WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. IN 2010, APPROXIMATELY 53% OF OUR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION. THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH

MAY BE DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH ATTEMPTS

TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION HAS DECREASED OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS A RESULT OF MORE VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS.

(15)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND NON-U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN WAYS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS BY RESTRICTING EXISTING ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTS, SUBJECTING THEM TO ESCALATING COSTS OR

PROHIBITING THEM OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR, U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERTAKING A SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CONSUMER LENDING, THE OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES MARKET AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON GE CAPITALS STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND PERFORMANCE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF TRADE CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RISKS FROM LAWS THAT REDUCE THE ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT CONSUMER BORROWING, LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE

ASSETS, AND CHANGES TO TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GES EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S.

RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS

PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH NON-U.S. BANKS AND OTHER NON-U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH EXPIRES AT THE END

OF 2011, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS ON SIX PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN DECEMBER OF 2010, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THE PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER

2011, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED,

WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2012. IN ADDITION, EFFORTS BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE COSTS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REIMBURSEMENTS AND INCREASED UTILIZATION CONTROLS RELATED TO THE

USE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. INCREASED GOVERNMENT REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF MEDICAL DEVICES, INCLUDING REVIEWS OF THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (U.S. FDA) DEVICE PRE-MARKET AUTHORIZATION PROCESS, MAY IMPACT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SLOW OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE BEEN, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE, PARTICIPATING IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAMS, WHICH

REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH STRICT GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS. INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STATUS IN THESE PROJECTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. WE, OUR REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE AT TIMES BEING REVIEWED OR

INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND DAMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO

CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. THESE INCLUDE THE DREDGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE, AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS

FORM 10-K REPORT. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE

GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

(16)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND JOINT

VENTURES.

WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS AND JOINT VENTURES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR

MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION AND COLLABORATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES

THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF

OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. EVEN UPON REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH A BUYER OR SELLER FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF A BUSINESS, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO SATISFACTION OF PRE-CLOSING CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TO NECESSARY REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM COMPLETING THE TRANSACTION.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS

USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USED TO ESTIMATE

PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR 2011 ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT

CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED GAINS (LOSSES)  NET, BENEFIT PLANS. AT THE END OF 2010, THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED BY $2.8 BILLION, AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN, AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD A

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $4.4 BILLION. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  PENSION ASSUMPTIONS IN PART II, ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). FAILURE TO ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS COULD ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS. IN ADDITION, UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST

OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST

INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY

AND COST OF GE CAPITAL FUNDING.

A LARGE PORTION OF GE CAPITALS BORROWINGS IS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT. GE

CAPITALS OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT WAS $37 BILLION AND $350 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. WE CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR TERM MATURITIES

FOR 2011 AND BEYOND. IN ADDITION, WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS TO REFINANCE MATURING COMMERCIAL PAPER DEBT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN ORDER TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES, WE ALSO PLAN TO EXPAND OUR RELIANCE ON

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING BANK DEPOSITS, SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER ASSET-BASED FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN DIVERSIFYING OUR FUNDING SOURCES OR THAT THE SHORT AND LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS WILL BE

AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE COST OF FUNDING WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE AND AFFECT THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OF GE CAPITAL. FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING COSTS INCLUDE: A DECREASED RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM FUNDING,

SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, IN FAVOR OF LONGER-TERM FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS; DECREASED CAPACITY AND INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG DEBT ISSUERS; AND INCREASED COMPETITION FOR DEPOSITS IN OUR AFFILIATE BANKS MARKETS. IF GE CAPITALS COST OF

FUNDING WERE TO INCREASE, IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND RESULT IN LOWER LENDING MARGINS, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AS WELL AS LOWER RETURNS ON ITS SHAREOWNERS EQUITY AND INVESTED CAPITAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DETERIORATE, IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OF GE CAPITAL.

INCREASED PAYMENT DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES AND SUSTAINED LEVELS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT WRITE-DOWNS OF

ASSET VALUES BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GE CAPITAL. IF THESE CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND TAX ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE ESTABLISHED ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES IN GE CAPITALS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE, FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO

INCREASE THESE ALLOWANCES AND WRITE-OFFS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS

,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. TO REDUCE GES EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND REBALANCE THE RELATIVE SIZE OF ITS FINANCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WE DECIDED TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF GE CAPITAL, AS MEASURED BY ITS ENDING NET INVESTMENT. WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY AHEAD OF OUR REDUCTION

TARGETS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO TIMELY EXECUTE ON OUR REDUCTION TARGETS AND FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD RESULT IN GREATER EXPOSURE TO FINANCIAL MARKETS THAN CONTEMPLATED UNDER OUR STRATEGIC FUNDING PLAN OR MAY RESULT IN THE

NEED FOR US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO GE CAPITAL.

THE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITAL.

GE CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION, GE

CAPITALS CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS EXPOSURE TO

THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF UNSECURED DEBT INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING TO INITIAL CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 22 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT), WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY LOSSES

OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IN TWO WAYS: IT PROVIDES FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTIES, AND IT ALSO ACQUIRES EQUITY POSITIONS IN VARIOUS TYPES OF PROPERTIES OR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH THE

PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED AND THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF THOSE MARKETS AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE LEVEL OF TRANSACTIONS FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS CONTINUE TO REMAIN AT LEVELS BELOW HISTORICAL NORMS IN MANY OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL OPERATES. CONTINUED

HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, SLOWDOWN IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY, EXCESS INVENTORY CAPACITY AND LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND COLLATERAL TO REAL ESTATE LOANS GE CAPITAL HOLDS. UNDER

CURRENT MARKET AND CREDIT CONDITIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES GE CAPITAL WILL COMPLETE OR THE NET SALES PROCEEDS IT WILL REALIZE. ALSO, OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENT LEVELS MAY WORSEN, WHICH MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS TO

THE CARRYING VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS.

GE CAPITAL IS ALSO A

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDER IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES AND HOME SALE VOLUMES, JOB LOSSES, CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER

FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF OUR MORTGAGE LOANS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THESE MORTGAGE LOANS IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF CURRENT AND HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND LOAN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS OTHER MANAGEMENT

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY BE INACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED AND, AS A RESULT, MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITALS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY,

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GE AND GECCS LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD AND POORS

RATINGS SERVICE (S&P) WAS AA+ (THE SECOND HIGHEST OF 22 RATING CATEGORIES) WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK AND FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) WAS AA2 (THE THIRD HIGHEST OF 21 RATING CATEGORIES) WITH

A STABLE OUTLOOK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GE, GE CAPITAL SERVICES AND GE CAPITALS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING FROM S&P WAS A-1+ (THE HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF SIX CATEGORIES) AND FROM MOODYS WAS P-1 (THE

HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF FOUR CATEGORIES). THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS

TO CAPITAL MARKETS. VARIOUS DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION.

CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ALSO MAY MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES.

THE BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, HOME AND BUSINESS SOLUTIONS AND MEDIA BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CONDITIONS IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION,

HEALTHCARE, MEDIA, HOME BUILDING AND OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. AS A RESULT OF SLOWER GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, REDUCED LEVELS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR

POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY FASHION. IN PARTICULAR, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

CYCLICAL, AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL IS CORRELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF SLOW GROWTH IN THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONALLY THAT RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAFFIC COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. SERVICE CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING

SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IF SLOWER GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

INCREASED IT SECURITY THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED COMPUTER

CRIME COULD POSE A RISK TO OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES.

INCREASED GLOBAL IT SECURITY THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND

TARGETED COMPUTER CRIME POSE A RISK TO THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR DATA. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS BY EMPLOYING A NUMBER OF MEASURES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE TRAINING,

COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING OF OUR NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS, AND MAINTENANCE OF BACKUP AND PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS, OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS. DEPENDING ON THEIR NATURE

AND SCOPE, SUCH THREATS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE COMPROMISING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, IMPROPER USE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, MANIPULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF DATA, DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, PRODUCTION DOWNTIMES AND OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, COMPETITIVENESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY FACE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM OPERATIONAL

FAILURES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WE ARE DEPENDENT ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND PRODUCT INNOVATIONS FOR CONTINUED REVENUE

GROWTH.

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR BOTH OUR AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE OR USE

LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. WHILE WE HAVE BUILT EXTENSIVE OPERATIONAL PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICING OF SUCH PRODUCTS MEET THE MOST RIGOROUS QUALITY STANDARDS, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT WE OR OUR CUSTOMERS WILL NOT EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL PROCESS FAILURES THAT COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL PRODUCT, SAFETY, REGULATORY OR ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS. SUCH OPERATIONAL FAILURES OR

(19)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUALITY ISSUES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. OUR LONG-TERM OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP, INTRODUCE, AND MARKET NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, TO MODIFY EXISTING PRODUCTS, TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TO CUSTOMIZE

CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO OURS.

OUR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY

DEVELOPING OR SELLING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE OF OURS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY US TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL

ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY. WE COULD ALSO FACE COMPETITION IN SOME COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE NOT INVESTED IN AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND

OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF SUCH CLAIMS, RESPONDING TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. IF GE IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY

RIGHTS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR WE COULD BE ENJOINED FROM OFFERING SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR RE-NEW FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES WE NEED IN THE

FUTURE, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS.

SIGNIFICANT RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, SUPPLIER QUALITY ISSUES OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN

THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE

INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. QUALITY ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS CAN ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RESULT IN LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ARE CONDUCTING AN INDUSTRY-WIDE

INVESTIGATION OF MARKETING AND SALES OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO MUNICIPALITIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION, TWO SUBSIDIARIES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC) HAVE RECEIVED

SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTIGATION: GE FUNDING CMS (TRINITY FUNDING CO.) AND GE FUNDING CAPITAL MARKET SERVICES, INC. (GE FCMS). GECC HAS COOPERATED AND CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE SEC AND DOJ IN

THIS MATTER. IN JULY 2008, GE FCMS RECEIVED A WELLS NOTICE ADVISING THAT THE SEC STAFF WAS CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING THAT THE SEC BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION OR INSTITUTE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE BIDDING FOR

VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES OF GE FCMS. GE FCMS IS ONE OF SEVERAL INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS THAT RECEIVED WELLS NOTICES DURING 2008. GE FCMS DISAGREES WITH THE SEC STAFF REGARDING THIS

RECOMMENDATION AND HAS HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STAFF, INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING A POTENTIAL RESOLUTION OF THE MATTER. GE FCMS INTENDS TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND UNDERSTANDS THAT IT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ANY

DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE SEC STAFF WITH RESPECT TO ITS RECOMMENDATION THROUGH THE WELLS PROCESS WITH THE FULL COMMISSION. SEPARATELY, GE FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING CO. ALSO RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT AND

FLORIDA ON BEHALF OF A WORKING GROUP OF STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN JUNE 2008, AND A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS IN OCTOBER 2010. GE FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING CO. ARE COOPERATING WITH THOSE

INVESTIGATIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN MARCH 2008, GE FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING CO. WERE SERVED WITH A FEDERAL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT ASSERTING

ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. THIS ACTION WAS COMBINED WITH OTHER RELATED ACTIONS IN A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PROCEEDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE CLAIMS AGAINST GE FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING CO. IN THE

FEDERAL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT AND THE SIMILAR CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE OTHER RELATED ACTIONS WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. IN JUNE 2010, ONE EXISTING COMPLAINT WAS AMENDED TO BRING CLAIMS AGAINST GE FCMS ASSERTING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. SINCE

SEPTEMBER 2010, FOUR ADDITIONAL COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST GE FCMS, TRINITY FUNDING CO., TRINITY PLUS FUNDING CO. LLC (TRINITY PLUS), AND GECC ASSERTING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. IN JANUARY 2011, AN ADDITIONAL ACTION WAS BROUGHT AGAINST

TRINITY PLUS AND FGIC CAPITAL MARKET SERVICES, INC. (THE PREDECESSOR OF GE FCMS) ASSERTING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, IN FEBRUARY 2011, PLAINTIFFS IN ELEVEN COMPLAINTS THAT WERE DISMISSED IN APRIL 2010 (AS WELL AS FIVE ADDITIONAL COMPLAINTS

THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY NAMED TRINITY FUNDING CO. OR GE FCMS) WERE GRANTED LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED COMPLAINTS AGAINST TRINITY FUNDING CO., TRINITY PLUS, GE FCMS, AND GECC.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN SEPTEMBER 2010, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS IN ITS ENTIRETY WITH PREJUDICE A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION UNDER THE

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS NAMING US AS DEFENDANT, AS WELL AS OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. IN THIS ACTION, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED THAT DURING A CONFERENCE CALL WITH ANALYSTS ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE

AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING (I) THE STATE OF GES FUNDING, CASH FLOWS, AND LIQUIDITY AND (II) THE QUESTION OF ISSUING ADDITIONAL EQUITY, WHICH CAUSED ECONOMIC LOSS TO THOSE SHAREHOLDERS WHO PURCHASED GE STOCK BETWEEN

SEPTEMBER 25, 2008 AND OCTOBER 2, 2008, WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THE PRICING OF A COMMON STOCK OFFERING. PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED NOTICE OF APPEAL.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN JULY 2010, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS IN THEIR ENTIRETY TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS NAMING US, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

AND OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AS DEFENDANTS. THESE TWO ACTIONS, WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ALLEGED THAT WE AND OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS THAT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED OUR STOCK PRICE BETWEEN MARCH 12,

2008 AND APRIL 10, 2008, WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 WOULD NOT MEET OUR PREVIOUS GUIDANCE AND ALSO LOWERED OUR FULL YEAR GUIDANCE FOR 2008. PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED NOTICE OF APPEAL.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN MARCH AND APRIL 2009, SHAREHOLDERS FILED PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK NAMING AS DEFENDANTS GE, A NUMBER OF GE OFFICERS (INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER) AND OUR DIRECTORS. THE COMPLAINTS, WHICH

HAVE NOW BEEN CONSOLIDATED, SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES BASED ON ALLEGATIONS RELATED TO STATEMENTS REGARDING THE GE DIVIDEND AND PROJECTED LOSSES AND EARNINGS FOR GECC IN 2009. OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN NOVEMBER

2009, IS NOW FULLY BRIEFED AND, FOLLOWING AN ORAL ARGUMENT HELD IN NOVEMBER 2010, IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT. A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN CONNECTICUT IN MAY 2009 MAKING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

ALLEGATIONS AS THE NEW YORK CLASS ACTIONS. GES MOTION TO TRANSFER THE DERIVATIVE ACTION TO THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AS A RELATED CASE WAS GRANTED IN FEBRUARY 2010, AND OUR MOTION TO DISMISS IS CURRENTLY PENDING. THE DEFENDANTS INTEND

TO DEFEND THEMSELVES VIGOROUSLY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN MARCH 2010, A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK NAMING AS DEFENDANTS GE, A NUMBER OF GE OFFICERS (INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER) AND OUR DIRECTORS. THE COMPLAINT PRINCIPALLY ALLEGES BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND OTHER

CAUSES OF ACTION RELATED TO THE GE DIVIDEND AND SEC MATTER WHICH GE RESOLVED IN AUGUST 2009 AND ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. IN MAY 2010, AN ADDITIONAL DERIVATIVE ACTION ALSO CLAIMING MISMANAGEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF NEW YORK NAMING AS DEFENDANTS GE AND A NUMBER OF PRESENT AND FORMER GE OFFICERS (INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER). THE DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED

MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE DERIVATIVE CASES AND INTEND TO DEFEND THEMSELVES VIGOROUSLY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEC REQUIREMENTS TO

DISCLOSE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS POTENTIALLY INVOLVING MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000 OR GREATER, IN JUNE 2008, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND IN JANUARY 2011 FILED A COMPLAINT ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE

WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT AT A POWER COGENERATION PLANT IN HOMER CITY, PA. THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HAVE INTERVENED IN

THE EPA CASE. THE PLANT IS OPERATED EXCLUSIVELY BY EME HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P., AND IS OWNED AND LEASED TO EME HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P. BY SUBSIDIARIES OF GECC AND ONE OTHER ENTITY. THE COMPLAINTS DO NOT INDICATE A SPECIFIC PENALTY AMOUNT BUT

MAKES REFERENCE TO STATUTORY FINES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES AND THAT EME HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P. IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY GECCS SUBSIDIARIES AND PAY ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS

OPERATIONS

OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMBINE THE INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING, SERVICES AND MEDIA BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (GE) WITH THE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. (GECS OR FINANCIAL SERVICES).

IN THE ACCOMPANYING ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WE SOMETIMES USE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BUT NOT PRESENTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). CERTAIN OF THESE DATA ARE CONSIDERED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES. FOR

SUCH MEASURES, WE HAVE PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL EXPLANATIONS AND RECONCILIATIONS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SECTION.

WE PRESENT MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS IN FIVE PARTS: OVERVIEW OF OUR EARNINGS FROM 2008 THROUGH 2010, GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT, SEGMENT OPERATIONS, GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, WE REFER TO CAPTIONS SUCH AS REVENUES

AND EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY SIMPLY AS REVENUES AND EARNINGS THROUGHOUT THIS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. SIMILARLY, DISCUSSION OF OTHER MATTERS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, WE REORGANIZED OUR SEGMENTS TO BETTER

ALIGN OUR CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL AND ENERGY BUSINESSES FOR GROWTH. AS A RESULT OF THIS REORGANIZATION, WE CREATED A NEW SEGMENT CALLED HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDES THE APPLIANCES AND LIGHTING BUSINESSES FROM OUR PREVIOUS

CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT AND THE RETAINED PORTION OF THE GE FANUC INTELLIGENT PLATFORMS BUSINESS OF OUR PREVIOUS ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS (FORMERLY WITHIN OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT). IN ADDITION, THE INDUSTRIAL

BUSINESS OF OUR PREVIOUS CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT AND THE SENSING & INSPECTION TECHNOLOGIES AND DIGITAL ENERGY BUSINESSES OF OUR PREVIOUS ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS ARE NOW PART OF THE ENERGY BUSINESS WITHIN THE ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT. THE SECURITY BUSINESS OF ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS WAS REPORTED IN CORPORATE ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS UNTIL ITS SALE IN FEBRUARY 2010. ALSO, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE CAPITAL FINANCE SEGMENT WAS RENAMED GE CAPITAL AND

INCLUDES ALL OF THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC). IN ADDITION, THE TRANSPORTATION FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN GE CAPITAL AVIATION SERVICES (GECAS), IS INCLUDED IN COMMERCIAL LENDING AND

LEASING (CLL) AND OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS IN ITALY, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN CONSUMER, IS INCLUDED IN CLL.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, WE REORGANIZED

THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT INTO THREE SEGMENTS  AVIATION, HEALTHCARE AND TRANSPORTATION. THE RESULTS OF THE AVIATION, HEALTHCARE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES ARE UNAFFECTED BY THIS REORGANIZATION AND WE WILL BEGIN REPORTING THESE

AS SEPARATE SEGMENTS BEGINNING WITH OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2011. RESULTS FOR 2010 AND PRIOR PERIODS ARE REPORTED ON THE BASIS UNDER WHICH WE MANAGED OUR BUSINESSES IN 2010 AND DO NOT REFLECT THE JANUARY

2011 REORGANIZATION.

BEGINNING IN 2011, WE WILL SUPPLEMENT OUR GAAP NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) REPORTING BY ALSO REPORTING AN OPERATING

EARNINGS AND EPS MEASURE (NON-GAAP). OPERATING EARNINGS AND EPS WILL INCLUDE SERVICE COST AND PLAN AMENDMENT AMORTIZATION FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AS THESE COSTS REPRESENT EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EARNED. OPERATING EARNINGS

AND EPS WILL EXCLUDE NON-OPERATING PENSION COST/INCOME SUCH AS INTEREST COST, EXPECTED RETURN ON PLANS ASSETS AND NON-CASH AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS REPORTING WILL PROVIDE BETTER TRANSPARENCY TO THE EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT COSTS OF OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AND COMPANY OPERATING RESULTS.

(27)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVERVIEW OF OUR EARNINGS FROM 2008 THROUGH 2010

EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY INCREASED 15% IN 2010 AFTER DECREASING 39% IN 2009, REFLECTING THE STABILIZATION OF OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING 2010, FOLLOWING THE CHALLENGING

CONDITIONS OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AND THE EFFECT ON BOTH OUR INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE SEEING SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, INCLUDING IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, AS GECS EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY INCREASED 138% IN 2010 COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF 83% IN 2009. NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY INCREASED 6% IN 2010 AFTER DECREASING 37% IN 2009, AS LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2010

PARTIALLY OFFSET THE 15% INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. WE HAVE A STRONG BACKLOG ENTERING 2011 AND EXPECT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THROUGH 2012.

ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE (25% AND 33% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) REVENUES DECREASED 8% IN 2010 AND 6% IN 2009 AS THE WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR NEW SOURCES OF POWER, SUCH AS

WIND AND THERMAL, DECLINED WITH THE OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED 2% IN 2010 AND 9% IN 2009 PRIMARILY ON HIGHER PRICES AND LOWER MATERIAL AND OTHER COSTS. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES AT

ENERGY AND OIL & GAS.

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE (24% AND 33% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY)

REVENUES AND SEGMENT PROFIT FELL 2% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2010 AND 7% AND 9%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2009. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES AT AVIATION, HEALTHCARE AND TRANSPORTATION. AVIATION REVENUES AND EARNINGS

TRENDED DOWN OVER THIS PERIOD ON LOWER EQUIPMENT SALES AND SERVICES AND THE COSTS OF INVESTMENT IN NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, COUPLED WITH THE EFFECTS OF THE CHALLENGING GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. HEALTHCARE REVENUES AND EARNINGS IMPROVED IN 2010 ON

HIGHER EQUIPMENT SALES AND SERVICES AFTER TRENDING DOWN IN 2009 DUE TO GENERALLY WEAK GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKETS. TRANSPORTATION REVENUES AND EARNINGS DECLINED 12% AND 33%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2010, AND 24% AND

51%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2009 AS THE WEAKENED ECONOMY HAS DRIVEN OVERALL REDUCTIONS IN U.S. FREIGHT TRAFFIC AND WE UPDATED OUR ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICE COSTS IN OUR MAINTENANCE SERVICE AGREEMENTS.

NBC UNIVERSAL (NBCU) (10% AND 12% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) IS A DIVERSIFIED MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY.

NBCU REVENUES INCREASED 9% IN 2010 AFTER DECREASING 9% IN 2009 AND SEGMENT PROFIT WAS FLAT IN 2010 AFTER DECREASING 28% IN 2009. THE CABLE BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW AND BECOME MORE PROFITABLE, THE TELEVISION BUSINESS HAD MIXED PERFORMANCE, AND OUR

PARKS AND FILM BUSINESSES HAVE IMPROVED AS THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS STABILIZED. ON JANUARY 28, 2011, WE TRANSFERRED THE ASSETS OF THE NBCU BUSINESS TO A NEWLY FORMED ENTITY, WHICH CONSISTS OF OUR NBCU BUSINESSES AND COMCAST CORPORATIONS CABLE

NETWORKS, REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORKS, CERTAIN DIGITAL PROPERTIES AND CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, WE RECEIVED $6.2 BILLION IN CASH AND A 49% INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED ENTITY, NBC UNIVERSAL LLC, WHICH WE

WILL ACCOUNT FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD.

GE CAPITAL (34% AND 20% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) NET

EARNINGS INCREASED TO $3.3 BILLION IN 2010 DUE TO STABILIZATION IN THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AFTER DECLINING TO $1.5 BILLION IN 2009 FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CREDIT MARKETS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE

TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, SHIFTED TEAMS FROM ORIGINATION TO COLLECTION AND MAINTAINED A PROACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT FOCUS. THIS, ALONG WITH RECENT INCREASED STABILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER LOSSES AND A RETURN TO

PRE-TAX EARNINGS AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SEGMENT PROFIT IN 2010. WE ALSO REDUCED OUR ENDING NET INVESTMENT (ENI), EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS FROM $526 BILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010 TO $477 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE CURRENT

CREDIT CYCLE HAS BEGUN TO SHOW SIGNS OF STABILIZATION AND WE EXPECT FURTHER SIGNS OF STABILIZATION AS WE ENTER 2011. OUR FOCUS IS TO REPOSITION GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC) AS A DIVERSELY FUNDED AND SMALLER, MORE FOCUSED FINANCE

COMPANY WITH STRONG POSITIONS IN SEVERAL MID-MARKET, CORPORATE AND CONSUMER FINANCING SEGMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS (6% AND 2% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT PROFIT,

RESPECTIVELY) REVENUES HAVE INCREASED 2% IN 2010 AFTER DECLINING 17% IN 2009. HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS CONTINUES TO REPOSITION ITS BUSINESS BY ELIMINATING CAPACITY IN ITS INCANDESCENT LIGHTING MANUFACTURING SITES AND INVESTING IN ENERGY

EFFICIENT PRODUCT MANUFACTURING IN LOCATIONS SUCH AS LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY AND BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA. SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED 24% IN 2010 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF PRODUCTIVITY REFLECTING THESE COST REDUCTION EFFORTS AND INCREASED OTHER

INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRICES. SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED 1% IN 2009 ON HIGHER PRICES AND LOWER MATERIAL COSTS.

OVERALL, ACQUISITIONS

CONTRIBUTED $0.3 BILLION, $2.9 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION TO CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ACQUISITION GAINS FOLLOWING OUR ADOPTION OF AN AMENDMENT TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

CONSOLIDATION

. OUR CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION, $0.5 BILLION AND $0.8 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. WE INTEGRATE

ACQUISITIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ONLY REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM THE DATE WE COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION THROUGH THE END OF THE FOURTH FOLLOWING QUARTER ARE ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH BUSINESSES. DISPOSITIONS ALSO AFFECTED OUR ONGOING RESULTS THROUGH LOWER

REVENUES OF $3.0 BILLION IN 2010, LOWER REVENUES OF $4.7 BILLION IN 2009 AND HIGHER REVENUES OF $0.1 BILLION IN 2008. THE EFFECTS OF DISPOSITIONS ON NET EARNINGS WERE INCREASES OF $0.1 BILLION, $0.6 BILLION AND $0.4 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

SIGNIFICANT MATTERS RELATING TO OUR STATEMENT OF EARNINGS ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

CONSISTENT WITH OUR GOAL OF REDUCING GECC ENI AND FOCUSING OUR BUSINESSES ON SELECTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS WHERE WE HAVE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, BROAD DISTRIBUTION, AND THE ABILITY

TO EARN A CONSISTENT RETURN ON CAPITAL, WHILE MANAGING OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET SIZE AND RISK, IN DECEMBER 2010, WE SOLD OUR CENTRAL AMERICAN BANK AND CARD BUSINESS, BAC CREDOMATIC GECF INC. (BAC). IN SEPTEMBER 2007, WE COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL

OUR JAPANESE PERSONAL LOAN BUSINESS (LAKE) UPON DETERMINING THAT, DESPITE RESTRUCTURING, JAPANESE REGULATORY LIMITS FOR INTEREST CHARGES ON UNSECURED PERSONAL LOANS DID NOT PERMIT US TO EARN AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN. DURING 2008, WE COMPLETED THE SALE

OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WHICH INCLUDED LAKE, ALONG WITH OUR JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP IN GE NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDES OUR U.S. RECREATIONAL VEHICLE AND MARINE EQUIPMENT

FINANCE BUSINESS (CONSUMER RV MARINE) AND CONSUMER MEXICO. ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE GE CAPITAL SEGMENT.

WE REPORTED THE

BUSINESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SEE SEGMENT OPERATIONS  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THIS ITEM AND NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

WE DECLARED $5.2

BILLION IN DIVIDENDS IN 2010.

COMMON PER-SHARE DIVIDENDS OF $0.46 WERE DOWN 25% FROM 2009, FOLLOWING A 51% DECREASE FROM THE PRECEDING YEAR. IN FEBRUARY 2009, WE ANNOUNCED THE REDUCTION OF THE QUARTERLY GE STOCK DIVIDEND BY 68% FROM $0.31 PER

SHARE TO $0.10 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN JUNE 2009, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009. AS A RESULT OF STRONG CASH GENERATION, RECOVERY OF GE CAPITAL AND SOLID UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE IN OUR INDUSTRIAL

BUSINESSES DURING 2010, IN JULY 2010, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A 20% INCREASE IN OUR REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND FROM $0.10 PER SHARE TO $0.12 PER SHARE AND IN DECEMBER 2010, APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL 17% INCREASE FROM $0.12 PER SHARE TO $0.14

PER SHARE. ON FEBRUARY 11, 2011, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.14 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS PAYABLE APRIL 25, 2011, TO SHAREOWNERS OF RECORD AT CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 28, 2011. IN

2010 AND 2009, WE DECLARED $0.3 BILLION IN PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE ANALYSIS IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION PRESENTS

THE RESULTS OF GE (WITH GECS INCLUDED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS) AND GECS. SEE THE SEGMENT OPERATIONS SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESSES WITHIN GE AND GECS.

GE SALES OF PRODUCT SERVICES

WERE $34.7 BILLION IN 2010, A DECREASE OF 1% COMPARED WITH 2009. DECREASES IN PRODUCT SERVICES AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES AT ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS. OPERATING PROFIT FROM PRODUCT SERVICES WAS $10.0 BILLION IN 2010, ABOUT FLAT COMPARED WITH 2009.

(29)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

COSTS WERE $3.0 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. COSTS INCREASED IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AMORTIZATION OF 2008 INVESTMENT LOSSES AND THE EFFECTS OF LOWER DISCOUNT RATES (PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED FROM 6.11% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TO 5.78% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EARLY RETIREMENT COSTS.

COSTS INCREASED IN 2009 PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE EFFECTS OF LOWER DISCOUNT

RATES (PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED FROM 6.34% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 TO 6.11% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008) AND INCREASES IN EARLY RETIREMENTS RESULTING FROM RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR YEARS INVESTMENT GAINS AND BENEFITS FROM NEW HEALTHCARE SUPPLIER CONTRACTS.

OUR DISCOUNT RATE FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION

PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS 5.28%, WHICH REFLECTED CURRENT INTEREST RATES. CONSIDERING THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF ASSETS IN WHICH OUR PLANS ARE INVESTED, WE

HAVE ASSUMED THAT LONG-TERM RETURNS ON OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL BE 8.0% FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2011, A REDUCTION FROM THE 8.5% WE ASSUMED IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008. GAAP PROVIDES RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSUMED AND ACTUAL

RETURNS OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES. SEE THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

WE EXPECT THE COSTS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS TO INCREASE IN 2011 BY APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF

ADDITIONAL 2008 INVESTMENT LOSS AMORTIZATION AND LOWER DISCOUNT RATES.

PENSION EXPENSE FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS ON A GAAP BASIS WAS $1.1

BILLION, $0.5 BILLION AND $0.2 BILLION FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING PENSION COSTS (NON-GAAP) FOR THESE PLANS WERE $1.4 BILLION, $2.0 BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED BY $2.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2010 AS COMPARED TO $2.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN,

WHICH IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF $4.4 BILLION AND $3.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN UNDERFUNDING FROM YEAR-END 2009 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF LOWER

DISCOUNT RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN GE PENSION PLAN ASSETS. OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED FROM 5.78% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO 5.28% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WHICH INCREASED THE PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

YEAR-END 2010 BY APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION. OUR GE PENSION PLAN ASSETS INCREASED FROM $42.1 BILLION AT THE END OF 2009 TO $44.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DRIVEN BY A 13.5% INCREASE IN INVESTMENT VALUES DURING THE YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

BENEFIT PAYMENTS. ASSETS OF THE GE PENSION PLAN ARE HELD IN TRUST, SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL COMPANY OPERATIONS.

ON AN EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) BASIS, THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS 98% FUNDED AT JANUARY 1, 2011. WE WILL NOT MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2011. FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARE

DETERMINED AS PRESCRIBED BY ERISA AND FOR GE, ARE BASED ON THE PLANS FUNDED STATUS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS MAY VARY BASED ON ACTUAL PLAN RESULTS. ASSUMING OUR 2011 ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH

OUR CURRENT BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS (E.G., EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AND INTEREST RATES), WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE ABOUT $1.4 BILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2012.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS FOR OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS WAS $2.1 BILLION LESS THAN THE RESPECTIVE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WAS $2.7

BILLION. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.7 BILLION TO OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2011, COMPARED WITH ACTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.6 BILLION AND $0.7 BILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. WE FUND OUR RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS. THE

UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE PLANS WAS $10.9 BILLION AND $11.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER HEALTHCARE TRENDS AND THE EFFECTS OF

HEALTHCARE REFORM PROVISIONS ON OUR MEDICARE-APPROVED PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DISCOUNT RATES (RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE PLANS DISCOUNT RATE DECREASED FROM 5.67% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO 5.15% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010).

WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.7 BILLION TO THESE PLANS IN 2011 COMPARED WITH ACTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.6 BILLION IN BOTH 2010 AND 2009.

THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLANS AND FUTURE EFFECTS ON OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT FUNDED STATUS, COMPONENTS OF EARNINGS EFFECTS AND ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

GE OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES

ARE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THESE COSTS

WERE 16.3%, 14.3% AND 12.9% OF TOTAL GE SALES IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN 2010 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SELLING EXPENSES TO SUPPORT GLOBAL GROWTH AND HIGHER PENSION COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND

OTHER CHARGES.

INTEREST ON BORROWINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES

AMOUNTED TO $16.0 BILLION, $18.3 BILLION AND $25.8 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR BORROWINGS ARE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHERE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $15.0 BILLION, $17.5 BILLION AND $24.7 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. GECS AVERAGE BORROWINGS DECLINED FROM 2009 TO 2010 AND

FROM 2008 TO 2009, IN LINE WITH CHANGES IN AVERAGE GECS ASSETS. INTEREST RATES HAVE DECREASED OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINING GLOBAL BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE CREDIT SPREADS. GECS AVERAGE

BORROWINGS WERE $480.4 BILLION, $497.6 BILLION AND $521.2 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE GECS AVERAGE COMPOSITE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE WAS 3.1% IN 2010, 3.5% IN 2009 AND 4.7% IN 2008. IN 2010, GECS AVERAGE ASSETS OF $616.9

BILLION WERE 3% LOWER THAN IN 2009, WHICH IN TURN WERE 4% LOWER THAN IN 2008. SEE THE LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS SECTION FOR A DISCUSSION OF LIQUIDITY, BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT.

INCOME TAXES

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR NET EARNINGS. AS A GLOBAL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, OUR TAX RATES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR

GLOBAL MIX OF EARNINGS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE GLOBAL EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, LEGISLATION, ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND TAX CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR INCOME. OUR TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED AND

SETTLEMENTS OF ISSUES RAISED IN THESE AUDITS SOMETIMES AFFECT OUR TAX PROVISIONS.

GE AND GECS FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THIS

ENABLES GE TO USE GECS TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS TO REDUCE THE TAX THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE BY GE.

OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE IS

LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE USE OF GLOBAL FUNDING STRUCTURES, AND OUR 2009 AND 2008 DECISIONS TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THERE

IS A BENEFIT FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS AS NON-U.S. INCOME IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE. THESE NON-U.S. EARNINGS HAVE BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO

CURRENT U.S. INCOME TAX. THE RATE OF TAX ON OUR INDEFINITELY REINVESTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS IS BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE

U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND BECAUSE GE FUNDS THE MAJORITY OF ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LOW FOREIGN TAXES.

INCOME TAXES (BENEFIT) ON CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE 7.4% IN 2010 COMPARED WITH (11.5)% IN 2009 AND 5.6% IN 2008. WE EXPECT OUR

CONSOLIDATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE IN 2011 IN PART BECAUSE WE EXPECT A HIGH EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON THE PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE NBCU TRANSACTION WITH COMCAST (MORE THAN $3 BILLION) DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

WE EXPECT OUR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM NON-U.S.

INCOME TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE TO CONTINUE, SUBJECT TO CHANGES OF U.S. OR FOREIGN LAW, INCLUDING, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, THE POSSIBLE EXPIRATION OF THE U.S. TAX LAW PROVISION DEFERRING TAX ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME. IN ADDITION, SINCE THIS BENEFIT DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENTS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST AMOUNTS

OUTSIDE THE U.S., OUR TAX PROVISION WILL INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVEST FOREIGN EARNINGS.

(31)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BENEFITS FROM LOWER TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS DECLINED TO $2.8 BILLION IN 2010 FROM $4.0 BILLION IN 2009 PRINCIPALLY

BECAUSE OF LOWER EARNINGS IN OUR OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE, AND FROM LOSSES FOR WHICH THERE WAS NOT A FULL TAX BENEFIT. THESE DECREASES ALSO REFLECTED MANAGEMENTS

DECISION IN 2009 TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCREASED IN 2010 BY $0.4 BILLION DUE TO AUDIT RESOLUTIONS. TO THE EXTENT GLOBAL INTEREST RATES AND NON-U.S. OPERATING

INCOME INCREASE WE WOULD EXPECT TAX BENEFITS TO INCREASE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENTS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THOSE EARNINGS.

OUR BENEFIT

FROM LOWER TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF THE LOWER FOREIGN TAX RATE ON OUR INDEFINITELY REINVESTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS WHICH PROVIDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $2.0 BILLION IN 2010 AND $3.0 BILLION IN 2009. THE TAX BENEFIT FROM NON-U.S. INCOME

TAXED AT A LOCAL COUNTRY RATHER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE IS REPORTED IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RECONCILIATION IN THE LINE TAX ON GLOBAL EARNINGS INCLUDING EXPORTS.

OUR BENEFITS FROM LOWER TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS DECLINED TO $4.0 BILLION IN 2009 FROM $5.1 BILLION IN 2008 (INCLUDING IN EACH YEAR A BENEFIT FROM THE DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE

THE U.S.) PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF LOWER EARNINGS IN OUR OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MANAGEMENTS DECISION IN 2009 TO

INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT WAS LARGER THAN THE 2008 DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 2009 TO 2010 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF AN INCREASE DURING 2010 OF INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS DECREASED THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF OUR TAX BENEFITS FROM

LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 2009 TO 2010 DUE TO THE DECREASE, DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THESE EFFECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

THE BENEFIT FROM AUDIT RESOLUTIONS, PRIMARILY A DECREASE IN THE BALANCE OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FROM THE COMPLETION OF OUR 2003-2005 AUDIT WITH THE IRS.

CASH INCOME TAXES PAID IN 2010 WERE $2.7 BILLION, REFLECTING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES.

OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2008 TO 2009 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A REDUCTION DURING 2009 OF INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCREASED

THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF OUR TAX BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE DECISION, DISCUSSED BELOW, TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THESE EFFECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE FROM 2008 TO 2009 IN

THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS.

A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND THE

CONSOLIDATED RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS, IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT. THE NATURE OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ASSOCIATED INCOME TAXES DIFFER FOR GE AND FOR GECS AND A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF EACH IS PRESENTED IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW.

BECAUSE GE TAX EXPENSE DOES NOT INCLUDE TAXES ON GECS EARNINGS, THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BEST ANALYZED IN RELATION TO GE EARNINGS EXCLUDING GECS. GE PRE-TAX EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING GECS

EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WERE $12.0 BILLION, $12.6 BILLION AND $14.2 BILLION FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. ON THIS BASIS, GES EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 16.8% IN 2010, 21.8% IN 2009 AND 24.2% IN 2008.

THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2009 TO 2010 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE 4.0 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT FROM AUDIT

RESOLUTIONS SHOWN ABOVE.

THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2008 TO 2009 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE 3.6 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT

FROM LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING AUDIT RESOLUTIONS. THE 2008 GE RATE REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS.

THE GECS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE USE OF GLOBAL FUNDING STRUCTURES. THERE IS A BENEFIT FROM

GLOBAL OPERATIONS AS NON-U.S. INCOME IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE. THESE NON-U.S. EARNINGS HAVE BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CURRENT U.S.

INCOME TAX. THE RATE OF TAX ON OUR INDEFINITELY REINVESTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS IS BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE U.S.

STATUTORY RATE AND BECAUSE GECS FUNDS THE MAJORITY OF ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LOW FOREIGN TAXES.

WE

EXPECT OUR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM NON-U.S. INCOME TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE TO CONTINUE SUBJECT TO CHANGES OF U.S. OR FOREIGN LAW, INCLUDING, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, THE POSSIBLE EXPIRATION OF THE U.S. TAX LAW PROVISION DEFERRING TAX ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME. IN ADDITION, SINCE THIS BENEFIT DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENTS

INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST AMOUNTS OUTSIDE THE U.S., OUR TAX PROVISION WILL INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVEST FOREIGN EARNINGS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, GE AND GECS FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THIS ENABLES GE TO USE GECS TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS TO REDUCE THE TAX THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE BY GE. THE GECS

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR EACH PERIOD REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF THESE TAX REDUCTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED RETURN. GE MAKES CASH PAYMENTS TO GECS FOR THESE TAX REDUCTIONS AT THE TIME GES TAX PAYMENTS ARE DUE. THE EFFECT OF GECS ON THE AMOUNT OF THE

CONSOLIDATED TAX LIABILITY FROM THE FORMATION OF THE NBCU JOINT VENTURE WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH WHEN IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE LIABILITY OF THE GROUP ABSENT THE TAX ON JOINT VENTURE FORMATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GECS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS (44.8)% IN 2010, COMPARED WITH 152.0% IN 2009 AND (41.4)% IN 2008. COMPARING A TAX

BENEFIT TO PRE-TAX INCOME RESULTED IN A NEGATIVE TAX RATE IN 2010 AND 2008. COMPARING A TAX BENEFIT TO PRE-TAX LOSS RESULTS IN THE POSITIVE TAX RATE IN 2009. THE GECS TAX BENEFIT OF $3.9 BILLION IN 2009 DECREASED BY $2.9 BILLION TO $1.0 BILLION IN

2010. THE LOWER 2010 TAX BENEFIT RESULTED IN LARGE PART FROM THE CHANGE FROM A PRE-TAX LOSS IN 2009 TO PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2010 WHICH INCREASED PRE-TAX INCOME $4.7 BILLION AND DECREASED THE BENEFIT ($1.7 BILLION), THE NON-REPEAT OF THE ONE-TIME

BENEFIT RELATED TO THE 2009 DECISION (DISCUSSED BELOW) TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST UNDISTRIBUTED PRIOR YEAR NON-U.S. EARNINGS ($0.7 BILLION), AND A DECREASE IN LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS IN 2010 AS COMPARED TO 2009 ($0.6 BILLION) CAUSED IN PART BY

AN INCREASE IN LOSSES FOR WHICH THERE WAS NOT A FULL TAX BENEFIT, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO THE 2008 LOSS ON THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN ($0.2 BILLION). THESE LOWER BENEFITS

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT FROM RESOLUTION OF THE 2003-2005 IRS AUDIT ($0.3 BILLION), WHICH IS REPORTED IN THE CAPTION ALL OTHER  NET IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RECONCILIATION IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

THE GECS TAX BENEFIT OF $2.3

BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED BY $1.6 BILLION TO $3.9 BILLION IN 2009. THE HIGHER BENEFIT RESULTED IN LARGE PART FROM THE CHANGE FROM PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2008 TO A PRE-TAX LOSS IN 2009 WHICH DECREASED PRE-TAX INCOME $8.2 BILLION AND INCREASED THE BENEFIT

($2.9 BILLION) AND THE ONE-TIME BENEFIT RELATED TO THE 2009 DECISION (DISCUSSED BELOW) TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST UNDISTRIBUTED PRIOR-YEAR NON-U.S. EARNINGS THAT WAS LARGER THAN THE 2008 DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST PRIOR-YEAR NON-U.S. EARNINGS

($0.4 BILLION). THESE INCREASES IN BENEFITS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN 2009 BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS AS COMPARED TO 2008 ($1.9 BILLION), SUBSTANTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT IN 2009 OF LOWER INTEREST RATES AND

FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON THE FUNDING OF OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A LOW RATE OF TAX.

DURING 2009, FOLLOWING THE CHANGE

IN GECS EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS, FUNDING ACTIONS TAKEN AND OUR CONTINUED REVIEW OF OUR OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING, WE DETERMINED THAT UNDISTRIBUTED PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF GECS, ON WHICH WE HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED

DEFERRED U.S. TAXES, WOULD BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION, RESULTING IN AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $0.7 BILLION

IN 2009.

THE GECS 2008 RATE REFLECTS A REDUCTION DURING 2008 OF INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS WHICH INCREASED THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF TAX

BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS ON THE TAX RATE.

GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT

A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO RISK IS IMPORTANT IN A DIVERSIFIED ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE EXECUTING ACCORDING TO OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND THAT WE ONLY ACCEPT RISK FOR WHICH WE ARE

ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED. WE EVALUATE RISK AT THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION LEVEL, AND EVALUATE AGGREGATED RISK AT THE CUSTOMER, INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AND COLLATERAL-TYPE LEVELS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGEMENT. THE GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOARD) HAS OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISK OVERSIGHT WITH A FOCUS ON THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS FACING THE

COMPANY, INCLUDING STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. AT THE END OF EACH YEAR, MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD JOINTLY DEVELOP A LIST OF MAJOR RISKS THAT GE PLANS TO PRIORITIZE IN THE NEXT YEAR. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, THE BOARD AND THE COMMITTEES

TO WHICH IT HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY DEDICATE A PORTION OF THEIR MEETINGS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS SPECIFIC RISK TOPICS IN GREATER DETAIL. STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CEOS

REPORT ON OPERATIONS TO THE BOARD AT REGULARLY SCHEDULED BOARD MEETINGS AND AT PRESENTATIONS TO THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES BY THE VICE CHAIRMEN, CHIEF RISK OFFICER, GENERAL COUNSEL AND OTHER OFFICERS. THE BOARD HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

OVERSIGHT OF SPECIFIC RISKS TO BOARD COMMITTEES AS FOLLOWS.

(34)

TABLE OF CONTENTS



IN FEBRUARY 2011, THE BOARD CREATED A RISK COMMITTEE. THIS COMMITTEE OVERSEES GES KEY RISKS, INCLUDING STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, MARKET, LIQUIDITY, FUNDING,

CREDIT AND PRODUCT RISK AND THE GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND PROCESSES FOR MONITORING AND MITIGATING SUCH RISKS. STARTING IN MARCH 2011, AS PART OF ITS OVERALL RISK OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR GE, THE RISK COMMITTEE WILL ALSO OVERSEE RISKS RELATED TO

GECS (INCLUDING GECC), WHICH PREVIOUSLY WAS SUBJECT TO DIRECT AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT. THE RISK COMMITTEE IS EXPECTED TO MEET AT LEAST FOUR TIMES A YEAR.



THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSEES GES AND GE CAPITALS POLICIES AND PROCESSES RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS,

COMPLIANCE AND AUDITING. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RECEIVES AN ANNUAL RISK UPDATE, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE KEY RISKS AFFECTING GE AS WELL AS REPORTING ON THE COMPANYS RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND PROCESSES. IN ADDITION

TO MONITORING ONGOING COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND MATTERS, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE ALSO ANNUALLY CONDUCTS AN ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND PROGRAMS.



THE PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES COMMITTEE OVERSEES RISKS RELATED TO GES PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES, THE ENVIRONMENT AND SIMILAR

MATTERS.



THE MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OVERSEES THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGEMENT RESOURCES, STRUCTURE, SUCCESSION PLANNING, MANAGEMENT

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION PROCESSES, INCLUDING EVALUATING THE EFFECT COMPENSATION STRUCTURE MAY HAVE ON RISK DECISIONS.



THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE OVERSEES RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES AND RISKS ARISING FROM RELATED

PERSON TRANSACTIONS.

THE GE BOARDS RISK OVERSIGHT PROCESS BUILDS UPON MANAGEMENTS RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION

PROCESSES, WHICH INCLUDE STANDARDIZED REVIEWS OF LONG-TERM STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL PLANNING; EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION; CODE OF CONDUCT COMPLIANCE UNDER THE COMPANYS THE SPIRIT & THE LETTER; REGULATORY COMPLIANCE; HEALTH,

SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE; FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONTROLLERSHIP; AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY. GES CHIEF RISK OFFICER (CRO) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING AND COORDINATING RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION ON AN

ENTERPRISE-WIDE BASIS. THE CRO LEADS THE CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF KEY BUSINESS RISKS, PROVIDING FOR APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT OF THESE RISKS WITHIN STATED LIMITS, AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGH POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES. MANAGEMENT HAS TWO COMMITTEES TO FURTHER ASSIST IT IN ASSESSING AND MITIGATING RISK. THE POLICY COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD MEETS BETWEEN 10 AND 14 TIMES A YEAR, IS CHAIRED BY THE COMPANYS GENERAL COUNSEL AND INCLUDES THE CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER AND OTHER SENIOR LEVEL FUNCTIONAL LEADERS. IT HAS PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE MATTERS ACROSS THE COMPANY. THE CORPORATE RISK COMMITTEE (CRC) MEETS AT LEAST FOUR TIMES A YEAR, IS CHAIRED BY THE CRO AND

COMPRISES THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO AND OTHER SENIOR LEVEL BUSINESS AND FUNCTIONAL LEADERS. IT HAS PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVALUATING AND ADDRESSING RISKS ESCALATED TO THE CRO AND CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION.

GES CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION LEVERAGES THE RISK INFRASTRUCTURES IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH HAVE ADOPTED AN APPROACH THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE

COMPANYS OVERALL RISK POLICIES, GUIDELINES AND REVIEW MECHANISMS. IN 2010, WE AUGMENTED THE RISK INFRASTRUCTURE BY FORMALIZING ENTERPRISE RISK OWNERSHIP AT THE BUSINESS UNIT LEVEL AND WITHIN OUR CORPORATE FUNCTIONS. OUR RISK INFRASTRUCTURE IS

DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY, EVALUATE AND MITIGATE RISKS WITHIN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.



STRATEGIC.

STRATEGIC RISK RELATES TO THE COMPANYS FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS AND STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKETS AND

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, COMPETITIVE THREATS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT INNOVATION, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY.



OPERATIONAL.

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PEOPLE, INTEGRITY OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, AS WELL AS EXTERNAL EVENTS THAT

AFFECT THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESSES. IT INCLUDES PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE AND EXECUTION, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND DATA SECURITY, BUSINESS DISRUPTION, HUMAN RESOURCES AND REPUTATION.

(35)

TABLE OF CONTENTS



FINANCIAL.

FINANCIAL RISK RELATES TO OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND MITIGATE CREDIT RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND EXPOSURE TO BROAD MARKET

RISKS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. LIQUIDITY RISK IS THE RISK OF BEING UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE LIABILITY MATURITIES, FUND ASSET GROWTH AND MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGH ACCESS

TO FUNDING AT REASONABLE MARKET RATES AND CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS ARISING FROM A CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY FAILURE TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE FACE CREDIT RISK IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS IN OUR GE CAPITAL

INVESTING, LENDING AND LEASING ACTIVITIES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACTIVITIES.



LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS WITH POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO FINANCIAL REPORTING, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS. GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY RISK IS THE RISK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR REGULATORY ACTIONS WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COST ON US OR

CAUSE US TO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS OR PRACTICES.

RISKS IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES ARE PRIORITIZED

AND, DEPENDING ON THE PROBABILITY AND SEVERITY OF THE RISK, ESCALATED TO THE CRO. THE CRO, IN COORDINATION WITH THE CRC, ASSIGNS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RISKS TO THE BUSINESS OR FUNCTIONAL LEADER MOST SUITED TO MANAGE THE RISK. ASSIGNED OWNERS ARE

REQUIRED TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR, EVALUATE AND REPORT ON RISKS FOR WHICH THEY BEAR RESPONSIBILITY. ENTERPRISE RISK LEADERS WITHIN EACH BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTION ARE RESPONSIBLE TO PRESENT TO THE CRO AND CRC RISK ASSESSMENTS AND KEY RISKS AT

LEAST ANNUALLY. WE HAVE GENERAL RESPONSE STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING RISKS, WHICH CATEGORIZE RISKS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL AVOID, TRANSFER, REDUCE OR ACCEPT THE RISK. THESE RESPONSE STRATEGIES ARE TAILORED TO ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE WITHIN

ACCEPTABLE GE BOARD TOLERANCE LEVELS.

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE RISK INVOLVED AND THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR FUNCTION AFFECTED, WE USE A WIDE

VARIETY OF RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES, INCLUDING HEDGING, DELEGATION OF AUTHORITIES, OPERATING REVIEWS, INSURANCE, STANDARDIZED PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC PLANNING REVIEWS. AS A MATTER OF POLICY, WE GENERALLY HEDGE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. OUR SERVICE BUSINESSES EMPLOY A COMPREHENSIVE TOLLGATE PROCESS LEADING UP TO AND THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF A CONTRACTUAL SERVICE AGREEMENT TO MITIGATE LEGAL, FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL

RISKS. FURTHERMORE, WE CENTRALLY MANAGE SOME RISKS BY PURCHASING INSURANCE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY BALANCING THE LEVEL OF RISK RETAINED OR ASSUMED WITH THE COST OF TRANSFERRING RISK TO OTHERS. WE MANAGE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND CUSTOMER DEMAND BY MONITORING INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDING BY ADJUSTING CAPACITY, IMPLEMENTING COST REDUCTIONS AND ENGAGING IN MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.

GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT

GE CAPITAL HAS

DEVELOPED A ROBUST RISK INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND THE GE CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION RELIES UPON THEM IN FULFILLMENT OF ITS MISSION. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, STARTING IN MARCH 2011, THE GE RISK COMMITTEE WILL

OVERSEE GE CAPITALS RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY AN AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITY.

AT THE GE CAPITAL LEVEL,

THE GECS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OVERSEES THE GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, AND APPROVES ALL SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT BORROWINGS AND INVESTMENTS. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

MUST COMPLY WITH APPROVAL LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE GECS BOARD.

GE CAPITALS RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH RESTS UPON THREE MAJOR TENETS: A BROAD

SPREAD OF RISK BASED ON MANAGED EXPOSURE LIMITS; SENIOR, SECURED COMMERCIAL FINANCINGS; AND A HOLD TO MATURITY MODEL WITH TRANSACTIONS UNDERWRITTEN TO ON-BOOK STANDARDS. DEDICATED RISK PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE BUSINESSES INCLUDE

UNDERWRITERS, PORTFOLIO MANAGERS, COLLECTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING SPECIALISTS, AND SPECIALIZED ASSET MANAGERS WHO EVALUATE LEASED ASSET RESIDUALS AND REMARKET OFF-LEASE EQUIPMENT. THE SENIOR RISK OFFICERS HAVE, ON AVERAGE, OVER 25 YEARS OF

EXPERIENCE.

(36)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GE CAPITAL MANAGES RISK CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED IN GE CAPITALS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IF MATERIALIZED, COULD

PREVENT GE CAPITAL FROM ACHIEVING ITS RISK OBJECTIVES AND/OR RESULT IN LOSSES. THESE RISKS ARE DEFINED AS GE CAPITALS ENTERPRISE RISK UNIVERSE, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING RISKS: STRATEGIC (INCLUDING EARNINGS AND CAPITAL), REPUTATIONAL,

LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONS (INCLUDING FINANCIAL, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LEGAL), AND COMPLIANCE.

GE CAPITALS ENTERPRISE RISK

MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (ERMC), WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THE MOST SENIOR LEADERS IN GE CAPITAL AS WELL AS THE GE CRO, OVERSEES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF APPROPRIATE RISK SYSTEMS, INCLUDING POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES THAT SUPPORT RISK

CONTROLS TO ENSURE THE ENTERPRISE RISKS ARE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED, AND CONTROLLED.

THE ERMC ALSO OVERSEES THE DEVELOPMENT OF GE

CAPITALS OVERALL RISK APPETITE. THE RISK APPETITE IS THE AMOUNT OF RISK THAT GE CAPITAL IS WILLING AND ABLE TO BEAR, EXPRESSED AS THE COMBINATION OF THE ENTERPRISE RISK OBJECTIVES AND RISK LIMITS. GE CAPITALS RISK APPETITE IS DETERMINED

RELATIVE TO ITS DESIRED RISK OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, STAND-ALONE CREDIT RATINGS, CAPITAL LEVELS, LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS, EARNINGS, DIVIDENDS AND COMPLIANCE. GE CAPITAL DETERMINES ITS RISK APPETITE THROUGH

CONSIDERATION OF PORTFOLIO ANALYTICS, INCLUDING STRESS TESTING AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL MEASUREMENT, EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT OF SENIOR RISK OFFICERS, CURRENT PORTFOLIO LEVELS, STRATEGIC PLANNING, AND REGULATORY AND RATING AGENCY EXPECTATIONS.

GE CAPITAL USES STRESS TESTING TO SUPPLEMENT OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. THE ERMC APPROVES THE HIGH-LEVEL SCENARIOS FOR, AND REVIEWS THE RESULTS

OF, GE CAPITAL-WIDE STRESS TESTS ACROSS KEY RISK AREAS, SUCH AS CREDIT AND INVESTMENT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISK. STRESS TEST RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF IMPACT TO CAPITAL LEVELS AND METRICS, AND THAT INFORMATION IS REVIEWED WITH THE GECS

BOARD AND THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR. STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS ARE SET FORTH IN THE COMPANYS APPROVED RISK POLICIES. KEY POLICIES, SUCH AS THE ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY, THE ENTERPRISE RISK APPETITE STATEMENT AND

THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE APPROVED BY THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

GE CAPITAL, IN COORDINATION WITH AND UNDER THE

OVERSIGHT OF THE GE CRO, PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE RISK REPORTS TO THE GE RISK COMMITTEE. AT THESE MEETINGS, WHICH OCCUR AT LEAST FOUR TIMES A YEAR, GE CAPITAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON THE RISK STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING

THE RISK OVERSIGHT PROCESSES USED TO MANAGE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF RISK MANAGED BY THE ERMC.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR LIQUIDITY AND HOW WE MANAGE

THIS RISK CAN BE FOUND IN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY SECTION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREDIT RISK AND GECS PORTFOLIO CAN BE FOUND IN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTIONS.

SEGMENT OPERATIONS

OUR FIVE SEGMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON THE

BROAD MARKETS THEY SERVE: ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, NBC UNIVERSAL, GE CAPITAL AND HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING INFORMATION ON SEGMENTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY, WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SEGMENTS FOR GREATER CLARITY.

SEGMENT PROFIT IS DETERMINED BASED ON INTERNAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT ASSESSMENT, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MAY EXCLUDE MATTERS SUCH AS CHARGES FOR RESTRUCTURING; RATIONALIZATION AND OTHER SIMILAR

EXPENSES; IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES AND BALANCES; TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS; CERTAIN GAINS AND LOSSES FROM ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS; AND LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS OR OTHER

CHARGES, RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHICH PRECEDED THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT TEAM.

(37)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEGMENT PROFIT EXCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, RESULTS REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, EARNINGS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES. SEGMENT PROFIT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES AND INCOME TAXES ACCORDING TO HOW A PARTICULAR SEGMENTS MANAGEMENT IS

MEASURED  EXCLUDED IN DETERMINING SEGMENT PROFIT, WHICH WE SOMETIMES REFER TO AS OPERATING PROFIT, FOR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, NBC UNIVERSAL AND HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS; INCLUDED IN DETERMINING

SEGMENT PROFIT, WHICH WE SOMETIMES REFER TO AS NET EARNINGS, FOR GE CAPITAL. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011, WE WILL ALLOCATE SERVICE COSTS RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AND WE WILL NO LONGER ALLOCATE THE RETIREE COSTS OF OUR

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO OUR SEGMENTS. THIS REVISED ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WILL BETTER ALIGN SEGMENT OPERATING COSTS TO THE ACTIVE EMPLOYEE COSTS, WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE SEGMENTS. WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS CHANGE TO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT

REPORTED SEGMENT RESULTS.

WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR-PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT-PERIOD PRESENTATION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ABOUT OUR SEGMENTS, SEE PART I, ITEM 1. BUSINESS AND NOTE 28 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR SECURITY BUSINESS; RESULTS OF OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES REMAINING IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS; COST OF OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS; UNDERABSORBED CORPORATE OVERHEAD; AND CERTAIN NON-ALLOCATED AMOUNTS DESCRIBED BELOW. CORPORATE

ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS IS NOT AN OPERATING SEGMENT. RATHER, IT IS ADDED TO OPERATING SEGMENT TOTALS TO RECONCILE TO CONSOLIDATED TOTALS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS COST ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO GE OPERATING SEGMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF THEIR OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES. IN

2010, THESE INCLUDED $0.5 BILLION AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND $0.3 BILLION AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, PRIMARILY FOR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS, RESTRUCTURING, RATIONALIZATION AND OTHER CHARGES, AND $0.3 BILLION AT HOME &

BUSINESS SOLUTIONS AND $0.1 BILLION AT NBC UNIVERSAL, PRIMARILY FOR RESTRUCTURING, RATIONALIZATION AND OTHER CHARGES. IN 2009, THESE INCLUDED $0.3 BILLION AT BOTH TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND $0.2 BILLION AT

HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, PRIMARILY FOR RESTRUCTURING, RATIONALIZATION AND OTHER CHARGES AND $0.3 BILLION AT NBC UNIVERSAL, PRIMARILY FOR RESTRUCTURING, RATIONALIZATION AND OTHER CHARGES AND TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. IN

2008, AMOUNTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, RATIONALIZATION AND OTHER CHARGES WERE $0.5 BILLION AT NBC UNIVERSAL, $0.4 BILLION AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND $0.3 BILLION AT EACH OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOME & BUSINESS

SOLUTIONS. INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS IN 2008 WERE TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $0.2 BILLION AT NBC UNIVERSAL AND $0.1 BILLION AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

IN 2010, UNDERABSORBED CORPORATE OVERHEAD INCREASED BY $0.2 BILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASED COSTS AT OUR GLOBAL RESEARCH CENTERS. OTHER OPERATING PROFIT (COST) DECREASED $0.4 BILLION IN 2010 AS COMPARED

WITH 2009, AS LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS RELATED TO THE HUDSON RIVER DREDGING PROJECT) ($0.6 BILLION) WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS RELATED TO DISPOSED BUSINESSES ($0.2 BILLION).

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PRIMARILY COMPRISED BAC, GE MONEY JAPAN, OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS (WMC), CONSUMER RV MARINE, CONSUMER MEXICO

AND PLASTICS. RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR 100% INTEREST IN BAC FOR $1.9 BILLION. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $0.8 BILLION IN 2010. THE DISPOSITION OF BAC IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR GOAL OF REDUCING ENI AND FOCUSING OUR BUSINESSES ON SELECTIVE

FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS WHERE WE HAVE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, BROAD DISTRIBUTION, AND THE ABILITY TO EARN A CONSISTENT RETURN ON CAPITAL, WHILE MANAGING OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET SIZE AND RISK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO SELL CONSUMER RV MARINE AND CONSUMER MEXICO FOR

APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION AND APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND HAVE CLASSIFIED THESE BUSINESSES AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

DURING THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL OUR LAKE BUSINESS AND RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $0.9 BILLION, WHICH REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NET BOOK VALUE OF OUR LAKE BUSINESS AND THE PROJECTED SALE PRICE. DURING 2008, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WHICH INCLUDED LAKE, ALONG WITH OUR JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN GE NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SALE, AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR

JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, WE RECORDED AN INCREMENTAL $0.4 BILLION LOSS IN 2008.

IN 2010, LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES,

PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREMENTAL RESERVES FOR EXCESS INTEREST CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR LOSS-SHARING ARRANGEMENT ON THE 2008 SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN ($1.7 BILLION) AND ESTIMATED AFTER-TAX LOSSES OF $0.2 BILLION AND $0.1 BILLION ON THE PLANNED SALES OF

CONSUMER MEXICO AND CONSUMER RV MARINE, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN AFTER-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF BAC OF $0.8 BILLION AND EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AT CONSUMER MEXICO OF $0.2 BILLION AND AT BAC OF $0.1 BILLION.

LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, IN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREMENTAL RESERVES FOR EXCESS INTEREST CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR LOSS-SHARING

ARRANGEMENT ON THE 2008 SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN OF $0.1 BILLION.

LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, IN 2008 WAS $0.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY

REFLECTED A LOSS FROM OPERATIONS OF $0.3 BILLION, AND INCREMENTAL RESERVES FOR EXCESS INTEREST CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR LOSS-SHARING ARRANGEMENT ON THE 2008 SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN OF $0.4 BILLION.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS

OUR GLOBAL ACTIVITIES SPAN ALL GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND PRIMARILY ENCOMPASS MANUFACTURING FOR LOCAL AND EXPORT MARKETS, IMPORT AND SALE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN OTHER REGIONS, LEASING OF AIRCRAFT, SOURCING FOR OUR

PLANTS DOMICILED IN OTHER GLOBAL REGIONS AND PROVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES WITHIN THESE REGIONAL ECONOMIES. THUS, WHEN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS EXPERIENCE CURRENCY AND/OR ECONOMIC STRESS, WE OFTEN HAVE INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN RISKS, BUT ALSO

OFTEN HAVE NEW PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES. POTENTIAL INCREASED RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER RECEIVABLE DELINQUENCIES AND BAD DEBTS, DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF SALES AND ORDERS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO POWER AND AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT, HIGHER LOCAL

CURRENCY FINANCING COSTS AND SLOWDOWN IN ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES. NEW PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER COST OUTSOURCING, EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES

THROUGH PURCHASES OF COMPANIES OR ASSETS AT REDUCED PRICES AND LOWER U.S. DEBT FINANCING COSTS.

REVENUES ARE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE REGION TO

WHICH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ANALYSIS, U.S. IS PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE AMERICAS. WE CLASSIFY CERTAIN OPERATIONS THAT CANNOT MEANINGFULLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AS OTHER

GLOBAL FOR THIS PURPOSE.

GECS GLOBAL ASSETS ON A CONTINUING BASIS OF $279.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2010 WERE 9% LOWER THAN AT THE END OF 2009, REFLECTING CORE DECLINES IN EUROPE AND THE PACIFIC BASIN, PRIMARILY DUE TO PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF IN VARIOUS BUSINESSES AT CONSUMER AND

LOWER FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS AT CLL.

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR GLOBAL ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS ARE AFFECTED BY

CURRENCY EXCHANGE. WE USE A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES TO MANAGE THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE, INCLUDING SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND SELECTIVE HEDGING OF SIGNIFICANT CROSS-CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. SUCH PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES ARE THE POUND

STERLING, THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

OUR OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES, INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZEABLE

NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL

SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.2 BILLION IN 2010, $0.3 BILLION IN 2009 AND $0.2 BILLION IN 2008. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $0.4

BILLION FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) TO DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENT FROM THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE CONSENT DECREE PROVIDED THAT THE DREDGING WOULD BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES. PHASE 1 WAS COMPLETED IN MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009. BETWEEN PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 THERE WAS AN

INTERVENING PEER REVIEW BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF NATIONAL EXPERTS. THE PANEL EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF PHASE 1 DREDGING OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO PHASE 1 ENGINEERING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE STANDARDS. ON

DECEMBER 17, 2010, EPA ISSUED ITS DECISIONS SETTING FORTH THE FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR PHASE 2 OF THE DREDGING PROJECT, INCORPORATING ASPECTS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW PANEL AND FROM GE. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE

AGREED WITH EPA TO PERFORM PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS SET BY EPA. WE HAVE REVIEWED EPAS FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR PHASE 2 TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL SCOPE AND DURATION OF PHASE 2, AS WELL AS

OPERATIONAL AND ENGINEERING CHANGES THAT COULD BE REQUIRED. BASED ON THIS REVIEW AND OUR BEST PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING JUDGMENT, WE INCREASED OUR RESERVE FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS FOR COMPLETING THE HUDSON RIVER DREDGING PROJECT BY $0.8

BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

THIS DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ADDRESSES THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS, DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS, THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS EQUITY, THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL

POSITION

MAJOR CHANGES TO OUR SHAREOWNERS EQUITY ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS EQUITY SECTION.

IN ADDITION, OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO BALANCES IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION FOLLOW.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

BECAUSE GE AND GECS SHARE CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF THEIR STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND BORROWINGS, FOR EXAMPLE

 THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES SIGNIFICANT CAPTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT. WITHIN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GE AND GECS ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO PERMIT MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OF EACH

INDIVIDUAL CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

COMPRISE MAINLY INVESTMENT GRADE DEBT SECURITIES SUPPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO ANNUITANTS

AND POLICYHOLDERS IN OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND HOLDERS OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (GICS) IN TRINITY (WHICH CEASED ISSUING NEW INVESTMENT CONTRACTS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010) AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES HELD AT OUR

GLOBAL BANKS. THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES DECREASED TO $43.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, FROM $51.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN RETAINED INTERESTS AS A RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF FASB

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2009-16 AND ASU 2009-17, AMENDMENTS TO ASC 860,

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING

, AND ASC 810,

CONSOLIDATIONS

, RESPECTIVELY (ASU 2009-16 & 17), AND MATURITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED MARKET

CONDITIONS. OF THE AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HELD DEBT SECURITIES WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $42.8 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS) AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES (CMBS) WITH ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $25.4 BILLION, $2.8 BILLION AND $2.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON DEBT SECURITIES WERE $1.4 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, RMBS AND CMBS OF $0.4 BILLION, $0.4 BILLION AND $0.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AS COMPARED WITH $0.8 BILLION, $0.8 BILLION AND $0.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

(48)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA. WE

PRESENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO SELL OUR DEBT SECURITIES AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EQUITY SECURITIES WILL BE RECOVERED WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

OUR RMBS PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED PRIMARILY

BY POOLS OF INDIVIDUAL, DIRECT MORTGAGE LOANS (A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND 2005), NOT OTHER STRUCTURED PRODUCTS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR RMBS SECURITIES ARE IN A SENIOR POSITION IN THE

CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEALS AND 65% ARE AGENCY BONDS OR INSURED BY MONOLINE INSURERS (ON WHICH WE CONTINUE TO PLACE RELIANCE). OF OUR TOTAL RMBS PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY $0.7 BILLION AND $0.9

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT, PRIMARILY SUPPORTING OUR GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. A MAJORITY OF EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT RELATED TO INVESTMENT SECURITIES BACKED BY MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED IN

2006 AND 2005. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SUBPRIME RMBS WERE INVESTMENT GRADE AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND APPROXIMATELY 72% HAVE BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY DOWNGRADED TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE.

OUR CMBS PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED BY BOTH DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF MORTGAGES THAT WERE ORIGINATED FOR SECURITIZATION (CONDUIT CMBS) AND POOLS OF LARGE LOANS BACKED BY HIGH QUALITY PROPERTIES (LARGE LOAN CMBS), A

MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE ORIGINATED IN 2007 AND 2006. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES IN OUR CMBS PORTFOLIO HAVE INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SECURITIES ARE IN A SENIOR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ABS) PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF ASSETS SUCH AS STUDENT LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS, AS WELL AS LARGE

SENIOR SECURED LOANS OF HIGH QUALITY MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR ABS SECURITIES ARE IN A SENIOR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEALS. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES THAT

ARE BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE ARE IN AN UNREALIZED GAIN POSITION.

FOR ABS, INCLUDING RMBS, WE ESTIMATE THE PORTION OF LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS CONSIDER INTERNAL CREDIT RISK, INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATE OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITY AND PREPAYMENT RATES. FOR CMBS, WE ESTIMATE THE PORTION OF LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT BY EVALUATING POTENTIAL LOSSES ON EACH OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS IN THE SECURITY. COLLATERAL

CASH FLOWS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEALS. ASSUMPTIONS CAN VARY WIDELY DEPENDING UPON THE COLLATERAL TYPE, GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS AND VINTAGE.

IF THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN CASH FLOWS FOR RMBS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS SUCH AS MONOLINE INSURANCE (WHICH ARE FEATURES OF A SPECIFIC

SECURITY). IN EVALUATING THE OVERALL CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE MONOLINE INSURER (MONOLINE), WE USE AN ANALYSIS THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH WE USE FOR CORPORATE BONDS, INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE MONOLINES CASH RESERVES

AND CAPITAL, RATINGS ACTIVITY, WHETHER THE MONOLINE IS IN DEFAULT OR DEFAULT APPEARS IMMINENT, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR INTERVENTION BY AN INSURANCE OR OTHER REGULATOR.

MONOLINES PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES, PRIMARILY RMBS AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES. THE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS A FEATURE OF EACH SPECIFIC SECURITY THAT GUARANTEES THE PAYMENT OF

ALL CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS, AND IS NOT PURCHASED SEPARATELY BY GE. THE MONOLINE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL STRESS FROM INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL LOANS UNDERLYING INSURED SECURITIES. WE CONTINUE TO RELY

ON MONOLINES WITH ADEQUATE CAPITAL AND CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES. WE HAVE REDUCED OUR RELIANCE ON MONOLINES THAT DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CAPITAL OR HAVE EXPERIENCED REGULATOR INTERVENTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES INSURED BY

MONOLINES ON WHICH WE CONTINUE TO PLACE RELIANCE WERE $1.7 BILLION, INCLUDING $0.3 BILLION OF OUR $0.7 BILLION INVESTMENT IN SUBPRIME RMBS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES SUBJECT TO MONOLINE CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS AN EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS WAS $0.3 BILLION.

TOTAL PRE-TAX, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES DURING 2010 WERE $0.5

BILLION, OF WHICH $0.3 BILLION WAS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AND PRIMARILY RELATES TO CREDIT LOSSES ON RMBS, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, NON-U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND $0.2 BILLION PRIMARILY RELATES TO NON-CREDIT RELATED

LOSSES ON RMBS AND IS INCLUDED WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR QUALITATIVE REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY ISSUERS SECURITIES THAT ARE AT-RISK OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THAT IS, FOR SECURITIES THAT WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL AND IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WHETHER THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CREDIT LOSS THAT

WOULD RESULT IN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNITION IN THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS. SECURITIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS AT-RISK PRIMARILY RELATE TO INVESTMENTS IN RMBS SECURITIES AND NON-U.S. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES ACROSS A BROAD

RANGE OF INDUSTRIES. THE AMOUNT OF ASSOCIATED UNREALIZED LOSS ON THESE SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, IS $0.4 BILLION. CREDIT LOSSES THAT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS ARE CALCULATED WHEN WE DETERMINE THE SECURITY TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY CAUSE INCREASED LEVELS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES TOTALED $1.4 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.2 BILLION AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER, COMPARED WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $2.6 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.3 BILLION AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. OF THE AMOUNT AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, MORE THAN 70% OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, OF THE AMOUNT AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER,

$0.7 BILLION AND $0.3 BILLION RELATED TO STRUCTURED SECURITIES (MORTGAGE-BACKED, ASSET-BACKED AND SECURITIZATION RETAINED INTERESTS) AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED

LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE VAST MAJORITY RELATE TO DEBT SECURITIES HELD TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS OF GICS AND ANNUITANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS IN OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE OPERATIONS. WE PRESENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO SELL OUR DEBT

SECURITIES AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS

. FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A MARKET PARTICIPANT AT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT

WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1 AND 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART

II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

INVESTMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS

INCLUDE EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF $0.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2010. THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ON THESE ASSETS, FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE, WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THOSE CHANGES OCCUR. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WE ALSO HAVE ASSETS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, LOANS AND REAL

ESTATE PROPERTIES, CARRIED AT $3.5 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2010, WHICH REPRESENTS THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL IS LOWER THAN CARRYING VALUE, ANY

FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL BE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR.

WORKING CAPITAL

,

REPRESENTING GE CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, LESS GE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND PROGRESS COLLECTIONS, WAS $(1.6) BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DOWN AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS REDUCTIONS IN INVENTORY AND AN

INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND LOWER PROGRESS COLLECTIONS. AS ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE DELIVER UNITS OUT OF THEIR BACKLOGS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PROGRESS COLLECTIONS OF $11.8

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WILL BE EARNED, WHICH, ALONG WITH PROGRESS COLLECTIONS ON NEW ORDERS, WILL IMPACT WORKING CAPITAL. THROUGHOUT THE LAST FOUR YEARS, WE HAVE EXECUTED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THROUGH OUR OPERATING COUNCIL,

SUCH AS LEAN CYCLE TIME PROJECTS, WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF WORKING CAPITAL. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THESE INITIATIVES IN 2011, WHICH SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF DECREASES IN PROGRESS COLLECTIONS.

WE DISCUSS CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, TWO IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL, IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

(50)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CURRENT RECEIVABLES

FOR GE TOTALED TO $10.4 BILLION AT THE END OF 2010 AND $9.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2009, AND

INCLUDED $8.1 BILLION DUE FROM CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF 2010 COMPARED WITH $7.5 BILLION AT THE END OF 2009. GE CURRENT RECEIVABLES TURNOVER WAS 8.6 IN 2010, COMPARED WITH 8.2 IN 2009. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN CURRENT RECEIVABLES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE HIGHER VOLUME IN TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESSES.

INVENTORIES

FOR GE TOTALED TO $11.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DOWN $0.5

BILLION FROM THE END OF 2009. THIS DECREASE REFLECTED LOWER INVENTORIES AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INVENTORIES AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. GE INVENTORY TURNOVER WAS 7.2 AND 6.8 IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 5

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

IS OUR LARGEST CATEGORY OF ASSETS AND REPRESENTS ONE OF OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF REVENUES. OUR PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS

DIVERSE AND NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO MAJOR U.S. BANKS. A DISCUSSION OF THE QUALITY OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO FOLLOWS.

OUR CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS LARGELY NON-U.S. AND PRIMARILY COMPRISES MORTGAGE, SALES FINANCE, AUTO AND PERSONAL LOANS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN AND ASIAN COUNTRIES. OUR

U.S. CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES COMPRISE 14% OF OUR TOTAL PORTFOLIO. OF THOSE, APPROXIMATELY 63% RELATE PRIMARILY TO CREDIT CARDS, WHICH ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO PROFIT AND LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RETAILER (THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE

REFLECTED IN REVENUES), AND HAVE A SMALLER AVERAGE BALANCE AND LOWER LOSS SEVERITY AS COMPARED TO BANK CARDS. THE REMAINING 37% ARE SALES FINANCE RECEIVABLES, WHICH PROVIDE ELECTRONICS, RECREATION, MEDICAL AND HOME IMPROVEMENT FINANCING TO

CUSTOMERS. IN 2007, WE EXITED THE U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS AND WE HAVE NO U.S. AUTO OR STUDENT LOANS.

OUR COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY COMPRISES

SENIOR, SECURED POSITIONS WITH COMPARATIVELY LOW LOSS HISTORY. THE SECURED RECEIVABLES IN THIS PORTFOLIO ARE COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF ASSET CLASSES, WHICH FOR OUR CLL BUSINESS PRIMARILY INCLUDE: INDUSTRIAL-RELATED FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT,

VEHICLES, CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, AND EQUIPMENT USED IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, MEDIA, COMMUNICATIONS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES. THE PORTFOLIOS IN OUR REAL ESTATE, GECAS AND ENERGY

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND OPERATING ASSETS IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY AND WATER INDUSTRIES, RESPECTIVELY. WE ARE IN A SECURED POSITION FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL

PORTFOLIO.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED FINANCING RECEIVABLE. SUCH AN ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED

FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL VALUES (INCLUDING

HOUSING PRICE INDICES AS APPLICABLE), AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO PROVIDE FOR LOSSES ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT

CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS, AND EVALUATES RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR

INDIVIDUAL LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

LOANS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS ACQUISITION ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE,

WHICH INCORPORATES OUR ESTIMATE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE OF THE CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IS NOT CARRIED OVER AT ACQUISITION. THIS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF CAUSING LOWER RESERVE

COVERAGE RATIOS FOR THOSE PORTFOLIOS.

PAST DUE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS; AND NONEARNING RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE (OR FOR WHICH COLLECTION IS OTHERWISE DOUBTFUL). NONEARNING RECEIVABLES EXCLUDE LOANS PURCHASED AT A DISCOUNT (UNLESS THEY

HAVE DETERIORATED POST ACQUISITION). UNDER ASC 310,

RECEIVABLES

, THESE LOANS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ACCRETE INTEREST INCOME OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE LOAN BASED ON REASONABLY ESTIMABLE CASH FLOWS EVEN IF THE UNDERLYING

LOANS ARE CONTRACTUALLY DELINQUENT AT ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, NONEARNING RECEIVABLES EXCLUDE LOANS THAT ARE PAYING ON A CASH ACCOUNTING BASIS BUT CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL AND IMPAIRED. NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE ALL

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AND ARE THOSE ON WHICH WE HAVE STOPPED ACCRUING INTEREST. WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED

FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DELINQUENT WHEN PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURED TERMS, BUT MAY REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A PERIOD OF SATISFACTORY PAYMENT PERFORMANCE BY THE BORROWER AND

FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF COLLECTION.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND

THE CREDIT QUALITY AND CATEGORIZATION OF OUR FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS PROVIDED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND NOTES 1, 6 AND 23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL

ON JANUARY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED ASU 2009-16 & 17, RESULTING IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF $40.2 BILLION OF NET

FINANCING RECEIVABLES AT JANUARY 1, 2010. WE HAVE PROVIDED COMPARISONS OF OUR FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 TO JANUARY 1, 2010, AS WE BELIEVE THAT IT PROVIDES A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR PORTFOLIO

QUALITY FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-16 & 17.

THE PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, WAS $327.3 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND $376.7 BILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010. FINANCING RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, DECREASED $49.4 BILLION FROM JANUARY 1, 2010, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF COLLECTIONS EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS ($26.3 BILLION)

(WHICH INCLUDES SALES), WRITE-OFFS ($10.1 BILLION), THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR ($2.1 BILLION) AND DISPOSITIONS ($1.2 BILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ACQUISITIONS ($2.8 BILLION).

RELATED NONEARNING RECEIVABLES TOTALED $11.6 BILLION (3.5% OF OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $14.2 BILLION (3.8% OF OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES) AT JANUARY 1, 2010. NONEARNING

RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM JANUARY 1, 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ENTRY RATES IN CONSUMER AND IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN COMMERCIAL, OFFSET BY INCREASED REAL ESTATE DELINQUENCIES DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT IN

THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 TOTALED $8.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH $9.6 BILLION AT

JANUARY 1, 2010, REPRESENTING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES DECREASED $1.5 BILLION FROM JANUARY 1, 2010, PRIMARILY BECAUSE PROVISIONS WERE LOWER THAN WRITE-OFFS, NET OF RECOVERIES BY

$1.3 BILLION, WHICH IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL FINANCING RECEIVABLES BALANCE AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 2.3% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO 2.5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-16 & 17 ON JANUARY 1, 2010. FURTHER INFORMATION SURROUNDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES RELATED TO EACH OF OUR PORTFOLIOS IS DETAILED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLL  AMERICAS

. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $2.6 BILLION REPRESENTED 22.2% OF TOTAL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 36.2% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 50.1% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 REFLECTING AN OVERALL DECREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES COMBINED

WITH A FURTHER SLIGHT INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY IN OUR EQUIPMENT, AND FRANCHISE RESTAURANT AND HOTEL PORTFOLIOS. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AS A PERCENT OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM 3.4% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 3.0% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED NONEARNING EXPOSURES IN OUR CORPORATE LENDING, CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, AND INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS PORTFOLIOS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET DETERIORATION IN OUR HEALTHCARE AND FRANCHISE RESTAURANT AND HOTEL

PORTFOLIOS. COLLATERAL SUPPORTING THESE NONEARNING FINANCING RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY INCLUDES CORPORATE AIRCRAFT AND ASSETS IN THE RESTAURANT AND HOSPITALITY, TRUCKING, AND FORESTRY INDUSTRIES, AND FOR OUR LEVERAGED FINANCE BUSINESS, EQUITY OF THE

UNDERLYING BUSINESSES.

CLL  EUROPE

. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $1.2 BILLION REPRESENTED 10.7% OF TOTAL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM 39.9% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 34.6% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AS A GREATER PROPORTION OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

THE INTERBANCA S.P.A. PORTFOLIO, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN 2009. THE LOANS ACQUIRED WITH INTERBANCA S.P.A WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCORPORATES AN ESTIMATE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER THEIR REMAINING LIFE. ACCORDINGLY, THESE

LOANS GENERALLY HAVE A LOWER RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES COMPARED TO THE REMAINING PORTFOLIO. EXCLUDING THE NONEARNING LOANS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE 2009 ACQUISITION OF INTERBANCA S.P.A., THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE

FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 67.2% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 65.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DUE TO THE INCREASE OF HIGHLY COLLATERALIZED NONEARNING RECEIVABLES IN OUR SENIOR SECURED LENDING PORTFOLIO,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES IN OUR SENIOR SECURED LENDING AND EQUIPMENT FINANCE PORTFOLIOS DUE TO RESTRUCTURING, SALE, OR WRITE-OFF. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AS A PERCENT OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES REMAINED

CONSISTENT AT 3.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES IN THE INTERBANCA S.P.A. PORTFOLIO OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES ACROSS OUR SENIOR SECURED LENDING, EQUIPMENT FINANCE AND ASSET-BASED

LENDING PORTFOLIOS, PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. COLLATERAL SUPPORTING THESE SECURED NONEARNING FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE PRIMARILY EQUITY OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESSES FOR OUR SENIOR SECURED LENDING BUSINESS AND EQUIPMENT AND

TRADE RECEIVABLES FOR OUR EQUIPMENT FINANCE AND ASSET-BASED LENDING PORTFOLIOS, RESPECTIVELY.

CLL  ASIA

. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $0.4

BILLION REPRESENTED 3.5% OF TOTAL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 41.9% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 54.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY

AS A RESULT OF RESTRUCTURING, SALE OR WRITE-OFF OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES IN OUR ASSET-BASED FINANCING BUSINESSES IN JAPAN, WHICH IS HIGHLY COLLATERALIZED. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AS A PERCENT OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM 4.2%

AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 3.4% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES RELATED TO OUR ASSET-BASED FINANCING BUSINESSES IN JAPAN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER FINANCING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. COLLATERAL

SUPPORTING THESE NONEARNING FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, AND ASSETS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY.

REAL ESTATE  DEBT

. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $1.0 BILLION REPRESENTED 8.3% OF TOTAL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE INCREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES FROM JANUARY 1, 2010,

WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED DELINQUENCIES IN THE U.S. OFFICE PORTFOLIO AND THE EUROPEAN HOTEL AND RETAIL PORTFOLIOS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FORECLOSURES AND DISCOUNTED PAYOFFS PRIMARILY RELATED TO U.S. MULTI-FAMILY LOANS. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE

FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM 144.3% TO 134.4% REFLECTING WRITE-OFFS DRIVEN BY SETTLEMENTS AND PAYOFFS FROM IMPAIRED LOAN BORROWERS. SINCE OUR APPROACH IDENTIFIES LOANS AS IMPAIRED EVEN WHEN THE LOAN IS CURRENTLY

PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS, INCREASES IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DO NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE PROPORTIONATE INCREASES IN RESERVES UPON MIGRATION TO NONEARNING STATUS AS SPECIFIC RESERVES HAVE OFTEN BEEN ESTABLISHED ON THE LOANS PRIOR

TO THEIR MIGRATION TO NONEARNING STATUS. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 3.7% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 4.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED RENTAL RATE

DETERIORATION IN THE U.S. MARKETS, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN SPECIFIC CREDIT LOSS PROVISIONS.

(56)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE REAL ESTATE FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED BY INCOME-PRODUCING OR OWNER-OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL

PROPERTIES ACROSS A VARIETY OF ASSET CLASSES AND MARKETS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, TOTAL REAL ESTATE FINANCING RECEIVABLES OF $40.2 BILLION WERE PRIMARILY COLLATERALIZED BY OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES ($10.0 BILLION), OFFICE BUILDINGS ($9.4

BILLION), APARTMENT BUILDINGS ($6.2 BILLION) AND HOTEL PROPERTIES ($4.4 BILLION). IN 2010, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS HAVE CONTINUED TO BE UNDER PRESSURE, WITH LIMITED MARKET LIQUIDITY AND CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO

MAINTAIN AN INTENSE FOCUS ON OPERATIONS AND RISK MANAGEMENT. LOAN LOSS RESERVES RELATED TO OUR REAL ESTATE - DEBT FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO DECLINES IN UNDERLYING PROPERTY VALUES. ASSUMING GLOBAL PROPERTY VALUES

DECLINE AN INCREMENTAL 1% OR 5%, AND THAT DECLINE OCCURS EVENLY ACROSS GEOGRAPHIES AND ASSET CLASSES, WE ESTIMATE INCREMENTAL LOAN LOSS RESERVES WOULD BE REQUIRED OF APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION AND $0.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF

GLOBAL PROPERTY VALUES ON LOSS PERFORMANCE ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PROPERTY LEVEL OPERATING PERFORMANCE, LOCAL MARKET DYNAMICS AND INDIVIDUAL BORROWER BEHAVIOR. AS A RESULT, ANY

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES OR ATTEMPTS TO FORECAST POTENTIAL LOSSES CARRY A HIGH DEGREE OF IMPRECISION AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD 116 FORECLOSED COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES WHICH HAD A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.6

BILLION.

CONSUMER  NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES

. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $3.8 BILLION REPRESENTED 33.0% OF TOTAL NONEARNING

RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 21.4% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 21.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN 2010, OUR NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DECREASED

PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED COLLECTION AND LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS AND SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN THE U.K. HOUSING MARKET. OUR NON-U.S. MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO HAS A LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO OF APPROXIMATELY 75% AT ORIGINATION AND THE VAST MAJORITY ARE FIRST

LIEN POSITIONS. OUR U.K. AND FRANCE PORTFOLIOS, WHICH COMPRISE A MAJORITY OF OUR TOTAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, HAVE REINDEXED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OF 83% AND 60%, RESPECTIVELY. ABOUT 3% OF THESE LOANS ARE WITHOUT MORTGAGE INSURANCE AND HAVE A REINDEXED

LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 100%. LOAN-TO-VALUE INFORMATION IS UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOR A MAJORITY OF OUR LOANS AND CONSIDERS ECONOMIC FACTORS SUCH AS THE HOUSING PRICE INDEX. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD IN

REPOSSESSION STOCK APPROXIMATELY 700 HOUSES IN THE U.K., WHICH HAD A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AS A PERCENT OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 7.9% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 8.4% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED ORIGINATIONS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS.

CONSUMER  NON-U.S. INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING CREDIT.

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $0.3 BILLION REPRESENTED 2.5% OF TOTAL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 272.9% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 325.9% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, REFLECTING CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX FOLLOWING THE RECLASSIFICATION OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES TO ASSETS OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE FOLLOWING OUR COMMITMENT IN 2010 TO SELL OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL AND

CANADA.

CONSUMER  U.S. INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING CREDIT

. NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $1.2 BILLION REPRESENTED 10.4% OF TOTAL NONEARNING

RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES REMAINED CONSISTENT AT APPROXIMATELY 194.2%. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AS A PERCENTAGE OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM

3.7% AT JANUARY 1, 2010, TO 2.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DELINQUENCIES REFLECTING AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES DETAILS RELATED TO OUR NONACCRUAL AND NONEARNING

FINANCING RECEIVABLES. NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE ALL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AND ARE THOSE ON WHICH WE HAVE STOPPED ACCRUING INTEREST. WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE

ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NONEARNING AND NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES RELATE TO LOANS WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES BUT ARE PAYING ON A CASH ACCOUNTING BASIS, AND

THEREFORE EXCLUDED FROM NONEARNING RECEIVABLES. OF OUR $21.4 BILLION NONACCRUAL LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, $9.3 BILLION ARE CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

IMPAIRED LOANS

IMPAIRED LOANS IN THE TABLE BELOW ARE DEFINED AS LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT

ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CONSUMER AND A PORTION OF OUR CLL NONACCRUAL RECEIVABLES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS DEFINITION, AS THEY REPRESENT SMALLER BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS

THAT WE EVALUATE COLLECTIVELY BY PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT.

IMPAIRED LOANS INCLUDE NONEARNING RECEIVABLES ON LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS, LOANS

THAT ARE CURRENTLY PAYING INTEREST UNDER THE CASH BASIS (BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE NONEARNING CATEGORY), AND LOANS PAYING CURRENTLY BUT WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY RESTRUCTURED.

SPECIFIC RESERVES ARE RECORDED FOR INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED LOANS TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE

LOAN AGREEMENT. CERTAIN LOANS CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED MAY NOT REQUIRE A RESERVE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY COLLECT THE UNPAID BALANCE (THROUGH COLLECTION OR COLLATERAL REPOSSESSION).

IMPAIRED LOANS CONSOLIDATED AS A RESULT OF OUR

ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-16 & 17 PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS. IMPAIRED LOANS INCREASED BY $4.8 BILLION FROM JANUARY 1, 2010, TO DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY RELATING TO INCREASES AT REAL ESTATE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR

REAL ESTATE LOANS FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WE CLASSIFY REAL ESTATE LOANS AS IMPAIRED WHEN THE MOST RECENT VALUATION REFLECTS A PROJECTED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO AT MATURITY IN EXCESS OF 100%, EVEN IF THE LOAN IS CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE

WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE INCREASE IN REAL ESTATE IMPAIRED LOANS REFLECTS DETERIORATION IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES, PARTICULARLY IN JAPAN AND THE U.S., AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRS). REAL ESTATE SPECIFIC

RESERVES HAVE NOT INCREASED PROPORTIONATELY TO THE INCREASE IN IMPAIRED LOANS, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TDRS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY RECOVERABLE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND ARE PERFORMING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR

MODIFIED TERMS. OF OUR $9.8 BILLION IMPAIRED LOANS AT REAL ESTATE AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, $8.1 BILLION ARE CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AND ARE TYPICALLY LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS ADEQUATE DEBT SERVICE

COVERAGE TO MEET CONTRACTUAL INTEREST OBLIGATIONS. IMPAIRED LOANS AT CLL PRIMARILY REPRESENT SENIOR SECURED LENDING POSITIONS.

OUR LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGY IS INTENDED TO

MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND, AT TIMES, CAN RESULT IN RATE REDUCTIONS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, EXTENSIONS, FORBEARANCE OR OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE RELATED LOAN TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A TDR, AND ALSO AS IMPAIRED. CHANGES TO REAL ESTATES

LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE MATURITY EXTENSIONS, PRINCIPAL PAYMENT ACCELERATION, CHANGES TO COLLATERAL TERMS AND CASH SWEEPS, WHICH ARE IN ADDITION TO, OR SOMETIMES IN LIEU OF, FEES AND RATE INCREASES. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THESE CHANGES TO THE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR COMMERCIAL LOANS MEET THE TDR CRITERIA INCLUDES OUR CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, TDRS INCLUDED IN IMPAIRED LOANS WERE $10.1 BILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING TO REAL ESTATE

($4.9 BILLION), CLL ($2.9 BILLION) AND CONSUMER ($2.3 BILLION). TDRS CONSOLIDATED AS A RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-16 & 17 PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS ($0.4 BILLION).

WE UTILIZE CERTAIN SHORT-TERM LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING TEMPORARY FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN OUR CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO. THESE LOAN

MODIFICATION PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN OUR U.S. CREDIT CARD AND NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS. WE SOLD OUR U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BUSINESS IN 2007 AND AS SUCH, DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED MORTGAGE

MODIFICATION PROGRAMS. DURING 2010, WE PROVIDED SHORT-TERM MODIFICATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION OF CONSUMER LOANS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. THIS INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS IN THE U.S. AND

APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION OF OTHER CONSUMER LOANS, PRIMARILY NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARDS AND PERSONAL LOANS, WHICH WERE NOT CLASSIFIED AS TDRS. FOR THESE MODIFIED LOANS, WE PROVIDED SHORT-TERM (12 MONTHS OR LESS) INTEREST RATE

REDUCTIONS AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS, WHICH WERE NOT PART OF THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. WE EXPECT BORROWERS WHOSE LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED UNDER THESE SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UPON THE

CONCLUSION OF THE SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION. OUR EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS DURING 2010 HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AS APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION ARE PERFORMING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REVISED CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

DELINQUENCY RATES ON COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LEASES

DECREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO DECEMBER 31, 2010, AS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. WE EXPECT THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT TO SHOW FURTHER SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN 2011; HOWEVER, THE CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO BE UNCERTAIN AND MAY IMPACT FUTURE LEVELS OF COMMERCIAL DELINQUENCIES AND PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DELINQUENCY RATES ON CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO DECEMBER 31, 2010,

PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS AND LOWER DELINQUENCY ENTRY RATES IN OUR U.S. MARKETS. WE EXPECT THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, ALONG WITH U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, TO FURTHER SHOW SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN 2011; HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT MAY RESULT IN HIGHER PROVISIONS FOR LOAN LOSSES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 41% OF OUR U.S. PORTFOLIO, WHICH CONSISTED OF CREDIT CARDS, INSTALLMENT AND REVOLVING LOANS, WERE RECEIVABLE FROM SUBPRIME BORROWERS. WE HAD NO

U.S. SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. SEE NOTES 6 AND 23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION.

DELINQUENCY RATES ON REAL ESTATE LOANS AND LEASES INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

CONTINUED CHALLENGING REAL ESTATE MARKET FUNDAMENTALS, INCLUDING REDUCED OCCUPANCY RATES AND RENTALS AND THE EFFECTS OF REAL ESTATE MARKET LIQUIDITY, WHICH DESPITE STABILIZATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS, CONTINUES TO REMAIN LIMITED IN MANY OTHERS. SLOW

ECONOMIC RECOVERY COULD RESULT IN A CONTINUATION OF ELEVATED DELINQUENCY LEVELS AND PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

TOTALED $66.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DOWN $2.8 BILLION FROM 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS AND THE DECONSOLIDATION OF REGENCY BY GECS. GE PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

CONSISTED OF INVESTMENTS FOR ITS OWN PRODUCTIVE USE, WHEREAS THE LARGEST ELEMENT FOR GECS WAS EQUIPMENT PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES ON OPERATING LEASES. DETAILS BY CATEGORY OF INVESTMENT ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

GE ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT TOTALED $2.4 BILLION IN BOTH 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. TOTAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS, FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS WERE $13.5 BILLION, OF WHICH 40% WAS INVESTMENT FOR GROWTH THROUGH NEW CAPACITY AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT; 25% WAS INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH NEW EQUIPMENT AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS; AND 35% WAS INVESTMENT FOR OTHER PURPOSES SUCH AS IMPROVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES AND SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

GECS ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WERE $7.7 BILLION AND $6.4 BILLION DURING 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING ACQUISITIONS AND

ADDITIONS OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AT GECAS, OFFSET BY DISPOSALS OF FLEET VEHICLES AT CLL.

IMPAIRMENTS, DEPRECIATION AND THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR. DURING 2010, WE RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REAL ESTATE, OF $0.1 BILLION.

(61)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ARE REAL ESTATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF $27.2 BILLION AND $32.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. OUR PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY ASSET TYPE. WE REVIEW THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS SEMI-ANNUALLY. AS OF OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATE PERFORMED IN 2010, THE CARRYING

VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THEIR ESTIMATED VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $5.1 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT DETERIORATION IN REAL ESTATE VALUES AND MARKET FUNDAMENTALS, INCLUDING REDUCED MARKET

OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENTS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF LIMITED REAL ESTATE MARKET LIQUIDITY. GIVEN THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS, THERE CONTINUES TO BE RISK AND UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES.

DECLINES IN ESTIMATED VALUE OF REAL ESTATE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WHEN THE AGGREGATE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE MEASUREMENT ARE BELOW THE CARRYING AMOUNT. AS SUCH, ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE

PORTFOLIO WILL NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. DURING 2010, REAL ESTATE RECOGNIZED PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENTS OF $2.3 BILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT, COMPARED WITH $0.8 BILLION IN 2009. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS WITH

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IN EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF 0% TO 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $1.8 BILLION AND AN ASSOCIATED UNREALIZED LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION. CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR

PROLONGED MARKET ILLIQUIDITY MAY RESULT IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENTS BEING RECOGNIZED.

CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS REFLECT REVENUES EARNED IN

EXCESS OF BILLINGS ON OUR LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO CONSTRUCT TECHNICALLY COMPLEX EQUIPMENT (SUCH AS POWER GENERATION, AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND AERODERIVATIVE UNITS) AND LONG-TERM PRODUCT MAINTENANCE OR EXTENDED WARRANTY ARRANGEMENTS. OUR TOTAL CONTRACT

COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, WERE $8.1 BILLION AND $7.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING THE TIMING OF BILLING IN RELATION TO WORK PERFORMED, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES AND COSTS.

OUR TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CUSTOMERS IN OUR ENERGY, AVIATION AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES. FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION.

LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS

WE MAINTAIN A STRONG

FOCUS ON LIQUIDITY. AT BOTH GE AND GECS WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY TO HELP ENSURE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT FUNDING AT ACCEPTABLE COSTS TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGHOUT BUSINESS CYCLES.

OUR LIQUIDITY AND BORROWING PLANS FOR GE AND GECS ARE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR ANNUAL FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES. AT GE, OUR LIQUIDITY

AND FUNDING PLANS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO FUND OUR OPERATING COMMITMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE PRIMARILY PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS FOR INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT, PAYROLL AND GENERAL EXPENSES. WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION

AND GROWTH OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING PAYING DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASING SHARES, INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUIRING INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. AT GE, WE RELY PRIMARILY ON CASH GENERATED THROUGH OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY

MAINTAINED A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT WE REGULARLY USE TO FUND OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., PRINCIPALLY WITHIN FISCAL QUARTERS.

GECS LIQUIDITY AND

FUNDING PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO MEET GECS FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER NORMAL AND STRESS SCENARIOS, WHICH INCLUDE PRIMARILY EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT, PAYROLL, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, INTEREST ON BORROWINGS, DIVIDENDS TO GE, AND

GENERAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS OPERATING EXPENSES, COLLATERAL DEPOSITS HELD OR COLLATERAL POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES. GECS FUNDING PLAN ALSO HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR ENDING NET INVESTMENT IN GE CAPITAL. GECS

RELIES ON CASH GENERATED THROUGH COLLECTION OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER PAYMENTS ON OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND LEASES, SALES OF ASSETS, AND UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, TERM DEBT, BANK BORROWINGS,

SECURITIZATION AND OTHER RETAIL FUNDING PRODUCTS.

OUR 2011 GECS FUNDING PLAN ANTICIPATES REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS,

INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT ($118.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010), THROUGH ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT, CASH ON HAND, COLLECTIONS OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS, DISPOSITIONS, ASSET

SALES, AND DEPOSITS AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING. INTEREST ON BORROWINGS IS PRIMARILY REPAID THROUGH INTEREST EARNED ON EXISTING FINANCING RECEIVABLES. DURING 2010, GECS EARNED INTEREST INCOME ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES OF $24.1 BILLION, WHICH

MORE THAN OFFSET INTEREST EXPENSE OF $15.0 BILLION.

(62)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BOTH THE GECS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE GE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAVE APPROVED A DETAILED LIQUIDITY POLICY FOR GECS WHICH

INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE LIQUIDITY POLICY DEFINES GECS LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCE UNDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS BASED ON ITS LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES TO ESCALATE POTENTIAL ISSUES. WE

ACTIVELY MONITOR GECS ACCESS TO FUNDING MARKETS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE THROUGH TRACKING EXTERNAL INDICATORS AND TESTING VARIOUS STRESS SCENARIOS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND

ESTABLISHES ESCALATION PROCEDURES IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE.

ACTIONS TAKEN TO STRENGTHEN AND MAINTAIN OUR LIQUIDITY ARE

DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION.

LIQUIDITY SOURCES

WE MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY SOURCES THAT CONSIST OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, LIQUID INVESTMENTS (LIQUIDITY PORTFOLIO) AND COMMITTED UNUSED CREDIT LINES.

WE HAVE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS OF $79.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO MEET OUR NEEDS. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THIS IS FREELY AVAILABLE.

ABOUT $10 BILLION IS IN REGULATED ENTITIES AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS OR IS IN RESTRICTED COUNTRIES. ABOUT $18 BILLION IS HELD OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND IS AVAILABLE TO FUND OPERATIONS AND OTHER GROWTH OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES; IT IS ALSO

AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR NEEDS IN THE U.S. ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO U.S. TAX. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HELP MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

IN ADDITION TO OUR $79 BILLION OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS, WE HAVE A CENTRALLY-MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH A FAIR VALUE OF

$2.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE LIQUIDITY PORTFOLIO IS USED TO MANAGE LIQUIDITY AND MEET THE OPERATING NEEDS OF GECS UNDER BOTH NORMAL AND STRESS SCENARIOS. THE INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF UNENCUMBERED U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, U.S. AGENCY

SECURITIES, SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY THE GOVERNMENT, SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, AND A SELECT GROUP OF NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN READILY OBTAIN CASH FOR THESE SECURITIES, EVEN IN STRESSED MARKET CONDITIONS.

WE HAVE COMMITTED, UNUSED CREDIT LINES TOTALING $51.8 BILLION THAT HAVE BEEN EXTENDED TO US BY 58 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THESE LINES

INCLUDE $35.6 BILLION OF REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH WE CAN BORROW FUNDS FOR PERIODS EXCEEDING ONE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, $16.2 BILLION ARE 364-DAY LINES THAT CONTAIN A TERM-OUT FEATURE THAT ALLOWS US TO EXTEND BORROWINGS FOR ONE YEAR FROM

THE DATE OF EXPIRATION OF THE LENDING AGREEMENT. DURING 2010, WE RENEWED ALL OF THE 364-DAY LINES AND WE EXTENDED THE TERM OF $23 BILLION OF MULTI-YEAR LINES BY ONE YEAR TO 2013.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR AGGREGATE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND COMMITTED CREDIT LINES WERE MORE THAN TWICE GECS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS BALANCE.

FUNDING PLAN

OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO REDUCE OUR ENDING NET

INVESTMENT IN GE CAPITAL. IN 2010, WE REDUCED OUR GE CAPITAL ENDING NET INVESTMENT, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS, FROM $526 BILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010 TO $477 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

IN 2010, WE COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $25 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT WITH MATURITIES UP TO 17 YEARS (AND SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2010, AN ADDITIONAL

$11 BILLION). AVERAGE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS FOR GECS AND GE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER WERE $40.1 BILLION AND $6.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING FOR GECS AND GE DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER WAS $42.4 BILLION AND $7.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. GECS COMMERCIAL PAPER MATURITIES ARE FUNDED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH NEW ISSUANCES AND AT GE ARE REPAID BY QUARTER-END USING AVAILABLE CASH.

(63)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATIONS (FDIC) TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP), THE FDIC

GUARANTEED CERTAIN SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED BY GECC ON OR BEFORE OCTOBER 31, 2009, FOR WHICH WE INCURRED $2.3 BILLION OF FEES FOR OUR PARTICIPATION. OUR TLGP-GUARANTEED DEBT HAS REMAINING MATURITIES OF $18 BILLION IN 2011 ($2.5 BILLION

MATURED IN JANUARY 2011) AND $35 BILLION IN 2012. WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING THESE AND OUR OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITIES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EXISTING CASH, NEW DEBT ISSUANCES, COLLECTIONS EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS, DISPOSITIONS, ASSET SALES, DEPOSITS

AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING. GECC AND GE ARE PARTIES TO AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY DESIGNATION AGREEMENT AND GECC IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF A MASTER AGREEMENT, EACH ENTERED INTO WITH THE FDIC. THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, A REQUIREMENT THAT GE AND GECC REIMBURSE THE FDIC FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT THE FDIC PAYS TO HOLDERS OF GECC DEBT THAT IS GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC.

WE

SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING. ON JANUARY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED ASU 2009-16 & 17, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF $36.1 BILLION OF NON-RECOURSE BORROWINGS FROM ALL OF OUR SECURITIZATION QSPES.

DURING 2010, WE COMPLETED $10.3 BILLION OF NON-RECOURSE ISSUANCES AND HAD MATURITIES OF $22.3 BILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, CONSOLIDATED NON-RECOURSE BORROWINGS WERE $30.1 BILLION. WE ANTICIPATE THAT SECURITIZATION WILL REMAIN A PART OF OUR

OVERALL FUNDING CAPABILITIES NOTWITHSTANDING THE CHANGES IN CONSOLIDATION RULES DESCRIBED IN NOTES 1 AND 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

OUR ISSUANCES OF SECURITIES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE LIMITED TO ACTIVITIES AT CERTAIN OF OUR FOREIGN BANKS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, WE WERE PARTY TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TOTALING INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS, WHICH WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AS ON-BOOK FINANCINGS. WE HAVE HAD NO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WHICH WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCINGS AND WE DO NOT

ENGAGE IN SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS.

WE HAVE DEPOSIT-TAKING CAPABILITY AT 10 BANKS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND TWO BANKS IN THE U.S.  GE MONEY

BANK, A FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK (FSB), AND GE CAPITAL FINANCIAL INC., AN INDUSTRIAL BANK (IB). THE FSB AND IB CURRENTLY ISSUE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT (CDS) DISTRIBUTED BY BROKERS IN MATURITY TERMS FROM THREE MONTHS TO TEN YEARS.

TOTAL ALTERNATIVE FUNDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS $60 BILLION, COMPOSED MAINLY OF $37 BILLION BANK DEPOSITS, $11 BILLION OF FUNDING SECURED BY REAL ESTATE,

AIRCRAFT AND OTHER COLLATERAL AND $9 BILLION GE INTEREST PLUS NOTES. THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS $57 BILLION.

EXCHANGE RATE

AND INTEREST RATE RISKS

ARE MANAGED WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MATCH FUNDING AND SELECTIVE USE OF DERIVATIVES. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND MARKET RISKS BECAUSE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN DIVERSE

MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND LOCAL FUNDING IS NOT ALWAYS EFFICIENT. IN ADDITION, WE USE DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE DEBT WE ARE ISSUING TO MATCH THE FIXED OR FLOATING NATURE OF THE ASSETS WE ARE ORIGINATING. WE APPLY STRICT POLICIES TO MANAGE EACH OF

THESE RISKS, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS ON SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES. FOLLOWING IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USING SO-CALLED SHOCK TESTS THAT MODEL EFFECTS OF SHIFTS IN RATES.

THESE ARE NOT FORECASTS.



IT IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. WE FUND OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS USING DEBT OR A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS SO

THAT THE INTEREST RATES OF OUR BORROWINGS MATCH THE EXPECTED INTEREST RATE PROFILE ON OUR ASSETS. TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FIXED RATE POSITIONS, WE ASSUMED THAT, ON JANUARY 1, 2011, INTEREST RATES INCREASED BY 100 BASIS POINTS ACROSS

THE YIELD CURVE (A PARALLEL SHIFT IN THAT CURVE) AND FURTHER ASSUMED THAT THE INCREASE REMAINED IN PLACE FOR 2011. WE ESTIMATED, BASED ON THE YEAR-END 2010 PORTFOLIO AND HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT, THAT OUR 2011 CONSOLIDATED

EARNINGS WOULD DECLINE BY $0.1 BILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE.



IT IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS EITHER WITHIN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OR USING THE PROTECTION OF HEDGE STRATEGIES. WE

ANALYZED YEAR-END 2010 CONSOLIDATED CURRENCY EXPOSURES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, TO IDENTIFY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THEIR RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. FOR SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE

THEN EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF A 10% SHIFT IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THOSE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR, HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT. THIS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON 2011 EARNINGS OF SUCH A SHIFT IN

EXCHANGE RATES.

DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS

PRINCIPAL DEBT AND DERIVATIVE CONDITIONS

ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

CERTAIN OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CAN BE TERMINATED IF SPECIFIED CREDIT RATINGS ARE NOT MAINTAINED AND CERTAIN DEBT AND DERIVATIVES AGREEMENTS OF OTHER

CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HAVE PROVISIONS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THESE CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GE AND GECCS LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD AND POORS RATINGS SERVICE (S&P) WAS AA+ WITH

A STABLE OUTLOOK AND FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) WAS AA2 WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GE, GECS AND GECCS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING FROM S&P WAS A-1+ AND FROM

MOODYS WAS P-1. WE ARE DISCLOSING THESE RATINGS TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND THE EFFECTS OF OUR RATINGS ON OUR COSTS OF FUNDS. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT A DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS, OUR

RATINGS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REVISION OR WITHDRAWAL AT ANY TIME BY THE ASSIGNING RATING ORGANIZATION, AND EACH RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER RATING.

TYPICALLY CONTAIN MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3. IN CERTAIN OF THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS, THE

COUNTERPARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE SHORT-TERM RATING OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. THE NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITY AFTER CONSIDERATION OF NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, OUTSTANDING INTEREST PAYMENTS AND

COLLATERAL POSTED BY US UNDER THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $1.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

OTHER DEBT AND DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.



ONE GROUP OF CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HOLDS INVESTMENT SECURITIES FUNDED BY THE ISSUANCE OF GICS. IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GECC WERE TO FALL BELOW AA-/AA3

OR ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GECC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO SUCH ENTITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, PURSUANT TO LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY GECC, AS COMPARED TO $2.4 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. FURTHERMORE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ENTITIES LIABILITIES EXCEED THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT DRAWN UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT, GECC IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUCH EXCESS

AMOUNT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE VALUE OF THESE ENTITIES LIABILITIES WAS $5.7 BILLION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS ASSETS WAS $6.0 BILLION (WHICH INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $0.7 BILLION). WITH RESPECT TO THESE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, WE INTEND TO HOLD THEM AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAIR VALUES EXCEED THEIR AMORTIZED COST AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD ALL SUCH DEBT SECURITIES UNTIL MATURITY.



ANOTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITY ALSO ISSUES GICS WHERE PROCEEDS ARE LOANED TO GECC. IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GECC WERE TO FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR ITS

SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GECC COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UP TO APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, TO REPAY HOLDERS OF GICS, COMPARED TO $3.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THESE OBLIGATIONS

ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.



IF THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GECC WERE REDUCED BELOW A-1/P-1, GECC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PARTIALLY CASH COLLATERALIZE CERTAIN COVERED BONDS. THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS DETERMINED BY CONTRACT AND AMOUNTED TO $0.8 BILLION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS IN OUR STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES, INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT AND SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

ON MARCH 28, 1991, GE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH GECC TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO GECC, CONSTITUTING ADDITIONS TO PRE-TAX INCOME UNDER THE AGREEMENT, TO THE EXTENT

NECESSARY TO CAUSE THE RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES OF GECC AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (DETERMINED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS) TO BE NOT LESS THAN 1.10:1 FOR THE PERIOD, AS A SINGLE AGGREGATION, OF EACH GECC FISCAL YEAR COMMENCING WITH FISCAL

YEAR 1991. GECCS RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES INCREASED TO 1.13:1 DURING 2010 DUE TO HIGHER PRE-TAX EARNINGS AT GECC, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARGINS AND LOWER PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES.

ON OCTOBER 29, 2009, GE AND GECC AMENDED THIS AGREEMENT TO EXTEND THE NOTICE PERIOD FOR TERMINATION FROM THREE YEARS TO FIVE YEARS. IT WAS FURTHER AMENDED TO

PROVIDE THAT ANY FUTURE AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GECC REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE HOLDERS OF THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY GECC

(WITH AN ORIGINAL STATED MATURITY IN EXCESS OF 270 DAYS), UNLESS THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT TRIGGER A DOWNGRADE OF GECCS LONG-TERM RATINGS. NO PAYMENT IS REQUIRED IN 2011 PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

GE MADE A $9.5 BILLION PAYMENT TO GECS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 (OF WHICH $8.8 BILLION WAS FURTHER CONTRIBUTED TO GECC THROUGH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND SHARE

ISSUANCE) TO IMPROVE TANGIBLE CAPITAL AND REDUCE LEVERAGE. THIS PAYMENT CONSTITUTES AN ADDITION TO PRE-TAX INCOME UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND THEREFORE INCREASED THE RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES OF GECC FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2009 FOR PURPOSES OF THE

AGREEMENT TO 1.33:1. AS A RESULT, NO FURTHER PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN 2010 WERE REQUIRED RELATED TO 2009.

ANY PAYMENT MADE UNDER THE INCOME

MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT WILL NOT AFFECT THE RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CURRENT SEC RULES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ADDITION TO PRE-TAX INCOME UNDER CURRENT U.S. GAAP.

IN ADDITION, IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FOR WHICH GECC RECEIVES EQUITY CREDIT BY RATING AGENCIES, GE HAS AGREED TO PROMPTLY RETURN

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS OR OTHER PAYMENTS IT RECEIVES FROM GECC DURING EVENTS OF DEFAULT OR INTEREST DEFERRAL PERIODS UNDER SUCH SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. THERE WERE $7.3 BILLION OF SUCH DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. SEE NOTE 10

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS EQUITY

GE SHAREOWNERS EQUITY INCREASED BY $1.6 BILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF $12.6 BILLION IN 2009 AND A DECREASE OF $10.9 BILLION IN 2008.

NET EARNINGS INCREASED GE SHAREOWNERS EQUITY BY $11.6 BILLION, $11.0 BILLION AND $17.4 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF $5.2

BILLION, $6.8 BILLION AND $12.6 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

ELEMENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME DECREASED SHAREOWNERS EQUITY

BY $2.3 BILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF $6.6 BILLION IN 2009 AND A DECREASE OF $30.2 BILLION IN 2008, INCLUSIVE OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPONENTS OF THESE CHANGES ARE AS FOLLOWS.



CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLANS INCREASED SHAREOWNERS EQUITY BY $1.1 BILLION IN 2010, PRIMARILY REFLECTING PRIOR SERVICE COST AND NET ACTUARIAL LOSS AMORTIZATION

AND INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLANS ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO VALUE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THIS COMPARED WITH DECREASES OF $1.8 BILLION AND $13.3 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN 2009 PRIMARILY RELATED TO A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO VALUE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE DECREASE IN 2008 PRIMARILY RELATED TO DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AS A RESULT OF

MARKET CONDITIONS AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLANS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS DECREASED SHAREOWNERS EQUITY BY $3.9 BILLION IN 2010, INCREASED EQUITY BY $4.1 BILLION IN 2009 AND DECREASED EQUITY BY

$11.0 BILLION IN 2008. CHANGES IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT HAVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. AT THE END OF

2010, THE U.S. DOLLAR WAS STRONGER AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE POUND STERLING AND THE EURO AND WEAKER AGAINST THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, COMPARED WITH A WEAKER DOLLAR AGAINST THOSE CURRENCIES AT THE END OF 2009 AND A STRONGER DOLLAR

AGAINST THOSE CURRENCIES AT THE END OF 2008. THE DOLLAR WAS WEAKER AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN IN 2008.



THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES INCREASED SHAREOWNERS EQUITY BY AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN 2010, REFLECTING IMPROVED MARKET CONDITIONS

RELATED TO U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES AND LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES AND ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THE UNREALIZED GAINS ON INSURANCE-RELATED ASSETS AND EQUITY. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES INCREASED SHAREOWNERS

EQUITY BY $2.7 BILLION AND DECREASED SHAREOWNERS EQUITY BY $3.2 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTMENT SECURITIES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES INCREASED SHAREOWNERS EQUITY BY $0.5 BILLION IN 2010, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DESIGNATED INTEREST RATE AND CROSS CURRENCY HEDGES AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) RELEASED TO EARNINGS TO MATCH THE UNDERLYING FORECASTED CASH FLOWS. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES

DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES INCREASED EQUITY BY $1.6 BILLION AND DECREASED EQUITY BY $2.7 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

WE TOOK A NUMBER

OF ACTIONS IN 2008 AND 2009 TO STRENGTHEN OUR LIQUIDITY. SUCH ACTIONS ALSO HAD AN EFFECT ON SHAREOWNERS EQUITY, WHICH INCLUDED A $15 BILLION ADDITION TO EQUITY THROUGH COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK OFFERINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS  OVERVIEW FROM 2008 THROUGH 2010

CONSOLIDATED CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $79.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AN INCREASE OF $8.5 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $70.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AN

INCREASE OF $22.4 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008.

WE EVALUATE OUR CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE BY REVIEWING OUR INDUSTRIAL (NON-FINANCIAL SERVICES)

BUSINESSES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES SEPARATELY. CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (CFOA) IS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH GENERATION FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES ALSO HAVE LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE VIA THE PUBLIC CAPITAL

MARKETS. OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES USE A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS. CASH FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES IS PRIMARILY PROVIDED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

MARKETS, AS WELL AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES COLLECTIONS, SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS.

GE CASH FLOW

GE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $19.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $8.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. GE CFOA TOTALED $14.7 BILLION IN 2010

COMPARED WITH $16.4 BILLION AND $19.1 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. WITH RESPECT TO GE CFOA, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS USEFUL TO SUPPLEMENT OUR GE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND TO EXAMINE IN A BROADER CONTEXT THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE

AND REQUIRE CASH.

(A)

GE SELLS CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES TO GECS IN PART TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN RESULT IN CASH GENERATION OR CASH USE. DURING ANY GIVEN

PERIOD, GE RECEIVES CASH FROM THE SALE OF RECEIVABLES TO GECS. IT ALSO FOREGOES COLLECTION OF CASH ON RECEIVABLES SOLD. THE INCREMENTAL AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED FROM SALE OF RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF THE CASH GE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE COLLECTED HAD

THOSE RECEIVABLES NOT BEEN SOLD, REPRESENTS THE CASH GENERATED OR USED IN THE PERIOD RELATING TO THIS ACTIVITY. THE INCREMENTAL CASH GENERATED IN GE CFOA FROM SELLING THESE RECEIVABLES TO GECS INCREASED GE CFOA BY $0.3 BILLION AND AN INSIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ELIMINATION OF

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECS.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CASH IN GE CFOA IS CUSTOMER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, THE LARGEST

OF WHICH IS COLLECTING CASH FOLLOWING A PRODUCT OR SERVICES SALE. GE OPERATING CASH COLLECTIONS DECREASED BY $5.9 BILLION IN 2010 AND DECREASED BY $11.4 BILLION IN 2009. THESE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN COMPARABLE GE OPERATING

SEGMENT REVENUES. ANALYSES OF OPERATING SEGMENT REVENUES DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING SEGMENT OPERATIONS SECTION ARE THE BEST WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THEIR CUSTOMER-RELATED CFOA.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OPERATING USE OF CASH IS TO PAY OUR SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, TAX AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES. GE OPERATING CASH PAYMENTS DECREASED IN 2010 AND 2009 BY $4.2

BILLION AND $11.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN GE TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES.

GE CFOA DECREASED $1.7 BILLION

COMPARED WITH 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN PROGRESS COLLECTIONS COMPARED TO 2009. IN 2009, GE CFOA DECREASED $2.7 BILLION COMPARED WITH 2008, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE LACK OF A DIVIDEND FROM GECS ($2.4 BILLION).

DIVIDENDS FROM GECS REPRESENTED THE DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTION OF GECS RETAINED EARNINGS AND ARE DISTINCT FROM CASH FROM CONTINUING OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN GE CFOA ARE THE TOTAL DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING NORMAL DIVIDENDS AS WELL AS ANY SPECIAL DIVIDENDS FROM EXCESS CAPITAL, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM GECS BUSINESS SALES. BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2009, GECS SUSPENDED ITS NORMAL DIVIDEND TO GE. THERE WERE NO SPECIAL DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM GECS IN 2010, 2009 OR 2008.

GECS CASH FLOW

GECS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $60.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $62.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. GECS CASH FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $21.2 BILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH $7.4 BILLION IN 2009. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, IN NET CASH COLLATERAL HELD FROM COUNTERPARTIES ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS OF $6.9 BILLION, IN CASH

USED FOR OTHER LIABILITIES OF $1.5 BILLION, HIGHER CURRENT-YEAR EARNINGS, AND LOWER GAINS AND HIGHER IMPAIRMENTS AT REAL ESTATE OF $2.9 BILLION.

CONSISTENT WITH OUR PLAN TO REDUCE GECS ASSET LEVELS, CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $36.4 BILLION IN 2010. PRIMARY SOURCES WERE $26.3 BILLION RESULTING FROM A

REDUCTION IN FINANCING RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY FROM COLLECTIONS EXCEEDING ORIGINATIONS, A $1.8 BILLION REDUCTION IN INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND $1.6 BILLION OF RECOVERIES OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECEIVED

PROCEEDS OF $2.5 BILLION FROM SALES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY BAC, AND $1.2 BILLION RESULTED FROM PROCEEDS FROM BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS, INCLUDING THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES IN HONG KONG AND INDONESIA. THESE SOURCES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF $0.6 BILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN FINANCING BUSINESSES OF THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND.

GECS CASH USED FOR

FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 REFLECTED OUR CONTINUED REDUCTION IN ENDING NET INVESTMENT. CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $59.6 BILLION RELATED PRIMARILY TO A $60.3 BILLION REDUCTION IN BORROWINGS CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF REDUCTIONS IN LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS (WHICH INCLUDES REDUCTIONS RELATED TO BORROWINGS CONSOLIDATED UPON THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-16 & 17) AND COMMERCIAL PAPER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4.6 BILLION INCREASE IN BANK DEPOSITS.

VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES

WE SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO IMPROVE SHAREOWNER

RETURNS AND AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING. THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WE ENGAGE IN ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

(69)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ASSETS WE SECURITIZE INCLUDE: RECEIVABLES SECURED BY EQUIPMENT, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES,

FLOORPLAN INVENTORY RECEIVABLES, GE TRADE RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS ORIGINATED AND UNDERWRITTEN BY US IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE SECURITIZATIONS ARE FUNDED WITH ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM DEBT. OUR SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010 USED QSPES AND WERE THEREFORE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED.

ON JANUARY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED ASU

2009-16 & 17. ASU 2009-16 ELIMINATED THE QSPE CONCEPT, AND ASU 2009-17 REQUIRED THAT ALL SUCH ENTITIES BE EVALUATED FOR CONSOLIDATION AS VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES). ADOPTION OF THESE AMENDMENTS RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL OF

OUR SPONSORED QSPES. IN ADDITION, WE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF VIES RELATED TO DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT HOLD LOANS AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, A MEDIA JOINT VENTURE AND A SMALL NUMBER OF COMPANIES TO WHICH WE HAVE EXTENDED LOANS IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY WERE SUBJECT TO A TDR.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SECURITIZATION VIES ARE CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE WE ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE ENTITY. OUR INTERESTS IN OTHER VIES FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND QSPES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES, FINANCING RECEIVABLES OR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS DEPENDING ON

THE NATURE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT.

WE CONSOLIDATED THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AT AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAD WE ALWAYS CONSOLIDATED THEM. WE ALSO DECONSOLIDATED CERTAIN ENTITIES WHERE WE DID NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY UNDER THE REVISED GUIDANCE; HOWEVER THE EFFECT WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT JANUARY 1, 2010.

THE INCREMENTAL EFFECT ON TOTAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NET OF OUR RETAINED INTERESTS, WAS AN INCREASE OF $31.1 BILLION AND $33.0 BILLION RESPECTIVELY, AT JANUARY 1, 2010. THE NET REDUCTION OF TOTAL EQUITY (INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS)

WAS $1.9 BILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SECURITIZATION GAINS AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE $50.7 BILLION AND $38.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF $33.7 BILLION AND $23.1 BILLION FROM 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSETS HELD BY THESE ENTITIES ARE OF EQUIVALENT CREDIT QUALITY TO OUR ON-BOOK ASSETS. WE MONITOR THE UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR ROLE AS SERVICER AND APPLY RIGOROUS CONTROLS TO THE EXECUTION OF SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. WITH

THE EXCEPTION OF CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY SUPPORT DISCUSSED BELOW, INVESTORS IN THESE ENTITIES HAVE RECOURSE ONLY TO THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASU 2009-16 & 17, OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION INCLUDED $11.8 BILLION IN RETAINED INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES RELATED TO THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THESE

RETAINED INTERESTS TOOK TWO FORMS: (1) SELLERS INTERESTS, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES, AND (2) SUBORDINATED INTERESTS, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT TO SENIOR INTERESTS, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT

SECURITIES. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES WAS $3.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES WAS $8.8 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED VIES, INCLUDING OUR NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN PTL AND INVESTMENTS IN

REAL ESTATE ENTITIES, WERE $12.6 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2.9 BILLION FROM 2009, PRIMARILY RELATED TO $1.7 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES WHOSE STATUS AS A VIE CHANGED UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-17 AND $1.2 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN

PRE-EXISTING UNCONSOLIDATED VIES. IN ADDITION TO OUR EXISTING INVESTMENTS, WE HAVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO FUND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES OF $2.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $0.6 BILLION FROM 2009.

WE ARE PARTY TO VARIOUS CREDIT ENHANCEMENT POSITIONS WITH SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEE AND

REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS, AND HAVE PROVIDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ESTIMATED LOSSES ON SUCH POSITIONS. THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. SHOULD MARKET CONDITIONS

DETERIORATE, ACTUAL LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER. OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS WAS LIMITED TO $0.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

WE DO NOT

HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY VIE OR QSPE. WE DID NOT PROVIDE NON-CONTRACTUAL SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY TRANSFERRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES TO ANY VIE OR QSPE IN EITHER 2010 OR 2009.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. MANY OF THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES REFLECT OUR BEST JUDGMENT ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS

OF THE DATE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THESE CONDITIONS CHANGE FROM THOSE EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD CHANGE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES,

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, INCREASES IN RESERVES FOR CONTINGENCIES, ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER EFFECTS. ALSO

SEE NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES THAT WE HAVE SELECTED FROM ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH

REQUIRES US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED FINANCING RECEIVABLE. SUCH AN ESTIMATE

REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF

SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL VALUES (INCLUDING HOUSING PRICE INDICES AS APPLICABLE), AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO PROVIDE FOR

LOSSES ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OUR

CURRENT ESTIMATES. WRITE-OFFS IN BOTH OUR CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIOS CAN ALSO REFLECT BOTH LOSSES THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE BEGINNING OF A FISCAL YEAR AND INFORMATION BECOMING AVAILABLE DURING THAT FISCAL YEAR WHICH MAY IDENTIFY

FURTHER DETERIORATION ON EXPOSURES EXISTING PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THAT FISCAL YEAR, AND FOR WHICH RESERVES COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK EXPOSURES

AND CONCENTRATIONS, AND EVALUATES RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR INDIVIDUAL LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

ALSO REGULARLY ASSESS CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT CONTRACTUAL PENALTIES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET OUR ACCUMULATED INVESTMENT IN THE

EVENT OF CUSTOMER TERMINATION. WE GAIN INSIGHT INTO FUTURE UTILIZATION AND COST TRENDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT RISK, THROUGH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE CLOSE INTERACTION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT COMES WITH SUPPLYING CRITICAL

SERVICES AND PARTS OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. REVISIONS THAT AFFECT A PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS TOTAL ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY RESULT IN AN ADJUSTMENT OF EARNINGS; SUCH ADJUSTMENTS DECREASED EARNINGS BY $0.2 BILLION IN 2010, INCREASED EARNINGS BY

$0.2 BILLION IN 2009 AND DECREASED EARNINGS BY $0.2 BILLION IN 2008. WE PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE LOSSES WHEN THEY BECOME EVIDENT.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENT INVOLVES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENTS.

WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2009, THE

FASB AMENDED ASC 320 AND MODIFIED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT FOR DEBT SECURITIES. IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY AND IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE

SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE

WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR CRITERIA INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE

AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION. OUR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INVOLVE OUR FINANCE, RISK AND ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AND

THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGERS. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT

SECURITIES.

SECURITIES SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN NOTES 1, 3 AND 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT

BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED TYPICALLY REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DETERMINING WHICH UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED ASSET, THE USEFUL LIFE OVER

WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, THEIR AMOUNT, AND THE ASSETS RESIDUAL VALUE, IF ANY. IN TURN, MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS REQUIRES A DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE. WE DERIVE THE REQUIRED

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FROM OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS PLANS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, OUR INTERNAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATE AND

INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE.

OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF ASSETS IN GE CAPITAL,

AND IS PARTICULARLY SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. THEREFORE, WE TEST RECOVERABILITY OF EACH AIRCRAFT IN OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO AT LEAST ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, WE PERFORM QUARTERLY EVALUATIONS IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN AIRCRAFT ARE

RE-LEASED, CURRENT LEASE TERMS HAVE CHANGED OR A SPECIFIC LESSEES CREDIT STANDING CHANGES. WE CONSIDER MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS GLOBAL DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RENTALS AND RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION RECEIVED ROUTINELY FROM INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS. ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM FUTURE LEASES ARE REDUCED FOR EXPECTED DOWNTIME BETWEEN LEASES AND FOR ESTIMATED TECHNICAL COSTS REQUIRED TO PREPARE AIRCRAFT TO BE REDEPLOYED. FAIR

VALUE USED TO MEASURE IMPAIRMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE. IN DETERMINING ITS BEST ESTIMATE, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES AVERAGE CURRENT MARKET VALUES (OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES) OF SIMILAR TYPE AND AGE AIRCRAFT, WHICH ARE ADJUSTED FOR

THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT UNDER LEASE.

WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT OF $0.4

BILLION AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT WERE INSIGNIFICANT AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

REAL ESTATE.

WE REVIEW THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE CASH

FLOW ESTIMATES USED FOR BOTH ESTIMATING VALUE AND THE RECOVERABILITY ANALYSIS ARE INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL, AND REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE PROFILES, AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTAL, OCCUPANCY AND CAPITALIZATION

RATES AND EXPECTED BUSINESS PLANS, WHICH INCLUDE OUR ESTIMATED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE ASSET. OUR PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY ASSET TYPE. HOWEVER, THE GLOBAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC CYCLES THAT CAN CAUSE

SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES. AS OF OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATE PERFORMED IN 2010, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THEIR ESTIMATED VALUE BY ABOUT $5.1 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO

REFLECT DETERIORATION IN REAL ESTATE VALUES AND MARKET FUNDAMENTALS, INCLUDING REDUCED MARKET OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENTS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF LIMITED REAL ESTATE MARKET LIQUIDITY. GIVEN THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED CHALLENGING MARKET

CONDITIONS, THERE CONTINUES TO BE RISK AND UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES. DECLINES IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF REAL ESTATE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WHEN THE AGGREGATE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES

USED IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE MEASUREMENT ARE BELOW THE CARRYING AMOUNT. AS SUCH, ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT, THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED USING THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET, WHICH IS BASED UPON CASH FLOW ESTIMATES THAT REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE PROFILES AND AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT CAPITALIZATION RATES AND EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTS AND OCCUPANCY AND IS

CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISALS. DURING 2010, REAL ESTATE RECOGNIZED PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENTS OF $2.3 BILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT, AS COMPARED TO $0.8 BILLION IN 2009. CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR PROLONGED

MARKET ILLIQUIDITY MAY RESULT IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENTS BEING RECOGNIZED. FURTHERMORE, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO FORECASTED VALUATION TRENDS, ESPECIALLY IN ILLIQUID MARKETS, RESULTS IN INHERENT IMPRECISION IN REAL ESTATE VALUE

ESTIMATES. FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND THE ALL OTHER ASSETS SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND MORE

FREQUENTLY IF CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUES FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING AN INCOME APPROACH. WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, WE USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW RESULTS. FOR PURPOSES OF

THE INCOME APPROACH, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED RATE. WE USE OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF

LONG-TERM FUTURE GROWTH RATES BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT VIEWS OF THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EACH BUSINESS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ASSUMED IN OUR FORECASTS. WE DERIVE OUR DISCOUNT RATES USING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND ANALYZING

PUBLISHED RATES FOR INDUSTRIES RELEVANT TO OUR REPORTING UNITS TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING. WE USE DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND IN OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED

FORECASTS. DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR REPORTING UNIT VALUATIONS RANGED FROM 9% TO 14.5%. VALUATIONS USING THE MARKET APPROACH REFLECT PRICES AND OTHER RELEVANT OBSERVABLE INFORMATION GENERATED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING COMPARABLE BUSINESSES.

COMPARED TO THE MARKET APPROACH, THE INCOME APPROACH MORE CLOSELY ALIGNS EACH REPORTING UNIT VALUATION TO OUR BUSINESS PROFILE, INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC

MARKETS SERVED AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS. REQUIRED RATES OF RETURN, ALONG WITH UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ARE REFLECTED IN THE SELECTION OF THE DISCOUNT RATE. EQUALLY IMPORTANT, UNDER THIS APPROACH, REASONABLY LIKELY

SCENARIOS AND ASSOCIATED SENSITIVITIES CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR ALTERNATIVE FUTURE STATES THAT MAY NOT BE REFLECTED IN AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE. A MARKET APPROACH ALLOWS FOR COMPARISON TO ACTUAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND MULTIPLES. IT CAN BE SOMEWHAT

MORE LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATION BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF POTENTIAL COMPARABLES IS OFTEN LIMITED TO PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES WHERE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPARATIVE BUSINESS AND OURS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT, MARKET DATA IS USUALLY NOT

AVAILABLE FOR DIVISIONS WITHIN LARGER CONGLOMERATES OR NON-PUBLIC SUBSIDIARIES THAT COULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY AS COMPARABLE, AND THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING A MARKET TRANSACTION (E.G., SYNERGIES BETWEEN THE PARTIES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

THE TRANSACTION, ETC.) MAY BE DIFFERENT OR IRRELEVANT WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS. IT CAN ALSO BE DIFFICULT, UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, TO IDENTIFY ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES. WE ASSESS THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY BASED UPON THE RELEVANCE AND AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA AT THE TIME WE PERFORM THE VALUATION AND WEIGHT THE METHODOLOGIES APPROPRIATELY.

(73)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IN THE THIRD QUARTER USING DATA AS

OF JULY 1, 2010. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: IN STEP ONE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS FAIR VALUE; IN STEP TWO, WHICH IS APPLIED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS DERIVED BY DEDUCTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS EQUITY, AND COMPARING THAT AMOUNT WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. IN PERFORMING THE VALUATIONS,

WE USED CASH FLOWS THAT REFLECTED MANAGEMENTS FORECASTS AND DISCOUNT RATES THAT INCLUDED RISK ADJUSTMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STEP ONE TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH OF THE GE INDUSTRIAL

REPORTING UNITS AND THE CLL, CONSUMER, ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GECAS REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED AND NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT HAD A GOODWILL BALANCE OF $1.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. AS OF JULY 1, 2010, THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDED

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT BY APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND INVESTMENT, INCLUDING LOSS

ESTIMATES FOR THE EXISTING FINANCE RECEIVABLE AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, NEW DEBT ORIGINATION VOLUME AND MARGINS, AND ANTICIPATED STABILIZATION OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET ALLOWING FOR SALES OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AT NORMALIZED MARGINS. OUR ASSUMED

DISCOUNT RATE WAS 12% AND WAS DERIVED BY APPLYING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND CORROBORATED USING EQUITY ANALYST RESEARCH REPORTS AND IMPLIED COST OF EQUITY BASED ON FORECASTED PRICE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE MULTIPLES FOR SIMILAR COMPANIES. GIVEN

THE VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE CURRENT COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS BASED. DIFFERENT LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO, CHANGES IN THE

NEW DEBT ORIGINATION VOLUME AND MARGIN ASSUMPTIONS, CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED PACE OF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET RECOVERY, OR CHANGES IN THE EQUITY RETURN EXPECTATION OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE STEP ONE TESTING, WE PERFORMED THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST DESCRIBED ABOVE.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS FOR THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT, THE ESTIMATED IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL BY APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION. ACCORDINGLY, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS

REQUIRED. IN THE SECOND STEP, UNREALIZED LOSSES IN AN ENTITYS ASSETS HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE ESTIMATED IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. THE PRIMARY DRIVER

WAS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH APPROXIMATED $6.3 BILLION AT THAT TIME. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS PROVIDED IN THE FINANCIAL

RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION  ALL OTHER ASSETS OF THIS ITEM. OTHER DRIVERS FOR THE FAVORABLE OUTCOME INCLUDE THE UNREALIZED LOSSES IN THE REAL ESTATE FINANCE RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND THE FAIR VALUE PREMIUM ON

THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT ALLOCATED DEBT. THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THESE MEASUREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT.

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING

ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. IF CURRENT CONDITIONS PERSIST LONGER OR DETERIORATE FURTHER THAN EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

WE REVIEW IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINED USEFUL LIVES AND SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OCCURRED REQUIRES COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT TO THE SUM OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. WE TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR VALUE METHOD SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FOR OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES REMAINING IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WE PERIODICALLY TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT OUR DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS AND PRESENT

VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS.

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS

ARE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE ACTUARIAL MODELS THAT MEASURE PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND

RELATED EFFECTS ON OPERATIONS. TWO ASSUMPTIONS  DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS  ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF PLAN EXPENSE AND ASSET/LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST ANNUALLY ON A PLAN AND

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC BASIS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, SUCH AS RETIREMENT AGE, MORTALITY AND TURNOVER, AND UPDATE THEM TO REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE. ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN

YEAR WILL OFTEN DIFFER FROM ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

ACCUMULATED AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE MEASURED AS

THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. WE DISCOUNT THOSE CASH PAYMENTS USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MARKET-OBSERVED YIELDS FOR HIGH QUALITY FIXED INCOME SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. LOWER DISCOUNT RATES

INCREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE; HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES DECREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE.

OUR

DISCOUNT RATES FOR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WERE 5.28%, 5.78% AND 6.11%, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING MARKET INTEREST RATES.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN

DEVELOPING FUTURE RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL BENEFIT PLANS ASSETS, WE EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AS WELL AS KEY ELEMENTS OF ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, YIELDS AND SPREADS. ASSETS IN OUR PRINCIPAL

PENSION PLANS EARNED 13.5% IN 2010, AND HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS OF 4.1%, 7.9% AND 9.5% PER YEAR IN THE 10-, 15- AND 25-YEAR PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AVERAGE HISTORICAL RETURNS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY

INVESTMENT LOSSES IN 2008. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE, PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE ASSUMED AN 8.0% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS FOR COST RECOGNITION

IN 2011. THIS IS A REDUCTION FROM THE 8.5% WE HAD ASSUMED IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS WOULD HAVE

THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.



DISCOUNT RATE  A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2 BILLION AND WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT YEAR-END BY ABOUT $1.5 BILLION.



EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS  A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD INCREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2

BILLION.

INCOME TAXES

. OUR ANNUAL TAX RATE IS BASED ON OUR INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES

AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. TAX LAWS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS BY THE TAXPAYER AND RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTAL TAXING AUTHORITIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR TAX

EXPENSE AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING EVALUATING UNCERTAINTIES. WE REVIEW OUR TAX POSITIONS QUARTERLY AND ADJUST THE BALANCES AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. OUR INCOME TAX RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE TAX RATE ON OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THIS RATE DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT IS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT ABOUT AND

INTENTIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, $94 BILLION OF EARNINGS HAVE BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS

OPERATIONS, AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH

EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. SUCH ASSETS ARISE BECAUSE OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS FROM NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL

SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. THESE SOURCES OF INCOME RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES. WE USE OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR SHORT AND LONG-RANGE

BUSINESS FORECASTS TO PROVIDE INSIGHT. FURTHER, OUR GLOBAL AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY VARIOUS PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF FUTURE DEDUCTIONS. AMOUNTS

RECORDED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATED TO NON-U.S. NET OPERATING LOSSES, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WERE $4.4 BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $1.0 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, ASSOCIATED WITH LOSSES REPORTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR LOSS ON THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN. SUCH YEAR-END 2010 AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

FULLY RECOVERABLE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY EXPIRATION PERIODS. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED.

PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.

WE USE

DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY PRICES. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AS HEDGES REQUIRES THAT, AT INCEPTION AND OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND

RELATED DERIVATIVE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES ACCOUNTING ARE COMPLEX. FAILURE TO APPLY THIS COMPLEX GUIDANCE CORRECTLY WILL RESULT IN ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE BEING REPORTED IN EARNINGS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

IN EVALUATING WHETHER A

PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, WE TEST EFFECTIVENESS AT INCEPTION AND EACH REPORTING PERIOD THEREAFTER BY DETERMINING WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OFFSET, WITHIN A SPECIFIED RANGE, CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM. IF FAIR VALUE CHANGES FAIL THIS TEST, WE DISCONTINUE APPLYING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO THAT RELATIONSHIP PROSPECTIVELY. FAIR VALUES OF BOTH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE CALCULATED USING INTERNAL VALUATION

MODELS INCORPORATING MARKET-BASED ASSUMPTIONS, SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY CONFIRMATION, AS APPLICABLE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES WERE $7.5 BILLION AND $2.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 9, 21 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EVERY REPORTING PERIOD INCLUDE

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EVERY REPORTING PERIOD BUT THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE LOANS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN

REDUCED TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE HELD FOR SALE, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE

IMPAIRED AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, IF WE SELL A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND RETAIN A NONCONTROLLING STAKE IN THE ENTITY.

ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN IMPAIRED AND RETAINED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS DETERMINED AS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF

ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD

USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OFTEN INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS ABOUT ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE THAT FACTORS IN BOTH RISK AND LIQUIDITY

PREMIUMS, IDENTIFYING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, WEIGHTING THOSE DIFFERENCES ACCORDINGLY AND THEN MAKING THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE MARKET TRANSACTIONS TO REFLECT THE RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR ASSET BEING VALUED.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 21 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES

ARE UNCERTAIN AND UNRESOLVED MATTERS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND RESULT FROM EVENTS OR ACTIONS BY OTHERS THAT

HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN A FUTURE LOSS. SUCH CONTINGENCIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS, LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PRODUCT QUALITY AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM OTHER EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS.

WHEN A LOSS IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE ULTIMATE LOSS. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO

BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW END OF SUCH RANGE. HOWEVER, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A LOSS WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CONTINGENCY IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF

THE LOSS OR A RANGE OF LOSS MAY NOT BE PRACTICABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FUTURE EVENTS AND DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES THAT WILL DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE CONTINGENCY. MOREOVER, IT IS NOT

UNCOMMON FOR SUCH MATTERS TO BE RESOLVED OVER MANY YEARS, DURING WHICH TIME RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEW INFORMATION MUST BE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATED TO DETERMINE BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE

A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS. WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE, DISCLOSURE IS PROVIDED.

DISCLOSURE ALSO IS PROVIDED WHEN IT

IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LOSS WILL BE INCURRED OR WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF A LOSS WILL EXCEED THE RECORDED PROVISION. WE REGULARLY REVIEW ALL CONTINGENCIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS HAS CHANGED AND TO

ASSESS WHETHER A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS CAN BE MADE. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DEVELOPMENT OF A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF LOSS OR A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS IS COMPLEX WHEN THE OUTCOME IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH OR

DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE COURT SYSTEM AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES. SUCH FACTORS BEAR DIRECTLY ON WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND BOUNDARIES OF HIGH AND LOW ESTIMATES.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING STANDARDS FOR REVENUE

ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS. ASU 2009-13 REQUIRES THE ALLOCATION OF CONSIDERATION TO SEPARATE COMPONENTS BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF EACH COMPONENT IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT. ASU 2009-14 REQUIRES CERTAIN SOFTWARE-ENABLED PRODUCTS

TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR MULTIPLE COMPONENT ARRANGEMENTS AS OPPOSED TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SPECIFICALLY APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS. THE AMENDMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS

ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THESE AMENDMENTS IS EXPECTED TO BE INSIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

GE-FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $3.9 BILLION, $3.3 BILLION AND

$3.1 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FROM CUSTOMERS, PRINCIPALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TOTALED $1.0 BILLION, $1.1 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURES AVIATION BUSINESS ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF GES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WITH FUNDING FROM BOTH GE AND CUSTOMER FUNDS. ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURES ENERGY BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURES

HEALTHCARE BUSINESS ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FUNDED PRIMARILY BY GE.

EXPENDITURES REPORTED ABOVE REFLECT THE DEFINITION OF RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. FOR OPERATING AND MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, WE ALSO MEASURE AMOUNTS SPENT ON PRODUCT AND SERVICES TECHNOLOGY. THESE TECHNOLOGY EXPENDITURES WERE $5.9 BILLION IN 2010 AND INCLUDED OUR

REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT SPENT TO IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES.

ORDERS BACKLOG

GES TOTAL BACKLOG OF FIRM UNFILLED ORDERS AT THE END OF 2010 WAS $66.7 BILLION, A

DECREASE OF 1% FROM YEAR-END 2009, REFLECTING DECREASED DEMAND AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DEMAND AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. OF THIS BACKLOG, $46.0 BILLION RELATED TO PRODUCTS, OF WHICH 59% WAS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY

IN 2011. PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS, INCLUDED IN THIS REPORTED BACKLOG FOR ONLY THE SUCCEEDING 12 MONTHS, WERE $20.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2010. PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS BEYOND THE SUCCEEDING 12 MONTHS WERE APPROXIMATELY $108.7 BILLION, WHICH COMBINED

WITH THE FIRM UNFILLED ORDERS DESCRIBED ABOVE RESULTED IN A TOTAL BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $175.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. ORDERS CONSTITUTING BACKLOG MAY BE CANCELLED OR DEFERRED BY CUSTOMERS, SUBJECT IN CERTAIN CASES TO PENALTIES. SEE

RECONCILIATIONS TO THEIR MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES FOLLOW.

$16,405

$16,010

$13,925

WE REFER TO CASH GENERATED BY OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AS INDUSTRIAL CFOA, WHICH WE DEFINE AS GES CASH FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY GE FROM GECS. THIS INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING GE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES SOLD TO GECS; GECS SERVICES FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT AND MATERIAL

PROCUREMENT; BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILES) LEASED BETWEEN GE AND GECS; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND OTHER SERVICES SOLD TO GECS BY GE; AIRCRAFT ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT ARE INSTALLED ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY GECS FROM

THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; AND VARIOUS INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ALLOCATIONS OF GE CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO COMPARE GES OPERATING CASH FLOWS WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF GECS DIVIDENDS,

SINCE THESE DIVIDENDS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THIS MEASURE MAY NOT BE

COMPARABLE TO CASH FLOW RESULTS OF COMPANIES WHICH CONTAIN BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, BUT BELIEVES THAT THIS COMPARISON IS AIDED BY THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS OF DIVIDENDS PAID BY OUR FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESS AND THE SEPARATE PRESENTATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES (GECS) CASH FLOWS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MEASURE OF INDUSTRIAL CFOA PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH A USEFUL MEASURE TO COMPARE THE CAPACITY

OF OUR INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS TO GENERATE OPERATING CASH FLOW WITH THE OPERATING CASH FLOW OF OTHER NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES AND AS SUCH PROVIDES A USEFUL MEASURE TO SUPPLEMENT THE REPORTED GAAP CFOA MEASURE.

THESE ARE USEFUL COMPARISONS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH INFORMATION ON THE RESULTS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WITH AND WITHOUT THE NBCU BUSINESS, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS A BUSINESS HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

MEASURES, CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURES, PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR COMPARISON TO OTHER INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES.

ROTC CALCULATION EXCLUDES EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM THE NUMERATOR BECAUSE U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO DISPLAY THOSE EARNINGS (LOSSES) IN THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. OUR CALCULATION OF AVERAGE GE SHAREOWNERS EQUITY MAY NOT

BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A CLEARER WAY TO MEASURE THE ONGOING TREND IN RETURN ON TOTAL CAPITAL FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES GIVEN THE EXTENT THAT

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS HAVE AFFECTED OUR REPORTED RESULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS RESULTS IN A MORE RELEVANT MEASURE FOR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, AND TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE

THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS WITH THE ONGOING OPERATIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES.

EQUITY ON A BASIS THAT REFLECTS THE USE OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TO REDUCE DEBT, AND WITH LONG-TERM DEBT DUE IN 2066 AND 2067 CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A USEFUL COMPARISON TO A GAAP-BASED RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY BECAUSE CASH

BALANCES MAY BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT AND BECAUSE THIS LONG-TERM DEBT HAS EQUITY-LIKE CHARACTERISTICS. THE USEFULNESS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE MAY BE LIMITED, HOWEVER, AS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AT ANY POINT IN TIME MAY BE

DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNT THAT COULD PRACTICALLY BE APPLIED TO REDUCE OUTSTANDING DEBT, AND IT MAY NOT BE ADVANTAGEOUS OR PRACTICAL TO REPLACE CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT WITH EQUITY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, GE MADE A $9.5 BILLION PAYMENT TO GECS

(OF WHICH $8.8 BILLION WAS FURTHER CONTRIBUTED TO GECC THROUGH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND SHARE ISSUANCE). DESPITE THESE POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE, CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE, PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY BE MORE COMPARABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESSES.

CAPITAL (DEBT OR EQUITY) REQUIRED TO FUND A BUSINESS AS IT ADJUSTS FOR NON-INTEREST BEARING CURRENT LIABILITIES GENERATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A CAPITAL OUTLAY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT BY EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS,

WE PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF ASSETS REQUIRING CAPITAL TO FUND OUR GE CAPITAL SEGMENT, AS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THIS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS RESULTED FROM DEBT ISSUANCES TO PRE-FUND FUTURE DEBT MATURITIES AND WILL NOT BE USED TO FUND ADDITIONAL

ASSETS. PROVIDING THIS MEASURE WILL HELP INVESTORS MEASURE HOW WE ARE PERFORMING AGAINST OUR PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED GOAL TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT.

SECURITIZATION

A PROCESS WHEREBY LOANS OR OTHER RECEIVABLES ARE PACKAGED, UNDERWRITTEN AND SOLD TO

INVESTORS. IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION, ASSETS ARE SOLD TO A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH PURCHASES THE ASSETS WITH CASH RAISED THROUGH ISSUANCE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS (USUALLY DEBT INSTRUMENTS) TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. WHETHER OR NOT CREDIT RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITIZED ASSETS IS RETAINED BY THE SELLER DEPENDS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION. SEE MONETIZATION AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY.

SUBPRIME

FOR PURPOSES OF CONSUMER RELATED DISCUSSION, SUBPRIME INCLUDES CONSUMER FINANCE PRODUCTS LIKE MORTGAGE, AUTO, CARDS, SALES FINANCE AND PERSONAL LOANS TO U.S. AND GLOBAL BORROWERS WHOSE CREDIT SCORE

IMPLIES A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT BASED UPON GECCS PROPRIETARY SCORING MODELS AND DEFINITIONS, WHICH ADD VARIOUS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS TO A BASE CREDIT SCORE SUCH AS A FICO SCORE OR GLOBAL BUREAU SCORE. ALTHOUGH, FICO AND

GLOBAL BUREAU CREDIT SCORES ARE A WIDELY ACCEPTED RATING OF INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER CREDITWORTHINESS, THE INTERNALLY MODELED SCORES ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE BEHAVIOR AND DEFAULT RISKS IN THE PORTFOLIO COMPARED TO STAND-ALONE GENERIC BUREAU SCORES.

ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. WITH OUR PARTICIPATION, AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS CONDUCTED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK AND CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED ON THIS

EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO SHAREOWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (GE) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, AND THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010. WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED GES INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). GE

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON GES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING,

ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR

AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED

IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP).

CONSOLIDATION

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR AFFILIATES  ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. TO DETERMINE IF WE HOLD A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY WE FIRST EVALUATE IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) MODEL TO THE ENTITY, OTHERWISE THE ENTITY IS EVALUATED UNDER THE VOTING INTEREST MODEL.

WHERE WE HOLD CURRENT OR POTENTIAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE US THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE COMBINED WITH A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT GIVES US THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OR THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THAT VIE. RIGHTS HELD BY OTHERS

TO REMOVE THE PARTY WITH POWER OVER THE VIE ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNLESS ONE PARTY CAN EXERCISE THOSE RIGHTS UNILATERALLY. WHEN CHANGES OCCUR TO THE DESIGN OF AN ENTITY WE RECONSIDER WHETHER IT IS SUBJECT TO THE VIE MODEL. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE

WHETHER WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE.

WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN OTHER ENTITIES WHERE WE CURRENTLY HOLD, DIRECTLY

OR INDIRECTLY, MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTING RIGHTS OR WHERE WE EXERCISE CONTROL THROUGH SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS OR AS A GENERAL PARTNER. WHERE WE ARE A GENERAL PARTNER WE CONSIDER SUBSTANTIVE REMOVAL RIGHTS HELD BY OTHER PARTNERS IN

DETERMINING IF WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. WE EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THESE ENTITIES WHEN OUR VOTING OR SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS CHANGE.

ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, BUT OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A VOTING INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%. ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. RESULTS OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO ASSOCIATED

COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS IN THE CAPTION ALL OTHER ASSETS IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES THAT REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN SUCH ASSETS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED

CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT-YEARS PRESENTATION.

FINANCIAL DATA AND RELATED MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING

CATEGORIES.

GE

 THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OTHER THAN GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. (GECS), WHOSE

OPERATIONS ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS.

GECS

 THIS AFFILIATE OWNS ALL OF THE COMMON STOCK OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION

(GECC). GECC AND ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE ACCOMPANYING GECS COLUMNS AND CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF ITS BUSINESS.

CONSOLIDATED

 THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF GE AND GECS, GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

 THESE COMPRISE OUR FIVE BUSINESSES, FOCUSED ON THE BROAD MARKETS THEY SERVE: ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, NBC

UNIVERSAL (NBCU), GE CAPITAL AND HOME & BUSINESS SOLUTIONS. PRIOR-PERIOD INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE MANAGED OUR BUSINESSES IN 2010.

(97)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, INFORMATION IN THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING

OPERATIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED. SEE NOTE 2.

THE EFFECTS OF TRANSLATING TO U.S. DOLLARS THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS EQUITY. ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES, WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE

RATES FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS.

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, UNEMPLOYMENT, MARKET LIQUIDITY, THE REAL ESTATE MARKET, ETC.), WHICH AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH OUR

CURRENT ESTIMATES CONTEMPLATE CURRENT CONDITIONS AND HOW WE EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, AS APPROPRIATE, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IN 2011 ACTUAL CONDITIONS COULD BE WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED IN THOSE ESTIMATES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, SUCH CHANGES COULD RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES,

ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES.

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

WE RECORD ALL SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES ONLY WHEN A FIRM SALES AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED AND COLLECTIBILITY OF

THE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE SALES PRICE IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOMETIMES INCLUDE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS.

MOST OF OUR MULTIPLE COMPONENT ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS USUALLY INVOLVE FUTURE SERVICE DELIVERABLES SUCH AS INSTALLATION, TRAINING OR THE

FUTURE DELIVERY OF ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT. IN SUCH AGREEMENTS, THE AMOUNT ASSIGNED TO EACH COMPONENT IS BASED ON THE TOTAL PRICE AND THE UNDELIVERED COMPONENTS OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED FAIR VALUE, DETERMINED FROM SOURCES SUCH AS THE SEPARATE

SELLING PRICE FOR THAT OR A SIMILAR COMPONENT OR FROM COMPETITOR PRICES FOR SIMILAR COMPONENTS. IF FAIR VALUE OF AN UNDELIVERED COMPONENT CANNOT BE SATISFACTORILY DETERMINED, WE DEFER REVENUE UNTIL ALL COMPONENTS OF AN ARRANGEMENT ARE DELIVERED.

EXCEPT FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF GOODS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 104, REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE OFTEN SELL CONSUMER PRODUCTS, HOME VIDEOS AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN. WE USE OUR ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE TO ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR SUCH RETURNS

WHEN WE RECORD THE SALE. IN SITUATIONS WHERE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS BASED ON SELLER OR CUSTOMER-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE CRITERIA, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE HAVE RELIABLY DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL SPECIFIED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

HAVE BEEN MET OR WHEN FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OCCURS. IN ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE PROVIDE GOODS FOR TRIAL AND EVALUATION PURPOSES, WE ONLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE AFTER CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OCCURS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, WE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR ANTICIPATED LOSSES

BEFORE WE RECORD SALES.

CERTAIN OF OUR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES INVOLVE INCONSEQUENTIAL OR PERFUNCTORY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS

CAN INCLUDE NON-ESSENTIAL INSTALLATION OR TRAINING, AND IN SOME INSTANCES PROVISION OF PRODUCT MANUALS AND LIMITED TECHNICAL PRODUCT SUPPORT. WHEN THE ONLY REMAINING UNDELIVERED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION UNDER AN ARRANGEMENT IS INCONSEQUENTIAL OR

PERFUNCTORY, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE TOTAL CONTRACT AND PROVIDE FOR THE COST OF THE UNPERFORMED OBLIGATION.

(98)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON AGREEMENTS FOR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES UNDER POWER GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS;

NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES; LARGER OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS; AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS; MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS; AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, USING LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION AND PRODUCTION CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. WE ESTIMATE TOTAL

LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUE NET OF PRICE CONCESSIONS AS WELL AS TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS. FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER POWER GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS, NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES, AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS AND MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WE

RECOGNIZE SALES AS WE COMPLETE MAJOR CONTRACT-SPECIFIED DELIVERABLES, MOST OFTEN WHEN CUSTOMERS RECEIVE TITLE TO THE GOODS OR ACCEPT THE SERVICES AS PERFORMED. FOR LARGER OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, WE

RECOGNIZE SALES BASED ON OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN RELATION TO OUR ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE MEASURE LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUES BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES

TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT

LOSS IS PROBABLE.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY FOR SALES OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES, MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND RELATED SPARE PARTS NOT SOLD

UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS. DELIVERY OF COMMERCIAL ENGINES, NON-U.S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND ALL RELATED SPARE PARTS OCCURS ON SHIPMENT; DELIVERY OF MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT SOLD TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AGENCIES THEREOF OCCURS

UPON RECEIPT OF A MATERIAL INSPECTION AND RECEIVING REPORT, DD FORM 250 OR MEMORANDUM OF SHIPMENT. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES ARE COMPLEX AEROSPACE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURED TO CUSTOMER ORDER UNDER A VARIETY OF SOMETIMES-COMPLEX, LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS.

WE MEASURE SALES OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES AND COSTS FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINE AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND

REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRICE CONCESSIONS, PERFORMANCE-RELATED GUARANTEES AS WELL AS MATERIAL, LABOR AND OVERHEAD COSTS. WE MEASURE

REVENUE FOR MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS NOT SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC CONTRACT ON A SPECIFICALLY-MEASURED OUTPUT BASIS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE

AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE; CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, WE MAKE SUCH PROVISION ONLY IF SUCH LOSSES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE HIGHLY PROBABLE SALES OF SPARE PARTS FOR THOSE ENGINES.

WE SELL PRODUCT SERVICES UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT MAINTENANCE OR EXTENDED WARRANTY AGREEMENTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENTS,

PRINCIPALLY IN AVIATION, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION, WHERE COSTS OF PERFORMING SERVICES ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. WE ALSO SELL PRODUCT SERVICES IN HEALTHCARE, WHERE SUCH COSTS GENERALLY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS. FOR THE AVIATION, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE RELATED SALES BASED ON THE EXTENT OF OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES

OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. FOR THE HEALTHCARE AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS AND EXPENSE RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. WE PROVIDE

FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

NBC UNIVERSAL RECORDS BROADCAST AND CABLE TELEVISION AND

INTERNET ADVERTISING SALES WHEN ADVERTISEMENTS ARE AIRED, NET OF PROVISION FOR ANY VIEWER SHORTFALLS (MAKE GOODS). WE RECORD SALES FROM THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF FILMS AS THE FILMS ARE EXHIBITED; SALES OF HOME VIDEOS, NET OF A RETURN PROVISION,

WHEN THE VIDEOS ARE DELIVERED TO AND AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS; FEES FROM CABLE/SATELLITE OPERATORS WHEN SERVICES ARE PROVIDED; AND LICENSING OF FILM AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING WHEN WE MAKE THE MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR AIRING.

GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME)

WE USE THE INTEREST METHOD TO RECOGNIZE INCOME ON LOANS. INTEREST ON LOANS INCLUDES ORIGINATION, COMMITMENT AND OTHER NON-REFUNDABLE FEES RELATED TO FUNDING (RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD). WE

STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED INTEREST INCOME THAT WAS ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED FROM THE BORROWER IS EVALUATED AS

PART OF THE OVERALL RECEIVABLE IN DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. ALTHOUGH WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST IN ADVANCE OF PAYMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST INCOME AS CASH IS COLLECTED WHEN APPROPRIATE, PROVIDED THE AMOUNT DOES NOT

EXCEED THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EARNED AT THE HISTORICAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE; OTHERWISE, PAYMENTS RECEIVED ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN. WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONACCRUAL, NON-RESTRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOANS

ONLY WHEN (A) PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE LOANS ORIGINAL TERMS AND (B) FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED. WHEN WE AGREE TO RESTRUCTURED TERMS WITH THE BORROWER, WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ONLY WHEN IT IS

REASONABLY ASSURED THAT WE WILL RECOVER FULL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS, AND SUCH LOANS PASS UNDERWRITING REVIEWS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE APPLIED TO NEW LOANS. WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONACCRUAL CONSUMER LOANS WHEN THE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT IS LESS

THAN 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND COLLECTION OF SUCH AMOUNTS IS PROBABLE.

INTEREST ACCRUALS ON MODIFIED CONSUMER LOANS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRS) MAY RETURN TO CURRENT STATUS (RE-AGED) ONLY AFTER RECEIPT OF

AT LEAST THREE CONSECUTIVE MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OR THE EQUIVALENT CUMULATIVE AMOUNT, SUBJECT TO A RE-AGING LIMITATION OF ONCE A YEAR, OR TWICE IN A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

WE RECOGNIZE FINANCING LEASE INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD TO PRODUCE A LEVEL YIELD ON FUNDS NOT YET RECOVERED. ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF

THE LEASED ASSET AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. WE USE VARIOUS SOURCES OF DATA IN DETERMINING THIS ESTIMATE, INCLUDING INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED FOR THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC ASSET UNDER LEASE. GUARANTEES OF

RESIDUAL VALUES BY UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES ARE CONSIDERED PART OF MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN ESTIMATING RESIDUAL VALUES INCLUDE ESTIMATED NET CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERM, ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF FUTURE

REMARKETING, AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COMPONENT PART AND SCRAP METAL PRICES, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE.

WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE INCOME ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF UNDERLYING LEASES.

FEES INCLUDE COMMITMENT FEES RELATED TO LOANS THAT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO FUND AND LINE-OF-CREDIT

FEES. WE RECORD THESE FEES IN EARNED INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PERIOD TO WHICH THEY RELATE. WE RECORD SYNDICATION FEES IN EARNED INCOME AT THE TIME RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED, UNLESS SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES EXIST.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COST OF GE MANUFACTURING

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. U.S. ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED USING AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED ON A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA; NON-U.S. ASSETS ARE GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

THE COST OF GECS EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS ON OPERATING LEASES IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER THE LEASE TERM OR OVER THE

ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT.

THE COST OF GECS ACQUIRED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO THE ESTIMATED

SALVAGE VALUE OVER THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OR THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS UPON SALE OF THE INVESTMENT AT THE END OF THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD IF THAT APPROACH PRODUCES A HIGHER MEASURE OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

THE COST OF INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS IS AMORTIZED IN PROPORTION TO ESTIMATED TOTAL RELATED SALES; COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS

GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSETS ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. SEE

NOTES 7 AND 8.

NBC UNIVERSAL FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

WE DEFER FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION COSTS, INCLUDING DIRECT COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND INTEREST. WE DO NOT DEFER COSTS OF EXPLOITATION, WHICH PRINCIPALLY COMPRISE COSTS OF FILM AND

TELEVISION PROGRAM MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. WE AMORTIZE DEFERRED FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION COSTS, AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS, ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS USING THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS

REVENUES TO ESTIMATED TOTAL REMAINING GROSS REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES; WE STATE SUCH COSTS AT THE LOWER OF AMORTIZED COST OR FAIR VALUE. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL REVENUES AND COSTS ARE BASED ON ANTICIPATED RELEASE PATTERNS, PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AND

HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS. WE DEFER THE COSTS OF ACQUIRED BROADCAST MATERIAL, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO MATERIAL FOR USE ON NBC UNIVERSALS BROADCAST AND CABLE/SATELLITE TELEVISION NETWORKS, AT THE EARLIER OF ACQUISITION OR WHEN THE

LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. WE AMORTIZE ACQUIRED BROADCAST MATERIAL AND RIGHTS WHEN WE BROADCAST THE ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS; WE STATE SUCH COSTS AT THE LOWER OF AMORTIZED COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

LOSSES ON FINANCING

RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF

THE RELATED FINANCING RECEIVABLE. SUCH AN ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

SUCH AS DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL VALUES (INCLUDING HOUSING PRICE INDICES AS APPLICABLE), AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS,

ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO PROVIDE FOR LOSSES ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL

EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES. WRITE-OFFS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES WHEN WE JUDGE THE PRINCIPAL TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE AND SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES ARE ADDED TO THE ALLOWANCE AT THE TIME CASH IS

RECEIVED ON A WRITTEN-OFF ACCOUNT.

IMPAIRED LOANS ARE DEFINED AS LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE

LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. TDRS ARE THOSE LOANS FOR WHICH WE HAVE GRANTED A CONCESSION TO A BORROWER EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES WHERE WE DO NOT RECEIVE

ADEQUATE COMPENSATION. SUCH LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED, AND ARE INDIVIDUALLY REVIEWED FOR SPECIFIC RESERVES.

DELINQUENT RECEIVABLES

ARE THOSE THAT ARE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS; AND NONEARNING RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE (OR FOR WHICH COLLECTION IS OTHERWISE DOUBTFUL). NONEARNING RECEIVABLES EXCLUDE LOANS

PURCHASED AT A DISCOUNT (UNLESS THEY HAVE DETERIORATED POST ACQUISITION). UNDER ASC 310,

RECEIVABLES

, THESE LOANS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ACCRETE INTEREST INCOME OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE LOAN BASED ON REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE CASH FLOWS EVEN IF THE UNDERLYING LOANS ARE CONTRACTUALLY DELINQUENT AT ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, NONEARNING RECEIVABLES EXCLUDE LOANS THAT ARE PAYING ON A CASH ACCOUNTING BASIS BUT CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL AND IMPAIRED.

NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE ALL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AND ARE THOSE ON WHICH WE HAVE STOPPED ACCRUING INTEREST. WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE

ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DELINQUENT WHEN PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURED TERMS, BUT MAY REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A PERIOD

OF SATISFACTORY PAYMENT PERFORMANCE BY THE BORROWER AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF COLLECTION.

WHEN WE REPOSSESS COLLATERAL IN

SATISFACTION OF A LOAN, WE WRITE DOWN THE RECEIVABLE AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. REPOSSESSED COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION ALL OTHER ASSETS IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

(101)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE WRITE OFF UNSECURED CLOSED-END INSTALLMENT LOANS AT 120 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE AND UNSECURED OPEN-ENDED

REVOLVING LOANS AT 180 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE. WE WRITE DOWN CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY COLLATERAL OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE WHEN SUCH LOANS ARE 120 DAYS PAST DUE. CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE (BOTH REVOLVING AND

CLOSED-END LOANS) ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, LESS COSTS TO SELL, NO LATER THAN WHEN THEY BECOME 360 DAYS PAST DUE. UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS IN BANKRUPTCY ARE WRITTEN OFF WITHIN 60 DAYS OF NOTIFICATION OF FILING BY THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT OR WITHIN CONTRACTUAL WRITE-OFF PERIODS, WHICHEVER OCCURS EARLIER.

WRITE-OFFS ON LARGER BALANCE IMPAIRED COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE BASED ON

AMOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY. WRITE-OFFS ON REAL ESTATE LOANS ARE RECORDED UPON INITIATION OF FORECLOSURE OR EARLY SETTLEMENT BY THE BORROWER, OR IN SOME CASES, BASED ON THE PASSAGE OF TIME DEPENDING ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES. IN COMMERCIAL LENDING AND LEASING (CLL), LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE (E.G., WHEN THE BORROWER ENTERS RESTRUCTURING, COLLATERAL IS TO BE LIQUIDATED OR AT 180 DAYS PAST DUE FOR SMALLER BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS).

OUR CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF SMALLER BALANCE, HOMOGENEOUS LOANS INCLUDING CARD RECEIVABLES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES AND

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. WE COLLECTIVELY EVALUATE EACH PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON THESE RECEIVABLES IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH A PROCESS THAT ESTIMATES THE PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BASED UPON

STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF PORTFOLIO DATA. THESE ANALYSES INCLUDE MIGRATION ANALYSIS, IN WHICH HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IS APPLIED TO THE CURRENT AGING OF THE PORTFOLIO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER ANALYSES THAT REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS

AND CONDITIONS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OVERALL PORTFOLIO INDICATORS INCLUDING NONEARNING LOANS, TRENDS IN LOAN VOLUME AND LENDING TERMS, CREDIT POLICIES AND OTHER OBSERVABLE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND HOME PRICE INDICES.

OUR COMMERCIAL LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF LOANS AND LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH LARGER-BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES AND

SMALLER-BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS COMMERCIAL AND EQUIPMENT LOANS AND LEASES. LOSSES ON SUCH LOANS AND LEASES ARE RECORDED WHEN PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO FOR POTENTIAL SPECIFIC CREDIT OR COLLECTION ISSUES THAT MIGHT

INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT. FOR LARGER-BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES, WE CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL STATUS, PAYMENT HISTORY, COLLATERAL VALUE, INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND GUARANTOR SUPPORT RELATED TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. ANY DELINQUENCIES OR

BANKRUPTCIES ARE INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT REQUIRING FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF COLLECTIBILITY. WE ROUTINELY RECEIVE FINANCIAL AS WELL AS RATING AGENCY REPORTS ON OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE ELEVATE FOR FURTHER ATTENTION THOSE CUSTOMERS WHOSE

OPERATIONS WE JUDGE TO BE MARGINAL OR DETERIORATING. WE ALSO ELEVATE CUSTOMERS FOR FURTHER ATTENTION WHEN WE OBSERVE A DECLINE IN COLLATERAL VALUES FOR ASSET-BASED LOANS. WHILE COLLATERAL VALUES ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, WHEN WE OBSERVE SUCH A

DECLINE, WE EVALUATE RELEVANT MARKETS TO ASSESS RECOVERY ALTERNATIVES  FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REAL ESTATE LOANS, RELEVANT MARKETS ARE LOCAL; FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT LOANS, RELEVANT MARKETS ARE GLOBAL. MEASUREMENT OF THE LOSS ON OUR IMPAIRED LOANS IS

BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNTED AT THE LOANS EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OR THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, NET OF EXPECTED SELLING COSTS IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL DEPENDENT. WE DETERMINE WHETHER

A LOAN IS COLLATERAL DEPENDENT IF THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. OUR REVIEW PROCESS CAN OFTEN RESULT IN RESERVES BEING ESTABLISHED IN ADVANCE OF A MODIFICATION OF TERMS OR DESIGNATION AS A

TDR. AFTER PROVIDING FOR SPECIFIC INCURRED LOSSES, WE THEN DETERMINE AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED IN THE BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BUT CANNOT YET BE IDENTIFIED TO A SPECIFIC LOAN OR LEASE. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED UPON VARIOUS

STATISTICAL ANALYSES CONSIDERING HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY AND AGING, AS WELL AS OUR VIEW ON CURRENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IT IS PREPARED BY EACH RESPECTIVE LINE OF BUSINESS. FOR REAL ESTATE, THIS INCLUDES

CONVERTING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INTO REAL ESTATE MARKET INDICATORS THAT ARE CALIBRATED BY MARKET AND ASSET CLASS AND WHICH ARE USED TO PROJECT EXPECTED PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BASED ON SPECIFIC LOAN PORTFOLIO METRICS.

(102)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CONSIDER MULTIPLE FACTORS IN EVALUATING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON REAL ESTATE FINANCING

RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, COLLATERAL VALUES AT THE INDIVIDUAL LOAN LEVEL, DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS, DELINQUENCY STATUS, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND REAL ESTATE MARKET FORECASTS. IN ADDITION TO EVALUATING

THESE FACTORS, WE DEEM A REAL ESTATE LOAN TO BE IMPAIRED IF ITS PROJECTED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO AT MATURITY IS IN EXCESS OF 100%, EVEN IF THE LOAN IS CURRENTLY PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON REAL ESTATE

FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY, EXCEPT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE LOAN IS WITHIN 24 MONTHS OF MATURITY OR FORECLOSURE IS DEEMED PROBABLE, IN WHICH CASE RESERVES ARE BASED ON COLLATERAL VALUES. IF FORECLOSURE IS

DEEMED PROBABLE OR IF REPAYMENT IS DEPENDENT SOLELY ON THE SALE OF COLLATERAL, WE DEDUCT ESTIMATED SELLING COSTS FROM THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL VALUES. COLLATERAL VALUES FOR OUR REAL ESTATE LOANS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON INTERNAL

CASH FLOW ESTIMATES DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE AND CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE. COLLATERAL VALUATIONS ARE UPDATED AT LEAST SEMI-ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY, FOR HIGHER RISK LOANS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR REAL

ESTATE IMPAIRED LOANS HAVE SPECIFIC RESERVES THAT ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL VALUES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON DETERMINING FAIR VALUE SEE THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS SECTION BELOW.

EXPERIENCE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR NEW PRODUCTS; THEREFORE, WHILE WE ARE DEVELOPING THAT EXPERIENCE, WE SET LOSS ALLOWANCES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MOST

CLOSELY ANALOGOUS PRODUCTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO.

OUR LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGY INTENDS TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND, AT TIMES, CAN RESULT IN RATE

REDUCTIONS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, EXTENSIONS, FORBEARANCE OR OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE RELATED LOAN TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A TDR.

WE UTILIZE

CERTAIN LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING TEMPORARY FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN OUR CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO. THESE LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN OUR U.S. CREDIT CARD AND NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

PORTFOLIOS AND INCLUDE SHORT-TERM (12 MONTHS OR LESS) INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS AND PAYMENT DEFERRALS, WHICH WERE NOT PART OF THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. WE SOLD OUR U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BUSINESS IN 2007 AND AS SUCH, DO NOT PARTICIPATE

IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED MORTGAGE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS.

OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ON THESE MODIFIED CONSUMER LOANS IS

DETERMINED BASED UPON A FORMULAIC APPROACH THAT ESTIMATES THE PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BASED UPON STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF THE PORTFOLIO. DATA RELATED TO REDEFAULT EXPERIENCE IS ALSO CONSIDERED IN OUR OVERALL RESERVE ADEQUACY REVIEW.

ONCE THE LOAN HAS BEEN MODIFIED, IT RETURNS TO CURRENT STATUS (RE-AGED) ONLY AFTER RECEIPT OF AT LEAST THREE CONSECUTIVE MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OR THE EQUIVALENT CUMULATIVE AMOUNT, SUBJECT TO A RE-AGING LIMITATION OF ONCE A YEAR, OR TWICE IN A

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL GUIDELINES ON UNIFORM RETAIL CREDIT CLASSIFICATION AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT POLICY ISSUED IN JUNE 2000. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES WOULD NOT BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT HAD WE NOT RE-AGED THESE ACCOUNTS.

FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS, WE EVALUATE CHANGES IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE

CHANGES MEET THE CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION AS A TDR ON A LOAN-BY-LOAN BASIS. IN CLL, THESE CHANGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE: CHANGES TO COVENANTS, SHORT-TERM PAYMENT DEFERRALS AND MATURITY EXTENSIONS. FOR THESE CHANGES, WE RECEIVE ECONOMIC CONSIDERATION,

INCLUDING ADDITIONAL FEES AND/OR INCREASED INTEREST RATES, AND EVALUATE THEM UNDER OUR NORMAL UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND CRITERIA. CHANGES TO REAL ESTATES LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE MATURITY EXTENSIONS, PRINCIPAL PAYMENT ACCELERATION, CHANGES TO

COLLATERAL TERMS, AND CASH SWEEPS, WHICH ARE IN ADDITION TO, OR SOMETIMES IN LIEU OF, FEES AND RATE INCREASES. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THESE CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR COMMERCIAL LOANS MEET THE TDR CRITERIA INCLUDES OUR

CONSIDERATION OF ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN THE BORROWER IS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, WE CAREFULLY EVALUATE THESE CHANGES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE FORM OF A CONCESSION. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IF THE CHANGE

IS DEEMED TO BE A CONCESSION, WE CLASSIFY THE LOAN AS A TDR.

PARTIAL SALES OF BUSINESS INTERESTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 810,

CONSOLIDATION

, WHICH REQUIRES THAT GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF AFFILIATE SHARES WHERE WE RETAIN A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST TO BE RECORDED IN EQUITY. GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES THAT RESULT IN OUR LOSS OF A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS ALONG WITH REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON ANY INVESTMENTS IN THE ENTITY THAT WE RETAINED.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2010-02,

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR DECREASES IN OWNERSHIP OF A SUBSIDIARY

, WHICH CLARIFIED THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 810,

CONSOLIDATION

. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1,

2009, WE RECORDED GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF THEIR OWN SHARES BY AFFILIATES EXCEPT WHEN REALIZATION OF GAINS WAS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, IN WHICH CASE WE RECORDED THE RESULTS IN SHAREOWNERS EQUITY. WE RECORDED GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF

INTERESTS IN COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY ENGINE AND AERODERIVATIVE EQUIPMENT PROGRAMS.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

DEBT SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE INCLUDED IN CASH EQUIVALENTS UNLESS DESIGNATED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REPORT INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 21 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS EQUITY, NET OF APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA.

IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE

EVALUATE QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. WE ALSO EVALUATE QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDING DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. IF WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY,

WE CONSIDER THE SECURITY TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AND WE RECORD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITYS AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS RECOVERABLE AMOUNT IN EARNINGS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITYS RECOVERABLE AMOUNT

AND FAIR VALUE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. IF WE INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE SECURITY IS ALSO CONSIDERED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AND WE RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITYS AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS.

PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2009, UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT WERE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WERE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

SECURITYS AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR VALUE. IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE UNREALIZED LOSS WAS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE CONSIDERED BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDED THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE

AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY WAS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AND, FOR SECURITIES WITH FIXED MATURITIES, WHETHER THE ISSUER WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. FOR STRUCTURED SECURITIES, WE EVALUATED WHETHER THERE WAS AN

ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE TIMING OR AMOUNT OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. QUALITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, AS WELL AS OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY TO MATURITY OR UNTIL FORECASTED

RECOVERY.

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

ALL INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR REALIZABLE VALUES. COST FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GE U.S. INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT

(LIFO) BASIS. COST OF OTHER GE INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS. LIFO WAS USED FOR 39% OF GE INVENTORIES AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. GECS INVENTORIES CONSIST OF FINISHED PRODUCTS HELD FOR SALE; COST IS

DETERMINED ON A FIFO BASIS.

(104)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT TEST IT AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. A REPORTING UNIT IS THE OPERATING SEGMENT, OR A BUSINESS ONE LEVEL BELOW THAT OPERATING SEGMENT (THE COMPONENT

LEVEL) IF DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PREPARED AND REGULARLY REVIEWED BY SEGMENT MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, COMPONENTS ARE AGGREGATED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT IF THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IF THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL. WE USE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES. WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS

APPROPRIATE, WE USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW RESULTS. WHEN ALL OR A PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DISPOSED OF, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSITION BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THE

BUSINESS DISPOSED OF AND THE PORTION OF THE REPORTING UNIT THAT WILL BE RETAINED.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. THE COST OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSETS ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE, EXCEPT THAT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

AMORTIZED IN RELATION TO TOTAL RELATED SALES. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND, IF IMPAIRED, WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE BASED ON EITHER DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES. INTANGIBLE

ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AS REQUIRED.

GECS INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE

LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS

CERTAIN ENTITIES, WHICH WE CONSOLIDATE, PROVIDE GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS TO STATES, MUNICIPALITIES

AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES.

OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDE PROVIDING INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE FOR LIFE AND HEALTH RISKS AND PROVIDING CERTAIN

ANNUITY PRODUCTS. THREE PRODUCT GROUPS ARE PROVIDED: TRADITIONAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITH SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY AND/OR MORBIDITY RISKS, WHILE INVESTMENT

CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITHOUT SUCH RISKS. UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACT WHOSE TERMS ARE NOT FIXED AND GUARANTEED.

FOR SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE, WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME OVER THE TERMS OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS, GENERALLY ON A PRO-RATA BASIS. FOR TRADITIONAL

LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS INCLUDING TERM, WHOLE LIFE AND ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ANNUITANT, WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME WHEN DUE.

PREMIUMS RECEIVED ON INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (INCLUDING ANNUITIES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY RISK) AND UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUES BUT RATHER AS DEPOSIT LIABILITIES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES

FOR CHARGES AND ASSESSMENTS ON THESE CONTRACTS, MOSTLY FOR MORTALITY, CONTRACT INITIATION, ADMINISTRATION AND SURRENDER. AMOUNTS CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

LIABILITIES FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE PRESENT VALUE OF SUCH BENEFITS LESS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE NET PREMIUMS BASED ON MORTALITY, MORBIDITY, INTEREST AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS

AT THE TIME THE POLICIES WERE ISSUED OR ACQUIRED. LIABILITIES FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES EQUAL THE ACCOUNT VALUE, THAT IS, THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES TO THE BENEFIT OF THE CONTRACT OR POLICYHOLDER INCLUDING CREDITED INTEREST

AND ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE.

LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE

OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATIONS FOR REPORTED AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED CLAIMS AND THE RELATED ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES. LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED THROUGH

CURRENT OPERATIONS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A MARKET

PARTICIPANT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION

THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT

MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES, WHILE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT OUR MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. PREFERENCE IS GIVEN TO OBSERVABLE INPUTS. THESE TWO TYPES OF INPUTS CREATE THE FOLLOWING FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

LEVEL 1



QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 2



QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS WHOSE INPUTS ARE

OBSERVABLE OR WHOSE SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE.

LEVEL 3



SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL ARE UNOBSERVABLE.

WE MAINTAIN POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES TO VALUE INSTRUMENTS USING THE BEST AND MOST RELEVANT DATA AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT REVIEW VALUATION, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT PRICE VALIDATION FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS. FURTHER, IN OTHER INSTANCES, WE

RETAIN INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDORS TO ASSIST IN VALUING CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DESCRIBES THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO

MEASURE DIFFERENT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

. WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE

QUOTED MARKET PRICES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1. LEVEL 1 SECURITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES.

WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNOBSERVABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INFORMATION FROM AN INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDOR. THE PRICING VENDOR USES VARIOUS PRICING MODELS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE. THE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS TO THE MODEL OF THE PRICING VENDOR ARE DERIVED FROM MARKET OBSERVABLE SOURCES INCLUDING: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS,

OFFERS, AND OTHER MARKET-RELATED DATA. SINCE MANY FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE METHODOLOGY OF THE PRICING VENDOR USES AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS APPLICABLE SUCH AS BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR

GROUPINGS, AND MATRIX PRICING. THE PRICING VENDOR CONSIDERS AVAILABLE MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS IN DETERMINING THE EVALUATION FOR A SECURITY. THUS, CERTAIN SECURITIES MAY NOT BE PRICED USING QUOTED PRICES, BUT RATHER DETERMINED FROM MARKET OBSERVABLE

INFORMATION. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 AND PRIMARILY COMPRISE OUR PORTFOLIO OF CORPORATE FIXED INCOME, AND GOVERNMENT, MORTGAGE AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. IN INFREQUENT CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR PRICING VENDORS MAY PROVIDE US WITH

VALUATIONS THAT ARE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE CLASSIFY THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN LEVEL 3.

(106)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANNUALLY, WE CONDUCT REVIEWS OF OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR TO VALIDATE THAT THE INPUTS USED IN THAT VENDORS

PRICING PROCESS ARE DEEMED TO BE MARKET OBSERVABLE AS DEFINED IN THE STANDARD. WHILE WE WERE NOT PROVIDED ACCESS TO PROPRIETARY MODELS OF THE VENDOR, OUR REVIEWS HAVE INCLUDED ON-SITE WALK-THROUGHS OF THE PRICING PROCESS, METHODOLOGIES AND CONTROL

PROCEDURES FOR EACH ASSET CLASS AND LEVEL FOR WHICH PRICES ARE PROVIDED. OUR REVIEW ALSO INCLUDED AN EXAMINATION OF THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR A SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ACROSS ASSET CLASSES, CREDIT RATING LEVELS AND VARIOUS

DURATIONS, A PROCESS WE CONTINUE TO PERFORM FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE PRICING VENDOR HAS AN ESTABLISHED CHALLENGE PROCESS IN PLACE FOR ALL SECURITY VALUATIONS, WHICH FACILITATES IDENTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF POTENTIALLY

ERRONEOUS PRICES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM OUR PRICING VENDOR ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT PRICES) AND ARE CLASSIFIED APPROPRIATELY IN THE HIERARCHY.

WE USE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AS OUR PRIMARY BASIS FOR VALUATION WHEN THERE IS LIMITED, OR NO, RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY FOR A SPECIFIC INSTRUMENT OR FOR OTHER

INSTRUMENTS THAT SHARE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. WE HAVE NOT ADJUSTED THE PRICES WE HAVE OBTAINED. INVESTMENT SECURITIES PRICED USING NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. AS IS THE CASE WITH OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR, THIRD-PARTY

BROKERS DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THEIR PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL CONDUCT INTERNAL REVIEWS OF PRICING FOR ALL SUCH INVESTMENT SECURITIES QUARTERLY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS OF

VALUATIONS USED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE REVIEWS ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PRICES THAT APPEAR STALE, THOSE THAT HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRIOR VALUATIONS, AND OTHER ANOMALIES THAT MAY INDICATE THAT A PRICE MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. BASED

ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUES PROVIDED BY THE BROKERS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT PRICES).

RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION AND ESTIMATED NET

CREDIT EXPOSURE, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DISCOUNT RATES AND EXPECTED LIFE.

DERIVATIVES.

WE USE CLOSING PRICES FOR DERIVATIVES INCLUDED IN LEVEL

1, WHICH ARE TRADED EITHER ON EXCHANGES OR LIQUID OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING INTERNAL MODELS. THE

MODELS MAXIMIZE THE USE OF MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES AND BOTH FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 PRIMARILY REPRESENT INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 PRIMARILY

REPRESENT INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY OR PREPAYMENT FEATURES.

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

. CERTAIN ASSETS

ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS. THESE ASSETS ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AN ONGOING BASIS, BUT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE ASSETS CAN INCLUDE LOANS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT

HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE HELD FOR SALE, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE

WHEN THEY ARE IMPAIRED AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, IF WE SELL A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND RETAIN A NONCONTROLLING STAKE

IN THE ENTITY. ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN IMPAIRED AND RETAINED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS AND FOR ASSETS WITHIN OUR PENSION PLANS AND RETIREE

BENEFIT PLANS AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOANS

. WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICING ON RECENT CLOSED MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

TO VALUE LOANS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2. WHEN THIS DATA IS UNOBSERVABLE, WE USE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USING CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATE DATA ADJUSTED FOR INHERENT CREDIT RISK, AND SUCH LOANS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. WHEN APPROPRIATE, LOANS

ARE VALUED USING COLLATERAL VALUES AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT (SEE LONG-LIVED ASSETS BELOW).

COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

. COST AND EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE. WHEN MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA IS UNAVAILABLE, INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES OR A COMBINATION OF

BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND COLLECTIVE FUNDS

ARE VALUED USING NET ASSET VALUES. THE NET ASSET VALUES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

REDEEMABLE AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. INVESTMENTS IN COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

. FAIR VALUES OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS, INCLUDING AIRCRAFT AND REAL ESTATE, ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED INTERNALLY AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVED SALES TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR ASSETS. IN OTHER INSTANCES, FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL TYPES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE COMPARABLE OBSERVED SALES

TRANSACTION DATA, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY AND CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISAL INFORMATION. ADJUSTMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY VALUATIONS MAY BE PERFORMED IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MARKET COMPARABLES ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO THE ATTRIBUTES OF

THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL OR APPRAISAL INFORMATION MAY NOT BE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND THE OCCURRENCE OF MARKET EVENTS SINCE RECEIPT OF THE INFORMATION. FOR REAL ESTATE, FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ESTIMATES WHICH REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE PROFILES AND AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT CAPITALIZATION RATES AND EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTS AND OCCUPANCY AND ARE CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISALS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN

DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF OUR RETAINED NONCONTROLLING STAKE IN THE FORMER SUBSIDIARY IS VALUED USING AN INCOME APPROACH, A MARKET APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE. IN APPLYING THESE

METHODOLOGIES, WE RELY ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS, FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, MARKET OBSERVABLE PRICING MULTIPLES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, AND POSSIBLE CONTROL PREMIUM.

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) MADE THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2009. THE

ASC COMBINES ALL PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GAAP INTO ONE SET OF GUIDANCE CODIFIED BY SUBJECT AREA. IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, REFERENCES TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH THE RELEVANT ASC REFERENCES.

SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS TO GAAP BY THE FASB ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE ASC THROUGH ISSUANCE OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES (ASU).

ON JANUARY 1, 2010,

WE ADOPTED ASU 2009-16 AND ASU 2009-17, AMENDMENTS TO ASC 860,

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING

, AND ASC 810,

CONSOLIDATION

, RESPECTIVELY (ASU 2009-16 & 17). ASU 2009-16 ELIMINATED THE QUALIFIED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (QSPE) CONCEPT,

AND ASU 2009-17 REQUIRED THAT ALL SUCH ENTITIES BE EVALUATED FOR CONSOLIDATION AS VIES. ADOPTION OF THESE AMENDMENTS RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL OF OUR SPONSORED QSPES. IN ADDITION, WE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF VIES RELATED TO DIRECT

INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT HOLD LOANS AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, A MEDIA JOINT VENTURE AND A SMALL NUMBER OF COMPANIES TO WHICH WE HAVE EXTENDED LOANS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY WERE SUBJECT TO A TDR.

(108)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CONSOLIDATED THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AT AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAD WE ALWAYS CONSOLIDATED THEM. WE ALSO DECONSOLIDATED CERTAIN ENTITIES WHERE WE DID NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY UNDER THE REVISED GUIDANCE; HOWEVER, THE EFFECT WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT JANUARY 1, 2010.

THE INCREMENTAL EFFECT ON TOTAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NET OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE ENTITIES, WAS AN INCREASE OF $31,097 MILLION AND $33,042 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT JANUARY 1, 2010. THE NET REDUCTION OF TOTAL EQUITY (INCLUDING

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) WAS $1,945 MILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SECURITIZATION GAINS AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS. SEE NOTE 24 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 805,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

. THIS AMENDMENT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS BOTH DURING THE PERIOD OF THE ACQUISITION AND IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS ARE THE FOLLOWING.



ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ASSET, WITH THE COST RECOGNIZED AS THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS REALIZED OR

ABANDONED. IPR&D WAS PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION.



CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS AN ELEMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS RECOGNIZED IN OPERATIONS. CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION

WAS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE.



SUBSEQUENT DECREASES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON ACQUIRED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED IN OPERATIONS AFTER THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SUCH CHANGES WERE

PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED TO BE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN CONSIDERATION AND WERE RECORDED AS DECREASES IN GOODWILL.



TRANSACTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED. THESE COSTS WERE PREVIOUSLY TREATED AS COSTS OF THE ACQUISITION.



UPON GAINING CONTROL OF AN ENTITY IN WHICH AN EQUITY METHOD OR COST BASIS INVESTMENT WAS HELD, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT INVESTMENT IS ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE

WITH THE RELATED GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED IN EARNINGS. PREVIOUSLY, THIS FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE.

IN APRIL 2009,

THE FASB AMENDED ASC 805 AND CHANGED THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE ADOPTED THIS AMENDMENT RETROSPECTIVELY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009. THE AMENDMENT REQUIRES

PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES TO BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE, IF FAIR VALUE CAN BE DETERMINED OR REASONABLY ESTIMATED DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. IF FAIR VALUE CANNOT BE DETERMINED OR REASONABLY ESTIMATED, THE STANDARD REQUIRES MEASUREMENT BASED

ON THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT CRITERIA OF ASC 450,

CONTINGENCIES.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 810, THAT

REQUIRES US TO MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT REQUIRES US TO CLASSIFY EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS MINORITY INTEREST) AS PART OF

CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS ($535 MILLION AND $200 MILLION FOR 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY) AND TO INCLUDE THE ACCUMULATED AMOUNT OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AS PART OF SHAREOWNERS EQUITY ($5,262 MILLION AND $7,845 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY). THE NET EARNINGS AMOUNTS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ARE NOW PRESENTED AS NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY AND, AS REQUIRED, EARNINGS PER SHARE CONTINUES TO REFLECT AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE ONLY TO THE

COMPANY. SIMILARLY, IN OUR PRESENTATION OF SHAREOWNERS EQUITY, WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EQUITY AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GE SHAREOWNERS AND AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS MINORITY INTEREST

OUTSIDE OF SHAREOWNERS EQUITY. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009, DIVIDENDS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ($317 MILLION AND $548 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY) ARE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FINANCIAL

REPORTING CHANGES, THIS GUIDANCE PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS; SPECIFICALLY, INCREASES AND DECREASES IN OUR CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE REPORTED IN EQUITY

SIMILAR TO TREASURY STOCK TRANSACTIONS. IF A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY RESULTS IN LOSS OF CONTROL AND DECONSOLIDATION, ANY RETAINED OWNERSHIP INTERESTS ARE REMEASURED WITH THE GAIN OR LOSS REPORTED IN NET EARNINGS.

(109)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED ASC 808,

PRESENTATION OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES FOR PRINCIPAL PARTICIPANTS IN COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENTS ENTER INTO COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS

USED TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN CERTAIN ENGINES, AERODERIVATIVES, AND TURBINES, UNDER WHICH GE AND THESE PARTICIPANTS SHARE IN RISKS AND REWARDS OF THESE PRODUCT PROGRAMS. ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD HAD NO EFFECT AS OUR HISTORICAL PRESENTATION HAD BEEN

CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS.

WE ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO ASC 320,

NOTE 2. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE

NBC

UNIVERSAL

IN DECEMBER 2009, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH COMCAST CORPORATION (COMCAST) TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS OF THE NBCU BUSINESS TO A NEWLY

FORMED ENTITY, COMPRISING OUR NBCU BUSINESS AND COMCASTS CABLE NETWORKS, REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORKS, CERTAIN DIGITAL PROPERTIES AND CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH AND A 49% INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED ENTITY.

ON MARCH 19, 2010, NBCU ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND A 364-DAY BRIDGE LOAN AGREEMENT. ON APRIL 30, 2010, NBCU ISSUED $4,000

MILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED NOTES WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM 2015 TO 2040 (INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 3.65% TO 6.40%). ON OCTOBER 4, 2010, NBCU ISSUED $5,100 MILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED NOTES WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM 2014 TO 2041

(INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 2.10% TO 5.95%). SUBSEQUENT TO THESE ISSUANCES, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND BRIDGE LOAN AGREEMENTS WERE TERMINATED, WITH A $750 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT REMAINING IN EFFECT. PROCEEDS FROM THESE ISSUANCES WERE USED

TO REPAY $1,678 MILLION OF EXISTING DEBT AND PAY A DIVIDEND TO GE.

ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2010, WE ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 38% OF VIVENDI S.A.S

(VIVENDI) 20% INTEREST IN NBCU (7.7% OF NBCUS OUTSTANDING SHARES) FOR $2,000 MILLION.

PRIOR TO AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION WITH

COMCAST, WE ACQUIRED THE REMAINING VIVENDI INTEREST IN NBCU (12.3% OF NBCUS OUTSTANDING SHARES) FOR $3,578 MILLION AND MADE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OF $222 MILLION RELATED TO THE PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED SHARES.

ON JANUARY 28, 2011, WE TRANSFERRED THE ASSETS OF THE NBCU BUSINESS AND COMCAST TRANSFERRED CERTAIN OF ITS ASSETS TO A NEWLY FORMED ENTITY, NBC UNIVERSAL LLC

(NBCU LLC). IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, WE RECEIVED $6,197 MILLION IN CASH FROM COMCAST AND A 49% INTEREST IN NBCU LLC. COMCAST HOLDS THE REMAINING 51% INTEREST IN NBCU LLC. WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN NBCU LLC UNDER THE EQUITY

METHOD. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE A SMALL AFTER-TAX GAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011.

(110)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH RESPECT TO OUR 49% INTEREST IN NBCU LLC, WE HOLD REDEMPTION RIGHTS, WHICH, IF EXERCISED, CAUSE NBCU LLC OR

COMCAST TO PURCHASE HALF OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND THE REMAINING HALF AFTER SEVEN YEARS (EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE TRANSFER OF COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATE OWNER OF NBCU LLC) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS,

CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS. OUR INTEREST IN NBCU LLC IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CALL PROVISIONS, WHICH, IF EXERCISED, ALLOW COMCAST TO PURCHASE OUR INTEREST (EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE TRANSFER OF COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATE OWNER OF NBCU LLC) AT

SPECIFIED TIMES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THE REDEMPTION PRICES FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE DETERMINED PURSUANT TO A CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED FORMULA.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS WITH COMCAST GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF THE VENTURE AND TRANSITIONAL SERVICES,

EMPLOYEE, TAX AND OTHER MATTERS. UNDER THE OPERATING AGREEMENT, EXCESS CASH GENERATED BY THE OPERATIONS OF NBCU LLC WILL BE USED TO REDUCE BORROWINGS RATHER THAN TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS TO US, EXCEPT FOR DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER A FORMULA TO ENABLE US TO

PAY TAXES ON NBCU LLCS PROFITS. IN ADDITION, COMCAST IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO US FOR A SHARE OF TAX SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH COMCASTS PURCHASE OF ITS NBCU LLC MEMBER INTEREST.

AS PART OF THE TRANSFER, WE PROVIDED GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATED TO CERTAIN PRE-EXISTING CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY NBCU. WE HAVE

PROVIDED GUARANTEES, ON BEHALF OF NBCU LLC, FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS PROGRAMMING IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,258 MILLION, TRIGGERED ONLY IN THE EVENT NBCU LLC FAILS TO MEET ITS PAYMENT COMMITMENTS. WE ALSO HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY COMCAST AGAINST ANY

LOSS (AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO UNDERLYING COLLATERAL) RELATED TO A PRE-EXISTING CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENT COVERING $815 MILLION OF DEBT PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST OWED BY A JOINT VENTURE OF NBCU LLC.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE CLASSIFIED THE NBCU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $33,758 MILLION AND $15,455 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS HELD FOR SALE. THE MAJOR CLASSES

OF ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WERE CURRENT RECEIVABLES ($2,572 MILLION), PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  NET ($2,082 MILLION), GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  NET ($22,263) AND ALL OTHER ASSETS ($6,841 MILLION), INCLUDING FILM

LIABILITIES ($1,073 MILLION).

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE CLASSIFIED THE NBCU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $32,150 MILLION AND $5,751 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AS HELD FOR SALE. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE CURRENT RECEIVABLES ($2,136 MILLION), PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  NET ($1,805 MILLION), GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  NET ($21,574) AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GE MONEY JAPAN

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL OUR JAPANESE PERSONAL LOAN BUSINESS, LAKE, UPON DETERMINING THAT, DESPITE RESTRUCTURING, JAPANESE

REGULATORY LIMITS FOR INTEREST CHARGES ON UNSECURED PERSONAL LOANS DID NOT PERMIT US TO EARN AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WHICH INCLUDED LAKE, ALONG WITH OUR JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND

CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT IN GE NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $908 MILLION IN 2007 AND AN INCREMENTAL LOSS OF $361 MILLION IN 2008. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, WE REDUCED THE PROCEEDS ON THE

SALE FOR ESTIMATED INTEREST REFUND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE STATUTORY INTEREST RATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE WERE TO BE INCREASED OR DECREASED BASED ON THE ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOSS-SHARING TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE SALE

AGREEMENT, WITH ALL CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF 258 BILLION JAPANESE YEN (APPROXIMATELY $3,000 MILLION) REMAINING OUR RESPONSIBILITY. THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO TO WHICH THIS OBLIGATION RELATES IS IN RUNOFF AND INTEREST RATES WERE CAPPED FOR ALL DESIGNATED

ACCOUNTS BY MID-2009. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, WE BEGAN MAKING REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT.

OUR OVERALL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPED

UNFAVORABLY THROUGH 2010. WHILE OUR AVERAGE DAILY CLAIMS CONTINUED TO DECLINE THROUGH AUGUST 2010, THE PACE OF THE DECLINE WAS SLOWER THAN EXPECTED, AND CLAIMS SEVERITY INCREASED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF EXCESS INTEREST REFUND CLAIMS HAS BEEN

IMPACTED BY THE CHALLENGING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, IN ADDITION TO JAPANESE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES. WE ACCRUED $566 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL RESERVES FOR THESE CLAIMS DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2010, IN ADDITION TO THE THIRD

QUARTER CHARGE DISCUSSED BELOW.

SIGNIFICANTLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2010, A LARGE INDEPENDENT PERSONAL LOAN COMPANY IN JAPAN FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHICH

PRECIPITATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PUBLICITY SURROUNDING EXCESS INTEREST REFUND CLAIMS IN THE JAPANESE MARKETPLACE, ALONG WITH SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL ADVERTISING. WE OBSERVED AN INCREASE IN CLAIMS DURING SEPTEMBER 2010 AND HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY CLAIMS

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. BASED ON THESE FACTORS AND ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS, WE RECORDED AN ADJUSTMENT TO OUR RESERVES OF $1,100 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 TO BRING THE RESERVE TO A BETTER ESTIMATE OF OUR PROBABLE LOSS. THIS ADJUSTMENT

PRIMARILY REFLECTS REVISIONS IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND CALCULATIONS OF THE NUMBER OF ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE INCOMING CLAIMS, INCREASES IN CLAIMS SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS, REFLECTING RECENT TRENDS IN AMOUNTS PAID PER CLAIM, AND HIGHER ESTIMATES OF LOSS

FOR CLAIMS IN PROCESS OF SETTLEMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR RESERVE FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE STATUTORY INTEREST RATE WAS $1,465 MILLION.

THE AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES IS BASED ON ANALYSES OF RECENT AND HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, PENDING AND ESTIMATED FUTURE EXCESS INTEREST REFUND REQUESTS, THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS WHO PRESENT VALID

REQUESTS, AND OUR ESTIMATED PAYMENTS RELATED TO THOSE REQUESTS. OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR EXCESS INTEREST REFUND CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 ASSUMES THE PACE OF INCOMING CLAIMS WILL DECELERATE, AVERAGE EXPOSURE PER CLAIM REMAINS CONSISTENT

WITH RECENT EXPERIENCE, AND WE SEE THE IMPACT OF OUR LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS. ESTIMATING THE PACE OF DECLINE IN INCOMING CLAIMS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF OUR LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR THIRD QUARTER 2010 ESTIMATE ASSUMES

INCOMING AVERAGE DAILY CLAIMS WILL DECLINE AT A LONG-TERM AVERAGE RATE OF 4% MONTHLY. HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT, IF CLAIMS DECLINED AT A RATE OF ONE PERCENT HIGHER OR LOWER THAN ASSUMED, OUR LIABILITY ESTIMATE WOULD CHANGE BY

APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION.

UNCERTAINTIES AROUND THE IMPACT OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS, CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE RUNOFF STATUS OF THE

UNDERLYING BOOK OF BUSINESS AND THE EFFECTS OF OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE POSSIBLE CLAIMS EXPOSURE. RECENT TRENDS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, MARKET ACTIVITY

REGARDING OTHER PERSONAL LOAN COMPANIES AND CONSUMER ACTIVITY, MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CLAIMS DEVELOPMENT.

GE MONEY JAPAN REVENUES

FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN BOTH 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, AND $763 MILLION IN 2008. IN TOTAL, GE MONEY JAPAN LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE $1,671 MILLION, $158 MILLION AND $651 MILLION

FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

WMC

DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF WMC, OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS. WMC SUBSTANTIALLY DISCONTINUED ALL NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, AND IS NOT A LOAN SERVICER. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, WMC RETAINED CERTAIN

OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO LOANS SOLD PRIOR TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WMCS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS AS TO WHICH THERE WAS AN EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT OR WITH RESPECT TO WHICH CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WERE NOT MET. ALL CLAIMS RECEIVED FOR EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT HAVE EITHER BEEN RESOLVED OR ARE NO LONGER BEING PURSUED.

PENDING CLAIMS FOR UNMET REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES HAVE DECLINED FROM APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010. RESERVES RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WERE $101 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND $205 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES IS BASED UPON PENDING AND ESTIMATED

FUTURE LOAN REPURCHASE REQUESTS, THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF LOANS VALIDLY TENDERED FOR REPURCHASE, AND OUR ESTIMATED LOSSES ON LOANS REPURCHASED. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE ESTIMATE THAT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL LOANS WMC

ORIGINATED AND SOLD WILL BE TENDERED FOR REPURCHASE, AND OF THOSE TENDERED, ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT WILL QUALIFY AS VALIDLY TENDERED, MEANING THE LOANS SOLD DID NOT SATISFY SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. NEW CLAIMS RECEIVED OVER THE

PAST THREE YEARS HAVE DECLINED FROM $859 MILLION IN 2008 TO $320 MILLION IN 2010. WMCS CURRENT RESERVE REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES WITH RESPECT TO WMCS REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. ACTUAL LOSSES COULD EXCEED THE RESERVE AMOUNT IF

ACTUAL CLAIM RATES, VALID TENDERS OR LOSSES WMC INCURS ON REPURCHASED LOANS ARE HIGHER THAN HISTORICALLY OBSERVED.

WMC REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS WERE $(4) MILLION, $2 MILLION AND $(71) MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IN TOTAL, WMCS LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE $7 MILLION, $1 MILLION AND $41 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) ON SECURITIES STILL HELD AMOUNTED TO $(478) MILLION, OF

WHICH $(368) MILLION RELATED TO RMBS. GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO THOSE SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AMOUNTED TO $(328) MILLION, OF WHICH $(232) MILLION RELATED TO RMBS.

WE ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO ASC 320 AND RECORDED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO INCREASE RETAINED EARNINGS BY $62 MILLION AS OF APRIL 1, 2009.

WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA. WE PRESENTLY DO NOT INTEND TO SELL OUR DEBT SECURITIES

AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EQUITY

SECURITIES WILL BE RECOVERED WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR U.S. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES ARE RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE

MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. WE EVALUATE U.S. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE

SECURITY. IN THE EVENT A U.S. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITY IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WE ISOLATE THE CREDIT PORTION OF THE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS TO THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE

SECURITY. WE DISCOUNT THE CASH FLOWS USING THE ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF THE SECURITY.

(117)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR RMBS HAVE INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES AND ARE IN A SENIOR

POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL. OF OUR TOTAL RMBS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, APPROXIMATELY $673 MILLION AND $897 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT, PRIMARILY SUPPORTING OUR GUARANTEED INVESTMENT

CONTRACTS. THESE ARE COLLATERALIZED PRIMARILY BY POOLS OF INDIVIDUAL, DIRECT MORTGAGE LOANS (A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND 2005), NOT OTHER STRUCTURED PRODUCTS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, OF THE TOTAL

RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT EXPOSURE AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, APPROXIMATELY $343 MILLION AND $456 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WAS INSURED BY MONOLINE INSURERS (MONOLINES) ON WHICH WE CONTINUE TO PLACE RELIANCE.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS) ALSO HAVE INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES AND ARE IN A SENIOR

POSITION IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL. OUR CMBS INVESTMENTS ARE COLLATERALIZED BY BOTH DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF MORTGAGES THAT WERE ORIGINATED FOR SECURITIZATION (CONDUIT CMBS) AND POOLS OF LARGE LOANS BACKED BY HIGH-QUALITY PROPERTIES (LARGE

LOAN CMBS), A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND 2007.

OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ABS) PORTFOLIO IS COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF

DIVERSIFIED POOLS OF ASSETS SUCH AS STUDENT LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS, AS WELL AS LARGE SENIOR SECURED LOANS TARGETING HIGH-QUALITY, MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR ABS SECURITIES ARE IN A SENIOR POSITION IN

THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES THAT ARE BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE ARE IN AN UNREALIZED GAIN POSITION.

FOR ABS, INCLUDING RMBS, WE ESTIMATE THE PORTION OF LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED

FROM THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS CONSIDER INTERNAL CREDIT RISK, INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITY AND

PREPAYMENT RATES. FOR CMBS, WE ESTIMATE THE PORTION OF LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT BY EVALUATING POTENTIAL LOSSES ON EACH OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS IN THE SECURITY. COLLATERAL CASH FLOWS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR POSITION IN THE CAPITAL

STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL. ASSUMPTIONS CAN VARY WIDELY DEPENDING UPON THE COLLATERAL TYPE, GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS AND VINTAGE.

IF THERE HAS BEEN AN

ADVERSE CHANGE IN CASH FLOWS FOR RMBS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS SUCH AS MONOLINE INSURANCE (WHICH ARE FEATURES OF A SPECIFIC SECURITY). IN EVALUATING THE OVERALL CREDIT WORTHINESS OF THE MONOLINE, WE USE AN ANALYSIS THAT IS SIMILAR

TO THE APPROACH WE USE FOR CORPORATE BONDS, INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE MONOLINES CASH RESERVES AND CAPITAL, RATINGS ACTIVITY, WHETHER THE MONOLINE IS IN DEFAULT OR DEFAULT APPEARS IMMINENT, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR

INTERVENTION BY AN INSURER OR OTHER REGULATOR.

DURING 2010, WE RECORDED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $460 MILLION, OF WHICH $253 MILLION WAS

RECORDED THROUGH EARNINGS ($35 MILLION RELATES TO EQUITY SECURITIES) AND $207 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI). AT JANUARY 1, 2010, CUMULATIVE IMPAIRMENTS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT

SECURITIES STILL HELD WERE $340 MILLION. DURING 2010, WE RECOGNIZED FIRST TIME IMPAIRMENTS OF $164 MILLION AND INCREMENTAL CHARGES ON PREVIOUSLY IMPAIRED SECURITIES OF $38 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDED $41 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT WERE

SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD.

DURING 2009, WE RECORDED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $1,078 MILLION, OF WHICH $753 MILLION WAS RECORDED THROUGH EARNINGS

($42 MILLION RELATES TO EQUITY SECURITIES), AND $325 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN AOCI.

DURING 2009, WE RECORDED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $1,078

MILLION, OF WHICH $33 MILLION WAS RECLASSIFIED TO RETAINED EARNINGS AT APRIL 1, 2009, AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO ASC 320. SUBSEQUENT TO APRIL 1, 2009, FIRST TIME AND INCREMENTAL CREDIT IMPAIRMENTS WERE $109 MILLION AND $257 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. PREVIOUS CREDIT IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO SECURITIES SOLD WERE $124 MILLION.

ALTHOUGH WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL ANY SPECIFIC SECURITIES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

MANAGING OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WE MAY SELL SECURITIES PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITIES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING DIVERSIFICATION, CREDIT QUALITY, YIELD AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND THE FUNDING OF CLAIMS AND OBLIGATIONS TO

POLICYHOLDERS. IN SOME OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES, WE MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PURCHASES AND SALES VOLUME PRINCIPALLY OF NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES. IN THESE SITUATIONS, FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE FOR THESE SECURITIES.

PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENT SECURITIES SALES AND EARLY REDEMPTIONS BY ISSUERS TOTALED $16,238 MILLION, $7,823 MILLION AND $3,942 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND

WE RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX LOSS ON TRADING SECURITIES OF $7 MILLION AND PRE-TAX GAINS OF $408 MILLION AND $108 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

INVESTMENTS IN RETAINED INTERESTS DECREASED $291 MILLION AND $113 MILLION DURING 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, WITH THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-16 & 17, WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY

TRANSFER BUT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE ORIGINATION PER ASC 310,

RECEIVABLES.

GECS FINANCING RECEIVABLES

INCLUDE BOTH LOANS AND FINANCING LEASES. LOANS REPRESENT TRANSACTIONS IN A VARIETY OF FORMS, INCLUDING REVOLVING CHARGE AND CREDIT, MORTGAGES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, INTERMEDIATE-TERM LOANS AND REVOLVING LOANS SECURED BY BUSINESS ASSETS. THE PORTFOLIO

INCLUDES LOANS CARRIED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT ON WHICH FINANCE CHARGES ARE BILLED PERIODICALLY, AND LOANS CARRIED AT GROSS BOOK VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES FINANCE CHARGES.

INVESTMENT IN FINANCING LEASES CONSISTS OF DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES OF AIRCRAFT, RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK, AUTOS, OTHER TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, COMMERCIAL

REAL ESTATE AND OTHER MANUFACTURING, POWER GENERATION, AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES.

FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THE LEVERAGED LEASES

AND THE MAJORITY OF THE DIRECT FINANCING LEASES ARE LEASES IN WHICH GECS DEPRECIATES THE LEASED ASSETS AND IS TAXED UPON THE ACCRUAL OF RENTAL INCOME. CERTAIN DIRECT FINANCING LEASES ARE LOANS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS,

GECS IS TAXABLE ONLY ON THE PORTION OF EACH PAYMENT THAT CONSTITUTES INTEREST, UNLESS THE INTEREST IS TAX-EXEMPT (E.G., CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS).

INVESTMENT IN DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES REPRESENTS NET UNPAID RENTALS AND ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED EQUIPMENT, LESS RELATED DEFERRED INCOME. GECS HAS NO GENERAL OBLIGATION FOR

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTING THIRD-PARTY PARTICIPATION RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES; SUCH NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES BUT HAVE BEEN OFFSET AGAINST THE RELATED RENTALS

RECEIVABLE. THE GECS SHARE OF RENTALS RECEIVABLE ON LEVERAGED LEASES IS SUBORDINATE TO THE SHARE OF OTHER PARTICIPANTS WHO ALSO HAVE SECURITY INTERESTS IN THE LEASED EQUIPMENT. FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, GECS IS ENTITLED TO DEDUCT THE INTEREST

EXPENSE ACCRUING ON NON-RECOURSE FINANCING RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UPON CLOSING AN ACQUISITION, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED AND CONSOLIDATE THE

ACQUISITION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. GIVEN THE TIME IT TAKES TO OBTAIN PERTINENT INFORMATION TO FINALIZE THE ACQUIRED COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET, THEN TO ADJUST THE ACQUIRED COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND BOOKS AND RECORDS TO

OUR STANDARDS, IT IS OFTEN SEVERAL QUARTERS BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO FINALIZE THOSE INITIAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY REVISED.

GOODWILL RELATED TO NEW ACQUISITIONS IN 2010 WAS $507 MILLION AND INCLUDED THE ACQUISITION OF CLARIENT, INC. ($425 MILLION) AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. GOODWILL

BALANCES DECREASED $603 MILLION DURING 2010, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF REGENCY ENERGY PARTNERS L.P. (REGENCY) AT GE CAPITAL ($557 MILLION) AND THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR ($260 MILLION).

GOODWILL RELATED TO NEW ACQUISITIONS IN 2009 WAS $3,418 MILLION AND INCLUDED ACQUISITIONS OF INTERBANCA S.P.A. ($1,394 MILLION) AND BAC ($1,083 MILLION) AT GE

CAPITAL AND AIRFOILS TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL  SINGAPORE PTE. LTD. (ATI-SINGAPORE) ($342 MILLION) AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. DURING 2009, THE GOODWILL BALANCE INCREASED BY $128 MILLION RELATED TO ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR

PRIOR-YEAR ACQUISITIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS WAS AN INCREASE OF $180 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2008 ACQUISITION OF CITICAPITAL AT GE CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $141 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2008 ACQUISITION

OF HYDRIL PRESSURE CONTROL BY ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. ALSO DURING 2009, GOODWILL BALANCES DECREASED $20,094 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF NBCU AND OUR SECURITY BUSINESS BEING CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE ($19,001 MILLION) AND ($1,077 MILLION),

RESPECTIVELY, BY THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PENSKE TRUCK LEASING CO., L.P. (PTL) ($634 MILLION) AT GE CAPITAL AND THE DISPOSITION OF 81% OF GE HOMELAND PROTECTION, INC. ($423 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR ($1,666 MILLION).

ON MAY 26, 2010, WE SOLD OUR GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN REGENCY, A MIDSTREAM NATURAL GAS SERVICES PROVIDER, AND RETAINED A 21% LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP INTEREST. THIS RESULTED IN THE DECONSOLIDATION OF REGENCY AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST TO FAIR VALUE. WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $119 MILLION, WHICH IS REPORTED IN GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES.

ON JUNE 25, 2009, WE INCREASED OUR OWNERSHIP IN BAC FROM 49.99% TO 75% FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $623 MILLION FOLLOWING THE TERMS OF OUR 2006 INVESTMENT

AGREEMENT (BAC INVESTMENT AGREEMENT) WITH THE THEN CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER. AT THAT TIME, WE REMEASURED OUR PREVIOUSLY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENT TO FAIR VALUE, RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $343 MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION REQUIRED US TO CONSOLIDATE

BAC, WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR STATED PLAN TO REDUCE GE CAPITAL ENDING NET INVESTMENT, WE

EXITED THIS BUSINESS DURING 2010, AND COMPLETED THE SALE OF BAC FOR $1,920 MILLION IN DECEMBER 2010. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE BAC INVESTMENT AGREEMENT AND PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE SALE, WE ACQUIRED THE REMAINING 25% INTEREST IN BAC FOR A

PURCHASE PRICE OF $633 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF OUR 100% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN BAC, WE RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $780 MILLION IN 2010, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. GOODWILL RELATED TO NEW ACQUISITIONS IN 2009

INCLUDES $1,083 MILLION RELATED TO BAC, WHICH REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL INITIALLY RECORDED IN 2009 UPON BAC CONSOLIDATION ($1,605 MILLION), AND THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL RECLASSIFIED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS BASED ON A

RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION ($522 MILLION), AS REQUIRED UNDER ASC 350-20-35.

ON MARCH 20, 2009, WE INCREASED OUR OWNERSHIP IN ATI-SINGAPORE

FROM 49% TO 100% AND CONCURRENTLY ACQUIRED FROM THE SAME SELLER A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN CERTAIN AFFILIATES. WE REMEASURED OUR PREVIOUS EQUITY INTERESTS TO FAIR VALUE, RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $254 MILLION, WHICH IS REPORTED IN

OTHER INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND MORE FREQUENTLY IF CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUES FOR

EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING AN INCOME APPROACH. WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, WE USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW RESULTS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE INCOME APPROACH, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT

VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED RATE. WE USE OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM FUTURE GROWTH RATES BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT VIEWS OF THE

LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EACH BUSINESS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ASSUMED IN OUR FORECASTS. WE DERIVE OUR DISCOUNT RATES USING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND ANALYZING PUBLISHED RATES FOR INDUSTRIES RELEVANT TO OUR REPORTING UNITS TO

ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING. WE USE DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND IN OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORECASTS. DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR REPORTING UNIT VALUATIONS

RANGED FROM 9% TO 14.5%. VALUATIONS USING THE MARKET APPROACH REFLECT PRICES AND OTHER RELEVANT OBSERVABLE INFORMATION GENERATED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING COMPARABLE BUSINESSES.

COMPARED TO THE MARKET APPROACH, THE INCOME APPROACH MORE CLOSELY ALIGNS EACH REPORTING UNIT VALUATION TO OUR BUSINESS PROFILE, INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS SERVED AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS. REQUIRED RATES OF RETURN,

ALONG WITH UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ARE REFLECTED IN THE SELECTION OF THE DISCOUNT RATE. EQUALLY IMPORTANT, UNDER THIS APPROACH, REASONABLY LIKELY SCENARIOS AND ASSOCIATED SENSITIVITIES CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE STATES THAT MAY NOT BE REFLECTED IN AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE. A MARKET APPROACH ALLOWS FOR COMPARISON TO ACTUAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND MULTIPLES. IT CAN BE SOMEWHAT MORE LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATION BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF

POTENTIAL COMPARABLES IS OFTEN LIMITED TO PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES WHERE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPARATIVE BUSINESS AND OURS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT, MARKET DATA IS USUALLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR DIVISIONS WITHIN LARGER CONGLOMERATES OR

NON-PUBLIC SUBSIDIARIES THAT COULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY AS COMPARABLE, AND THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING A MARKET TRANSACTION (E.G., SYNERGIES BETWEEN THE PARTIES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TRANSACTION, ETC.) MAY BE DIFFERENT OR IRRELEVANT

WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS. IT CAN ALSO BE DIFFICULT, UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, TO IDENTIFY ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES. WE ASSESS THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY BASED UPON THE RELEVANCE AND

AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA AT THE TIME WE PERFORM THE VALUATION AND WEIGHT THE METHODOLOGIES APPROPRIATELY.

WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF

GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IN THE THIRD QUARTER USING DATA AS OF JULY 1, 2010. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: IN STEP ONE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS FAIR VALUE; IN STEP TWO, WHICH IS

APPLIED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS DERIVED BY DEDUCTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS EQUITY, AND COMPARING THAT

AMOUNT WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. IN PERFORMING THE VALUATIONS, WE USED CASH FLOWS THAT REFLECTED MANAGEMENTS FORECASTS AND DISCOUNT RATES THAT INCLUDED RISK ADJUSTMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. BASED ON THE

RESULTS OF OUR STEP ONE TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH OF THE GE INDUSTRIAL REPORTING UNITS AND THE CLL, CONSUMER, ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GECAS REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT

TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED AND NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT HAD A GOODWILL BALANCE OF $1,089

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. AS OF JULY 1, 2010, THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT BY APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT IS BASED ON

A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND INVESTMENT, INCLUDING LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE EXISTING FINANCE RECEIVABLE AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, NEW DEBT ORIGINATION VOLUME AND MARGINS, AND ANTICIPATED STABILIZATION OF THE REAL

ESTATE MARKET ALLOWING FOR SALES OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AT NORMALIZED MARGINS. OUR ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WAS 12% AND WAS DERIVED BY APPLYING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND CORROBORATED USING EQUITY ANALYST RESEARCH REPORTS AND IMPLIED COST OF

EQUITY BASED ON FORECASTED PRICE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE MULTIPLES FOR SIMILAR COMPANIES. GIVEN THE VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE CURRENT COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS BASED. DIFFERENT LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO, CHANGES IN THE NEW DEBT ORIGINATION VOLUME AND MARGIN ASSUMPTIONS, CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED PACE OF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET RECOVERY, OR CHANGES IN THE

EQUITY RETURN EXPECTATION OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT.

(130)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE STEP ONE TESTING, WE PERFORMED THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST DESCRIBED ABOVE.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS FOR THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT, THE ESTIMATED IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL BY APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION. ACCORDINGLY, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS

REQUIRED. IN THE SECOND STEP, UNREALIZED LOSSES IN AN ENTITYS ASSETS HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE ESTIMATED IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. THE PRIMARY DRIVER

WAS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH APPROXIMATED $6.3 BILLION AT THAT TIME. OTHER DRIVERS FOR THE FAVORABLE OUTCOME INCLUDE THE UNREALIZED LOSSES IN THE REAL ESTATE FINANCE

RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND THE FAIR VALUE PREMIUM ON THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT ALLOCATED DEBT. THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND STEP ANALYSIS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THESE MEASUREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE REPORTING UNIT.

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS THAT

ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. IF CURRENT CONDITIONS PERSIST LONGER OR DETERIORATE FURTHER THAN EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

RECEIVABLES ON OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, AND AMOUNTED TO $1,284 MILLION AND $1,188 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

WE RECOGNIZE REINSURANCE RECOVERIES AS A REDUCTION OF THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS CAPTION INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LOSSES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS. REINSURANCE RECOVERIES WERE $174 MILLION,

$219 MILLION AND $221 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 12. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION BENEFITS

WE SPONSOR A NUMBER OF PENSION PLANS. PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, TOGETHER WITH AFFILIATE AND

CERTAIN OTHER PENSION PLANS (OTHER PENSION PLANS) DETAILED IN THIS NOTE, REPRESENT ABOUT 99% OF OUR TOTAL PENSION ASSETS. WE USE A DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR OUR PLANS.

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS

ARE THE GE PENSION PLAN AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN.

THE GE PENSION PLAN

PROVIDES BENEFITS TO CERTAIN U.S. EMPLOYEES BASED ON THE GREATER OF A FORMULA RECOGNIZING CAREER EARNINGS OR A FORMULA RECOGNIZING LENGTH OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE EARNINGS. CERTAIN BENEFIT PROVISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO COMMENCE SERVICE ON OR AFTER THAT DATE, WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GE PENSION PLAN, BUT WILL PARTICIPATE IN A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLAN.

THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTARY RETIREMENT BENEFITS PRIMARILY TO HIGHER-LEVEL, LONGER-SERVICE U.S. EMPLOYEES.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION

PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL BENEFIT PLANS ASSETS, WE EVALUATE

GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AS WELL AS KEY ELEMENTS OF ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, YIELDS AND SPREADS. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE, PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET

ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE ASSUMED AN 8.0% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2011. THIS IS A REDUCTION FROM THE 8.5% WE HAD ASSUMED IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008. FOR THE PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, WE APPLY OUR EXPECTED RATE OF

RETURN TO A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS, WHICH STABILIZES VARIABILITY IN THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH WE APPLY THAT EXPECTED RETURN.

WE AMORTIZE EXPERIENCE

GAINS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PLAN PROVISIONS OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES.

FUNDING POLICY

FOR THE GE PENSION PLAN IS TO CONTRIBUTE AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

AS SET FORTH IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND TAX LAWS PLUS SUCH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS AS WE MAY DETERMINE TO BE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE NOT MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN SINCE 1987 AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2011. IN 2011, WE EXPECT

TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS UNDER OUR GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AND EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION TO OTHER PENSION PLANS. IN 2010,

COMPARATIVE AMOUNTS WERE $183 MILLION AND $573 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES. ACCUMULATED AND

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (ABO AND PBO) REPRESENT THE OBLIGATIONS OF A PENSION PLAN FOR PAST SERVICE AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. ABO IS THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS EARNED TO DATE WITH BENEFITS COMPUTED BASED ON CURRENT COMPENSATION LEVELS. PBO

ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES AND SETTING LONG-TERM STRATEGIC TARGETS. LONG-TERM STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES INCLUDE PRESERVING THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN AND BALANCING RISK AND RETURN. TARGET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES ARE ESTABLISHED AT AN ASSET

CLASS LEVEL BY PLAN FIDUCIARIES. TARGET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE GUIDELINES, NOT LIMITATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PLAN FIDUCIARIES WILL APPROVE ALLOCATIONS ABOVE OR BELOW A TARGET RANGE.

GE PENSION TRUST ASSETS ARE INVESTED SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES.



SHORT-TERM SECURITIES MUST GENERALLY BE RATED A1/P1 OR BETTER, EXCEPT FOR 15% OF SUCH SECURITIES THAT MAY BE RATED A2/P2 AND OTHER SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AS MAY

BE APPROVED BY THE PLAN FIDUCIARIES.



REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT EXCEED 25% OF TOTAL ASSETS.



INVESTMENTS IN RESTRICTED SECURITIES (EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS) THAT ARE NOT FREELY TRADABLE MAY NOT EXCEED 30% OF TOTAL ASSETS (ACTUAL WAS 18% OF TRUST

ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010).

ACCORDING TO STATUTE, THE AGGREGATE HOLDINGS OF ALL QUALIFYING EMPLOYER SECURITIES (E.G., GE

COMMON STOCK) AND QUALIFYING EMPLOYER REAL PROPERTY MAY NOT EXCEED 10% OF THE FAIR VALUE OF TRUST ASSETS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. GE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 3.6% AND 3.3% OF TRUST ASSETS AT YEAR-END 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

TO

DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON RETIREE LIFE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE RETURN

EXPECTATIONS FOR RETIREE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS, WE EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AS WELL AS KEY ELEMENTS OF ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, YIELDS AND SPREADS. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE,

PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE ASSUMED AN 8.0% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2011. THIS IS A REDUCTION FROM THE 8.5% WE HAD ASSUMED IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008. WE APPLY

OUR EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN TO A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS, WHICH STABILIZES VARIABILITY IN THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH WE APPLY THAT EXPECTED RETURN.

WE

AMORTIZE EXPERIENCE GAINS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PLAN PROVISIONS OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES.

FUNDING POLICY.

WE FUND RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $660 MILLION IN 2011 TO FUND SUCH BENEFITS. WE FUND RETIREE LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS AT OUR

DISCRETION.

NOTE 13. ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES LIABILITIES FOR VARIOUS ITEMS INCLUDING NON-CURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, DEFERRED INCOME, INTEREST ON TAX LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS.

ACCRUALS FOR NON-CURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

AMOUNTED TO $25,356 MILLION AND $24,921 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, PENSION ACCRUALS, AND OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT ACCRUALS SUCH AS DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS

EXCLUDE POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND, WHEN DATES AND AMOUNTS OF SUCH COSTS ARE NOT KNOWN, ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW END OF SUCH RANGE.

IN 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENT FROM THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER.

THE CONSENT DECREE PROVIDED THAT THE DREDGING WOULD BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES. PHASE 1 WAS COMPLETED IN MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009. BETWEEN PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 THERE WAS AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF NATIONAL EXPERTS. THE

PANEL EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF PHASE 1 DREDGING OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO PHASE 1 ENGINEERING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE STANDARDS. ON DECEMBER 17, 2010, EPA ISSUED ITS DECISIONS SETTING FORTH THE FINAL

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR PHASE 2 OF THE DREDGING PROJECT, INCORPORATING ASPECTS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW PANEL AND FROM GE. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE AGREED WITH EPA TO PERFORM PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS SET BY EPA. WE HAVE REVIEWED EPAS FINAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR PHASE 2 TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL SCOPE AND DURATION OF PHASE 2, AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL AND ENGINEERING CHANGES THAT COULD BE REQUIRED. BASED ON THIS

REVIEW AND OUR BEST PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING JUDGMENT, WE INCREASED OUR RESERVE FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS FOR COMPLETING THE HUDSON RIVER DREDGING PROJECT BY $845 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010.

UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE STATUS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SITES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF

THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION EXPOSURE; THESE COSTS COULD DIFFER FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES. TOTAL RESERVES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, INCLUDING ASBESTOS CLAIMS, WERE $3,510 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GE AND GECS FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THIS ENABLES GE TO USE GECS TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS

TO REDUCE THE TAX THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE BY GE. THE GECS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR EACH PERIOD REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF THESE TAX REDUCTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED RETURN. GE MAKES CASH PAYMENTS TO GECS FOR THESE TAX REDUCTIONS AT THE TIME

GES TAX PAYMENTS ARE DUE. THE EFFECT OF GECS ON THE AMOUNT OF THE CONSOLIDATED TAX LIABILITY FROM THE FORMATION OF THE NBCU JOINT VENTURE WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH WHEN IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE LIABILITY OF THE GROUP ABSENT THE TAX ON

FORMATION.

CONSOLIDATED U.S. EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES WERE $5,078 MILLION IN 2010, $(212) MILLION IN 2009 AND

$2,956 MILLION IN 2008. THE CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS FOR NON-U.S.-BASED OPERATIONS WERE $9,130 MILLION IN 2010, $10,207 MILLION IN 2009 AND $16,814 MILLION IN 2008.

CONSOLIDATED CURRENT TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES OF A BENEFIT OF $3,253 MILLION, $833 MILLION AND $651 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE BENEFIT

FROM GECS DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS IN EXCESS OF GES CURRENT U.S. TAX EXPENSE. CONSOLIDATED CURRENT TAX EXPENSE AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS WERE $3,258 MILLION, $2,385 MILLION AND $3,027 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. CONSOLIDATED DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES WERE AN EXPENSE OF $2,099 MILLION IN 2010 AND A BENEFIT OF $2,501 MILLION AND $836 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS OF A BENEFIT OF $1,167 MILLION, $264 MILLION AND $499 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES REFLECT

THE EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES, AS WELL AS FROM NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, AND ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN TAXES

ARE ACTUALLY PAID OR RECOVERED. DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE

ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A

DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S.

FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR TAX LIABILITY, RETURN ON INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GES EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE

BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN

ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH FOREIGN

BANKS AND OTHER FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, WHICH EXPIRES AT THE END OF 2011, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS ON SIX PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN DECEMBER OF 2010, BUT THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THE PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2011, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2012.

WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S. DEFERRED TAXES ON CUMULATIVE EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, WERE APPROXIMATELY $94 BILLION. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S.

FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED

COMPANIES WHEN WE PLAN TO REMIT THOSE EARNINGS.

(148)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2009, FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN OUR EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS, FUNDING ACTIONS TAKEN AND REVIEW OF OUR OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING, WE DETERMINED THAT UNDISTRIBUTED PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF GECS, ON WHICH WE HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. TAXES, WOULD BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE AMOUNT

OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION, RESULTING IN AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $700 MILLION IN 2009.

DURING 2008, BECAUSE THE USE OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS NO LONGER REQUIRED THE REPATRIATION OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS, WE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS THAT

WERE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, RESULTING IN AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $350 MILLION.

ANNUALLY, WE FILE OVER

6,400 INCOME TAX RETURNS IN OVER 250 GLOBAL TAXING JURISDICTIONS. WE ARE UNDER EXAMINATION OR ENGAGED IN TAX LITIGATION IN MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS. DURING 2010, THE IRS COMPLETED THE AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR

2003-2005. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE IRS WAS AUDITING OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2006-2007. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER U.S. TAX DEFICIENCY ISSUES AND REFUND CLAIMS FOR PREVIOUS YEARS WERE UNRESOLVED. THE IRS HAS DISALLOWED THE

TAX LOSS ON OUR 2003 DISPOSITION OF ERC LIFE REINSURANCE CORPORATION. WE EXPECT TO CONTEST THE DISALLOWANCE OF THIS LOSS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE 2006-2007 U.S. AUDIT CYCLE WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD RESULT

IN A DECREASE IN OUR BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS  THAT IS, THE AGGREGATE TAX EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TAX RETURN POSITIONS AND THE BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE OUTCOME OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES OR CLAIMS IS LIKELY TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MADE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES.

RESOLUTION OF AUDIT MATTERS, INCLUDING THE IRS AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2003-2005, REDUCED OUR 2010 CONSOLIDATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 5.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

THE BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, THE AMOUNT OF RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES WE HAVE PROVIDED AND WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WERE.

WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT AT THE DATE OF GRANT USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $4.11, $3.81 AND $5.26, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN ARRIVING AT THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES OF 2.9%, 3.2% AND 3.4%; DIVIDEND YIELDS OF 3.9%, 3.9% AND 4.4%; EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF 35%, 49% AND 27%; AND EXPECTED LIVES OF SIX YEARS AND ELEVEN MONTHS, SIX YEARS AND TEN MONTHS, AND SIX YEARS AND NINE MONTHS. RISK-FREE

INTEREST RATES REFLECT THE YIELD ON ZERO-COUPON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELDS PRESUME A SET DIVIDEND RATE. FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2010, 2009 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE USED A HISTORICAL FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE FOR THE

DIVIDEND YIELD. EXPECTED VOLATILITIES ARE BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITIES FROM TRADED OPTIONS AND HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK. THE EXPECTED OPTION LIVES ARE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF EMPLOYEE EXERCISE BEHAVIOR.

THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008 AMOUNTED TO $23 MILLION, AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AND $45 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE WAS $697 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO NONVESTED OPTIONS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF TWO YEARS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $236 MILLION, PRE TAX, IS

EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 2011.

STOCK OPTION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS AMOUNTED TO $178 MILLION IN 2010, $120 MILLION IN 2009 AND $69

MILLION IN 2008. CASH RECEIVED FROM OPTION EXERCISES DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $37 MILLION, AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AND $353 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $7 MILLION,

COMPENSATION COST WERE OUTSTANDING. OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND PSUS RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS AMOUNTED TO $116 MILLION, $127 MILLION AND $155 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE TOTAL INCOME TAX BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR ALL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AMOUNTED TO $143 MILLION, $118 MILLION AND $106 MILLION IN 2010,

2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

WHEN STOCK OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND RESTRICTED STOCK VESTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSUMED TAX BENEFIT AND THE ACTUAL

TAX BENEFIT MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT IS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED TAX BENEFIT, THAT DIFFERENCE IS RECORDED IN EQUITY, TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX

BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ANY FUTURE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED TAX BENEFITS FOR ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, OUR UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS THAT CONTAIN NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND

EQUIVALENTS ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND, THEREFORE, ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE PURSUANT TO THE TWO-CLASS METHOD. APPLICATION OF THIS TREATMENT HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT.

(A)

INCLUDED AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS PRESENTED.

(B)

INCLUDED AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT RELATED TO ACCRETION OF REDEEMABLE SECURITIES IN 2010 AND 2009.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 344 MILLION, 328 MILLION AND 204 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUTSTANDING STOCK AWARDS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE

COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE THEIR EFFECT WAS ANTIDILUTIVE.

EARNINGS-PER-SHARE AMOUNTS ARE COMPUTED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EARNINGS

FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET EARNINGS. AS A RESULT, THE SUM OF PER-SHARE AMOUNTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MAY NOT EQUAL THE TOTAL PER-SHARE AMOUNTS FOR NET EARNINGS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

AS A MATTER OF POLICY, WE USE DERIVATIVES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, AND WE DO NOT

USE DERIVATIVES FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. A KEY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE FOR OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES IS TO MITIGATE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK BY SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEBT MATCH THE ASSETS THEY ARE

FUNDING. IF THE FORM (FIXED VERSUS FLOATING) AND CURRENCY DENOMINATION OF THE DEBT WE ISSUE DO NOT MATCH THE RELATED ASSETS, WE TYPICALLY EXECUTE DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE NATURE AND TENOR OF FUNDING TO MEET THIS OBJECTIVE. THE DETERMINATION OF

WHETHER WE ENTER INTO A DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION OR ISSUE DEBT DIRECTLY TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET RELATED FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE TYPE OF DEBT WE CAN ISSUE.

(166)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE BASIS UPON WHICH INTEREST AND OTHER PAYMENTS ARE CALCULATED

AND ARE REPORTED GROSS, EXCEPT FOR OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE EXECUTED IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR CURRENCY RISK OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. OF THE OUTSTANDING NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $347,000 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY

86% OR $300,000 MILLION, IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY OR MARKET RISK BETWEEN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. THE REMAINING DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATE TO

HEDGING AGAINST ADVERSE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES RELATED TO ANTICIPATED SALES AND PURCHASES AND CONTRACTS CONTAINING CERTAIN CLAUSES WHICH MEET THE ACCOUNTING DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE. THE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THESE

ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN PRACTICABLE. WHEN WE ARE NOT ABLE TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, OR WHEN THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE BOTH RECORDED IN EARNINGS CURRENTLY, THE DERIVATIVES ARE DEEMED ECONOMIC HEDGES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING

IS NOT APPLIED. THIS MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURS WHEN WE HEDGE A RECOGNIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION (E.G., A RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE) WITH A DERIVATIVE. SINCE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES ARE REFLECTED CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS FOR BOTH THE

DERIVATIVE AND THE TRANSACTION, THE ECONOMIC HEDGE DOES NOT REQUIRE HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF

OUR DERIVATIVES, BY CONTRACT TYPE, SEPARATING THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

WE USE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON LOCAL AND NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIXED-RATE DEBT. FOR RELATIONSHIPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

THE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS WITHIN INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES, ALONG WITH OFFSETTING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED DEBT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF OUR FAIR VALUE

CASH FLOW HEDGES

WE USE INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS

AND COMMERCIAL PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING COMMODITIES. FOR DERIVATIVES THAT ARE DESIGNATED IN A CASH FLOW HEDGING RELATIONSHIP, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF AOCI AND

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS CONTEMPORANEOUSLY AND IN THE SAME CAPTION WITH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.

WE EXPECT TO TRANSFER $(1,004) MILLION TO EARNINGS AS AN EXPENSE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. IN 2010, WE RECOGNIZED INSIGNIFICANT GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGED

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT DID NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE MAXIMUM TERM OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS WAS 25 YEARS AND 26

YEARS, RESPECTIVELY, AND RELATED TO HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL DEBT.

FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE AMOUNT OF

INEFFECTIVENESS IN THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AND AMOUNT OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF INEFFECTIVENESS ARE BOTH REFLECTED IN EARNINGS EACH REPORTING PERIOD. THESE AMOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE USE CURRENCY EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES TO PROTECT OUR NET INVESTMENTS IN GLOBAL OPERATIONS CONDUCTED IN NON-U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCIES. FOR DERIVATIVES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN

OPERATION, WE ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON CHANGES IN SPOT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. CHANGES IN SPOT RATES ON THE DERIVATIVE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF AOCI UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE FOREIGN ENTITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED OR SOLD. THE CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD POINTS, WHICH REFLECTS THE INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES ON THE DERIVATIVE, IS EXCLUDED FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN AOCI FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, AS WELL AS THE GAIN (LOSS) RECORDED IN GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES WHEN RECLASSIFIED

FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE

RECORDED IN EARNINGS EACH PERIOD. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THESE DERIVATIVES ARE TYPICALLY ENTERED INTO AS ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY PRICES AND OTHER RISKS. GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE

ARE TYPICALLY RECORDED IN GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES OR OTHER INCOME, BASED ON OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY. IN GENERAL, THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE ITEM THAT REPRESENT THE ECONOMIC RISK EXPOSURE ARE RECORDED IN THE SAME CAPTION AS THE DERIVATIVE. LOSSES

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 ON DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WERE $(302) MILLION COMPRISED OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS OF $185 MILLION, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF $(666) MILLION, AND OTHER DERIVATIVES OF

$179 MILLION. THESE LOSSES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE EARNINGS EFFECTS FROM THE UNDERLYING ITEMS THAT WERE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED. GAINS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ON DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE

OFFSETTING EARNINGS EFFECTS FROM THE ITEM REPRESENTING THE ECONOMIC RISK EXPOSURE, WERE $1,021 MILLION COMPRISED OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS OF $211 MILLION, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF $499 MILLION, AND OTHER DERIVATIVES OF

$311 MILLION.

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

FAIR

VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN OUR POSITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE EXPOSURES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE. WE

MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL DEFAULT AND NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF OUR STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS) ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS. WHERE WE HAVE AGREED TO NETTING OF DERIVATIVE

EXPOSURES WITH A COUNTERPARTY, WE OFFSET OUR EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND APPLY THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED TO US TO DETERMINE THE EXPOSURE. WHEN NET EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY, BASED ON THE CURRENT MARKET VALUES OF AGREEMENTS AND

COLLATERAL, EXCEEDS CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS (SEE FOLLOWING TABLE), WE TYPICALLY TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE SUCH EXPOSURES. THESE ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PROHIBITING ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, REQUIRING ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM THE

COUNTERPARTY (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND TERMINATING OR RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS.

(169)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN CERTAIN OF OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE COUNTERPARTIES TO POST

COLLATERAL (TYPICALLY, CASH OR U.S. TREASURIES) WHEN OUR RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE COUNTERPARTY, MEASURED AT CURRENT MARKET VALUE, EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED LIMIT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING INTEREST DUE, NET OF

COLLATERAL WE HOLD, WAS $1,232 MILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH COLLATERAL WAS $7,689 MILLION, OF WHICH $2,112 MILLION WAS CASH AND $5,577 MILLION WAS IN THE FORM OF SECURITIES HELD BY A CUSTODIAN FOR OUR BENEFIT. UNDER CERTAIN OF THESE SAME

AGREEMENTS, WE POST COLLATERAL TO OUR COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR DERIVATIVE OBLIGATIONS, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH WAS $1,528 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3. IN CERTAIN OF THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS, EACH PARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE

SHORT-TERM RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. THE NET AMOUNT RELATING TO OUR DERIVATIVE LIABILITY OF $2,799 MILLION SUBJECT TO THESE PROVISIONS, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY US, AND OUTSTANDING INTEREST PAYMENTS,

NOTE 23. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

PURSUANT TO NEW DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY ASC 310-10, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILED INFORMATION

ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR COMMERCIAL, REAL ESTATE AND CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIOS. FOR EACH PORTFOLIO, WE DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT COLLATERAL, PAYMENT PERFORMANCE,

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, AND IMPAIRMENT. WHILE WE PROVIDE DATA ON SELECTED CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 310-10, WE MANAGE THESE PORTFOLIOS USING DELINQUENCY AND NONEARNING DATA AS KEY

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. THE CATEGORIES USED WITHIN THIS SECTION SUCH AS IMPAIRED LOANS, TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING AND NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE DEFINED BY THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE AND WE BASE OUR CATEGORIZATION ON THE RELATED SCOPE

AND DEFINITIONS CONTAINED IN THE RELATED STANDARDS. THE CATEGORIES OF NONEARNING AND DELINQUENT ARE DEFINED BY US AND ARE USED IN OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING OUR FINANCING RECEIVABLES. DEFINITIONS OF THESE CATEGORIES ARE PROVIDED BELOW.

IMPAIRED LOANS

ARE LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO

ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

ARE THOSE LOANS FOR WHICH WE HAVE GRANTED A CONCESSION TO A

BORROWER EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES WHERE WE DO NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION. SUCH LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED, AND ARE INDIVIDUALLY REVIEWED FOR SPECIFIC RESERVES.

NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES

ARE THOSE ON WHICH WE HAVE STOPPED ACCRUING INTEREST. WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT

BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. ALTHOUGH WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST IN ADVANCE OF PAYMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST INCOME AS CASH IS COLLECTED WHEN APPROPRIATE PROVIDED THE AMOUNT DOES NOT EXCEED THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EARNED AT THE HISTORICAL EFFECTIVE

INTEREST RATE.

NONEARNING FINANCING RECEIVABLES

ARE A SUBSET OF NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES FOR WHICH CASH PAYMENTS ARE NOT BEING RECEIVED

OR FOR WHICH WE ARE ON THE COST RECOVERY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING (I.E., ANY PAYMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF PRINCIPAL). THIS CATEGORY EXCLUDES LOANS PURCHASED AT A DISCOUNT (UNLESS THEY HAVE DETERIORATED POST ACQUISITION).

DELINQUENT FINANCING RECEIVABLES

ARE THOSE THAT ARE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

THE SAME FINANCING RECEIVABLE MAY MEET MORE THAN ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS ABOVE. ACCORDINGLY, THESE CATEGORIES ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A

PARTICULAR LOAN TO MEET THE DEFINITIONS OF A TDR, IMPAIRED LOAN, NONACCRUAL LOAN AND NONEARNING LOAN AND BE INCLUDED IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW. THE CATEGORIZATION OF A PARTICULAR LOAN ALSO MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE

POTENTIAL FOR LOSS.

COMMERCIAL

SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO COMPRISES SECURED COLLATERAL POSITIONS. CLL PRODUCTS INCLUDE LOANS AND LEASES COLLATERALIZED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF EQUIPMENT TYPES, CASH FLOW LOANS, ASSET-BACKED LOANS AND FACTORING ARRANGEMENTS. OUR LOANS AND LEASES

ARE SECURED BY ASSETS SUCH AS HEAVY MACHINERY, VEHICLES, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, AND OFFICE IMAGING EQUIPMENT. CASH FLOW FINANCING IS SECURED BY OUR ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OF THE BORROWER AND THE ASSET-BACKED LOANS

AND FACTORING ARRANGEMENTS ARE SECURED BY CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, AND/OR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. THE PORTFOLIOS IN OUR ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GECAS BUSINESSES ARE PRIMARILY COLLATERALIZED BY ENERGY GENERATING ASSETS AND

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, RESPECTIVELY. OUR SENIOR SECURED POSITION AND RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE PROVIDE LOSS MITIGATION AGAINST BORROWERS WITH WEAK CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO IS SECURED LENDING AND WE ASSESS THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO BASED ON THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS MEASURE. THE METRIC INCORPORATES BOTH

THE BORROWERS CREDIT QUALITY ALONG WITH ANY RELATED COLLATERAL PROTECTION.

OUR INTERNAL RISK RATINGS PROCESS IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF

INFORMATION IN DETERMINING OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AND REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE, STATISTICALLY VALIDATED APPROACH TO EVALUATE RISK IN OUR FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIOS. IN DERIVING OUR INTERNAL RISK RATINGS, WE STRATIFY OUR COMMERCIAL

PORTFOLIOS INTO TWENTY-ONE CATEGORIES OF DEFAULT RISK AND/OR SIX CATEGORIES OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT TO GROUP INTO THREE CATEGORIES: A, B AND C. OUR PROCESS STARTS BY DEVELOPING AN INTERNAL RISK RATING FOR OUR BORROWERS, WHICH ARE BASED UPON OUR

PROPRIETARY MODELS USING DATA DERIVED FROM BORROWER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AGENCY RATINGS, PAYMENT HISTORY INFORMATION, EQUITY PRICES AND OTHER COMMERCIAL BORROWER CHARACTERISTICS. WE THEN EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS FOR THE SPECIFIC LENDING

TRANSACTION IN THE EVENT OF BORROWER DEFAULT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SUCH FACTORS AS APPLICABLE COLLATERAL VALUE, HISTORICAL LOSS AND RECOVERY RATES FOR SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS, AND OUR COLLECTION CAPABILITIES. OUR INTERNAL RISK RATINGS PROCESS AND

THE MODELS WE USE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR MONITORING AND VALIDATION CONTROLS. THE FREQUENCY OF RATING UPDATES IS SET BY OUR CREDIT RISK POLICY, WHICH REQUIRES ANNUAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL. THE MODELS ARE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND

STATISTICALLY VALIDATED ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT.

THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES OUR COMMERCIAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES BY RISK

CATEGORY. AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE ASSIGNED ONE OF TWENTY-ONE RISK RATINGS BASED ON OUR PROCESS AND THEN THESE ARE GROUPED BY SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS INTO THREE CATEGORIES IN THE TABLE BELOW. CATEGORY A IS CHARACTERIZED BY

EITHER HIGH CREDIT QUALITY BORROWERS OR TRANSACTIONS WITH SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL COVERAGE WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES OR ELIMINATES THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE EVENT OF BORROWER DEFAULT. CATEGORY B IS CHARACTERIZED BY BORROWERS WITH WEAKER CREDIT

QUALITY THAN THOSE IN CATEGORY A, OR TRANSACTIONS WITH MODERATELY STRONG COLLATERAL COVERAGE WHICH MINIMIZES BUT MAY NOT FULLY MITIGATE THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. CATEGORY C IS CHARACTERIZED BY BORROWERS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF DEFAULT

RISK RELATIVE TO OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO OR TRANSACTIONS WHERE COLLATERAL COVERAGE MAY NOT FULLY MITIGATE A LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT.

FOR OUR SECURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO, OUR COLLATERAL POSITION AND ABILITY TO WORK OUT PROBLEM ACCOUNTS MITIGATES OUR

LOSSES. OUR ASSET MANAGERS HAVE DEEP INDUSTRY EXPERTISE THAT ENABLES US TO IDENTIFY THE OPTIMUM APPROACH TO DEFAULT SITUATIONS. WE PRICE RISK PREMIUMS FOR WEAKER CREDITS AT ORIGINATION, CLOSELY MONITOR CHANGES IN CREDITWORTHINESS THROUGH OUR RISK

RATINGS AND WATCH LIST PROCESS, AND ARE ENGAGED EARLY WITH DETERIORATING CREDITS TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS. SECURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITHIN RISK CATEGORY C ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN OUR CLL BUSINESSES AND ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF SENIOR TERM

LENDING FACILITIES AND FACTORING PROGRAMS SECURED BY VARIOUS ASSET TYPES INCLUDING INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, EQUIPMENT AND RELATED BUSINESS FACILITIES AS WELL AS FRANCHISE FINANCE ACTIVITIES SECURED BY UNDERLYING EQUIPMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOANS WITHIN CATEGORY C ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED REGULARLY, AND CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY

WILL NOT PAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS. OUR INTERNAL RISK RATING PROCESS IDENTIFIES CREDITS WARRANTING CLOSER MONITORING; AND AS SUCH, THESE LOANS ARE NOT NECESSARILY CLASSIFIED AS NONEARNING OR IMPAIRED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR UNSECURED COMMERCIAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO OF $208 MILLION, $964 MILLION AND $783 MILLION WAS RATED A, B AND C,

RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR INTERBANCA S.P.A. AND GE SANYO CREDIT ACQUISITIONS IN EUROPE AND ASIA, RESPECTIVELY.

REAL ESTATE

OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY COMPRISES FIXED AND FLOATING LOANS SECURED BY COMMERCIAL REAL

ESTATE. OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO IS UNDERWRITTEN BASED ON THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY UNDERLYING INCOME-PRODUCING COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND SECURED BY FIRST MORTGAGES. OUR BUSINESS PROPERTIES PORTFOLIO IS UNDERWRITTEN PRIMARILY BY THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

THE BORROWER AND SECURED BY TENANT AND OWNER-OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES.

DUE TO THE PRIMARILY NON-RECOURSE NATURE OF OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS PROVIDE THE BEST INDICATORS OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. BY CONTRAST, THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE BUSINESS PROPERTIES

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE REAL ESTATE DEBT FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS GREATER THAN 95% ARE PAYING IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE LOANS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS

PROPERTIES FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDED IN CATEGORY C ARE IMPAIRED LOANS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE SPECIFIC RESERVE EVALUATION PROCESS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1. THE ULTIMATE RECOVERABILITY OF IMPAIRED LOANS IS DRIVEN BY COLLECTION STRATEGIES THAT DO NOT

NECESSARILY DEPEND ON THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND INCLUDE FULL OR PARTIAL REPAYMENTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REFINANCING AND RESTRUCTURINGS.

CONSUMER

OUR CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS LARGELY NON-U.S. AND

PRIMARILY COMPRISES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, SALES FINANCE, AND AUTO AND PERSONAL LOANS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN AND ASIAN COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR U.S. CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDED PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD AND SALES FINANCING

FOR OVER 51 MILLION CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE U.S. WITH NO METROPOLITAN AREA ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 6% OF THE PORTFOLIO. OF THE TOTAL U.S. CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES, APPROXIMATELY 63% RELATE TO CREDIT CARD LOANS, WHICH ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO

PROFIT AND LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RETAILER (WHICH ARE RECORDED IN REVENUES), AND THE REMAINING 37% ARE SALES FINANCE RECEIVABLES, WHICH PROVIDE FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS IN AREAS SUCH AS ELECTRONICS, RECREATION, MEDICAL AND HOME

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CONSUMER NONACCRUAL FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE SMALLER BALANCE

HOMOGENEOUS LOANS EVALUATED COLLECTIVELY, BY PORTFOLIO, FOR IMPAIRMENT AND THEREFORE ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT FOR IMPAIRED LOANS. ACCORDINGLY, IMPAIRED LOANS IN OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS REPRESENT RESTRUCTURED SMALLER BALANCE

HOMOGENEOUS LOANS MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A TDR, AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT FOR IMPAIRED LOANS, AND COMMERCIAL LOANS IN OUR CONSUMEROTHER PORTFOLIO. THE RECORDED INVESTMENT OF THESE IMPAIRED LOANS TOTALED $2,554

MILLION (WITH AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF $2,244 MILLION) AND COMPRISED $106 MILLION WITH NO SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, PRIMARILY ALL IN OUR CONSUMEROTHER PORTFOLIO, AND $2,448 MILLION WITH A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE OF $555 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

BUSINESS AND HAD AN UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND AVERAGE INVESTMENT OF $2,139 MILLION AND $1,771 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. WE RECOGNIZED $115 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRINCIPALLY

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS

OUR CONSUMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO COMPRISES BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED LENDING. SECURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES COMPRISE RESIDENTIAL LOANS AND LENDING TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES PREDOMINANTLY SECURED BY AUTO AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY FINANCE, AND CASH

FLOW LOANS. UNSECURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD FINANCING. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE CARDS ARE NOT FOR GENERAL USE AND ARE LIMITED TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD BY THE RETAILER. THE PRIVATE LABEL PORTFOLIO IS

DIVERSE WITH NO METROPOLITAN AREA ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 6% OF THE RELATED PORTFOLIO.

NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES

FOR OUR SECURED NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BOOK, WE ASSESS THE OVERALL CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO THROUGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS (THE RATIO OF THE OUTSTANDING

DEBT ON A PROPERTY TO THE VALUE OF THAT PROPERTY AT ORIGINATION). IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT AND REPOSSESSION OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMARKET AND SELL THE PROPERTIES TO ELIMINATE OR MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS. THE

FOR LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. FOR LOWER CREDIT SCORES, WE ADEQUATELY PRICE FOR THE INCREMENTAL RISK AT ORIGINATION AND MONITOR CREDIT MIGRATION THROUGH OUR RISK RATINGS PROCESS. WE CONTINUOUSLY ADJUST OUR CREDIT LINE UNDERWRITING MANAGEMENT AND

COLLECTION STRATEGIES BASED ON CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES. DURING 2008 THROUGH 2010, WE STRENGTHENED OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESSES BY ACTIVELY REDUCING CREDIT LINES AND APPROVAL RATES ALONG WITH INCREASING OUR COLLECTION EFFORTS TO

MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS IN THESE PORTFOLIOS AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN IMPROVEMENT IN NONEARNING ASSETS.

CONSUMEROTHER

SECURED LENDING IN CONSUMEROTHER COMPRISES LOANS TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES PREDOMINANTLY SECURED BY AUTO AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY

FINANCE, AND CASH FLOW LOANS. WE DEVELOP OUR INTERNAL RISK RATINGS FOR THIS PORTFOLIO IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE PROCESS USED TO DEVELOP OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE USE THE BORROWERS CREDIT QUALITY AND

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL STRENGTH TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, CONSUMEROTHER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES OF $6,417 MILLION, $822 MILLION AND $1,067 MILLION WERE RATED A, B, AND C, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

24. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

WE SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BEYOND IMPROVING

RETURNS, THESE TRANSACTIONS SERVE AS ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES FOR A VARIETY OF DIVERSIFIED LENDING AND SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE USED BOTH GE-SUPPORTED AND THIRD-PARTY VIES TO EXECUTE OFF-BALANCE SHEET SECURITIZATION

TRANSACTIONS FUNDED IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM MARKETS. THE LARGEST GROUP OF VIES THAT WE ARE INVOLVED WITH ARE FORMER QSPES, WHICH UNDER GUIDANCE IN EFFECT THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION STANDARDS

BASED ON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS. EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW, INVESTORS IN THESE ENTITIES ONLY HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE ENTITY AND NOT TO OUR GENERAL CREDIT. WE DO NOT HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY VIE. WE DID NOT PROVIDE

NON-CONTRACTUAL SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY TRANSFERRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES TO ANY VIE IN 2010 OR 2009.

ON JANUARY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED FASB ASU

2009-16 & 17, WHICH AMENDED ASC 860,

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING

, AND ASC 810,

CONSOLIDATION

, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMENDMENTS ELIMINATED THE SCOPE EXCEPTION FOR QSPES AND REQUIRED THAT ALL SUCH ENTITIES BE EVALUATED FOR

CONSOLIDATION AS VIES, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL OF OUR SPONSORED QSPES. AMONG OTHER CHANGES, THE AMENDMENTS TO ASC 810 REPLACED THE EXISTING QUANTITATIVE APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING THE PARTY THAT SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A VIE, WHICH WAS

BASED ON EXPOSURE TO A MAJORITY OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS, WITH A QUALITATIVE APPROACH, BASED ON DETERMINATION OF WHICH PARTY HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE MOST ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY. THE REVISED GUIDANCE WILL SOMETIMES

CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF ENTITIES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A VIE AND THE DETERMINATION ABOUT WHICH PARTY SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A VIE, AS WELL AS REQUIRING THE LATTER TO BE EVALUATED CONTINUOUSLY.

IN EVALUATING WHETHER WE HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT, AS DEFINED IN THE STANDARD, WE CONSIDER THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE VIE WAS CREATED, THE IMPORTANCE OF EACH OF THE

ACTIVITIES IN WHICH IT IS ENGAGED AND OUR DECISION-MAKING ROLE, IF ANY, IN THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DETERMINE THE ENTITYS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO OTHER ECONOMIC INTEREST HOLDERS. THIS EVALUATION REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF

ALL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELEVANT TO DECISION-MAKING THAT AFFECTS THE ENTITYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND THE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN DECIDING WHICH DECISION-MAKING RIGHTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT.

IN DETERMINING WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS OR THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE, WE EVALUATE ALL

OF OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE ENTITY, REGARDLESS OF FORM (DEBT, EQUITY, MANAGEMENT AND SERVICING FEES, AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS). THIS EVALUATION CONSIDERS ALL RELEVANT FACTORS OF THE ENTITYS DESIGN, INCLUDING: THE ENTITYS

CAPITAL STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO EARNINGS (LOSSES), SUBORDINATION OF OUR INTERESTS RELATIVE TO THOSE OF OTHER INVESTORS, CONTINGENT PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE POTENTIAL TO BE ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE

EVALUATION OF EACH OF THESE FACTORS IN REACHING A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IS A MATTER THAT REQUIRES THE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2010 AND SUBSEQUENTLY, WE EVALUATED ALL ENTITIES THAT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AMENDED ASC 810 TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE WERE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE OR DECONSOLIDATE THEM BASED ON THE

APPROACH DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN ADDITION TO THE SECURITIZATION QSPES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE WERE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE ASSETS OF VIES RELATED TO DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT HOLD LOANS AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, A MEDIA JOINT VENTURE AND A

SMALL NUMBER OF COMPANIES TO WHICH WE HAVE EXTENDED LOANS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN SUBJECT TO A TDR. THE INCREMENTAL EFFECT OF THESE ENTITIES ON OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NET OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THEM,

WAS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $31,097 MILLION AND $33,042 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT JANUARY 1, 2010. THERE ALSO WAS A NET REDUCTION OF TOTAL EQUITY (INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) OF APPROXIMATELY $1,945 MILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010,

PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SECURITIZATION GAINS AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

(181)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ASSETS OF QSPES THAT WE CONSOLIDATED WERE $29,792 MILLION, NET OF OUR EXISTING RETAINED INTERESTS OF $8,782

MILLION, AND LIABILITIES WERE $31,616 MILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010. SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OF THE QSPES INCLUDED NET FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND TRADE RECEIVABLES OF $39,463 MILLION AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $1,015 MILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010.

SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES INCLUDED NON-RECOURSE BORROWINGS OF $36,112 MILLION. THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF OTHER VIES WE CONSOLIDATED WERE $1,305 MILLION AND $1,426 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

WE CONSOLIDATE VIES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES

THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, TYPICALLY BECAUSE OF OUR ROLE AS EITHER SERVICER OR MANAGER FOR THE VIE. OUR CONSOLIDATED VIES FALL INTO THREE MAIN GROUPS, WHICH ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.



TRINITY IS A GROUP OF SPONSORED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES THAT HOLDS INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE INVESTMENT GRADE, AND ARE FUNDED BY THE

ISSUANCE OF GICS. THESE ENTITIES WERE CONSOLIDATED IN 2003, AND CEASED ISSUING NEW INVESTMENT CONTRACTS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010.

IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GECC WERE TO FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GECC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY $1,508 MILLION TO SUCH ENTITIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010 PURSUANT TO LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY GECC. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ENTITIES LIABILITIES EXCEED THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THEIR ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT DRAWN UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT, GECC IS

REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUCH EXCESS AMOUNT. AS THE BORROWINGS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE ALREADY REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN OUR DEBT IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES WAS $5,690 MILLION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS WAS $5,989 MILLION (WHICH INCLUDED NET UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $690 MILLION). WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, WE INTEND TO HOLD THEM AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAIR VALUES EXCEED THEIR AMORTIZED COST. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD ALL SUCH DEBT SECURITIES UNTIL MATURITY.



SECURITIZATION QSPES COMPRISE PREVIOUSLY OFF-BOOK QSPES THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED ON JANUARY 1, 2010 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2009-16 &

17. THESE ENTITIES WERE CREATED TO FACILITATE SECURITIZATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING WHICH SERVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM MARKETS. THE SECURITIZATION

TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED WITH THESE ENTITIES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE NON-RECOURSE. WE PROVIDE SERVICING FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS IN THESE ENTITIES.

THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN THESE ENTITIES HAVE SIMILAR RISKS AND CHARACTERISTICS TO OUR OTHER FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND WERE UNDERWRITTEN TO THE

SAME STANDARD. ACCORDINGLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ASSETS HAS BEEN SIMILAR TO OUR OTHER FINANCING RECEIVABLES; HOWEVER, THE BLENDED PERFORMANCE OF THE POOLS OF RECEIVABLES IN THESE ENTITIES REFLECTS THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT WE APPLY TO

DETERMINE WHICH RECEIVABLES ARE SELECTED FOR TRANSFER. CONTRACTUALLY THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES MUST FIRST BE USED TO PAY THIRD-PARTY DEBT HOLDERS AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES OF THE ENTITY. EXCESS CASH FLOWS ARE AVAILABLE TO GE.

THE CREDITORS OF THESE ENTITIES HAVE NO CLAIM ON OTHER ASSETS OF GE.



OTHER REMAINING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES RELATE PRIMARILY TO FIVE CATEGORIES OF ENTITIES: (1) ENTERPRISES WE ACQUIRED THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY

CREATED ASSET-BACKED FINANCING ENTITIES TO FUND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, MIDDLE-MARKET AND EQUIPMENT LOANS; WE ARE THE COLLATERAL MANAGER FOR THESE ENTITIES; (2) JOINT VENTURES THAT LEASE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT AND THAT HOLD A LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN CERTAIN MEDIA PROPERTIES; (3) ENTITIES THAT HAVE EXECUTED ON-BALANCE SHEET SECURITIZATIONS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OF THIRD-PARTY TRADE RECEIVABLES; (4) INSURANCE ENTITIES THAT, AMONG OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS,

PROVIDE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE FOR GE; AND (5) OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN POWER GENERATING, LEASING AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES.

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED VIES CONSISTS OF

THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: ASSISTING IN THE FORMATION AND FINANCING OF THE ENTITY, PROVIDING RECOURSE AND/OR LIQUIDITY SUPPORT, SERVICING THE ASSETS AND RECEIVING VARIABLE FEES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES

BECAUSE THE NATURE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIES DOES NOT GIVE US POWER OVER DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THEIR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.

UNCONSOLIDATED VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 INCLUDE OUR NON-CONTROLLING STAKE IN PTL ($5,790 MILLION); INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE ENTITIES ($2,071 MILLION), WHICH GENERALLY CONSIST OF PASSIVE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

INVESTMENTS IN TAX-ADVANTAGED, MULTI-FAMILY REAL ESTATE AND INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE ENTITIES; DEBT INVESTMENT FUND ($1,877 MILLION); AND EXPOSURES TO JOINT VENTURES THAT PURCHASE FACTORED RECEIVABLES ($1,596 MILLION).

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OTHER UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES CONSIST OF PASSIVE INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS ASSET-BACKED FINANCING ENTITIES.

THE LARGEST

UNCONSOLIDATED VIE WITH WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED IS PTL, WHICH IS A TRUCK RENTAL AND LEASING JOINT VENTURE. THE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF PTL AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WERE $7,444 MILLION AND $1,339 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS PART OF

OUR STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT MARKET, WE REDUCED OUR PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN PTL FROM 79% AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 TO 50.9% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 THROUGH A SERIES OF DISPOSITIONS TO PENSKE TRUCK LEASING

CORPORATION (PTLC), THE GENERAL PARTNER OF PTL, AND AN ENTITY AFFILIATED WITH PTLC. IN ADDITION, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE SOLD A 1% PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN PTL, A PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED VIE, TO PTLC. THE DISPOSITION OF THIS PARTNERSHIP

INTEREST, COUPLED WITH OUR RESULTING MINORITY POSITION ON THE PTL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND RELATED CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS, RESULTED IN THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PTL. WE RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF $296 MILLION, INCLUDING A GAIN ON

THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR RETAINED INVESTMENT OF $189 MILLION. THE TRANSACTION PRICE WAS DETERMINED ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS AND GE OBTAINED A FAIRNESS OPINION FROM A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL ADVISOR BECAUSE OF THE RELATED PARTY NATURE OF THE

TRANSACTION. THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INVESTMENT IN PTL WAS BASED ON A METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATED BOTH DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW INFORMATION AND MARKET DATA. IN APPLYING THIS METHODOLOGY, WE UTILIZED DIFFERENT SOURCES OF

INFORMATION, INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS, FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS AND MARKET OBSERVABLE PRICING MULTIPLES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES. THE RESULTING FAIR VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INTEREST REFLECTED OUR POSITION AS A NONCONTROLLING

SHAREOWNER AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRANSACTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT IN PTL OF $5,790 MILLION COMPRISED A 49.9% PARTNERSHIP INTEREST OF $935 MILLION AND LOANS AND ADVANCES OF $4,855 MILLION. GECC CONTINUES TO PROVIDE

LOANS UNDER LONG-TERM REVOLVING CREDIT AND LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITIES TO PTL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS BASED ON THE NATURE OF

THE ENTITY AND THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT WE HOLD. VARIABLE INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS AND CORPORATE ENTITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD INVESTMENTS. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ALSO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES IN

WHICH WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY BUT MAY HOLD A VARIABLE INTEREST SUCH AS LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS OR MEZZANINE DEBT INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED IN TWO CAPTIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: ALL OTHER ASSETS FOR

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AND FINANCING RECEIVABLES  NET FOR DEBT FINANCING PROVIDED TO THESE ENTITIES. OUR INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 FOLLOW.
