general
unless
otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms ge, gecs and ge
capital on the basis of consolidation described in note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements on page 74 of the 2006 annual report to shareowners of
general electric company (the company). the financial section of such annual
report to shareowners (pages45 through 113 of that document) is described
in part iv item 15(a)(1) and set forth in exhibit13 of this 10-k report
and is an integral part hereof. references in parts i and ii of this 10-k report
are to the page numbers of the 2006 annual report to shareowners. also, unless
otherwise indicated by the context, general electric means the parent company,
general electric company.
general
electrics address is 1 river road, schenectady, ny 12345-6999; we also maintain
executive offices at 3135 easton turnpike, fairfield, ct
06828-0001.
ge
is one of the largest and most diversified industrial corporations in the world.
we have engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety of
products for the generation, transmission, distribution, control and utilization
of electricity since our incorporation in 1892. over the years, we have
developed or acquired new technologies and services that have broadened
considerably the scope of our activities.
our
products include major appliances; lighting products; industrial automation
products; medical diagnostic imaging systems; bioscience assays and separation
technology products; electrical distribution and control equipment; locomotives;
power generation and delivery products; nuclear power support services and
fuel
assemblies; commercial and military aircraft jet engines; chemicals and
equipment for treatment of water and process systems; security equipment and
systems; and engineered materials, such as plastics.
our
services include product services; electrical apparatus installation,
engineering, and repair and rebuilding services. through our affiliate, nbc
universal, inc., we produce and deliver network television services, operate
television stations, produce and distribute motion pictures, operate
cable/satellite networks, operate theme parks, and program activities in
multimedia and the internet. through another affiliate, general electric capital
services, inc., we offer a broad array of financial and other services including
consumer financing, commercial and industrial financing, real estate financing,
asset management and leasing, mortgage services and consumer
savings.
in
virtually all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and
able competition. in many instances, the competitive climate is characterized
by
changing technology that requires continuing research and development, as well
as customer commitments. with respect to manufacturing operations, we believe
that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major
industries in which we participate. the nbc television network is one of four
major u.s. commercial broadcast television networks. we also compete with
syndicated broadcast television programming, cable and satellite television
programming activities and in the motion picture industry. the businesses in
which gecs engages are subject to competition from various types of financial
institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks,
broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies,
independent finance companies and finance companies associated with
manufacturers.

this document contains forward-looking statements- that is, statements related
to future, not past, events. in this context, forward-looking statements
often
address our expected future business and financial performance, and often
contain words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe,
seek, or will. forward-looking statements by their nature address matters
that are, to different degrees, uncertain. for us, particular uncertainties
that
could adversely or positively affect our future results include: the behavior
of
financial markets, including fluctuations in interest and exchange rates
and
commodity and equity prices; the commercial and consumer credit environment;
the
impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal actions; strategic
actions, including acquisitions and dispositions; future integration of acquired
businesses; future financial performance of major industries which we serve,
including, without limitation, the air and rail transportation, energy
generation, media, real estate and healthcare industries; and numerous other
matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political,
economic, business and competitive nature. these uncertainties may cause
our
actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in
our
forward-looking statements. we do not undertake to update our forward-looking
statements.
our
consolidated global revenues increased to $87.4 billion in 2006, compared with
$75.6 billion in 2005 and $66.2 billion in 2004. for additional information
about our global operations, see page57 of the 2006 annual report to
shareowners.
operating
segments
segment
revenue and profit information is presented on page 53 of the 2006 annual report
to shareowners. additional financial data and commentary on recent financial
results for operating segments are provided on pages52-56
of
that report and in note 26 (page 100) to the consolidated financial
statements.
in
january 2007, we announced the planned acquisitions of smiths aerospace and
vetco-gray by infrastructure and abbotts primary in
vitro
diagnostics businesses and abbott point-of-care diagnostics business by
healthcare. also during january 2007, we announced that we were reviewing the
potential disposition of our plastics business by industrial. in the fourth
quarter of 2006, we completed the sales of our advanced materials business
by
industrial and ge life, our u.k.-based life insurance business. we have reported
ge life as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
operating
businesses that are reported as segments include infrastructure, commercial
finance, ge money (formerly consumer finance), healthcare, nbc universal and
industrial. there is appropriate elimination of the net earnings of gecs and
the
immaterial effect of transactions between segments to arrive at total
consolidated data. a summary description of each of our operating segments
follows.
we
will
also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental information
for certain businesses within the segments.
infrastructure
infrastructure
(29.0%, 28.3% and 27.8% of consolidated revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively) produces, sells, finances and services equipment for the air
transportation and energy generation industries. we also produce, sell and
service equipment for the rail transportation and water treatment industries.
our
operations are located in north america, europe, asia and south
america.

aviation
and aviation financial services
aviation
produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines,
and
related replacement parts for use in military and commercial aircraft. our
military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft including fighters,
bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine
applications, and our commercial engines power aircraft in all categories of
range: short/medium, intermediate and long-range, as well as executive and
regional aircraft. we also produce engines through cfm international, a company
jointly owned by ge and snecma, a subsidiary of safran of france; and new
engines are being designed and marketed in joint ventures with the pratt &
whitney division of united technologies corporation and honda aero, inc., a
division of honda motor co., ltd.
we
provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (mro), including
sales of replacement parts, for many models of engines, including repair and
overhaul of engines manufactured by competitors.
the
worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and mro (including parts sales)
is
intense. both u.s. and export markets are important. product development cycles
are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. research
and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused
intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design,
manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies.
potential
sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological
lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in
technology, the small number of potential customers and the limited number
of
relevant airframe applications. aircraft engine orders tend to follow military
and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each
other.
on
january 15, 2007, aviation announced the acquisition of smiths aerospace from
smiths group plc for approximately $4.8 billion in cash. smiths aerospace is
a
$2.4 billion (sales) global aerospace systems and equipment company that
includes innovative flight management systems, airborne platform computing
systems, power generation, conversion and distribution products, actuation
products and systems for flight control, thrust reversers and landing gear
applications, various engine components and a global customer services
organization to military and commercial airframe manufacturers. the acquisition
is subject to regulatory approvals in the u.s. and abroad.
aviation
financial services is a global commercial aviation financial services business
that offers a broad range of financial products to airlines, aircraft operators,
owners, lenders, investors and airport developers. financial products include
leases, aircraft purchasing and trading, loans, engine/spare parts financing,
pilot training, fleet planning and financial advisory services. we operate
in a
highly competitive environment. our competitors include aircraft manufacturers,
banks, financial institutions, and other finance and leasing companies.
competition is based on lease rates and terms, as well as aircraft delivery
dates, condition and availability.
(5)
the
north american commercial aviation industry improved during 2006 because of
a
strong revenue environment and continued cost reduction efforts by the airlines,
despite rising fuel prices. although these conditions have improved the overall
industry outlook, the airlines continue to face challenges and financial
pressure that affect a portion of our commercial aviation business. several
airlines are experiencing major restructuring and reorganization, including
those who remain in, or recently emerged from, bankruptcy, while others could
be
candidates for further industry consolidation.
energy
and energy financial services
energy
serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide
with products and services related to energy production, distribution and
management. we offer wind turbines as part of our renewable energy portfolio,
which also includes solar and geothermal technology. we also sell aircraft
engine derivatives for use as industrial power sources. gas turbines and
generators are used principally in power plants for generation of electricity
and for industrial cogeneration and mechanical drive applications. we are a
worldwide supplier of gas turbines for integrated gasification combined cycle
(igcc) applications, having provided gas turbines for a significant number
of
the worlds operating igcc plants. igcc systems convert coal and other
hydrocarbons into synthetic gas that, after cleanup, is used as the primary
fuel
for gas turbines in combined-cycle systems. igcc systems produce fewer air
pollutants compared with traditional pulverized coal power plants. we sell
steam
turbines and generators to the electric utility industry and to private
industrial customers for cogeneration applications. nuclear reactors, fuel
and
support services for both new and installed boiling water reactors are also
a
part of this segment. we provide our customers with total solutions to meet
their needs through a complete portfolio of aftermarket services, including
equipment upgrades, long-term maintenance service agreements, repairs, equipment
installation, monitoring and diagnostics, asset management and performance
optimization tools, remote performance testing and dry low nox (dln) tuning.
we
continue to invest in advanced technology development that will provide more
value to our customers and more efficient solutions that comply with todays
strict environmental regulations.
worldwide
competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand for
most power generation products and services is global and, as a result, is
sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which
we
do business. regional load growth requirements and demand side management are
important factors. the availability of fuels and related prices have a large
impact on demand.
energy
financial services offers structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership
financing, project finance and broad-based commercial finance to the global
energy and water industries and invests in operating assets in these industries.
we operate in a highly competitive environment. our competitors include banks,
financial institutions, energy and water companies, and other finance and
leasing companies. competition is primarily based on price, that is interest
rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. as we compete globally,
our
success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country
in which we do business.

suppliers of drilling, completion and production equipment for onshore and
subsea applications in oil and gas fields. the business supplies flow control
valves (known as christmas trees), control systems, wellheads, manifolds,

nederland n.v., a subsidiary of dexia group; the custom fleet business of
national australia bank ltd.; and several senior housing portfolios from
formation capitalllc.
we
operate in a highly competitive environment. our competitors include commercial
banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated
with
manufacturers, and independent finance companies. competition related to our
lending and leasing operations is based on price, that is interest rates and
fees, as well as deal structure and terms. profitability is affected not only
by
broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the
availability and cost of capital, but also by successful management of credit
risk, operating risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency
exchange risks. success requires high quality risk management systems, customer
and industry specific knowledge, diversification, service and distribution
channels, strong collateral and asset management knowledge, deal structuring
expertise and the ability to reduce costs through technology and productivity.

certain of our equity investments, including properties we acquire for
investment, are sold under favorable market conditions. we invest in, and
provide restructuring financing for, portfolios of mortgage loans, limited
partnerships and tax-exempt bonds.
in
the normal course of our business operations, we sell certain real estate equity
investments when it is economically advantageous for us to do so. however,
as
real estate values are affected by certain forces beyond our control (e.g.,
market fundamentals and demographic conditions), it is difficult to predict
with
certainty the level of future sales or sales prices. rental income generally
approximates operating expenses, which include depreciation and
amortization.

institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan
companies, independent finance companies, manufacturers captive finance
companies, and insurance companies. industry participants compete on the basis
of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and
cross selling. the markets in which we operate are also subject to the risks
from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates, and
the
consumers capacity to repay debt.

nbc
universals broadcast ratings and advertising revenue are affected by viewer
demographics and the availability of other entertainment choices. in addition,
recent technological advances like personal video recorders offer personal
entertainment through new media, introducing additional uncertainty to future
revenue sources. other technologies enable copying content, increasing the
risk
of content piracy, particularly in international markets where the intellectual
property laws may not be clear or strictly applied.

the
aggregate level of economic activity in markets for such products and services
generally lags overall economic slowdowns as well as subsequent recoveries.
in
the united states, industrial markets are undergoing significant structural
changes reflecting, among other factors, increased international competition
and
pressures to modernize productive capacity.
equipment
services
equipment
services is a provider of transport solutions for domestic and international
supply chains. we offer a wide range of equipment leasing and intelligence-based
asset management and logistics services for commercial and transportation
equipment, including tractors, trailers, railroad rolling stock, modular space
units, and land and marine shipping containers. our operations are conducted
in
highly competitive markets. economic conditions, geographic location, pricing
and equipment availability are important factors in this business. future
success will depend upon our ability to maintain a large and diverse customer
portfolio, optimize asset mix, maximize asset utilization and manage credit
risk
as well as providing our customers with solutions to assist in asset and supply
chain management.
plastics
plastics
manufactures and sells high-performance plastics and structured products used
by
compounders, molders, and major original equipment manufacturers for use in
a
variety of applications, including fabrication of automotive parts, computer
enclosures, compact disks and optical-quality media, major appliance parts,
telecommunications equipment and construction materials. our business has a
significant operating presence around the world and we participate in numerous
manufacturing and distribution joint ventures.
our
business environment is characterized by technological innovation and heavy
capital investment. to remain competitive we must maintain emphasis on efficient
manufacturing process implementation and devote significant resources to market
and application development. our competitors include large, technology-driven
suppliers of the same, as well as other functionally similar, materials. our
business is cyclical and is sensitive to variations in price and to the effects
of supply/demand factors on the cost of utilities and raw materials such as
benzene, cumene and phenol. competition is affected by availability of
manufacturing capacity and anticipation of new product or material performance
requirements. our application development, often in association with our
existing or potential customers, and associated technology assistance have
added
additional demand. product and manufacturing process patents establish barriers
to entry in many product lines. in january 2007, we announced that we are
reviewing the potential disposition of our plastics business.

total
expenditures for research and development were $3,659 million, $3,425 million
and $3,091 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. of these amounts,
$2,969 million in 2006 was ge-funded ($2,741 million in 2005 and $2,443 million
in 2004); and $690 million in 2006 was funded by customers ($684 million in
and $648 million in 2004), principally the u.s. government. infrastructures
aviation business accounts for the largest share of ges research and
development expenditures with funding from both ge and customer funds.
healthcare and infrastructures energy business also made significant
expenditures funded primarily by ge.
environmental
matters
our
operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses,
involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under
environmental protection laws.
we
are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous
wastes as required by federal and state laws. such statutes require that
responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality
of
original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. expenditures for site
remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.2 billion in 2006 and $0.1
billion in 2005. we presently expect that such remediation actions will require
average annual expenditures in the range of $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over
the next two years.
the
u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) ruled in february2002 that
approximately 150,000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) must be dredged
from a 40-mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state. on
november2,2006, the u.s. district court for the northern district of
new york approved a consent decree entered into between ge and the epa that
represents a comprehensive framework for implementation of the epas 2002
decision to dredge pcb-containing sediments in the upper hudson river. the
dredging will be performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of
performance after phase1. under this consent decree, we have committed up
to $0.1 billion to reimburse the epa for its past and future project oversight
costs and agreed to perform the first phase of dredging. we further committed
that, subject to future agreement with the epa about completion of dredging
after completion of phase1 and the peer review, we will be responsible for
further costs, including costs of phase2 dredging. our statement of
financial position as of december31,2006 and 2005, included
liabilities for the estimated costs of this remediation.
employee
relations
at
year-end 2006, general electric company and consolidated affiliates employed
approximately 319,000 persons, of whom approximately 155,000 were employed
in
the united states. for further information about employees, see page67 of
the 2006 annual report to shareowners.
(14)
approximately
19,500 ge manufacturing and service employees in the united states are
represented for collective bargaining purposes by a total of approximately
different local collective bargaining groups. a majority of such employees
are
represented by union locals that are affiliated with, and bargain in conjunction
with, the international union of electronic, electrical, salaried, machine
and
furniture workers (iue/cwa-afl-cio). during 2003, general electric company
negotiated four-year contracts with unions representing a substantial majority
of those united states employees who are represented by unions. most of these
contracts will terminate in june 2007, and we will be engaged in negotiations
to
attain new agreements. while results of the 2007 union negotiations cannot
be
predicted, our recent past negotiations have resulted in agreements that
increased costs.
approximately
3,500 staff employees (and a large number of freelance employees) in the united
states are covered by about 160 labor agreements to which nbc universal is
a
party. these agreements are with various labor unions, expire at various dates
and are generally for a term ranging from three to five years.

because
of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic
dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide
variety of raw materials needed for our operations. we have not been adversely
affected by the inability to obtain raw materials.
we
own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. new patents are continuously
being obtained through our research and development activities as existing
patents expire. patented inventions are used both within the company and are
licensed to others, but no operating segment is substantially dependent on
any
single patent or group of related patents.

item
1a. risk factors
the
following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as
discussed in item 1. these risk factors may be important to understanding any
statement in this annual report on form 10-k or elsewhere. the following
information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and
analysis (md&a), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes
incorporated by reference in this report.
our
businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause
our
future results to be different -
sometimes materially different -
than we presently anticipate. discussion
about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found
in
the md&a section of our 2006 annual report to shareowners and in the
business descriptions in item 1. of this form10-k. below, we have
described certain important strategic risks. our reactions to material future
developments as well as our competitors reactions to those developments will
determine our future results.
our
global growth is subject to a number of economic and political
risks
we
conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world. global economic
developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways. operations are subject
to the effects of global competition. our global business is affected by local
economic environments, including inflation, recession and currency volatility.
political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our
supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.
while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial
instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are
costly and not always successful.
our
credit ratings are important to our cost of capital
the
major debt agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given their highest
debt ratings to us. one of our strategic objectives is to maintain these triple
a ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access
to a variety of lenders. failure to maintain our triple a debt rating could
adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins.
(16)
the
success of our business depends on achieving our objectives for strategic
acquisitions and dispositions
with
respect to acquisitions and mergers, we may not be able to identify suitable
candidates at terms acceptable to us, or may not achieve expected returns and
other benefits as a result of integration challenges, such as personnel and
technology. we will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets
and
businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives. when we decide to
sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or
alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could
delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or we may dispose of
a
business at a price or on terms, which are less than we had anticipated. in
addition, there is a risk that we sell a business whose subsequent performance
exceeds our expectations, in which case our decision would have potentially
sacrificed enterprise value. correspondingly, we may be too optimistic about
a
particular businesss prospects, in which case we may be unable to find a buyer
at a price acceptable to us and therefore may have potentially sacrificed
enterprise value.
we
are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations
our
businesses are subject to regulation by u.s. federal and state laws and foreign
laws, regulations and policies. changes to laws or regulations may even require
us to modify our business objectives if existing practices become more
restricted, subject to escalating costs or prohibited outright. particular
risks
include regulatory risks arising from local laws, such as laws which reduce
the
allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing, and from local liquidity
regulations, that may increase the risks of not being able to retrieve assets
and changes to tax law which may affect our return on investments. our business
and the industries in which we operate are also at times being reviewed or
investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines
and
penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.
changes
in the real estate markets are highly uncertain
we
provide financing for the acquisition, refinancing and renovation of various
types of properties. we also consider opportunities to buy and sell properties
which may result in significant outlays or proceeds of cash, either individually
or in the aggregate. the profitability of real estate investments is largely
dependent upon the specific geographic market in which they are located and
the
perceived value of that market at the time of sale. we may have difficulty
optimizing that mix and such activity may vary significantly from one year
to
the next.

3. legal proceedings
as
previously reported, since january 2005, the u.s. securities and exchange
commission (sec) staff has been conducting an investigation of the use of
hedge
accounting for derivatives by us and general electric capital corporation
(gecc). in august 2005 the sec staff advised us that the sec had issued a
formal
order of investigation in the matter. the sec staff has continued to subpoena
documents and take testimony in this matter. we and gecc continue to cooperate
fully with its investigation.
in
the course of the sec investigation, the sec enforcement staff raised certain
concerns about our accounting for the use of interest rate swaps to fix certain
otherwise variable interest costs in a portion of our commercial paper program
at gecc. the sec enforcement staff referred such concerns to the office of
chief
accountant (oca). we and our auditors determined that our accounting for
the
commercial paper hedging program satisfied the requirements of statement
of
financial accounting standards (sfas) 133, accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities,
as amended, and conveyed our views to the staff of oca. following our
discussions, however, oca communicated its view to us that our commercial
paper
hedging program as structured did not meet the sfas 133 specificity requirement.
accordingly, we restated our previously reported financial results to eliminate
hedge accounting for the interest rate swaps entered into as part of our
commercial paper hedging program from january 1, 2001.
as
previously disclosed, on april 16, 2004, the new york department of
environmental conservation (dec) informed the company that it would be seeking
$97,800 in penalties for violations of the state of new yorks water and
hazardous waste laws at its waterford, new york facility. in july 2004, dec
informed the company that it was dropping certain allegations and including
others pertaining to the reporting of information and increasing its penalty
demand to $117,000. the matter was settled in october 2006 and the company
has
paid a penalty of $90,000.
as
previously disclosed, in april 2006, the u.s. environmental protection agency
(epa) informed the company that it was contemplating seeking $990,000 in
penalties for violations of the clean air act at its mt. vernon, indiana
plastics facility. epa has asserted that the company failed to adequately
control emissions from valves and inlet pipes in an underground piping system.
we disagree with those assertions and epa has already modified its position
to
reduce the number of potential violations based on conversations with us. the
company continues to engage in settlement discussions with the agency over
both
the nature and severity of the alleged violations.
(18)
as
previously disclosed, in august 2006, the new jersey department of environmental
protections (dep) issued an administrative order seeking a penalty of $142,000
for violations of the clean air act at geccs linden, new jersey facility. the
dep has alleged that emissions from the facility exceeded thresholds established
in the sites permit. gecc has requested a hearing to contest the fine, and dep
has offered to settle the matter for 50% of the proposed penalty. gecc is
continuing to discuss the matter with the state of new jersey.

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
under
the direction of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of
december31,2006. we identified the following material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting -
we did not have adequately designed procedures to designate each hedged
commercial paper transaction with the specificity required by statement of
financial accounting standards133, accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities,
as amended. the restatement that resulted from this material weakness is
discussed in (b)below. solely as a result of this material weakness, we
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as
of
december 31, 2006. other than with respect to the identification of this
material weakness, there was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended december 31, 2006, that materially affected,
