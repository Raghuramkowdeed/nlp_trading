GE

IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD.

WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING A WIDE VARIETY OF

PRODUCTS FOR THE GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION, CONTROL AND UTILIZATION

OF ELECTRICITY SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1892. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE

DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED

CONSIDERABLY THE SCOPE OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

OUR

PRODUCTS INCLUDE MAJOR APPLIANCES; LIGHTING PRODUCTS; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION

PRODUCTS; MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SYSTEMS; BIOSCIENCE ASSAYS AND SEPARATION

TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS; ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL EQUIPMENT; LOCOMOTIVES;

POWER GENERATION AND DELIVERY PRODUCTS; NUCLEAR POWER SUPPORT SERVICES AND

FUEL

ASSEMBLIES; COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES; CHEMICALS AND

EQUIPMENT FOR TREATMENT OF WATER AND PROCESS SYSTEMS; SECURITY EQUIPMENT AND

SYSTEMS; AND ENGINEERED MATERIALS, SUCH AS PLASTICS.

ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED

BY

CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL

AS CUSTOMER COMMITMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE

THAT, IN GENERAL, WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IS ONE OF FOUR

MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH

SYNDICATED BROADCAST TELEVISION PROGRAMMING, CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES AND IN THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY. THE BUSINESSES IN

WHICH GECS ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, THRIFTS, INVESTMENT BANKS,

BROKER-DEALERS, CREDIT UNIONS, LEASING COMPANIES, CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES,

INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES AND FINANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH

MANUFACTURERS.

THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS”- THAT IS, STATEMENTS RELATED

TO FUTURE, NOT PAST, EVENTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

OFTEN

ADDRESS OUR EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND OFTEN

CONTAIN WORDS SUCH AS “EXPECT,” “ANTICIPATE,” “INTEND,” “PLAN,” “BELIEVE,”

“SEEK,” OR “WILL.” FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR NATURE ADDRESS MATTERS

THAT ARE, TO DIFFERENT DEGREES, UNCERTAIN. FOR US, PARTICULAR UNCERTAINTIES

THAT

COULD ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS INCLUDE: THE BEHAVIOR

OF

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATES

AND

COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRICES; THE COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER CREDIT ENVIRONMENT;

THE

IMPACT OF REGULATION AND REGULATORY, INVESTIGATIVE AND LEGAL ACTIONS; STRATEGIC

ACTIONS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS; FUTURE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED

BUSINESSES; FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR INDUSTRIES WHICH WE SERVE,

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY

GENERATION, MEDIA, REAL ESTATE AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES; AND NUMEROUS OTHER

MATTERS OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALE, INCLUDING THOSE OF A POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND COMPETITIVE NATURE. THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY CAUSE

OUR

ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE EXPRESSED IN

OUR

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE OUR FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED GLOBAL REVENUES INCREASED TO $87.4 BILLION IN 2006, COMPARED WITH

$75.6 BILLION IN 2005 AND $66.2 BILLION IN 2004. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

RESULTS FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON PAGES

52-56

OF

THAT REPORT AND IN NOTE 26 (PAGE 100) TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

IN

JANUARY 2007, WE ANNOUNCED THE PLANNED ACQUISITIONS OF SMITHS AEROSPACE AND

VETCO-GRAY BY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ABBOTT’S PRIMARY

IN

VITRO

DIAGNOSTICS BUSINESSES AND ABBOTT POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTICS BUSINESS BY

HEALTHCARE. ALSO DURING JANUARY 2007, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE REVIEWING THE

POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF OUR PLASTICS BUSINESS BY INDUSTRIAL. IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2006, WE COMPLETED THE SALES OF OUR ADVANCED MATERIALS BUSINESS

BY

INDUSTRIAL AND GE LIFE, OUR U.K.-BASED LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS. WE HAVE REPORTED

GE LIFE AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

OPERATING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE REPORTED AS SEGMENTS INCLUDE INFRASTRUCTURE, COMMERCIAL

FINANCE, GE MONEY (FORMERLY CONSUMER FINANCE), HEALTHCARE, NBC UNIVERSAL AND

INDUSTRIAL. THERE IS APPROPRIATE ELIMINATION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF GECS AND

THE

IMMATERIAL EFFECT OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SEGMENTS TO ARRIVE AT TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED DATA. A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS

FOLLOWS.

WE

WILL

ALSO CONTINUE OUR LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SEGMENTS.

INFRASTRUCTURE

INFRASTRUCTURE

AVIATION

AND AVIATION FINANCIAL SERVICES

AVIATION

PRODUCES, SELLS AND SERVICES JET ENGINES, TURBOPROP AND TURBO SHAFT ENGINES,

AND

RELATED REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR USE IN MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. OUR

MILITARY ENGINES ARE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT INCLUDING FIGHTERS,

BOMBERS, TANKERS, HELICOPTERS AND SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT, AS WELL AS MARINE

APPLICATIONS, AND OUR COMMERCIAL ENGINES POWER AIRCRAFT IN ALL CATEGORIES OF

RANGE: SHORT/MEDIUM, INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE, AS WELL AS EXECUTIVE AND

REGIONAL AIRCRAFT. WE ALSO PRODUCE ENGINES THROUGH CFM INTERNATIONAL, A COMPANY

JOINTLY OWNED BY GE AND SNECMA, A SUBSIDIARY OF SAFRAN OF FRANCE; AND NEW

ENGINES ARE BEING DESIGNED AND MARKETED IN JOINT VENTURES WITH THE PRATT &

WHITNEY DIVISION OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND HONDA AERO, INC., A

DIVISION OF HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD.

WE

PROVIDE MAINTENANCE, COMPONENT REPAIR AND OVERHAUL SERVICES (MRO), INCLUDING

SALES OF REPLACEMENT PARTS, FOR MANY MODELS OF ENGINES, INCLUDING REPAIR AND

OVERHAUL OF ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY COMPETITORS.

THE

WORLDWIDE COMPETITION IN AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES AND MRO (INCLUDING PARTS SALES)

IS

INTENSE. BOTH U.S. AND EXPORT MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES

ARE LONG AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS BUSINESS, AS ARE FOCUSED

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGIES AND PROTECTION OF KEY AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGN,

MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND PRODUCT UPGRADE TECHNOLOGIES.

POTENTIAL

SALES FOR ANY ENGINE ARE LIMITED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS TECHNOLOGICAL

LIFETIME, WHICH MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING UPON THE RATE OF ADVANCE IN

TECHNOLOGY, THE SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER

OF

RELEVANT AIRFRAME APPLICATIONS. AIRCRAFT ENGINE ORDERS TEND TO FOLLOW MILITARY

AND AIRLINE PROCUREMENT CYCLES, ALTHOUGH THESE CYCLES DIFFER FROM EACH

OTHER.

ON

JANUARY 15, 2007, AVIATION ANNOUNCED THE ACQUISITION OF SMITHS AEROSPACE FROM

SMITHS GROUP PLC FOR APPROXIMATELY $4.8 BILLION IN CASH. SMITHS AEROSPACE IS

A

$2.4 BILLION (SALES) GLOBAL AEROSPACE SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT COMPANY THAT

SYSTEMS, POWER GENERATION, CONVERSION AND DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTS, ACTUATION

PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS FOR FLIGHT CONTROL, THRUST REVERSERS AND LANDING GEAR

PILOT TRAINING, FLEET PLANNING AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES. WE OPERATE

IN A

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS,

BANKS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OTHER FINANCE AND LEASING COMPANIES.

COMPETITION IS BASED ON LEASE RATES AND TERMS, AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT DELIVERY

DATES, CONDITION AND AVAILABILITY.

(5)

THE

NORTH AMERICAN COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRY IMPROVED DURING 2006 BECAUSE OF

A

STRONG REVENUE ENVIRONMENT AND CONTINUED COST REDUCTION EFFORTS BY THE AIRLINES,

DESPITE RISING FUEL PRICES. ALTHOUGH THESE CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED THE OVERALL

INDUSTRY OUTLOOK, THE AIRLINES CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES AND FINANCIAL

PRESSURE THAT AFFECT A PORTION OF OUR COMMERCIAL AVIATION BUSINESS. SEVERAL

AIRLINES ARE EXPERIENCING MAJOR RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION, INCLUDING

THOSE WHO REMAIN IN, OR RECENTLY EMERGED FROM, BANKRUPTCY, WHILE OTHERS COULD

BE

CANDIDATES FOR FURTHER INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION.

ENERGY

AND ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES

POLLUTANTS COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL PULVERIZED COAL POWER PLANTS. WE SELL

STEAM

TURBINES AND GENERATORS TO THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY AND TO PRIVATE

INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS FOR COGENERATION APPLICATIONS. NUCLEAR REACTORS, FUEL

WE

CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL PROVIDE MORE

VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND MORE EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS THAT COMPLY WITH TODAY’S

STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

WORLDWIDE

COMPETITION FOR POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS INTENSE. DEMAND FOR

MOST POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS GLOBAL AND, AS A RESULT, IS

SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH

WE

DO BUSINESS. REGIONAL LOAD GROWTH REQUIREMENTS AND DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT ARE

IMPORTANT FACTORS. THE AVAILABILITY OF FUELS AND RELATED PRICES HAVE A LARGE

IMPACT ON DEMAND.

ENERGY

FINANCIAL SERVICES OFFERS STRUCTURED EQUITY, DEBT, LEASING, PARTNERSHIP

FINANCING, PROJECT FINANCE AND BROAD-BASED COMMERCIAL FINANCE TO THE GLOBAL

ENERGY AND WATER INDUSTRIES AND INVESTS IN OPERATING ASSETS IN THESE INDUSTRIES.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE BANKS,

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ENERGY AND WATER COMPANIES, AND OTHER FINANCE AND

LEASING COMPANIES. COMPETITION IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE, THAT IS INTEREST

RATES AND FEES, AS WELL AS DEAL STRUCTURE AND TERMS. AS WE COMPETE GLOBALLY,

OUR

SUCCESS IS SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF EACH COUNTRY

IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS.

WITH

MANUFACTURERS, AND INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES. COMPETITION RELATED TO OUR

LENDING AND LEASING OPERATIONS IS BASED ON PRICE, THAT IS INTEREST RATES AND

FEES, AS WELL AS DEAL STRUCTURE AND TERMS. PROFITABILITY IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY

BY

BROAD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT CUSTOMER CREDIT QUALITY AND THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL, BUT ALSO BY SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT

RISK, OPERATING RISK AND MARKET RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RISKS. SUCCESS REQUIRES HIGH QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, CUSTOMER

NBC

UNIVERSAL’S BROADCAST RATINGS AND ADVERTISING REVENUE ARE AFFECTED BY VIEWER

DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER ENTERTAINMENT CHOICES. IN ADDITION,

RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES LIKE PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS OFFER PERSONAL

ENTERTAINMENT THROUGH NEW MEDIA, INTRODUCING ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY TO FUTURE

REVENUE SOURCES. OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ENABLE COPYING CONTENT, INCREASING THE

RISK

OF CONTENT PIRACY, PARTICULARLY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WHERE THE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LAWS MAY NOT BE CLEAR OR STRICTLY APPLIED.

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL SELLS PRODUCTS THAT SHARE SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS

-

COMPETITIVE DESIGN, EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND

CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCTIVITY, IS KEY. DESPITE PRICING PRESSURES ON MANY

OF

OUR PRODUCTS, WE ALSO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENTIATED, PREMIUM

PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE PROFITABLE. WHILE SOME CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS

ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED TO CONSUMER APPLICATIONS (MAJOR APPLIANCES, FOR EXAMPLE),

AND SOME PRIMARILY TO INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS (SWITCHGEAR, FOR EXAMPLE), OTHERS

ARE DIRECTED TO BOTH MARKETS (LIGHTING, FOR EXAMPLE).

WE

BUSINESS IS CYCLICAL AND IS SENSITIVE TO VARIATIONS IN PRICE AND TO THE EFFECTS

OF SUPPLY/DEMAND FACTORS ON THE COST OF UTILITIES AND RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS

BENZENE, CUMENE AND PHENOL. COMPETITION IS AFFECTED BY AVAILABILITY OF

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND ANTICIPATION OF NEW PRODUCT OR MATERIAL PERFORMANCE

REQUIREMENTS. OUR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, OFTEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH OUR

EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, AND ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE HAVE

ADDED

ADDITIONAL DEMAND. PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS PATENTS ESTABLISH BARRIERS

TO ENTRY IN MANY PRODUCT LINES. IN JANUARY 2007, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE

REVIEWING THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF OUR PLASTICS BUSINESS.

(12)

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

TOTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WERE $3,659 MILLION, $3,425 MILLION

AND $3,091 MILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE AMOUNTS,

$2,969 MILLION IN 2006 WAS GE-FUNDED ($2,741 MILLION IN 2005 AND $2,443 MILLION

IN 2004); AND $690 MILLION IN 2006 WAS FUNDED BY CUSTOMERS ($684 MILLION IN

2005

AND $648 MILLION IN 2004), PRINCIPALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. INFRASTRUCTURE’S

AVIATION BUSINESS ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF GE’S RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WITH FUNDING FROM BOTH GE AND CUSTOMER FUNDS.

HEALTHCARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE’S ENERGY BUSINESS ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT

EXPENDITURES FUNDED PRIMARILY BY GE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS.

WE

ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS

WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY

OF

ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE

REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.2 BILLION IN 2006 AND $0.1

BILLION IN 2005. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE

AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF $0.2 BILLION TO $0.3 BILLION OVER

THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) RULED IN FEBRUARY 2002 THAT

APPROXIMATELY 150,000 POUNDS OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS) MUST BE DREDGED

FROM A 40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE. ON

NOVEMBER 2, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK APPROVED A CONSENT DECREE ENTERED INTO BETWEEN GE AND THE EPA THAT

REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EPA’S 2002

DECISION TO DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE

DREDGING WILL BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES WITH AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW OF

PERFORMANCE AFTER PHASE 1. UNDER THIS CONSENT DECREE, WE HAVE COMMITTED UP

TO $0.1 BILLION TO REIMBURSE THE EPA FOR ITS PAST AND FUTURE PROJECT OVERSIGHT

COSTS AND AGREED TO PERFORM THE FIRST PHASE OF DREDGING. WE FURTHER COMMITTED

THAT, SUBJECT TO FUTURE AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA ABOUT COMPLETION OF DREDGING

AFTER COMPLETION OF PHASE 1 AND THE PEER REVIEW, WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

FURTHER COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF PHASE 2 DREDGING. OUR STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, INCLUDED

LIABILITIES FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF THIS REMEDIATION.

EMPLOYEE

RELATIONS

AT

YEAR-END 2006, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES EMPLOYED

APPROXIMATELY 319,000 PERSONS, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 155,000 WERE EMPLOYED

IN

THE UNITED STATES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT EMPLOYEES, SEE PAGE 67 OF

THE 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

(14)

APPROXIMATELY

19,500 GE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

REPRESENTED FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PURPOSES BY A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY

150

DIFFERENT LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS. A MAJORITY OF SUCH EMPLOYEES

ARE

REPRESENTED BY UNION LOCALS THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH, AND BARGAIN IN CONJUNCTION

WITH, THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ELECTRONIC, ELECTRICAL, SALARIED, MACHINE

AND

FURNITURE WORKERS (IUE/CWA-AFL-CIO). DURING 2003, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY

NEGOTIATED FOUR-YEAR CONTRACTS WITH UNIONS REPRESENTING A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

OF THOSE UNITED STATES EMPLOYEES WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS. MOST OF THESE

CONTRACTS WILL TERMINATE IN JUNE 2007, AND WE WILL BE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS

TO

ATTAIN NEW AGREEMENTS. WHILE RESULTS OF THE 2007 UNION NEGOTIATIONS CANNOT

BE

PREDICTED, OUR RECENT PAST NEGOTIATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN AGREEMENTS THAT

INCREASED COSTS.

APPROXIMATELY

3,500 STAFF EMPLOYEES (AND A LARGE NUMBER OF FREELANCE EMPLOYEES) IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE COVERED BY ABOUT 160 LABOR AGREEMENTS TO WHICH NBC UNIVERSAL IS

A

PARTY. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE WITH VARIOUS LABOR UNIONS, EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES

AND ARE GENERALLY FOR A TERM RANGING FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,” AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY

STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING

INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS (MD&A), AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT.

OUR

BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE

OUR

FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT

-

SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

-

THAN WE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE.

DISCUSSION

ABOUT IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESSES ENCOUNTER CAN BE FOUND

IN

THE MD&A SECTION OF OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS AND IN THE

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS IN ITEM 1. OF THIS FORM 10-K. BELOW, WE HAVE

DESCRIBED CERTAIN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL FUTURE

DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS’ REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WILL

DETERMINE OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

RISKS

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. GLOBAL ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN MANY WAYS. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION. OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY LOCAL

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY.

POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR

SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION.

WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE

COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL.

OUR

CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COST OF CAPITAL

THE

MAJOR DEBT AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT AND HAVE GIVEN THEIR HIGHEST

DEBT RATINGS TO US. ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IS TO MAINTAIN THESE “TRIPLE

A” RATINGS AS THEY SERVE TO LOWER OUR BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATE OUR ACCESS

TO A VARIETY OF LENDERS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE A DEBT RATING COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS.

(16)

THE

SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

WITH

RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE

CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND

OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND

TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

AND

BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO

SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD

DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, OR WE MAY DISPOSE OF

A

BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS, WHICH ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. IN

ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE SELL A BUSINESS WHOSE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE

EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN WHICH CASE OUR DECISION WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY

SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE VALUE. CORRESPONDINGLY, WE MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT

A

PARTICULAR BUSINESS’S PROSPECTS, IN WHICH CASE WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A BUYER

AT A PRICE ACCEPTABLE TO US AND THEREFORE MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED

ENTERPRISE VALUE.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND FOREIGN

LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY EVEN REQUIRE

US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IF EXISTING PRACTICES BECOME MORE

RESTRICTED, SUBJECT TO ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITED OUTRIGHT. PARTICULAR

RISKS

INCLUDE REGULATORY RISKS ARISING FROM LOCAL LAWS, SUCH AS LAWS WHICH REDUCE

THE

ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT CONSUMER BORROWING, AND FROM LOCAL LIQUIDITY

REGULATIONS, THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISKS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS

AND CHANGES TO TAX LAW WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. OUR BUSINESS

AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE ALSO AT TIMES BEING REVIEWED OR

INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES

AND

PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND DAMAGES.

CHANGES

IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

WE

PROVIDE FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTIES. WE ALSO CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY AND SELL PROPERTIES

WHICH MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OUTLAYS OR PROCEEDS OF CASH, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY

OR IN THE AGGREGATE. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY

DEPENDENT UPON THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED AND

THE

PERCEIVED VALUE OF THAT MARKET AT THE TIME OF SALE. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY

OPTIMIZING THAT MIX AND SUCH ACTIVITY MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE YEAR

TO

THE NEXT.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, SINCE JANUARY 2005, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE USE OF

HEDGE

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES BY US AND GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION

(GECC). IN AUGUST 2005 THE SEC STAFF ADVISED US THAT THE SEC HAD ISSUED A

FORMAL

ORDER OF INVESTIGATION IN THE MATTER. THE SEC STAFF HAS CONTINUED TO SUBPOENA

DOCUMENTS AND TAKE TESTIMONY IN THIS MATTER. WE AND GECC CONTINUE TO COOPERATE

FULLY WITH ITS INVESTIGATION.

IN

THE COURSE OF THE SEC INVESTIGATION, THE SEC ENFORCEMENT STAFF RAISED CERTAIN

CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FIX CERTAIN

OTHERWISE VARIABLE INTEREST COSTS IN A PORTION OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM

AT GECC. THE SEC ENFORCEMENT STAFF REFERRED SUCH CONCERNS TO THE OFFICE OF

CHIEF

ACCOUNTANT (OCA). WE AND OUR AUDITORS DETERMINED THAT OUR ACCOUNTING FOR

THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER HEDGING PROGRAM SATISFIED THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATEMENT

OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 133,

ACCOUNTING

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

,

AS AMENDED, AND CONVEYED OUR VIEWS TO THE STAFF OF OCA. FOLLOWING OUR

DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, OCA COMMUNICATED ITS VIEW TO US THAT OUR COMMERCIAL

PAPER

HEDGING PROGRAM AS STRUCTURED DID NOT MEET THE SFAS 133 SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENT.

ACCORDINGLY, WE RESTATED OUR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS TO ELIMINATE

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ENTERED INTO AS PART OF OUR

COMMERCIAL PAPER HEDGING PROGRAM FROM JANUARY 1, 2001.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 16, 2004, THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION (DEC) INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WOULD BE SEEKING

$97,800 IN PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK’S WATER AND

HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS AT ITS WATERFORD, NEW YORK FACILITY. IN JULY 2004, DEC

INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS DROPPING CERTAIN ALLEGATIONS AND INCLUDING

OTHERS PERTAINING TO THE REPORTING OF INFORMATION AND INCREASING ITS PENALTY

DEMAND TO $117,000. THE MATTER WAS SETTLED IN OCTOBER 2006 AND THE COMPANY

HAS

PAID A PENALTY OF $90,000.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN APRIL 2006, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS CONTEMPLATING SEEKING $990,000 IN

PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AT ITS MT. VERNON, INDIANA

PLASTICS FACILITY. EPA HAS ASSERTED THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO ADEQUATELY

CONTROL EMISSIONS FROM VALVES AND INLET PIPES IN AN UNDERGROUND PIPING SYSTEM.

WE DISAGREE WITH THOSE ASSERTIONS AND EPA HAS ALREADY MODIFIED ITS POSITION

TO

REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH US. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AGENCY OVER

BOTH

THE NATURE AND SEVERITY OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS.

(18)

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN AUGUST 2006, THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTIONS (DEP) ISSUED AN ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER SEEKING A PENALTY OF $142,000

FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AT GECC’S LINDEN, NEW JERSEY FACILITY. THE

DEP HAS ALLEGED THAT EMISSIONS FROM THE FACILITY EXCEEDED THRESHOLDS ESTABLISHED

IN THE SITE’S PERMIT. GECC HAS REQUESTED A HEARING TO CONTEST THE FINE, AND DEP

HAS OFFERED TO SETTLE THE MATTER FOR 50% OF THE PROPOSED PENALTY. GECC IS

CONTINUING TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
