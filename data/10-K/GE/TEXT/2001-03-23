GE IS ONE OF THE

LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. GE HAS

ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS

FOR THE GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION, CONTROL AND UTILIZATION OF

ELECTRICITY SINCE ITS INCORPORATION IN 1892. OVER THE YEARS, GE HAS DEVELOPED OR

ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED CONSIDERABLY THE

SCOPE OF ITS ACTIVITIES.

GE'S PRODUCTS

INCLUDE MAJOR APPLIANCES; LIGHTING PRODUCTS; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION PRODUCTS;

MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING EQUIPMENT; MOTORS; ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND

CONTROL EQUIPMENT; LOCOMOTIVES; POWER GENERATION AND DELIVERY PRODUCTS; NUCLEAR

POWER SUPPORT SERVICES AND FUEL ASSEMBLIES; COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT JET

IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF

ITS GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, GE ENCOUNTERS AGGRESSIVE AND ABLE COMPETITION.

IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY CHANGING

TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS

CUSTOMER, COMMITMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT, IN GENERAL, GE IS ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH IT PARTICIPATES. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IS ONE OF FOUR

MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS. IT ALSO COMPETES WITH TWO

RELATIVELY NEW COMMERCIAL BROADCAST NETWORKS, SYNDICATED BROADCAST TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING AND CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES. THE

BUSINESSES IN WHICH GE CAPITAL SERVICES ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM

VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, THRIFTS,

INVESTMENT BANKS, BROKER-DEALERS, CREDIT UNIONS, LEASING COMPANIES, CONSUMER

LOAN COMPANIES, INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES, FINANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH

MANUFACTURERS, AND INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANIES.

THIS 10-K REPORT INCLUDES CERTAIN

"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON

MANAGEMENT'S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE EXPECTATIONS DUE

TO CHANGES IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, COMPETITIVE, MARKET AND REGULATORY

FACTORS.

GE HAS SUBSTANTIAL

EXPORT SALES FROM THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED

SIGNIFICANTLY ITS NON-U.S. ACTIVITIES THROUGH MAJORITY, MINORITY OR OTHER JOINT

VENTURE INTERESTS IN COMPANIES ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN MANUFACTURING AND

DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS AND PROVIDING NONFINANCIAL SERVICES SIMILAR TO THOSE SOLD

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. GECS FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES ALSO HAVE EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

REVENUE AND SEGMENT

PROFIT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 131

, DISCLOSURES ABOUT

SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

, IS PRESENTED ON PAGE 44

OF THE 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHARE OWNERS. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL DATA AND

COMMENTARY ON RECENT FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON

PAGES 43-48 OF THAT REPORT AND IN NOTE 28 (PAGES 72 AND 73) TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE REPORTED AS SEGMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 131 INCLUDE AIRCRAFT

ENGINES, APPLIANCES, GECS, POWER SYSTEMS, PLASTICS AND NBC. THE REMAINING KEY

BUSINESSES DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND HAVE BEEN

AGGREGATED INTO TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR

ACTIVITIES (INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES). FOR THE GECS SEGMENT, REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS ARE PRESENTED AND

ANALYZED ON PAGES 45-48 OF THE 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHARE OWNERS BY THE FIVE

MAJOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS (CONSUMER SERVICES,

EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT, MID-MARKET FINANCING, SPECIALIZED FINANCING AND SPECIALTY

INSURANCE). THERE IS APPROPRIATE ELIMINATION OF THE NET EARNINGS OF GECS AND THE

IMMATERIAL EFFECT OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECS SEGMENTS TO ARRIVE AT

TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DATA. A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THE COMPANY'S

OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES

AIRCRAFT ENGINES

(8.3%, 9.6% AND 10.2% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY) PRODUCES, SELLS AND SERVICES JET ENGINES, TURBOPROP AND TURBOSHAFT

ENGINES, AND RELATED REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR USE IN MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT. GE'S MILITARY ENGINES ARE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT THAT

INCLUDES FIGHTERS, BOMBERS, TANKERS, HELICOPTERS AND SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT. THE

CFM56, PRODUCED BY CFMI, A COMPANY JOINTLY OWNED BY GE AND SNECMA OF FRANCE, AND

GE'S CF6 ENGINES POWER AIRCRAFT IN ALL CATEGORIES OF LARGE COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT: SHORT/MEDIUM, INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE. APPLICATIONS FOR THE CFM56

ENGINE INCLUDE: BOEING'S 737-300/-400/-500 SERIES, THE NEXT GENERATION

737-600X/-700/-800/-900 SERIES, AND THE 737 BUSINESS JET; AIRBUS INDUSTRIE'S

A318, A319, A320, A321 AND A340-300 SERIES; AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT SUCH AS THE

KC-135R, E/KE-3 AND E-6. THE CF6 FAMILY OF ENGINES POWERS INTERMEDIATE AND

LONG-RANGE AIRCRAFT SUCH AS BOEING'S 747, 767, DC-10 AND MD-11 SERIES, AS WELL

AS AIRBUS INDUSTRIE'S A300, A310 AND A330 SERIES. THE GE90 ENGINE IS USED TO

POWER BOEING'S 777 SERIES TWIN-ENGINE AIRCRAFT. THE GP7000, BEING DESIGNED AND

MARKETED IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH THE PRATT & WHITNEY DIVISION OF UTX, IS

OFFERED ON AIRBUS INDUSTRIE'S A380 AND THE BOEING 747 GROWTH VERSION, ALTHOUGH

NO FIRM ORDERS HAVE YET BEEN TAKEN. THE BUSINESS ALSO PRODUCES JET ENGINES FOR

EXECUTIVE AIRCRAFT AND REGIONAL COMMUTER AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT ENGINE

DERIVATIVES USED FOR MARINE PROPULSION, MECHANICAL DRIVES AND INDUSTRIAL POWER

GENERATION SOURCES. THESE AIRCRAFT ENGINE DERIVATIVES ARE ALSO REPORTED AS PART

OF THE POWER SYSTEMS SEGMENT. MAINTENANCE, OVERHAUL AND COMPONENT REPAIR

SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR MANY MODELS OF ENGINES, INCLUDING ENGINES MANUFACTURED

BY COMPETITORS. THE BUSINESS FURTHER EXPANDED ITS PRODUCT SERVICES OPERATIONS

THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OF THE OVERHAUL OPERATIONS OF VARIG AIRLINES IN 1998.

THE WORLDWIDE

COMPETITION IN AIRCRAFT JET ENGINES IS INTENSE. BOTH U.S. AND EXPORT MARKETS ARE

IMPORTANT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES ARE LONG AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND

EFFICIENCY ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES, BOTH

CUSTOMER-FINANCED AND INTERNALLY FUNDED, ARE ALSO IMPORTANT IN THIS SEGMENT.

POTENTIAL SALES FOR ANY ENGINE ARE LIMITED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS

TECHNOLOGICAL LIFETIME, WHICH MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING UPON THE RATE OF

ADVANCE IN THE STATE OF THE ART, BY THE SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND

BY THE LIMITED NUMBER OF APPLICABLE AIRFRAME APPLICATIONS. SALES OF PRODUCT

SERVICES (REPLACEMENT PARTS AND SERVICES) ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BUSINESS.

AIRCRAFT ENGINE ORDERS TEND TO FOLLOW MILITARY AND AIRLINE PROCUREMENT CYCLES,

ALTHOUGH CYCLES FOR MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL ENGINE PROCUREMENT ARE DIFFERENT.

PROCUREMENTS OF MILITARY JET ENGINES ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GLOBAL POLITICAL

AND ECONOMIC FACTORS.

IN LINE WITH

INDUSTRY PRACTICE, AIRFRAME MANUFACTURERS SUPPORT THEIR SALES OF COMMERCIAL JET

AIRCRAFT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH LONG-TERM FINANCING COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS,

AND ENGINE MANUFACTURERS ARE OFTEN ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH FINANCINGS. IN

MAKING SUCH COMMITMENTS, IT IS GE'S GENERAL PRACTICE TO REQUIRE THAT IT HAVE OR

BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH AN OWNERSHIP OR SECURED POSITION IN THE AIRCRAFT BEING

FINANCED. UNDER SUCH AIRLINE FINANCING PROGRAMS, GE HAD ISSUED LOANS AND

GUARANTEES (PRINCIPALLY GUARANTEES) AMOUNTING TO $1.2 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000,

AND HAD ENTERED INTO COMMITMENTS TOTALING $1.5 BILLION TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL

ASSISTANCE ON FUTURE AIRCRAFT ENGINE SALES. ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE

AIRCRAFT SECURING THESE RECEIVABLES AND ASSOCIATED GUARANTEES EXCEEDED THE

RELATED ACCOUNT BALANCES AND GUARANTEED AMOUNTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2000. SEE PAGE

43 OF THE 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHARE OWNERS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT AIRCRAFT

ENGINES ORDERS AND BACKLOG.

APPLIANCES

APPLIANCES (4.5%, 5.1% AND 5.6% OF

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY) MANUFACTURES AND/OR

MARKETS A SINGLE CLASS OF PRODUCT - MAJOR APPLIANCES - THAT INCLUDES

REFRIGERATORS, ELECTRIC AND GAS RANGES, MICROWAVE OVENS, FREEZERS, DISHWASHERS,

CLOTHES WASHERS AND DRYERS, WATER-SOFTENING AND FILTERING PRODUCTS, AND ROOM AIR

CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT. THESE ARE SOLD UNDER GE, HOTPOINT, MONOGRAM, AND PROFILE

BRANDS AS WELL AS UNDER PRIVATE BRANDS FOR RETAILERS AND OTHERS. GE MICROWAVE

OVENS, GAS AND ELECTRIC RANGES, ROOM AIR CONDITIONERS, WATER SOFTENING AND

FILTERING PRODUCTS, AND FREEZERS ARE SOURCED FROM SUPPLIERS WHILE INVESTMENT IN

COMPANY-OWNED FACILITIES IS FOCUSED ON REFRIGERATORS, DISHWASHERS, ELECTRIC

RANGES AND HOME LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT. A LARGE PORTION OF APPLIANCE SALES IS FOR

REPLACEMENT OF INSTALLED UNITS. SUCH SALES ARE EFFECTED THROUGH A VARIETY OF

RETAIL OUTLETS. THE OTHER PRINCIPAL CHANNEL CONSISTS OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDING

CONTRACTORS WHO INSTALL APPLIANCES IN NEW DWELLINGS. GE HAS AN EXTENSIVE U.S.

PRODUCT SERVICES NETWORK THAT PROVIDES REPAIR SERVICES, EXPANDED SERVICE PLANS,

WARRANTY ADMINISTRATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR APPLIANCES IS

INFLUENCED BY ECONOMIC TRENDS SUCH AS INCREASES OR DECREASES IN CONSUMER

DISPOSABLE INCOME, AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. COMPETITION

IS VERY ACTIVE IN ALL PRODUCTS AND COMES FROM A NUMBER OF PRINCIPAL

MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS. AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THE DEGREE OF PRODUCT

DIFFERENTIATION ACHIEVED THROUGH INNOVATION AND NEW PRODUCT FEATURES. GE

APPLIANCES CONTINUED TO USE ITS SIX SIGMA NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION PROCESS TO

BRING NEW AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. THE BUSINESS RECENTLY

LAUNCHED THE ARCTICA REFRIGERATOR, WHICH INCLUDES A

NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE TIME-SAVING FEATURES, AS WELL AS PRODIGY AND WIZARD, THE INDUSTRY'S FIRST FULL LINE OF

ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED WASHING MACHINES. IN 1999, THE BUSINESS INTRODUCED THE

ADVANTIUM SPEEDCOOKING OVEN WHICH COOKS OVEN

QUALITY FOOD IN ABOUT ONE-FOURTH THE TIME OF A CONVENTIONAL OVEN. HIGHLIGHTING

THIS REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCE IN COOKING TECHNOLOGY WERE "BEST NEW PRODUCT OF

THE YEAR" AWARDS FROM

BUSINESS WEEK

AND

POPULAR SCIENCE

. ALSO

IN 1999, THE BUSINESS LAUNCHED THE TRITON DISHWASHER, SPECTRA ELECTRIC RANGE AND CUSTOMSTYLE

REFRIGERATOR. QUALITY IS ALSO A KEY ELEMENT TO SUCCESS IN THE APPLIANCE MARKET.

THE SIX SIGMA QUALITY INITIATIVE CONTINUES TO ENABLE THE BUSINESS TO IMPROVE THE

QUALITY OF PRODUCTS TO RECORD LEVELS, REDUCE WASTE AND PROVIDE BETTER PRODUCT

SERVICES. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTORS INCLUDE PRODUCT COST, BRAND RECOGNITION,

CUSTOMER RESPONSIVENESS AND APPLIANCE SERVICE CAPABILITY.

GE APPLIANCES CONTINUED TO GROW

E-COMMERCE REVENUES IN 2000, SELLING APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION OF APPLIANCES

ELECTRONICALLY AND MORE THAN $0.7 BILLION USING ITS STATE-OF-THE-ART CUSTOMERNET

WEBSITE. THE BUSINESS HAS ALSO USED WEB-BASED TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY

IN ITS PROCUREMENT PROCESS, PURCHASING MORE THAN $1 BILLION THROUGH ITS

SUPPLIERNET WEB-SITE.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS

PROVIDED BY EACH OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO

INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, INDUSTRIAL END

USERS, UTILITIES, ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS TO DISTRIBUTORS. THESE

BUSINESSES COMPETE AGAINST A VARIETY OF BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. MANUFACTURERS AND

SERVICE PROVIDERS. MARKETS FOR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DIVERSE,

GLOBAL AND HIGHLY PRICE COMPETITIVE. THE AGGREGATE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN

MARKETS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES GENERALLY LAG OVERALL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS

AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, INDUSTRIAL MARKETS ARE

UNDERGOING SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES REFLECTING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND PRESSURES TO MODERNIZE PRODUCTIVE

CAPACITY. A DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY EACH OF THE

BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT FOLLOWS.

GECS

GE CAPITAL SERVICES

(51.0%, 49.9% AND 48.5% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY) CONSISTS OF OWNERSHIP OF TWO PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES WHICH,

TOGETHER WITH THEIR AFFILIATES, CONSTITUTE GE'S PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL SERVICES

BUSINESSES. GE CAPITAL SERVICES IS THE SOLE OWNER OF THE COMMON STOCK OF GENERAL

ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION ("GE CAPITAL") AND GE GLOBAL INSURANCE

HOLDING CORPORATION ("GE GLOBAL INSURANCE").

GE CAPITAL'S

ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS INCLUDING,

AT THE U.S. FEDERAL LEVEL, THE CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION ACT, THE EQUAL CREDIT

OPPORTUNITY ACT AND CERTAIN REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.

A MAJORITY OF STATES HAVE CEILINGS ON RATES CHARGEABLE TO CUSTOMERS IN RETAIL

TIME SALES TRANSACTIONS, INSTALLMENT LOANS AND REVOLVING CREDIT FINANCING.

COMMON CARRIER SERVICES OF GE AMERICOM ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL

COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. CERTAIN GECS CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES ARE RESTRICTED

FROM REMITTING FUNDS TO GECS IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR LOANS BY A VARIETY OF

REGULATIONS, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO PROTECT AFFECTED INSURANCE

POLICYHOLDERS, DEPOSITORS OR INVESTORS. GECS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THEIR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. TO DATE, COMPLIANCE

WITH THE REGULATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON GE

CAPITAL'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GECS BUSINESSES ARE

GENERALLY AFFECTED BY GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES IN

WHICH GECS CONDUCTS BUSINESS. WHEN OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE IN

THOSE COUNTRIES, THERE GENERALLY ARE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON GECS OPERATIONS,

ALTHOUGH THOSE EFFECTS ARE DYNAMIC AND COMPLEX. FOR EXAMPLE, A DOWNTURN IN

EMPLOYMENT OR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A PARTICULAR NATIONAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMY WILL

GENERALLY INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON CUSTOMERS, WHICH GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN

DETERIORATION OF REPAYMENT PATTERNS AND A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

HOWEVER, IN SUCH A DOWNTURN, DEMAND FOR LOANS AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

OFFERED BY GECS MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE. INTEREST RATES, ANOTHER MACRO-ECONOMIC

FACTOR, ARE IMPORTANT TO GECS BUSINESSES. IN THE LENDING AND LEASING BUSINESSES,

HIGHER REAL INTEREST RATES INCREASE GECS COST TO BORROW FUNDS, BUT ALSO PROVIDE

HIGHER LEVELS OF RETURN ON NEW INVESTMENTS. FOR GECS OPERATIONS THAT ARE LESS

DIRECTLY LINKED TO INTEREST RATES, SUCH AS THE INSURANCE OPERATIONS, RATE

CHANGES GENERALLY AFFECT RETURNS ON INVESTMENT PORFOLIOS. FURTHER INFORMATION

ABOUT BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RISKS AFFECTING GECS CAN BE FOUND IN ITS ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ON MARCH 28, 1991,

GE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL, CONSTITUTING

ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS) TO BE NOT LESS THAN 1.10 FOR THE PERIOD, AS A SINGLE

AGGREGATION, OF EACH GE CAPITAL FISCAL YEAR COMMENCING WITH FISCAL YEAR 1991.

THE AGREEMENT CAN ONLY BE TERMINATED BY WRITTEN NOTICE AND TERMINATION IS NOT

EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF SUCH NOTICE. GE CAPITAL'S

RATIOS OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES FOR THE YEARS 2000, 1999 AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE 1.52, 1.60 AND 1.50, SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE LEVEL AT WHICH

PAYMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED. UNDER A SEPARATE AGREEMENT, GE HAS COMMITTED TO MAKE

A CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO GE CAPITAL IN THE EVENT CERTAIN GE CAPITAL PREFERRED

STOCK IS REDEEMED AND CAUSED THE GE CAPITAL

DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO, EXCLUDING FROM EQUITY ALL NET UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES, TO EXCEED 8 TO 1.

GECS BUSINESSES ARE

CATEGORIZED FOR MANAGEMENT PURPOSES INTO FIVE OPERATING ACTIVITIES: CONSUMER

SERVICES, EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT, MID-MARKET FINANCING, SPECIALIZED FINANCING AND

SPECIALTY INSURANCE. VERY LITTLE OF THE FINANCING PROVIDED BY GECS BUSINESSES

INVOLVES PRODUCTS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED BY GE. A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL

. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

GENERAL

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, ON MARCH 12, 1993, A COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT BY TEN EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S FORMER

AEROSPACE BUSINESS, PURPORTEDLY ON BEHALF OF ALL GE AEROSPACE EMPLOYEES WHOSE GE

EMPLOYMENT STATUS IS OR WAS AFFECTED BY THE THEN PLANNED TRANSFER OF GE

AEROSPACE TO A NEW COMPANY CONTROLLED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS OF MARTIN MARIETTA

CORPORATION. THE COMPLAINT SOUGHT TO CLARIFY AND ENFORCE THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMED

RIGHTS TO PENSION BENEFITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND RIGHTS TO ASSETS THEN HELD

IN, THE GE PENSION PLAN (THE "PLAN"). THE COMPLAINT NAMED THE COMPANY,

THE TRUSTEES OF THE GE PENSION TRUST ("TRUST"), AND MARTIN MARIETTA

CORPORATION AND ONE OF ITS FORMER PLAN ADMINISTRATORS AS DEFENDANTS. THE

COMPLAINT ALLEGED PRIMARILY THAT THE COMPANY'S PLANNED TRANSFER OF CERTAIN

ASSETS OF THE TRUST TO A MARTIN MARIETTA PENSION TRUST, IN CONNECTION WITH THE

TRANSFER OF THE AEROSPACE BUSINESS, VIOLATED THE RIGHTS OF THE PLAINTIFFS UNDER

THE PLAN AND APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY

ACT OF 1974 AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPLAINT SOUGHT EQUITABLE AND

DECLARATORY RELIEF, INCLUDING AN INJUNCTION AGAINST TRANSFER OF THE PLAN ASSETS

EXCEPT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES AND PROTECTIONS, IF ANY, APPROVED BY THE COURT, AN

ORDER THAT THE COMPANY DISGORGE ALL PROFITS ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED BY IT AS A RESULT

OF ANY SUCH TRANSFER AND THE MAKING OF RESTITUTION TO THE TRUST FOR ALLEGED

INVESTMENT LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S TREATMENT OF PLAN ASSETS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION OR ALTERNATIVELY THE TRANSFER OF ADDITIONAL

ASSETS FROM THE TRUST TO A NEW MARTIN MARIETTA PENSION TRUST, AND AN ORDER

REQUIRING MARTIN MARIETTA TO CONTINUE TO OFFER TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES ALL ACCRUED

PENSION-RELATED BENEFITS FOR WHICH THEY WERE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PLAN AS OF THE

CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSFER OF THE GE AEROSPACE BUSINESS TO MARTIN MARIETTA. ON

MARCH 23, 1993, THE COMPANY AND MARTIN MARIETTA CORPORATION FILED MOTIONS TO

DISMISS THE COMPLAINT ON THE BASIS THAT THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT STATE ANY CLAIM

UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED AS A MATTER OF LAW. ON APRIL 2, 1993, THE

TRANSFER OF THE AEROSPACE BUSINESS OCCURRED, AND ON JUNE 7, 1993, THE COURT

ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFFS' REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. ON SEPTEMBER

26, 1996, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS THOSE CLAIMS

WHICH WERE BASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT THE TRANSFER OF PLAN ASSETS WAS UNLAWFUL,

AND ORDERED DISCOVERY ON THE REMAINING CLAIMS. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1998, THE CLASS

WAS CERTIFIED AS TO THE REMAINING CLAIMS. ON MARCH 29, 2000, THE DISTRICT COURT

DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS FILED AN APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT'S

ORDER. ON MARCH 2, 2001, THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS HELD IN FAVOR OF GE

ON ALL COUNTS AND AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURT'S RULINGS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DIRECTORS SERVING ON THE BOARD IN 1991 AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN A CIVIL SUIT PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE

COMPANY AS A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION BY LESLIE MCNEIL, HAROLD SACHS, ARUN

SHINGALA AND PAUL AND HARRIET LUTS (THE MCNEIL ACTION) IN NEW YORK STATE SUPREME

COURT ON NOVEMBER 19, 1991. THE SUIT ALLEGES THE COMPANY WAS NEGLIGENT AND

ENGAGED IN FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF CONTAINMENT

SYSTEMS FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS AND CONTENDS THAT, AS A RESULT, GE HAS INCURRED

SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND IS POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL

LIABILITIES FROM CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS. THE SUIT ALLEGES

BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BY THE DEFENDANTS AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. ON MARCH 31, 1992, THE DEFENDANTS FILED MOTIONS TO

DISMISS THE SUIT. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1992, THE COURT DENIED THE MOTIONS AS

PREMATURE BUT RULED THAT THEY MAY BE RENEWED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF LIMITED

DISCOVERY. DEFENDANTS MOVED FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THAT ORDER, AND ON APRIL 3,

1993, THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND DIRECTED

THAT DISCOVERY BE STAYED PENDING THE FILING OF AN AMENDED COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS

FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ON MARCH 18, 1994, ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY,

WASTE AND INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS. ON JUNE 5, 2000, THE COURT DISMISSED THE

AMENDED COMPLAINT, AND ON JULY 11, 2000, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A NOTICE OF

APPEAL. THE COMPANY AND THE DEFENDANTS BELIEVE THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS ARE

WITHOUT MERIT.

ENVIRONMENTAL

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, IN MAY 1999, THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

CONSERVATION INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS SEEKING PENALTIES OF $325,000 FOR

VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE'S CLEAN WATER ACT AT ITS WATERFORD, NY FACILITY. THE

STATE ALLEGES DISCHARGES IN EXCESS OF PERMITTED LIMITS AS WELL AS REPORTING

VIOLATIONS. THE STATE HAS SINCE REDUCED ITS PENALTY DEMAND TO $200,000.

IN ADDITION, AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN MARCH 2000, THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS SEEKING PENALTIES OF

$204,000 FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE'S HAZARDOUS WASTE RULES AT ITS WATERFORD,

NY FACILITY. THE STATE ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF REQUIREMENTS FOR LABELING,

INSPECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. BOTH MATTERS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER

NEGOTIATION.

FOR FURTHER

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

THE FINANCIAL DATA IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY MANAGEMENT USING THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND

APPLYING JUDGMENT. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN PREPARING THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE THOSE THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A SOUND, DYNAMIC SYSTEM OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL

CONTROLS THAT BALANCES BENEFITS AND COSTS PROVIDES A VITAL INGREDIENT FOR THE

COMPANY'S SIX SIGMA QUALITY INITIATIVE AS WELL AS THE BEST SAFEGUARD FOR COMPANY

ASSETS. PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND

OVERSEEING THE FINANCIAL CONTROL SYSTEM, REPORTING ON MANAGEMENT'S STEWARDSHIP

OF THE ASSETS ENTRUSTED TO IT BY SHARE OWNERS AND MAINTAINING ACCURATE RECORDS.

GE IS DEDICATED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY, ETHICS AND SOCIAL

RESPONSIBILITY. THIS DEDICATION IS REFLECTED IN WRITTEN POLICY STATEMENTS

COVERING, AMONG OTHER SUBJECTS, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, POTENTIALLY

CONFLICTING OUTSIDE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES, COMPLIANCE WITH ANTITRUST LAWS,

PROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES, AND ADHERENCE TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND

PRACTICES IN TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY EMPHASIZES TO ALL EMPLOYEES THAT EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF

IMPROPRIETY CAN ERODE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE COMPANY. ONGOING EDUCATION AND

COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS AND REVIEW ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS THOSE CONDUCTED BY THE

COMPANY'S POLICY COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD, ARE DESIGNED TO CREATE A STRONG

COMPLIANCE CULTURE--ONE THAT ENCOURAGES EMPLOYEES TO RAISE THEIR POLICY

QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND THAT PROHIBITS RETRIBUTION FOR DOING SO.

KPMG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE, INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF

MANAGEMENT'S DISCHARGE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE FAIRNESS OF REPORTING

OF OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THEIR REPORT FOR 2000 APPEARS

BELOW.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD (CONSISTING SOLELY OF DIRECTORS FROM

OUTSIDE GE) MAINTAINS AN ONGOING APPRAISAL--ON BEHALF OF SHARE OWNERS--OF THE

ACTIVITIES AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, THE

ACTIVITIES OF ITS AUDIT STAFF, FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS, INTERNAL FINANCIAL

CONTROLS AND COMPLIANCE WITH KEY COMPANY POLICIES.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO SHARE OWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY

WE HAVE AUDITED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND

CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AS LISTED IN ITEM 14 (A)1 ON PAGE 21. THESE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED

IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A

TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE AFOREMENTIONED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND

CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR

OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE

COMBINATION OF THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING AND NONFINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES

("GE") AND THE ACCOUNTS OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. ("GECS"). SEE

NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH EXPLAINS HOW THE VARIOUS

FINANCIAL DATA ARE PRESENTED.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS IS PRESENTED IN THREE PARTS.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS, SEGMENT OPERATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY ACHIEVED RECORD REVENUES, EARNINGS AND CASH GENERATION

IN 2000, DEMONSTRATING THE BENEFITS OF ITS CONTINUING EMPHASIS ON GLOBALIZATION,

GROWTH IN SERVICES, SIX SIGMA QUALITY AND E-BUSINESS.

REVENUES ROSE 16% TO A RECORD $129.9 BILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH $111.6

BILLION IN 1999, WHICH WAS 11% HIGHER THAN THE $100.5 BILLION REPORTED IN 1998.

THE IMPROVEMENTS IN REVENUES OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD REFLECT CONTINUED GROWTH

FROM GLOBAL ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES.

EARNINGS INCREASED TO A RECORD $12,735 MILLION, A 19% INCREASE FROM $10,717

MILLION REPORTED IN 1999. EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED TO $1.27 DURING 2000, UP

19% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR'S $1.07 (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED, EARNINGS PER SHARE

ARE PRESENTED ON A DILUTED BASIS). EARNINGS IN 1999 ROSE 15% FROM $9,296 MILLION

IN 1998. IN 1999, EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 15% FROM $0.93 IN 1998.

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") HAS ISSUED, THEN SUBSEQUENTLY

AMENDED, STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, EFFECTIVE FOR GE

ON JANUARY 1, 2001. UPON ADOPTION, ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (INCLUDING CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS) WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUES; CHANGES IN SUCH FAIR VALUES MUST BE

RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN EARNINGS UNLESS SPECIFIC HEDGING CRITERIA ARE MET.

EFFECTS OF QUALIFYING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL BE RECORDED IN EQUITY PENDING

RECOGNITION IN EARNINGS AS OFFSETS TO THE RELATED EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE HEDGED

ITEMS. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT, AT JANUARY 1, 2001, THE EFFECTS ON ITS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 133, AS AMENDED, WILL BE

A ONE-TIME REDUCTION OF NET EARNINGS OF LESS THAN $0.5 BILLION, AND A ONE-TIME

REDUCTION OF EQUITY, EXCLUDING THE NET EARNINGS EFFECT, OF LESS THAN $1.0

BILLION. THE PRECISE TRANSITION EFFECT IS UNCERTAIN BECAUSE THE ACCOUNTING FOR

CERTAIN DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 133 IS

SUBJECT TO FURTHER INTERPRETATION BY THE FASB.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN 2000 AMOUNTED TO $5,647 MILLION. PER-SHARE DIVIDENDS OF

$0.57 WERE UP 17% FROM 1999, FOLLOWING A 17% INCREASE FROM THE PRECEDING YEAR.

GE HAS REWARDED ITS SHARE OWNERS WITH 25 CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF DIVIDEND GROWTH.

THE CHART ABOVE ILLUSTRATES THAT GE'S DIVIDEND GROWTH FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS

HAS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPACED DIVIDEND GROWTH OF COMPANIES IN THE STANDARD & POOR'S

500 STOCK INDEX.

RETURN ON AVERAGE SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY WAS 27.5% IN 2000, UP FROM 26.8% AND

25.7% IN 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE ANALYSIS IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION

PRESENTS GE RESULTS WITH GECS REPORTED ON AN EQUITY BASIS.

GE TOTAL REVENUES WERE $69.5 BILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH $60.9 BILLION IN

1999 AND $56.0 BILLION IN 1998.

*  GE SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES WERE $63.8 BILLION IN 2000, AN INCREASE OF 15%

FROM 1999, WHICH IN TURN WAS 8% HIGHER THAN IN 1998. VOLUME WAS ABOUT 16%

HIGHER IN 2000, REFLECTING GROWTH ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES DURING THE YEAR, LED

BY STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASES AT POWER SYSTEMS AND MEDICAL SYSTEMS. WHILE

OVERALL SELLING PRICES WERE DOWN SLIGHTLY IN 2000, THE EFFECTS OF SELLING

PRICES ON SALES IN VARIOUS BUSINESSES DIFFERED MARKEDLY. THE NET EFFECT OF

EXCHANGE RATES ON SALES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR

ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECTED REVENUES. VOLUME IN 1999 WAS ABOUT 10% HIGHER THAN

IN 1998, WITH SELLING PRICE AND CURRENCY EFFECTS BOTH SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

FOR PURPOSES OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISPLAY OF SALES AND COSTS OF

SALES ON PAGES 34 AND 35, "GOODS" IS REQUIRED TO INCLUDE SALES OF TANGIBLE

PRODUCTS, AND "SERVICES" MUST INCLUDE ALL OTHER SALES, INCLUDING BROADCASTING

AND INFORMATION SERVICES ACTIVITIES. AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF GE

F-10

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 42

SALES INCLUDES BOTH SPARE PARTS (GOODS) AS WELL AS REPAIR SERVICES. SUCH

SALES ARE REFERRED TO BY MANAGEMENT AS "PRODUCT SERVICES." SALES OF PRODUCT

SERVICES WERE $16.2 BILLION IN 2000, A 9% INCREASE OVER 1999 ON A COMPARABLE

BASIS. INCREASES IN PRODUCT SERVICES REVENUES IN 2000 WERE WIDESPREAD, LED BY

POWER SYSTEMS, MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. OPERATING MARGIN

FROM PRODUCT SERVICES WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION, UP 10% FROM 1999 ON A

COMPARABLE BASIS. THE INCREASE REFLECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN MOST PRODUCT

SERVICES BUSINESSES AND WAS LED BY POWER SYSTEMS, MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.

*  GE OTHER INCOME, EARNED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, WAS $0.5 BILLION IN

2000, $0.9 BILLION IN 1999 AND $0.7 BILLION IN 1998. COMPARISONS OVER THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ARE AFFECTED BY A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $388 MILLION IN 1999

RESULTING FROM THE CONTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN OF NBC'S MEDIA PROPERTIES TO NBC

INTERNET (NBCI), A PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANY, IN EXCHANGE FOR A NONCONTROLLING

INTEREST IN NBCI.

*  EARNINGS OF GECS WERE UP 17% IN 2000, FOLLOWING A 17% INCREASE THE YEAR

BEFORE. SEE PAGE 45 FOR AN ANALYSIS OF THESE EARNINGS.

PRINCIPAL COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR GE ARE THOSE CLASSIFIED AS COSTS OF GOODS AND

SERVICES SOLD, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. TWO GE

INITIATIVES HAD SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON COSTS.

*  THE SIX SIGMA QUALITY INITIATIVE HAS LOWERED GE'S COSTS BY DRAMATICALLY

REDUCING REWORK, SIMPLIFYING PROCESSES AND REDUCING DIRECT MATERIAL COSTS.

DESIGN FOR SIX SIGMA HAS BEEN A KEY TO THE INTRODUCTION OF NUMEROUS

HIGH-QUALITY NEW PRODUCTS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FEATURES.

*  COSTS HAVE ALSO BEEN REDUCED BY THE E-BUSINESS INITIATIVE, A BROAD-BASED

PROGRAM UNDER WHICH GE IS INVESTING IN INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE THAT IS ENABLING ITS BUSINESSES TO CONDUCT A GROWING PORTION OF

THEIR BUSINESS OVER THE INTERNET. BENEFITS FROM THE E-BUSINESS INITIATIVE

INCLUDE IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE, EXPANDED PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS AND

INCREASED OPERATING EFFICIENCY FOR BOTH GE AND ITS CUSTOMERS.

PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE GE PENSION PLAN (DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 6) AND OTHER RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS (DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5), PRINCIPAL U.S.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS CONTRIBUTED PRE-TAX COST REDUCTIONS OF $1,266

MILLION AND $1,062 MILLION IN 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY, ABOUT 6.5% OF NET

EARNINGS IN BOTH YEARS. THE PRESENT FUNDING STATUS PROVIDES ASSURANCE OF

BENEFITS FOR PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES, BUT FUTURE EFFECTS ON OPERATING RESULTS

DEPEND ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE.

COSTS AND EXPENSES IN 1999 INCLUDED $326 MILLION OF UNUSUAL CHARGES, THE

LARGEST OF WHICH RESULTED FROM FOURTH-QUARTER DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING LIABILITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH PAST ACTIVITIES AT FORMER MANUFACTURING SITES THAT ARE NOT PART

OF ANY CURRENT BUSINESS SEGMENT. OTHER SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF UNUSUAL CHARGES

INCLUDED AMOUNTS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 45 FOR NBC AND COSTS FOR RATIONALIZING

CERTAIN OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES OF GE'S WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. MAJOR

ELEMENTS OF THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM INCLUDED COSTS FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE,

LEASE TERMINATION, DISMANTLEMENT AND SITE RESTORATION. THE PROGRAM WAS

ESSENTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2000.

OPERATING MARGIN IS SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES LESS THE COSTS OF GOODS AND

SERVICES SOLD, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. GE'S ONGOING

OPERATING MARGIN REACHED A RECORD 18.9% OF SALES IN 2000, UP FROM 17.8% IN 1999

AND 16.7% IN 1998. REPORTED OPERATING MARGIN WAS 18.6% IN 2000, INCLUDING THE

EFFECTS OF A ONE-TIME RETIREMENT BENEFIT PROVISION ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW LABOR

AGREEMENT. REPORTED OPERATING MARGIN IN 1999 WAS 17.3% OF SALES, INCLUDING THE

$326 MILLION OF UNUSUAL CHARGES DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. THE

IMPROVEMENT IN ONGOING OPERATING MARGIN IN 2000 WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH

IMPROVEMENTS IN A MAJORITY OF GE'S BUSINESSES, LED BY POWER SYSTEMS AND AIRCRAFT

ENGINES, REFLECTING THE INCREASING BENEFITS FROM GE'S PRODUCT SERVICES, SIX

SIGMA QUALITY AND E-BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

MARGIN. TOTAL COST PRODUCTIVITY IN 2000 WAS 3.6%, REFLECTING BENEFITS FROM

IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE COST PRODUCTIVITY ACHIEVED THROUGH STRONG VOLUME GROWTH AND

THE SIX SIGMA QUALITY AND E-BUSINESS INITIATIVES. MOST BUSINESSES ACHIEVED

IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE COST PRODUCTIVITY IN EXCESS OF 5%. TOTAL COST PRODUCTIVITY

WAS 4.2% IN 1999, REFLECTING SIX SIGMA QUALITY BENEFITS AS WELL AS HIGHER

VOLUME. THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTIVITY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OFFSET NOT

ONLY THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF TOTAL COST INFLATION, BUT ALSO THE EFFECTS OF

SELLING PRICE DECREASES.

GE INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES IN 2000 AMOUNTED TO $811 MILLION, ABOUT

THE SAME AS 1999 AND SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE $883 MILLION IN 1998. DURING 2000,

HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE BORROWING

LEVELS. THE DECREASE IN 1999 AROSE FROM A COMBINATION OF LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST

RATES AND LOWER AVERAGE LEVELS OF BORROWING.

INCOME TAXES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WERE 31.0% OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS IN 2000,

COMPARED WITH 31.2% IN 1999 AND 31.0% IN 1998. A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND THE CONSOLIDATED RATE,

AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INCOME TAX PROVISIONS, IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 7.

SEGMENT OPERATIONS

REVENUES AND SEGMENT PROFIT FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE SHOWN ON PAGE 44. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

INCLUDED IN EACH SEGMENT, SEE NOTE 28.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES REPORTED A 17% INCREASE IN OPERATING PROFIT IN 2000, ON

REVENUES THAT WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN 1999. THE IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING

PROFIT REFLECTED STRONG PRODUCTIVITY. REVENUES IN 1999 INCREASED 4%, PRINCIPALLY

REFLECTING HIGHER VOLUME IN PRODUCT SERVICES. OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED 19% IN

1999 AS A RESULT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH IN PRODUCT SERVICES.

IN 2000, $1.6 BILLION OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES REVENUES WERE FROM SALES TO THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT, ABOUT THE SAME AS IN 1999.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES RECEIVED ORDERS OF $13.5 BILLION IN 2000 COMPARED WITH $12.0

BILLION IN 1999. THE $12.0 BILLION TOTAL BACKLOG AT YEAR-END 2000 COMPRISED

UNFILLED PRODUCT ORDERS OF $9.5 BILLION (OF WHICH 57% WAS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY

IN 2001) AND PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS OF $2.5 BILLION TO BE DELIVERED IN 2001.

COMPARABLE DECEMBER 31, 1999 TOTAL BACKLOG WAS $10.0 BILLION.

APPLIANCES REVENUES WERE 4% HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO, AS VOLUME INCREASES MORE

THAN OFFSET LOWER SELLING PRICES. OPERATING PROFIT ALSO INCREASED 4%, LARGELY AS

A RESULT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND HIGHER VOLUME FROM NEW PRODUCTS. REVENUES IN 1999

WERE 1% HIGHER THAN IN 1998, AS VOLUME INCREASES OFFSET LOWER SELLING PRICES.

OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED 13% IN 1999, REFLECTING LOWER SELLING PRICES AND

INCREASED SPENDING ON PROGRAMS FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND E-BUSINESS.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS REVENUES INCREASED 3% IN 2000, LARGELY AS A

RESULT OF VOLUME INCREASES AT INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS AND GROWTH IN PRODUCT SERVICES,

INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER SELLING PRICES. OPERATING

PROFIT INCREASED 4%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH IN PRODUCT

SERVICES. REVENUES ROSE 3% IN 1999, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF VOLUME INCREASES AT

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER SELLING PRICES. OPERATING

PROFIT INCREASED 11% IN 1999 AS STRONG PRODUCTIVITY AT INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS AND

LIGHTING MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER SELLING PRICES.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS RECEIVED ORDERS OF $2.1 BILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH

$1.4 BILLION IN 1999. THE $1.4 BILLION TOTAL BACKLOG AT YEAR-END 2000 COMPRISED

THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 56-76 ARE AN INTEGRAL

PART OF THIS STATEMENT. "GE" MEANS THE BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION AS DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; "GECS" MEANS GENERAL ELECTRIC

CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. AND ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES. THE

SEGMENT PROFIT MEASURE FOR GE'S INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES IS OPERATING PROFIT

(EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES, AND INCOME TAXES). THE

SEGMENT PROFIT MEASURE FOR GECS IS NET EARNINGS, REFLECTING THE IMPORTANCE OF

FINANCING AND TAX CONSIDERATIONS TO ITS OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

(A)   INCLUDES REVENUES OF $944 MILLION AND $789 MILLION IN 1997 AND 1996,

RESPECTIVELY, FROM AN APPLIANCE DISTRIBUTION AFFILIATE THAT WAS

DECONSOLIDATED IN 1998. ALSO INCLUDES $1,538 MILLION IN 1997 FROM AN

EXCHANGE OF PREFERRED STOCK IN LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION FOR THE STOCK

OF A NEWLY FORMED SUBSIDIARY.

(B)   PRINCIPALLY THE ELIMINATION OF GECS NET EARNINGS.

(C)   INCLUDES INCOME, PRINCIPALLY FROM LICENSING ACTIVITIES, OF $79 MILLION,

$62 MILLION, $271 MILLION, $310 MILLION AND $282 MILLION IN 2000, 1999,

1998, 1997 AND 1996, RESPECTIVELY.

(D)   1999 INCLUDES UNUSUAL CHARGES AMOUNTING TO $265 MILLION. OF THE TOTAL,

AMOUNTS THAT RELATE TO ACTIVITIES OF GE OPERATING SEGMENTS WERE AS

FOLLOWS: AIRCRAFT ENGINES--$42 MILLION, APPLIANCES--$75 MILLION,

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS--$12 MILLION, PLASTICS--$13 MILLION AND

TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES --$34 MILLION. 1997 INCLUDES UNUSUAL

CHARGES OF $2,322 MILLION. OF THE TOTAL, AMOUNTS THAT RELATE TO ACTIVITIES

OF GE OPERATING SEGMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS: AIRCRAFT ENGINES--$342 MILLION,

APPLIANCES--$330 MILLION, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS--$352 MILLION,

NBC--$161 MILLION, PLASTICS--$63 MILLION, POWER SYSTEMS--$437 MILLION AND

OPERATIONS AND CONTINUED COST REDUCTIONS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER LICENSE

FEES FOR CERTAIN PRIME-TIME PROGRAMS THAT WERE RENEWED. OPERATING PROFIT IN 1999

INCLUDED $123 MILLION OF THE GAIN FROM THE NBCI TRANSACTION, DESCRIBED ON PAGE

42. THAT GAIN WAS ENTIRELY OFFSET BY $62 MILLION OF OPERATING LOSSES FROM NBCI

AND PREDECESSOR OPERATIONS (RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF "OTHER INCOME"), AS WELL

AS $61 MILLION OF UNUSUAL COSTS RECORDED AS "OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES" FOR

ENTERING INTO A LOSS PROGRAMMING CONTRACT AND FOR CLOSING CERTAIN CNBC

FACILITIES.

PLASTICS OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED 16% IN 2000 ON REVENUES THAT WERE 12% HIGHER

THAN A YEAR AGO. THE INCREASES IN BOTH REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT WERE

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER VOLUME AND IMPROVED SELLING PRICES, WHICH MORE

THAN OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL PRICES. REVENUES IN 1999

INCREASED BY 5%, AS IMPROVED VOLUME ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES MORE THAN OFFSET

THE EFFECTS OF LOWER SELLING PRICES. OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED BY 4% AS

PRODUCTIVITY AND THE INCREASE IN VOLUME MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER PRICES.

POWER SYSTEMS REVENUES INCREASED 47% IN 2000, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SHARPLY

HIGHER VOLUME IN GAS TURBINES AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN PRODUCT SERVICES,

INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS. OPERATING PROFIT ROSE 60%, REFLECTING THE INCREASE IN

VOLUME, SELLING PRICES AND PRODUCTIVITY. REVENUES IN 1999 WERE 19% HIGHER THAN

IN 1998, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN GAS TURBINE

VOLUME AND IN PRODUCT SERVICES. OPERATING PROFIT ROSE 31%, REFLECTING

PRODUCTIVITY, GROWTH IN PRODUCT SERVICES AND THE INCREASE IN VOLUME.

POWER SYSTEMS ORDERS WERE $23.6 BILLION FOR 2000, A 68% INCREASE OVER 1999,

REFLECTING VERY STRONG AMERICAS MARKET GROWTH. THE $25.1 BILLION TOTAL BACKLOG

AT YEAR-END 2000 COMPRISED UNFILLED PRODUCT ORDERS OF $21.9 BILLION (OF WHICH

63% WAS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2001) AND PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS OF $3.2

BILLION TO BE DELIVERED IN 2001. COMPARABLE DECEMBER 31, 1999 TOTAL BACKLOG WAS

$16.1 BILLION.

TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REVENUES ROSE 15% IN 2000, REFLECTING SHARPLY

HIGHER VOLUME AT MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. OPERATING

PROFIT GREW 26%, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND VOLUME GROWTH AT

MEDICAL SYSTEMS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER SELLING PRICES ACROSS THE SEGMENT.

REVENUES IN 1999 WERE 29% HIGHER THAN 1998 PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH AT

MEDICAL SYSTEMS, THE RESULT OF HIGHER EQUIPMENT VOLUME, INCLUDING NEW PRODUCTS,

AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN PRODUCT SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SELLING

PRICES ACROSS THE SEGMENT. OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED 23% AS PRODUCTIVITY AND

VOLUME INCREASES, PARTICULARLY AT MEDICAL SYSTEMS, MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER

SELLING PRICES.

ORDERS RECEIVED BY MEDICAL SYSTEMS IN 2000 WERE $7.6 BILLION, A 19% INCREASE

OVER 1999. THE $3.6 BILLION TOTAL BACKLOG AT YEAR-END 2000 COMPRISED UNFILLED

PRODUCT ORDERS OF $2.3 BILLION (OF WHICH 87% WAS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2001)

AND PRODUCT SERVICES ORDERS OF $1.3 BILLION TO BE DELIVERED IN 2001. COMPARABLE

DECEMBER 31, 1999 TOTAL BACKLOG WAS $3.1 BILLION.

GECS BUSINESSES ARE CATEGORIZED FOR MANAGEMENT PURPOSES INTO FIVE OPERATING

ACTIVITIES: CONSUMER SERVICES, EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT, MID-MARKET FINANCING,

SPECIALIZED FINANCING AND SPECIALTY INSURANCE.

GECS NET EARNINGS WERE $5,192 MILLION IN 2000, UP 17% FROM $4,443 MILLION IN

1999, WITH STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT EARNINGS GROWTH IN FOUR OF THE FIVE OPERATING

ACTIVITIES. NET EARNINGS IN 1999 INCREASED 17% FROM 1998. THE EARNINGS

IMPROVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD RESULTED FROM ASSET GROWTH,

PRINCIPALLY FROM ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS, AND ORIGINATION

VOLUME.

ON DECEMBER 28, 2000, MONTGOMERY WARD, LLC (WARDS), FORMERLY A GECS

SUBSIDIARY, FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AND BEGAN LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS.

NET EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR 2000 INCLUDED OPERATING LOSSES FROM WARDS AMOUNTING TO

$245 MILLION AS WELL AS A CHARGE, PRIMARILY TO OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES, FOR

RESULTING FROM THE BANKRUPTCY OF WARDS.

*  GECS TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED 19% TO $66.2 BILLION IN 2000, FOLLOWING A 14%

INCREASE TO $55.7 BILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASES IN BOTH YEARS REFLECTED THE

CONTRIBUTIONS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS WELL AS GROWTH IN ORIGINATION VOLUME.

REVENUES IN 2000 INCLUDED A GAIN OF $1,366 MILLION ($848 MILLION, AFTER TAX)

FROM SALE OF GECS INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OF PAINE WEBBER GROUP, INC.

*  GECS COST OF GOODS SOLD AMOUNTED TO $8.5 BILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH $8.0

BILLION IN 1999 AND $6.8 BILLION IN 1998, AND RELATES TO IT SOLUTIONS AND

WARDS. THE INCREASE IN 2000 AND 1999 PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION OF

WARDS FROM AUGUST 2, 1999, WHEN GECS ACQUIRED CONTROL, THROUGH DECEMBER 28,

2000, WHEN WARDS COMMENCED LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS AND WAS DECONSOLIDATED.

*  GECS INTEREST ON BORROWINGS IN 2000 WAS $11.1 BILLION, UP FROM $9.4 BILLION

IN 1999 AND $9.0 BILLION IN 1998. THE INCREASE IN BOTH YEARS REFLECTED THE

EFFECTS OF BOTH INTEREST RATES AND THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF BORROWINGS USED TO

FINANCE ASSET GROWTH. GECS AVERAGE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE WAS 5.89% IN 2000,

COMPARED WITH 5.14% IN 1999 AND 5.92% IN 1998. IN 2000, AVERAGE ASSETS OF

$360.5 BILLION WERE 13% HIGHER THAN IN 1999, WHICH IN TURN WERE 16% HIGHER

THAN IN 1998. SEE PAGE 52 FOR A DISCUSSION OF INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT.

*  GECS INSURANCE LOSSES AND POLICYHOLDER AND ANNUITY BENEFITS INCREASED TO

$14.4 BILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH $11.0 BILLION IN 1999 AND $9.6 BILLION

IN 1998. THIS INCREASE REFLECTED EFFECTS OF GROWTH IN PREMIUM VOLUME AND

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD, AS WELL AS A HIGHER RATIO OF

LOSSES TO PREMIUMS EARNED IN THE REINSURANCE BUSINESS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 47.

*  GECS PROVISION FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES WAS $2.0 BILLION IN 2000,

COMPARED WITH $1.7 BILLION IN 1999 AND $1.6 BILLION IN 1998. THESE PROVISIONS

PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARDS, BANK CREDIT CARDS,

PERSONAL LOANS AND AUTO LOANS AND LEASES IN THE CONSUMER SERVICES OPERATIONS,

ALL OF WHICH ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGE 48 UNDER FINANCING RECEIVABLES. THE

PROVISIONS THROUGHOUT THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD REFLECTED HIGHER AVERAGE

RECEIVABLE BALANCES, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS, AND THE EFFECTS OF LOWER

AVERAGE CONSUMER DELINQUENCY RATES.

*  GECS OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE $22.8 BILLION IN 2000, AN INCREASE FROM

$19.4 BILLION IN 1999 AND $16.4 BILLION IN 1998. THE INCREASE IN 2000

REFLECTED INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS,

THE CHARGES DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY FOR WARDS, AND THE DECISION TO RATIONALIZE

CERTAIN OPERATIONS DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS OF ALL OTHER GECS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES. THE 1999 INCREASE REFLECTED INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS, HIGHER INVESTMENT LEVELS AND INCREASES IN

INSURANCE COMMISSIONS.

FINANCING SPREADS (THE EXCESS OF YIELDS OVER INTEREST RATES ON BORROWINGS)

INCREASED SLIGHTLY DURING 2000, AS THE IMPROVEMENT IN YIELDS OUTPACED INCREASES

IN BORROWING RATES. FINANCING SPREADS IN 1999 WERE RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED WITH

1998 AS YIELDS AND BORROWING RATES DECREASED TO A SIMILAR EXTENT.

REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE GECS SEGMENT

FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS ARE SUMMARIZED AND DISCUSSED BELOW.

CONSUMER SERVICES REVENUES INCREASED 28% IN 2000 AND 6% IN 1999, AND NET

EARNINGS INCREASED 47% IN 2000 AND 35% IN 1999. GROWTH IN REVENUES AND NET

INCOME IN 2000 RESULTED FROM HIGHER PREMIUM AND INVESTMENT INCOME AT GE

FINANCIAL ASSURANCE (GEFA), THE CONSUMER SAVINGS AND INSURANCE BUSINESS, WHICH

EXPERIENCED PROFITABLE GROWTH FROM BOTH ACQUISITIONS AND VOLUME. REVENUES AND

NET EARNINGS ALSO INCREASED AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITION AND VOLUME GROWTH AT CARD

SERVICES AND GLOBAL CONSUMER FINANCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSSES AT MORTGAGE

SERVICES, WHICH STOPPED ACCEPTING NEW BUSINESS DURING 2000. THE GROWTH IN

REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS DURING 1999 WAS LED BY GLOBAL CONSUMER FINANCE AND

IMPROVED RESULTS AT GEFA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF ASSET REDUCTIONS IN

CARD SERVICES. THE PORTFOLIO AT AUTO FINANCIAL SERVICES (AFS) BEGAN TO RUN OFF

IN 1999 AND CONTINUED IN 2000, RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN REVENUES;

DURING 2000, AFS STOPPED ACCEPTING NEW BUSINESS.

EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT REVENUES DECLINED 4% IN 2000, FOLLOWING A 3% INCREASE IN

1999, AS HIGHER REVENUES FROM GE CAPITAL AVIATION SERVICES (GECAS), TRANSPORT

INTERNATIONAL POOL, GE CAPITAL MODULAR SPACE AND AMERICOM, THE SATELLITE

SERVICES BUSINESS, WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES AT IT SOLUTIONS. THE

INCREASE IN 1999 REFLECTED ACQUISITIONS IN THE CORPORATE AUTO FLEET MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONS AND HIGHER REVENUES AT GECAS, LARGELY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN SALES

VOLUME AT THE REMAINING EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES. NET EARNINGS INCREASED

22% IN 2000, FOLLOWING A 15% DECREASE IN 1999. THE INCREASE IN 2000 REFLECTED

VOLUME GROWTH AT GECAS, TRANSPORT INTERNATIONAL POOL AND GE CAPITAL MODULAR

SPACE, FAVORABLE TAX EFFECTS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF ASSET GAINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY LOWER RESULTS AT IT SOLUTIONS. THE DECREASE IN NET EARNINGS IN 1999 REFLECTED

LOWER RESULTS AT IT SOLUTIONS AND THE EUROPEAN EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES,

WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET GROWTH AT GECAS AND AMERICOM.

MID-MARKET FINANCING REVENUES INCREASED 18% IN 2000, FOLLOWING A 26% INCREASE

IN 1999, WHILE NET EARNINGS GREW 22% AND 27%, RESPECTIVELY. FAVORABLE TAX

EFFECTS AND ASSET GROWTH FROM ORIGINATIONS WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO RESULTS IN 2000, WHILE ASSET GROWTH FROM BOTH

ACQUISITIONS AND ORIGINATIONS WAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN

1999.

SPECIALIZED FINANCING REVENUES ROSE 23% AND 37%, WHILE NET EARNINGS INCREASED

21% AND 67% IN 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS GROWTH IN

2000 WAS PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF ORIGINATION GROWTH ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES

WITHIN SPECIALIZED FINANCING. REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS GROWTH IN 1999 WAS

PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF GAINS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS LED BY GE EQUITY,

COMMERCIAL FINANCE AND REAL ESTATE. GE EQUITY EXPERIENCED A HIGH LEVEL OF GAINS

ON SALES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS DURING 1999 AND EARLY 2000.

SPECIALTY INSURANCE REVENUES INCREASED 12% AND 21% IN 2000 AND 1999,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM PREMIUM GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AND

HIGHER PREMIUM INCOME IN 1999 FROM ACQUISITIONS. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS

AMOUNTED TO $639 MILLION, $811 MILLION AND $574 MILLION IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY. INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN 2000, AS HIGHER INTEREST

INCOME MORE THAN OFFSET A DECREASE IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AT GE GLOBAL

INSURANCE (THE PARENT OF EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE).

NET INCOME DECREASED 25% IN 2000, FOLLOWING A 5% INCREASE IN 1999. THE

DECREASE IN 2000 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DETERIORATION OF UNDERWRITING RESULTS AT GE

GLOBAL INSURANCE, REFLECTING HIGHER PROPERTY AND CASUALTY-RELATED LOSSES

(PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO PRIOR-YEAR LOSS

EVENTS, INCLUDING LARGE LOSS EVENTS) AND THE CONTINUED EFFECTS OF LOW PREMIUMS

IN THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE/REINSURANCE INDUSTRY. LOSSES IN 1999 WERE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE LOSS EVENTS. LARGE LOSS EVENTS ARE

INDIVIDUAL EVENTS THAT, AFTER SPECIFIC REINSURANCE RECOVERIES AND RELATED

PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, AFFECT GE GLOBAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS BY $2 MILLION OR

MORE, AND INCLUDE LOSSES FROM EARTHQUAKES, AVIATION AND RAILROAD ACCIDENTS, FIRE

DAMAGE, AND WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE FROM HURRICANES, TORNADOES, WIND AND ICE.

LARGE LOSS EVENTS FOR GE GLOBAL INSURANCE OCCURRING IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998

RESULTED IN LOSSES IN THOSE YEARS OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION, $510 MILLION

AND $150 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A PORTION OF THE 2000 AND 1999 LOSSES WERE

RECOVERED UNDER AGGREGATE RISK COVERAGE OBTAINED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE

REINSURANCE BUSINESS. OVERALL INSURANCE LOSSES FOR SPECIALTY INSURANCE WERE

PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY FAVORABLE EXPERIENCE IN THE MORTGAGE INSURANCE BUSINESS,

PARTICULARLY IN 1999.

ALL OTHER GECS OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF WARDS FROM AUGUST

2, 1999, THROUGH DECEMBER 28, 2000. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN 2000 ALSO

INCLUDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $1,366 MILLION FROM SALE OF GECS INVESTMENT IN COMMON

STOCK OF PAINEWEBBER. THE NET LOSS OF $424 MILLION FOR 2000 COMPRISED THE

PAINEWEBBER AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $848 MILLION, AFTER-TAX CHARGES OF $537 MILLION

RELATED TO WARDS AND AFTER-TAX STRATEGIC RATIONALIZATION COSTS OF $347 MILLION,

STRATEGIC RATIONALIZATION COSTS CONSISTED OF $107 MILLION RELATED TO CONSUMER

SERVICES, $191 MILLION RELATED TO EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT AND $49 MILLION RELATED

TO SPECIALIZED FINANCING.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS THE LARGEST CATEGORY OF ASSETS FOR GECS AND

REPRESENTS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY SOURCES OF REVENUES. THE PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING

RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, INCREASED TO $147.3 BILLION AT THE END

OF 2000 FROM $137.9 BILLION AT THE END OF 1999, AS DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING

PARAGRAPHS. THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AT THE END OF 2000 AMOUNTED TO $4.0

BILLION ($3.7 BILLION AT THE END OF 1999), REPRESENTING MANAGEMENT'S BEST

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO.

IN GECS FINANCING RECEIVABLES, "NONEARNING" RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 90

DAYS OR MORE DELINQUENT (OR FOR WHICH COLLECTION HAS OTHERWISE BECOME DOUBTFUL)

AND "REDUCED-EARNING" RECEIVABLES ARE COMMERCIAL RECEIVABLES WHOSE TERMS HAVE

BEEN RESTRUCTURED TO A BELOW-MARKET YIELD.

CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY CREDIT CARD AND PERSONAL LOANS AND

AUTO LOANS AND LEASES, WERE $48.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000, A DECREASE OF $3.5

BILLION FROM YEAR-END 1999. CREDIT CARD AND PERSONAL RECEIVABLES INCREASED $0.2

BILLION, PRIMARILY FROM ORIGINATION VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES AND

SECURITIZATIONS AND THE NET EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. AUTO

RECEIVABLES DECREASED $3.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE RUN-OFF OF THE

LIQUIDATING AUTO FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO AND THE NET EFFECTS OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION. NONEARNING CONSUMER RECEIVABLES AT YEAR-END 2000 WERE $1.1

BILLION, ABOUT 2.3% OF OUTSTANDINGS, COMPARED WITH $0.9 BILLION, ABOUT 1.8% OF

OUTSTANDINGS AT YEAR-END 1999. WRITE-OFFS OF CONSUMER RECEIVABLES INCREASED TO

$1.3 BILLION FROM $1.2 BILLION FOR 1999, REFLECTING SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF

PRODUCTS AND GLOBAL BUSINESSES. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY TRENDS, CONSUMER

DELINQUENCY RATES INCREASED SOMEWHAT TOWARD THE END OF 2000 FROM THE UNUSUALLY

LOW LEVELS EARLIER IN THE YEAR BUT WERE BELOW YEAR-END 1999 LEVELS.

OTHER FINANCING RECEIVABLES, WHICH TOTALED $98.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2000, CONSISTED OF A DIVERSE COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND EQUIPMENT LOAN AND LEASE

PORTFOLIO. THIS PORTFOLIO INCREASED $12.9 BILLION DURING 2000, REFLECTING

INCREASED ORIGINATIONS AND ACQUISITION GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES AND

SECURITIZATIONS AND THE NET EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. RELATED

NONEARNING AND REDUCED-EARNING RECEIVABLES WERE $0.9 BILLION, ABOUT 1.0% OF

OUTSTANDINGS AT YEAR-END 2000, COMPARED WITH $0.9 BILLION, ABOUT 1.1% OF

OUTSTANDINGS AT YEAR-END 1999.

GECS LOANS AND LEASES TO COMMERCIAL AIRLINES AMOUNTED TO $15.3 BILLION AT THE

END OF 2000, UP FROM $11.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 1999. GECS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

POSITIONS ALSO INCLUDED FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, FUNDING COMMITMENTS AND AIRCRAFT

ORDERS AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

ESTIMATED RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF GE AND GECS

OPERATIONS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES PLUS ALL U.S. EXPORTS. CERTAIN GECS

OPERATIONS THAT CANNOT MEANINGFULLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

ARE CLASSIFIED AS "OTHER INTERNATIONAL" FOR THIS PURPOSE.

INTERNATIONAL REVENUES IN 2000 WERE $53.0 BILLION (41% OF CONSOLIDATED

REVENUES), COMPARED WITH $45.7 BILLION IN 1999 AND $42.5 BILLION IN 1998. THE

GE INTERNATIONAL REVENUES WERE $26.7 BILLION IN 2000, AN INCREASE OF $2.7

BILLION OVER 1999, WHICH WAS $0.3 BILLION LOWER THAN IN 1998. OVER THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD, INTERNATIONAL REVENUES WERE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN HALF OF TOTAL

REVENUES. THE INCREASE IN SUCH REVENUES DURING 2000 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES

GROWTH IN OPERATIONS BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 5%

DECREASE IN U.S. EXPORTS, PRIMARILY AT POWER SYSTEMS. REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS

BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES GREW 19% TO $19.5 BILLION IN 2000. EUROPEAN

REVENUES WERE 8% HIGHER IN 2000, LED BY INCREASES AT POWER SYSTEMS AND PLASTICS.

PACIFIC BASIN REVENUES WERE 39% HIGHER IN 2000, REFLECTING DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH

AT POWER SYSTEMS, MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND PLASTICS. REVENUES FROM THE AMERICAS

(NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, EXCEPT FOR THE UNITED STATES) INCREASED 17%,

REFLECTING DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN BOTH CANADIAN AND LATIN AMERICAN OPERATIONS.

GECS INTERNATIONAL REVENUES WERE $26.3 BILLION IN 2000, AN INCREASE OF 21%

FROM $21.7 BILLION IN 1999. REVENUES IN THE PACIFIC BASIN ALMOST DOUBLED IN

2000, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF GROWTH IN JAPAN, THE RESULT OF THE PURCHASE BY GE

FINANCIAL ASSURANCE OF THE INSURANCE POLICIES AND RELATED ASSETS OF TOHO MUTUAL

LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY (TOHO). "OTHER INTERNATIONAL" REVENUES INCREASED 27% IN

2000, LARGELY A RESULT OF HIGHER REVENUES AT GE CAPITAL AVIATION SERVICES

(GECAS). OVERALL, THESE INCREASES REFLECT THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF GECS AS A

GLOBAL PROVIDER OF A WIDE RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES.

CONSOLIDATED INTERNATIONAL OPERATING PROFIT WAS $6.8 BILLION IN 2000, AN

INCREASE OF 21% OVER 1999, WHICH WAS 9% HIGHER THAN IN 1998. ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATING PROFIT BY REGION IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 29.

TOTAL ASSETS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WERE $159.4 BILLION IN 2000 (37% OF

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS), AN INCREASE OF 13% OVER 1999. THE INCREASE IN 2000

REFLECTED STRONG GROWTH AT GECS IN THE PACIFIC BASIN, PARTICULARLY IN JAPAN,

RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF TOHO DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY. GECS ALSO ACHIEVED

SIGNIFICANT ASSET GROWTH AT GECAS, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS "OTHER INTERNATIONAL."

THE INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF GE AND GECS SPAN ALL GLOBAL REGIONS AND

PRIMARILY ENCOMPASS MANUFACTURING FOR LOCAL AND EXPORT MARKETS, IMPORT AND SALE

OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN OTHER REGIONS, LEASING OF AIRCRAFT, SOURCING FOR GE

PLANTS DOMICILED IN OTHER GLOBAL REGIONS AND PROVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES

WITHIN THESE REGIONAL ECONOMIES. THUS, WHEN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS EXPERIENCE

CURRENCY AND/OR ECONOMIC STRESS, GE MAY HAVE INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN RISKS

BUT ALSO MAY HAVE NEW PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES. POTENTIAL INCREASED RISKS INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER RECEIVABLES DELINQUENCIES AND BAD DEBTS, DELAYS OR

CANCELLATION OF SALES AND ORDERS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO POWER AND AIRCRAFT

EQUIPMENT, HIGHER LOCAL CURRENCY FINANCING COSTS AND A SLOWDOWN IN ESTABLISHED

FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES. NEW PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, LOWER COSTS OF GOODS SOURCED FROM COUNTRIES WITH WEAKENED CURRENCIES,

MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER COST OUTSOURCING, EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL AND

FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES THROUGH PURCHASES OF COMPANIES OR ASSETS AT

REDUCED PRICES AND LOWER U.S. DEBT FINANCING COSTS.

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF GE'S INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS

ARE AFFECTED BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE. A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO MANAGE THE

EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE, INCLUDING SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES

AND SELECTIVE HEDGING OF SIGNIFICANT CROSS-CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. PRINCIPAL

CURRENCIES ARE THE MAJOR EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE EURO, AS WELL AS THE

JAPANESE YEN AND THE CANADIAN DOLLAR. CERTAIN OF GE'S OPERATIONS IN EUROPE WILL

NEED TO BE FULLY EURO-CAPABLE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002. GE IS TAKING APPROPRIATE

ACTIONS TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT AND NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ARE EXPECTED.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

OVERVIEW

THIS DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ADDRESSES THE STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION (PAGE 36), STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY (PAGE

34) AND THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (PAGE 38).

GECS IS NOT A "CAPTIVE FINANCE COMPANY" OR A VEHICLE FOR "OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

FINANCING" FOR GE. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF GECS BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO

OTHER GE OPERATIONS. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GE AND GECS ARE

REFLECTED IN THE MEASUREMENTS COMMONLY USED BY INVESTORS, RATING AGENCIES AND

FINANCIAL ANALYSTS. THESE DIFFERENCES WILL BECOME CLEARER IN THE DISCUSSION THAT

FOLLOWS WITH RESPECT TO THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

BECAUSE GE AND GECS SHARE CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF THEIR STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL POSITION--PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND BORROWINGS, FOR

EXAMPLE--THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES SIGNIFICANT CAPTIONS IN THE

"CONSOLIDATED" STATEMENT. WITHIN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, DISTINCTION

IS DRAWN BETWEEN GE AND GECS ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO PERMIT MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS

OF EACH INDIVIDUAL STATEMENT.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR EACH OF THE PAST TWO YEARS COMPRISED MAINLY

INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE AND THE

SPECIALTY INSURANCE BUSINESSES OF GECS IN SUPPORT OF OBLIGATIONS TO ANNUITANTS

AND POLICYHOLDERS. GE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE $1.0 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000,

A DECREASE OF $0.3 BILLION FROM 1999, REFLECTING DECREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

EQUITY INVESTMENT SECURITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. GECS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE $90.3 BILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH $80.5 BILLION IN

1999. THE INCREASE OF $9.8 BILLION RESULTED FROM THE ADDITION OF SECURITIES FROM

ACQUIRED COMPANIES, INVESTMENT OF PREMIUMS RECEIVED AND INCREASES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF DEBT SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DISPOSITION OF GECS INVESTMENT

IN COMMON STOCK OF PAINEWEBBER AND A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

EQUITY SECURITIES, CONSISTENT WITH MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE NOTE 10 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION.

CURRENT RECEIVABLES FOR GE WERE $9.7 BILLION AT THE END OF 2000, AN INCREASE OF

$1.0 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 1999, AND INCLUDED $6.3 BILLION DUE FROM CUSTOMERS AT

THE END OF 2000, WHICH WAS $0.5 BILLION HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT DUE AT THE END OF

1999. TURNOVER OF CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES FROM SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES WAS 10.0

IN 2000, COMPARED WITH 9.4 IN 1999. OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES ARE PRIMARILY

AMOUNTS THAT DID NOT ORIGINATE FROM SALES OF GE GOODS OR SERVICES, SUCH AS

ADVANCES TO SUPPLIERS IN CONNECTION WITH LARGE CONTRACTS.

INVENTORIES FOR GE WERE $7.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, UP $1.3 BILLION FROM

THE END OF 1999. GE INVENTORY TURNOVER WAS 8.5 IN 2000, AN INCREASE FROM 8.3 IN

1999. ACQUISITIONS OF INVENTORIES IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND VOLUME GROWTH

MORE THAN OFFSET THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS

THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) REVALUATIONS DECREASED $82

MILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH DECREASES OF $84 MILLION IN 1999 AND $87 MILLION

IN 1998. INCLUDED IN THESE CHANGES WERE DECREASES OF $6 MILLION, $4 MILLION AND

$29 MILLION IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY, THAT RESULTED FROM LOWER LIFO

INVENTORY LEVELS. THERE WERE NET COST DECREASES IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS.

INVENTORIES (AT FIFO) AND CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES FROM SALES OF GOODS OR

SERVICES ARE TWO KEY COMPONENTS OF GE'S WORKING CAPITAL TURNOVER MEASUREMENT.

WORKING CAPITAL TURNOVER WAS 24.0 IN 2000, COMPARED WITH 11.5 IN 1999,

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING EFFECTS OF INCREASED PROGRESS COLLECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

PERIOD.

GECS INVENTORIES WERE $666 MILLION AND $1,209 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000

AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN 2000 PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE

DECONSOLIDATION OF WARDS BECAUSE OF ITS BANKRUPTCY FILING.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES OF GECS WERE $143.3 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000, NET OF

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, UP $9.1 BILLION OVER 1999. THESE RECEIVABLES

ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGE 48 AND IN NOTES 13 AND 14.

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF GECS WERE $23.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000, AN INCREASE

OF $4.8 BILLION THAT WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS.

OTHER RECEIVABLES OF GECS, WHICH CONSIST OF TRADE RECEIVABLES, ACCRUED

INVESTMENT INCOME, OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS,

WERE $13.3 BILLION AND $15.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $1.8 BILLION PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE PLANNED

RUN-OFF OF ASSETS FROM THE 1999 ACQUISITION OF JAPAN LEASING CORPORATION.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS) WAS $40.0

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, DOWN $1.0 BILLION FROM 1999. GE PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTS OF INVESTMENTS FOR ITS OWN PRODUCTIVE USE, WHEREAS THE

LARGEST ELEMENT FOR GECS IS IN EQUIPMENT PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES ON OPERATING

LEASES. DETAILS BY CATEGORY OF INVESTMENT ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 16.

F-19

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 51

GE TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR PLANT AND EQUIPMENT DURING 2000 TOTALED $2.5

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.0 BILLION IN 1999. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PAST

FIVE YEARS WERE $11.3 BILLION, OF WHICH 39% WAS INVESTMENT FOR GROWTH THROUGH

NEW CAPACITY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; 32% WAS INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH

NEW EQUIPMENT AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS; AND 29% WAS INVESTMENT FOR SUCH OTHER

PURPOSES AS IMPROVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES AND SAFETY AND

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

GECS ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING EQUIPMENT LEASED

TO OTHERS), WERE $11.4 BILLION DURING 2000 ($13.5 BILLION DURING 1999),

PRIMARILY REFLECTING ACQUISITIONS OF TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE $27.4 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000, UP FROM $26.0 BILLION AT

YEAR-END 1999. GE INTANGIBLES INCREASED TO $12.4 BILLION FROM $11.3 BILLION AT

THE END OF 1999, PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF GOODWILL RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS,

THE LARGEST OF WHICH WERE HARMON INDUSTRIES AND OEC MEDICAL SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AMORTIZATION. GECS INTANGIBLES INCREASED $0.3 BILLION TO $15.0

BILLION, REFLECTING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS,

THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS THE ACQUISITION OF THE INSURANCE POLICIES AND RELATED

ASSETS OF TOHO MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY BY GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AMORTIZATION.

ALL OTHER ASSETS TOTALED $73.9 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000, AN INCREASE OF $8.9

BILLION FROM THE END OF 1999. GE OTHER ASSETS INCREASED $3.2 BILLION,

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE PREPAID PENSION ASSET, HIGHER COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED VOLUME OF LONG-TERM SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND ADDITIONS

TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE. GECS OTHER ASSETS INCREASED $5.7 BILLION AS A RESULT OF

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE VENTURES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES, AND

INCREASES IN "SEPARATE ACCOUNTS" (SEE NOTE 18), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN

ASSETS ACQUIRED FOR RESALE, WHICH REFLECTED SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS IN EXCESS

OF ORIGINATIONS.

CONSOLIDATED BORROWINGS AGGREGATED $201.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, COMPARED

WITH $201.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 1999. THE MAJOR DEBT-RATING AGENCIES EVALUATE

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF GE AND OF GE CAPITAL (THE MAJOR PUBLIC BORROWING

ENTITY OF GECS) DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR DISTINCT BUSINESS CHARACTERISTICS.

USING CRITERIA APPROPRIATE TO EACH AND CONSIDERING THEIR COMBINED STRENGTH,

THOSE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO GIVE THE HIGHEST RATINGS TO DEBT OF BOTH

GE AND GE CAPITAL.

GE HAS COMMITTED TO CONTRIBUTE CAPITAL TO GE CAPITAL IN THE EVENT OF EITHER A

DECREASE BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL IN GE CAPITAL'S RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED

CHARGES, OR A FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A SPECIFIED DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO IN THE EVENT

CERTAIN GE CAPITAL PREFERRED STOCK IS REDEEMED. GE ALSO HAS GUARANTEED

SUBORDINATED DEBT OF GECS WITH A FACE AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2000 AND 1999. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT GE WILL BE REQUIRED TO

CONTRIBUTE CAPITAL UNDER EITHER THE COMMITMENTS OR THE GUARANTEE IS REMOTE.

GE TOTAL BORROWINGS WERE $1.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000 ($0.9 BILLION

SHORT-TERM, $0.9 BILLION LONG-TERM), A DECREASE OF $1.2 BILLION FROM YEAR-END

1999. GE TOTAL DEBT AT THE END OF 2000 EQUALED 3.3% OF TOTAL CAPITAL, DOWN FROM

6.4% AT THE END OF 1999.

GECS TOTAL BORROWINGS WERE $205.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, OF WHICH

$124.0 BILLION IS DUE IN 2001 AND $81.4 BILLION IS DUE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS.

COMPARABLE AMOUNTS AT THE END OF 1999 WERE $200.0 BILLION IN TOTAL, $129.2

BILLION DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR AND $70.8 BILLION DUE THEREAFTER. A LARGE PORTION OF

GECS BORROWINGS ($94.5 BILLION AND $96.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2000 AND 1999,

RESPECTIVELY) WAS ISSUED IN ACTIVE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THAT MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF SHORT-TERM FINANCING. MOST OF

THIS COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS ISSUED BY GE CAPITAL. THE AVERAGE REMAINING TERMS AND

INTEREST RATES OF GE CAPITAL COMMERCIAL PAPER WERE 45 DAYS AND 6.43% AT THE END

OF 2000, COMPARED WITH 53 DAYS AND 5.82% AT THE END OF 1999. THE GE CAPITAL

RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY WAS 7.53 TO 1 AT THE END OF 2000 AND 8.44 TO 1 AT THE

END OF 1999.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT IN THE NORMAL

OPERATIONS OF GE AND GECS. MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, AS WELL AS THE STRATEGIES AND POLICIES FOR THEIR USE, IS PROVIDED

IN NOTES 1, 19 AND 30.

THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS PROVIDE

INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY

EXCHANGE. ALTHOUGH THE RULES OFFER ALTERNATIVES FOR PRESENTING THIS INFORMATION,

NONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES IS WITHOUT LIMITATIONS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS

BASED ON SO-CALLED "SHOCK TESTS," WHICH MODEL EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE AND

CURRENCY SHIFTS ON THE REPORTING COMPANY. SHOCK TESTS, WHILE PROBABLY THE MOST

MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS PERMITTED, ARE CONSTRAINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

NECESSITY TO CONDUCT THE ANALYSIS BASED ON A SINGLE POINT IN TIME AND BY THEIR

INABILITY TO INCLUDE THE COMPLEX MARKET REACTIONS THAT NORMALLY WOULD ARISE FROM

THE MARKET SHIFTS MODELED. WHILE THE FOLLOWING RESULTS OF SHOCK TESTS FOR

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MAY HAVE SOME LIMITED USE

AS BENCHMARKS, THEY SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS FORECASTS.

*  ONE MEANS OF ASSESSING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES IS A DURATION-BASED

ANALYSIS THAT MEASURES THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN NET EARNINGS RESULTING FROM A

HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF 100 BASIS POINTS ACROSS ALL

MATURITIES (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A "PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE").

UNDER THIS MODEL, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT, ALL ELSE CONSTANT, SUCH AN INCREASE,

INCLUDING REPRICING EFFECTS IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WOULD REDUCE THE

2001 NET EARNINGS OF GECS BASED ON YEAR-END 2000 POSITIONS BY APPROXIMATELY

$124 MILLION; THE PRO FORMA EFFECT FOR GE WAS INSIGNIFICANT. BASED ON

POSITIONS AT YEAR-END 1999, THE PRO FORMA EFFECT ON 2000 NET EARNINGS OF SUCH

AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WAS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $105 MILLION

FOR GECS AND $13 MILLION FOR GE.

*  AS SHOWN IN THE CHART TO THE RIGHT, THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF GE AND

GECS OPERATIONS IS DIVERSE. ONE MEANS OF ASSESSING EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IS TO MODEL EFFECTS ON REPORTED EARNINGS USING A

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS. YEAR-END 2000 CONSOLIDATED CURRENCY EXPOSURES,

INCLUDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, WERE

ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY GE AND GECS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER

THAN THEIR RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. NET UNHEDGED EXPOSURES IN EACH

CURRENCY WERE THEN REMEASURED ASSUMING A 10% DECREASE (SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER

DECREASES FOR HYPERINFLATIONARY CURRENCIES) IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

COMPARED WITH THE U.S. DOLLAR. UNDER THIS MODEL, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT, ALL

ELSE CONSTANT, SUCH A DECREASE WOULD HAVE AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE 2001

NET EARNINGS OF GE AND GECS BASED ON YEAR-END 2000 POSITIONS. BASED ON

CONDITIONS AT YEAR-END 1999, THE EFFECT ON 2000 NET EARNINGS OF SUCH A

DECREASE IN EXCHANGE RATES WAS ESTIMATED TO BE INSIGNIFICANT FOR GE AND GECS.

INSURANCE LIABILITIES, RESERVES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS WERE $106.2 BILLION, $19.4

BILLION HIGHER THAN IN 1999. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

ADDITION OF LIABILITIES FROM ACQUISITIONS, INCREASES IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS, AND

GROWTH IN GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE

LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 20.

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY

SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY INCREASED $7,935 MILLION TO $50,492 MILLION AT YEAR-END

2000. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET EARNINGS DURING THE PERIOD OF

$12,735 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS OF $5,647 MILLION.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS REDUCED EQUITY BY $1,204 MILLION IN 2000.

CHANGES IN THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON GE'S NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT

HAVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE DECREASE DURING 2000

LARGELY REFLECTED CONTINUED WEAKENING IN THE EURO. ACCUMULATED CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AFFECT NET EARNINGS ONLY WHEN ALL OR A PORTION OF AN

AFFILIATE IS DISPOSED OF.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

BECAUSE CASH MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES OF GE AND GECS ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT, IT

IS MORE USEFUL TO REVIEW THEIR CASH FLOWS SEPARATELY.

GE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AGGREGATED $7.2 BILLION AT THE END OF 2000, UP FROM $2.0

BILLION AT YEAR-END 1999. DURING 2000, GE GENERATED A RECORD $15.4 BILLION IN

CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, A 31% INCREASE OVER 1999. THE INCREASE REFLECTED

IMPROVEMENTS IN EARNINGS AND WORKING CAPITAL, THE LATTER PRINCIPALLY FROM

PROGRESS COLLECTIONS. THE 2000 CASH GENERATION PROVIDED THE NECESSARY RESOURCES

TO PURCHASE $2.2 BILLION OF GE COMMON STOCK UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM,

TO PAY $5.4 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS TO SHARE OWNERS, TO INVEST $2.5 BILLION IN

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO MAKE $1.2 BILLION IN ACQUISITIONS.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF GE'S CASH FLOWS. OVER THE

PAST THREE YEARS, OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAVE PROVIDED MORE THAN $37 BILLION OF

CASH. THE PRINCIPAL APPLICATION OF THIS CASH WAS DISTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY

$22 BILLION TO SHARE OWNERS, BOTH THROUGH PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ($13.9 BILLION)

AND THROUGH THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ($7.7 BILLION) DESCRIBED BELOW. OTHER

APPLICATIONS INCLUDED INVESTMENT IN PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($6.6 BILLION) AND

ACQUISITIONS ($4.2 BILLION).

UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM INITIATED IN DECEMBER 1994, GE HAS

PURCHASED MORE THAN $17 BILLION OF GE STOCK--OVER 950 MILLION SHARES THROUGH

2000. IN DECEMBER 1999, GE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE AMOUNT AUTHORIZED

FROM $17 BILLION TO $22 BILLION. FUNDS USED FOR THE SHARE REPURCHASE ARE

EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED LARGELY FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW.

BASED ON PAST PERFORMANCE AND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, IN COMBINATION WITH THE

FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY THAT COMES WITH A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND THE HIGHEST

CREDIT RATINGS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT GE IS IN A SOUND POSITION TO COMPLETE

THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, TO GROW DIVIDENDS IN LINE WITH EARNINGS, AND TO

CONTINUE MAKING SELECTIVE INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH. EXPENDITURES FOR

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $2.9 BILLION IN 2001, PRINCIPALLY

FOR PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH.

GECS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AGGREGATED $6.1 BILLION AT THE END OF 2000, DOWN FROM

$6.9 BILLION AT YEAR-END 1999 PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF LIQUIDATION OF

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $13.2 BILLION OF CASH ACQUIRED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE INSURANCE POLICIES AND RELATED ASSETS OF

THE TOHO MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY. THE CASH ACQUIRED WITH TOHO IS SHOWN AS

CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. PAYDOWN OF THE ACQUIRED TOHO INSURANCE POLICIES

($4.4 BILLION IN 2000) APPEARS AS A USAGE UNDER THE CAPTION "INSURANCE

LIABILITIES AND RESERVES" AND WAS A PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE DECREASE IN GECS CASH

FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2000.

ONE OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH FOR GECS IS FINANCING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING

THE CONTINUED ROLLOVER OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND APPROPRIATE ADDITION OF

BORROWINGS WITH A REASONABLE BALANCE OF MATURITIES. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS,

GECS BORROWINGS WITH MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS HAVE INCREASED BY $21.5

BILLION. NEW BORROWINGS OF $135.9 BILLION HAVING MATURITIES LONGER THAN 90 DAYS

WERE ADDED DURING THOSE YEARS, WHILE $89.9 BILLION OF SUCH LONGER-TERM

BORROWINGS WERE RETIRED. GECS ALSO GENERATED $35.1 BILLION FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES.

================================================================================

THE PRINCIPAL USE OF CASH BY GECS HAS BEEN INVESTING IN ASSETS TO GROW ITS

BUSINESSES. OF THE $109.7 BILLION THAT GECS INVESTED OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS,

$34.7 BILLION WAS USED FOR ADDITIONS TO FINANCING RECEIVABLES; $31.8 BILLION WAS

USED TO INVEST IN NEW EQUIPMENT, PRINCIPALLY FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; AND $28.4

BILLION WAS USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF NEW BUSINESSES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WERE

JAPAN LEASING AND THE CREDIT CARD OPERATIONS OF JC PENNEY, BOTH IN 1999.

WITH THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY THAT COMES WITH EXCELLENT CREDIT RATINGS,

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT GECS SHOULD BE WELL POSITIONED TO MEET THE GLOBAL NEEDS

OF ITS CUSTOMERS FOR CAPITAL AND TO CONTINUE PROVIDING GE SHARE OWNERS WITH GOOD

RETURNS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA SUMMARIZED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE

SECTIONS: UPPER PORTION--CONSOLIDATED DATA; MIDDLE PORTION--GE DATA THAT REFLECT

VARIOUS CONVENTIONAL MEASUREMENTS FOR SUCH ENTERPRISES; AND LOWER PORTION--GECS

DATA THAT REFLECT KEY INFORMATION PERTINENT TO FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES.

GE'S TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $2,193 MILLION IN 2000, UP

9% OVER 1999 AND 1998. IN 2000, EXPENDITURES FROM GE'S OWN FUNDS WERE $1,867

MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 12% OVER 1999, REFLECTING CONTINUING RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT WORK RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT, SERVICE AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES.

PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY EFFORTS IN 2000 INCLUDED CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT WORK ON THE

NEXT GENERATION OF GAS TURBINES, FURTHER ADVANCES IN STATE-OF-THE-ART DIAGNOSTIC

IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT, COST-EFFECTIVE

AIRCRAFT ENGINE DESIGNS. SERVICES TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTIC

PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED CAPACITY FOR MANUFACTURING ENGINEERED MATERIALS.

EXPENDITURES FUNDED BY CUSTOMERS (MAINLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT) WERE $326 MILLION

IN 2000, DOWN $24 MILLION FROM 1999.

GE'S TOTAL BACKLOG OF FIRM UNFILLED ORDERS AT THE END OF 2000 WAS $44.2 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF 36% OVER 1999, REFLECTING STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH AT POWER

SYSTEMS, AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND MEDICAL SYSTEMS. OF THE TOTAL, $36.7 BILLION

RELATED TO PRODUCTS, OF WHICH 71% WAS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY IN 2001. SERVICES

ORDERS, INCLUDED IN THIS REPORTED BACKLOG FOR ONLY THE SUCCEEDING 12 MONTHS,

WERE $7.5 BILLION AT THE END OF 2000. ORDERS CONSTITUTING THIS BACKLOG MAY BE

CANCELED OR DEFERRED BY CUSTOMERS, SUBJECT IN CERTAIN CASES TO PENALTIES. SEE

SEGMENT OPERATIONS BEGINNING ON PAGE 43 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, GE'S OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER

COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES, INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP

OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS.

IN 2000, GE EXPENDED ABOUT $48 MILLION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS RELATED TO THE

ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT IN 1999 WAS $66 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS

EXCLUDE EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIONS, WHICH ARE PRINCIPALLY EXPENSED AND

ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE

INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES--SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS,

GROUNDWATER MONITORING DEVICES, AIR STRIPPERS OR SEPARATORS, AND

INCINERATORS--AT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE

NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY, AVERAGE ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION

PROJECTS ARE PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $55 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

THIS LEVEL IS IN LINE WITH EXISTING LEVELS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD

FACILITIES OR MODIFY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE

EMISSIONS.

GE ALSO IS INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP

HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE

THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY

OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE

REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $128 MILLION IN 2000, COMPARED

WITH $114 MILLION IN 1999. IT IS PRESENTLY EXPECTED THAT SUCH REMEDIATION

ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF $90 MILLION TO

$150 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

---------------------------------------------

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

---------------------------------------------

CONSOLIDATION. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE ADDING

TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES--COMPANIES THAT GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY CONTROLS. RESULTS OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES--GENERALLY COMPANIES THAT

ARE 20% TO 50% OWNED AND OVER WHICH GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY, HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE--ARE INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ON A "ONE-LINE" BASIS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. FINANCIAL DATA AND RELATED MEASUREMENTS ARE

PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

*  GE. THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OTHER THAN GENERAL

ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. (GECS), WHOSE OPERATIONS ARE PRESENTED ON A

ONE-LINE BASIS.

*  GECS. THIS AFFILIATE OWNS ALL OF THE COMMON STOCK OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL

CORPORATION (GE CAPITAL) AND GE GLOBAL INSURANCE HOLDING CORPORATION (GE

GLOBAL INSURANCE), THE PARENT OF EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE CORPORATION. GE

CAPITAL, GE GLOBAL INSURANCE AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARE CONSOLIDATED

IN THE GECS COLUMNS AND CONSTITUTE ITS BUSINESS.

*  CONSOLIDATED. THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF GE AND GECS.

THE EFFECTS OF TRANSACTIONS AMONG RELATED COMPANIES WITHIN AND BETWEEN EACH OF

THE ABOVE-MENTIONED GROUPS ARE ELIMINATED. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GECS ARE

NOT MATERIAL.

CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE 2000

PRESENTATION.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES. A SALE IS RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE

CUSTOMER OR WHEN SERVICES ARE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTS. SALES

UNDER COMPLEX CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED FAIR

VALUE OF EACH COMPONENT OF THE CONTRACT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME). INCOME ON ALL LOANS IS RECOGNIZED

ON THE INTEREST METHOD. ACCRUAL OF INTEREST INCOME IS SUSPENDED AT THE EARLIER

OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT

BECOMES 90 DAYS DELINQUENT. INTEREST INCOME ON IMPAIRED LOANS IS RECOGNIZED

EITHER AS CASH IS COLLECTED OR ON A COST-RECOVERY BASIS AS CONDITIONS WARRANT.

FINANCING LEASE INCOME IS RECORDED ON THE INTEREST METHOD SO AS TO PRODUCE A

LEVEL YIELD ON FUNDS NOT YET RECOVERED. ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES

OF LEASED ASSETS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON PERIODIC INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS OF THE

VALUES OF LEASED ASSETS REMAINING AT EXPIRATION OF THE LEASE TERMS.

OPERATING LEASE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS

OF UNDERLYING LEASES.

ORIGINATION, COMMITMENT AND OTHER NONREFUNDABLE FEES RELATED TO FUNDINGS ARE

DEFERRED AND RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD. COMMITMENT FEES

RELATED TO LOANS NOT EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED AND LINE-OF-CREDIT FEES ARE DEFERRED

AND RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PERIOD TO WHICH

THE FEES RELATE. SYNDICATION FEES ARE RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME AT THE TIME

RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED UNLESS SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES EXIST.

INCOME FROM INVESTMENT AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES IS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 57.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. THE COST OF MOST OF GE'S MANUFACTURING PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED USING AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED PRIMARILY ON A

SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA.

THE COST OF GECS EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS ON OPERATING LEASES IS AMORTIZED,

PRINCIPALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER THE LEASE

TERM OR OVER THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT. DEPRECIATION OF

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT USED BY GECS IS RECORDED ON EITHER A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS

DIGITS FORMULA OR A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIVES OF THE ASSETS.

RECOGNITION OF LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON

SMALL-BALANCE RECEIVABLES REFLECTS MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO DETERMINED PRINCIPALLY ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE. FOR OTHER RECEIVABLES, PRINCIPALLY THE LARGER LOANS AND LEASES, THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENT'S BEST

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES, INCLUDING SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR KNOWN TROUBLED

ACCOUNTS.

ALL ACCOUNTS OR PORTIONS THEREOF DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE OR TO REQUIRE AN

EXCESSIVE COLLECTION COST ARE WRITTEN OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES.

SMALL-BALANCE ACCOUNTS GENERALLY ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN 6 TO 12 MONTHS DELINQUENT,

ALTHOUGH ANY SUCH BALANCE JUDGED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, SUCH AS AN ACCOUNT IN

BANKRUPTCY, IS WRITTEN DOWN IMMEDIATELY TO ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE.

LARGE-BALANCE ACCOUNTS ARE REVIEWED AT LEAST QUARTERLY, AND THOSE ACCOUNTS WITH

AMOUNTS THAT ARE JUDGED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO ESTIMATED

REALIZABLE VALUE.

WHEN COLLATERAL IS REPOSSESSED IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN, THE RECEIVABLE IS

WRITTEN DOWN AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE

ASSET LESS COSTS TO SELL, TRANSFERRED TO OTHER ASSETS AND SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED

AT THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. THIS ACCOUNTING

METHOD HAS BEEN EMPLOYED PRINCIPALLY FOR SPECIALIZED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS. DEBT SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS ARE INCLUDED IN CASH EQUIVALENTS UNLESS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE

AND CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE BASED PRIMARILY ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR, IF QUOTED

PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING MARKET RATES

COMMENSURATE WITH CREDIT QUALITY AND MATURITY OF THE INVESTMENT. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE, WITH UNREALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY, NET OF APPLICABLE TAXES AND

OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT ARE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY ARE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

INVENTORIES. ALL INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR REALIZABLE

VALUES. COST FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OF GE'S U.S. INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A

LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) BASIS. COST OF OTHER GE INVENTORIES IS PRIMARILY

DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS.

GECS INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINISHED PRODUCTS HELD FOR SALE. COST

IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED ON A FIFO BASIS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL IS AMORTIZED OVER ITS ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT ON

A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS; OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON APPROPRIATE

BASES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED LIVES. NO AMORTIZATION PERIOD EXCEEDS 40 YEARS. WHEN

AN INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ASSOCIATED EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS, IT IS

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED AND IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DETERMINED

BASED ON EITHER DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT. UPON ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, ON JANUARY 1, 2001, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND PORTIONS OF

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WILL BE DEFINED TO BE DERIVATIVES. AFTER THAT DATE,

ALL DERIVATIVES WILL BE CARRIED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES, AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUES WILL AFFECT NET EARNINGS OR SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY IMMEDIATELY.

AS A MATTER OF POLICY, NEITHER GE NOR GECS ENGAGES IN DERIVATIVES TRADING,

DERIVATIVES MARKET-MAKING OR OTHER SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES.

GE AND GECS USE SWAPS PRIMARILY TO OPTIMIZE FUNDING COSTS. TO A LESSER

DEGREE, AND IN COMBINATION WITH OPTIONS AND LIMIT CONTRACTS, GECS USES SWAPS TO

STABILIZE CASH FLOWS FROM MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS.

DESIGNATED INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS, FORWARDS AND LIMIT CONTRACTS

THAT MODIFY BORROWINGS OR CERTAIN ASSETS, AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS

FORECASTED COMMERCIAL PAPER RENEWALS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS.

BOTH GE AND GECS REQUIRE ALL OTHER SWAPS, AS WELL AS FUTURES, OPTIONS AND

CURRENCY FORWARDS, TO BE DESIGNATED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF SPECIFIC

ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FIRM COMMITMENTS; RESULTING PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS ARE

RECOGNIZED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH EFFECTS OF HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. A PAYMENT OR

RECEIPT ARISING FROM EARLY TERMINATION OF AN EFFECTIVE HEDGE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS

AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASIS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.

INSTRUMENTS USED AS HEDGES MUST BE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED AND MUST BE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE AT THE

INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OF HEDGE

INSTRUMENTS MUST BE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OF

UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS, BOTH AT INCEPTION OF THE HEDGE AND OVER THE LIFE OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT.

AS A MATTER OF POLICY, ANY DERIVATIVE THAT IS EITHER NOT DESIGNATED AS A

HEDGE, OR IS SO DESIGNATED BUT IS INEFFECTIVE, IS MARKED TO MARKET AND

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY.

GECS INSURANCE ACCOUNTING POLICIES. ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR GECS INSURANCE

BUSINESSES FOLLOW.

PREMIUM INCOME. INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE REPORTED AS EARNED INCOME AS FOLLOWS.

*  FOR SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS (INCLUDING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY,

ACCIDENT AND HEALTH, AND FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE), PREMIUMS ARE REPORTED

AS EARNED INCOME, GENERALLY ON A PRO-RATA BASIS, OVER THE TERMS OF THE

RELATED AGREEMENTS. FOR RETROSPECTIVELY RATED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS, PREMIUM

ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON ESTIMATED LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES, TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH CASE AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED RESERVES.

*  FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS (INCLUDING TERM AND WHOLE

LIFE CONTRACTS AND ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ANNUITANT), PREMIUMS

ARE REPORTED AS EARNED INCOME WHEN DUE.

*  FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS, PREMIUMS RECEIVED ARE

REPORTED AS LIABILITIES, NOT AS REVENUES. UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS ARE

LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT ARE NOT FIXED AND

GUARANTEED; FOR THESE CONTRACTS, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR ASSESSMENTS

AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDER'S ACCOUNT, MOSTLY FOR MORTALITY, CONTRACT

INITIATION, ADMINISTRATION AND SURRENDER. INVESTMENT CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS

THAT HAVE NEITHER SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY NOR SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY RISK,

INCLUDING ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR A DETERMINED PERIOD; FOR THESE CONTRACTS,

REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE ASSOCIATED INVESTMENTS AND AMOUNTS CREDITED TO

POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 58

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS. COSTS THAT VARY WITH AND ARE PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF NEW AND RENEWAL INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS

ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE RESPECTIVE POLICY TERMS. FOR SHORT-DURATION

INSURANCE CONTRACTS, ACQUISITION COSTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMMISSIONS,

BROKERAGE EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. FOR LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS,

THESE COSTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIRST-YEAR COMMISSIONS IN EXCESS OF RECURRING

RENEWAL COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN VARIABLE SALES EXPENSES AND CERTAIN SUPPORT COSTS

SUCH AS UNDERWRITING AND POLICY ISSUE EXPENSES.

*  FOR SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, THESE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED PRO RATA

OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED.

*  FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, THESE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED

OVER THE RESPECTIVE CONTRACT PERIODS IN PROPORTION TO EITHER ANTICIPATED

PREMIUM INCOME OR, IN THE CASE OF LIMITED-PAYMENT CONTRACTS, ESTIMATED

BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

*  FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS, THESE COSTS ARE

AMORTIZED ON THE BASIS OF ANTICIPATED GROSS PROFITS.

PERIODICALLY, DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED FOR RECOVERABILITY;

ANTICIPATED INVESTMENT INCOME IS CONSIDERED IN RECOVERABILITY EVALUATIONS.

PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS. THE ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED PRESENT VALUE OF

ANTICIPATED NET CASH FLOWS TO BE REALIZED FROM INSURANCE, ANNUITY AND INVESTMENT

CONTRACTS IN FORCE AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION OF LIFE INSURANCE ENTERPRISES IS

RECORDED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS AND IS AMORTIZED OVER THE

RESPECTIVE POLICY TERMS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION

COSTS. UNAMORTIZED BALANCES ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT EXPERIENCE AND IMPAIRMENT,

IF ANY.

6 PENSION BENEFITS

---------------------------------------------

GE AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR A NUMBER OF PENSION PLANS. PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS

ARE DISCUSSED BELOW; OTHER PENSION PLANS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUALLY OR IN

THE AGGREGATE.

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS ARE THE GE PENSION PLAN AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION

PLAN.

THE GE PENSION PLAN PROVIDES BENEFITS TO CERTAIN U.S. EMPLOYEES BASED ON THE

GREATER OF A FORMULA RECOGNIZING CAREER EARNINGS OR A FORMULA RECOGNIZING LENGTH

OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE EARNINGS. BENEFIT PROVISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. THE GE PENSION PLAN COVERS APPROXIMATELY 485,000

PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING 134,000 EMPLOYEES, 156,000 FORMER EMPLOYEES WITH VESTED

RIGHTS TO FUTURE BENEFITS, AND 195,000 RETIREES AND BENEFICIARIES RECEIVING

BENEFITS.

THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN IS A PAY-AS-YOU-GO PLAN PROVIDING

SUPPLEMENTARY RETIREMENT BENEFITS PRIMARILY TO HIGHER-LEVEL, LONGER-SERVICE U.S.

EMPLOYEES.

FUNDING POLICY FOR THE GE PENSION PLAN IS TO CONTRIBUTE AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO

MEET MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AS SET FORTH IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND TAX LAWS

PLUS SUCH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS AS GE MAY DETERMINE TO BE APPROPRIATE. GE HAS NOT

MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN SINCE 1987 BECAUSE THE FULLY FUNDED

STATUS OF THE PLAN PRECLUDES A CURRENT TAX DEDUCTION AND BECAUSE ANY GE

CONTRIBUTION WOULD REQUIRE PAYMENT OF EXCISE TAXES.

CONSOLIDATED CURRENT TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FEDERAL

INCOME TAXES OF $3,005 MILLION, $1,632 MILLION AND $1,459 MILLION IN 2000, 1999

AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY, AND AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS OF

$1,246 MILLION, $1,399 MILLION AND $1,335 MILLION IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998,

DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES REFLECT THE IMPACT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES AND

ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN TAXES ARE ACTUALLY

PAID OR RECOVERED. SEE NOTE 22 FOR DETAILS.

EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EARNINGS THAT GE INTENDS TO REINVEST INDEFINITELY,

PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE ESTIMATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES

APPLICABLE TO UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES. IT

IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY, IF ANY,

THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SALES OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ENGINES

OFTEN INVOLVE LONG-TERM CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS. IN MAKING SUCH

COMMITMENTS, IT IS GE'S GENERAL PRACTICE TO REQUIRE THAT IT HAVE OR BE ABLE TO

ESTABLISH A SECURED POSITION IN THE AIRCRAFT BEING FINANCED. UNDER SUCH AIRLINE

FINANCING PROGRAMS, GE HAD ISSUED LOANS AND GUARANTEES (PRINCIPALLY GUARANTEES)

AMOUNTING TO $1,160 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2000 AND $1,453 MILLION AT YEAR-END

1999; AND IT HAD ENTERED INTO COMMITMENTS TOTALING $1,476 MILLION AND $1,843

MILLION AT YEAR-END 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

ON FUTURE AIRCRAFT ENGINE SALES. ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE AIRCRAFT SECURING

THESE RECEIVABLES AND ASSOCIATED GUARANTEES EXCEEDED THE RELATED ACCOUNT

BALANCES AND GUARANTEED AMOUNTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2000. GECS ACTS AS A LENDER AND

LESSOR TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999, THE

BALANCE OF SUCH GECS LOANS, LEASES AND EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS WAS $15.3

BILLION AND $11.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, GECS

HAD ISSUED FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND FUNDING COMMITMENTS OF $601 MILLION ($59

MILLION AT YEAR-END 1999) AND HAD PLACED MULTI-YEAR ORDERS FOR VARIOUS BOEING

AND AIRBUS AIRCRAFT WITH LIST PRICES OF APPROXIMATELY $22.9 BILLION ($9.9

BILLION AT YEAR-END 1999).

AT YEAR-END 2000, THE NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY HAD $7,631 MILLION OF

COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE BROADCAST MATERIAL AND THE RIGHTS TO BROADCAST TELEVISION

PROGRAMS, INCLUDING U.S. TELEVISION RIGHTS TO FUTURE OLYMPIC GAMES, AND

COMMITMENTS UNDER LONG-TERM TELEVISION STATION AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS THAT

REQUIRE PAYMENTS THROUGH THE YEAR 2010.

IN CONNECTION WITH NUMEROUS PROJECTS, PRIMARILY POWER GENERATION BIDS AND

CONTRACTS, GE HAD ISSUED VARIOUS BID AND PERFORMANCE BONDS AND GUARANTEES

TOTALING $4,599 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2000 AND $3,794 MILLION AT YEAR-END 1999.

YEAR-END 2000. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF GE'S CREDIT LINES ARE AVAILABLE TO GECS AND

ITS AFFILIATES IN ADDITION TO THEIR OWN CREDIT LINES.

AT YEAR-END 2000, GECS AND ITS AFFILIATES HELD COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT

AGGREGATING $28.1 BILLION, INCLUDING $12.2 BILLION OF REVOLVING CREDIT

AGREEMENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH IT HAS THE RIGHT TO BORROW FUNDS FOR PERIODS

EXCEEDING ONE YEAR. AMOUNTS DRAWN BY GECS UNDER THESE LINES AT DECEMBER 31,

2000, WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. BOTH GE AND GECS COMPENSATE CERTAIN BANKS FOR CREDIT

FACILITIES IN THE FORM OF FEES, WHICH WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN EACH OF THE PAST

THREE YEARS.

INTEREST RATE RISK IS MANAGED BY GECS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED BEHAVIOR,

INCLUDING PREPAYMENT BEHAVIOR, OF ASSETS IN WHICH DEBT PROCEEDS ARE INVESTED. A

VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS AND CURRENCY

FORWARDS, ARE EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE MANAGEMENT'S INTEREST RATE OBJECTIVES.

EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES ARE LOWER UNDER THESE "SYNTHETIC" POSITIONS THAN COULD

HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY ISSUING DEBT DIRECTLY.

OPERATIONS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN GECS CEDES INSURANCE TO THIRD PARTIES, IT IS NOT RELIEVED OF ITS PRIMARY

OBLIGATION TO POLICYHOLDERS. LOSSES ON CEDED RISKS GIVE RISE TO CLAIMS FOR

RECOVERY; ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR SUCH RECEIVABLES FROM REINSURERS.

THE INSURANCE LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

RELATED TO POLICIES THAT MAY COVER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS EXPOSURES IS BASED

ON KNOWN FACTS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF APPLICABLE LAW AND COVERAGE LITIGATION.

LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR BOTH KNOWN AND UNASSERTED CLAIMS (INCLUDING THE

COST OF RELATED LITIGATION) WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO

INDICATE THAT A CLAIM HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DEVELOPED CASE LAW AND ADEQUATE CLAIM HISTORY DO NOT EXIST

FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AS TO BOTH THE

LEVEL OF ULTIMATE LOSSES THAT WILL OCCUR AND WHAT PORTION, IF ANY, WILL BE

DEEMED TO BE INSURED AMOUNTS.

21 GE ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

---------------------------------------------

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES NONCURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT ACCRUALS AT YEAR-END

2000 AND 1999 OF $6,268 MILLION AND $5,839 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALSO INCLUDED

ARE AMOUNTS FOR DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, DEFERRED INCOME, PRODUCT

WARRANTIES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS.

GE IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES

AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT EACH

SITE ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATE OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE COSTS,

EXCLUDING POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERIES. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF

POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOWER END OF

SUCH RANGE. UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE STATUS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND

INFORMATION RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SITES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A

MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION EXPOSURE. HOWEVER, EVEN IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT REMEDIATION COSTS

AMOUNTED TO THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF COSTS FOR EACH SITE, THE RESULTING

ADDITIONAL LIABILITY WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO GE'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

30 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

---------------------------------------------

THIS NOTE CONTAINS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO

WHICH GE AND GECS ARE PARTIES. APART FROM CERTAIN BORROWINGS BY GE AND GECS AND

CERTAIN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, RELATIVELY FEW OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE ACTIVELY

TRADED. THUS, FAIR VALUES MUST OFTEN BE DETERMINED BY USING ONE OR MORE MODELS

THAT INDICATE VALUE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF QUANTIFIABLE CHARACTERISTICS AS OF A

PARTICULAR DATE. BECAUSE THIS UNDERTAKING IS, BY ITS NATURE, DIFFICULT AND

HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL, FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS, ALTERNATIVE VALUATION

TECHNIQUES MAY HAVE PRODUCED DISCLOSED VALUES DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT COULD

HAVE BEEN REALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 OR 1999. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT, AS

A MATTER OF ACCOUNTING POLICY, ARE REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES; SUCH

ITEMS INCLUDE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS.

A DESCRIPTION OF HOW VALUES ARE ESTIMATED FOLLOWS.

BORROWINGS. BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR MARKET COMPARABLES. FAIR VALUES OF

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS ON BORROWINGS ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES

AND INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF COUNTERPARTY CREDITWORTHINESS.

TIME SALES AND LOANS. BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, RECENT TRANSACTIONS AND/OR

DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, USING RATES AT WHICH SIMILAR LOANS WOULD HAVE BEEN

MADE TO SIMILAR BORROWERS.

INVESTMENT CONTRACT BENEFITS. BASED ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT

CURRENTLY OFFERED DISCOUNT RATES FOR IMMEDIATE ANNUITY CONTRACTS OR CASH

SURRENDER VALUES FOR SINGLE PREMIUM DEFERRED ANNUITIES.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND CREDIT LIFE. BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS, CONSIDERING

EXPECTED RENEWAL PREMIUMS, CLAIMS, REFUNDS AND SERVICING COSTS, DISCOUNTED AT A

MARKET RATE.

ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS. BASED ON COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, MARKET COMPARABLES,

DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, QUOTED MARKET PRICES, AND/OR ESTIMATES OF THE COST

TO TERMINATE OR OTHERWISE SETTLE OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE TABLE ABOVE

FOLLOWS.

CURRENCY FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS ARE EMPLOYED BY GE AND GECS TO MANAGE

EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL

PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS AND BY GECS TO OPTIMIZE BORROWING COSTS AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19. THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY ARE USED TO FIX THE

CASH FLOW VARIABILITY OF LOCAL CURRENCY COSTS OR SELLING PRICES DENOMINATED IN

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT RESULT

FROM NET INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES ARE MANAGED PRINCIPALLY BY FUNDING ASSETS

DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCY WITH DEBT DENOMINATED IN THOSE SAME CURRENCIES. IN

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, NET INVESTMENT EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED USING CURRENCY

FORWARDS AND CURRENCY SWAPS.

F-44

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 76

OPTIONS AND INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING OPTION FEATURES THAT BEHAVE BASED ON LIMITS

("CAPS," "FLOORS" OR "COLLARS") ON INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY MOVEMENTS ARE USED

PRIMARILY TO MANAGE RISKS IN CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS RISKS IN CERTAIN

GECS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE SERVICING AND ANNUITIES.

SWAPS OF INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCIES ARE USED BY GE AND GECS TO OPTIMIZE

FUNDING COSTS FOR A PARTICULAR FUNDING STRATEGY (SEE NOTE 19). A CANCELABLE

INTEREST RATE SWAP WAS USED BY GE TO HEDGE AN INVESTMENT POSITION. INTEREST RATE

SWAPS, ALONG WITH PURCHASED OPTIONS AND FUTURES, ARE USED BY GECS TO ESTABLISH

SPECIFIC HEDGES OF MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS. CREDIT RISK OF THESE POSITIONS IS

EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT UNDER THE CREDIT CRITERIA DISCUSSED BELOW. AS PART OF

ITS ONGOING ACTIVITIES, GECS ALSO ENTERS INTO SWAPS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO

INVESTMENTS IN OR LOANS TO PARTICULAR CUSTOMERS. SUCH INTEGRATED SWAPS NOT

INVOLVING ASSUMPTION OF THIRD-PARTY CREDIT RISK ARE EVALUATED AND MONITORED LIKE

THEIR ASSOCIATED INVESTMENTS OR LOANS AND ARE NOT THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE SAME

CREDIT CRITERIA THAT WOULD APPLY TO A STAND-ALONE POSITION.

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK--RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL BE FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO

MAKE PAYMENTS ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS--IS THE PRINCIPAL RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH SWAPS, PURCHASED OPTIONS AND FORWARDS. GROSS MARKET VALUE OF

PROBABLE FUTURE RECEIPTS IS ONE WAY TO MEASURE THIS RISK, BUT IS MEANINGFUL ONLY

IN THE CONTEXT OF NET CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES. AT DECEMBER

31, 2000 AND 1999, THIS GROSS MARKET RISK AMOUNTED TO $2.9 BILLION AND $2.0

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AGGREGATE FAIR VALUES THAT REPRESENT ASSOCIATED PROBABLE

FUTURE OBLIGATIONS, NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A RIGHT OF OFFSET AGAINST PROBABLE

FUTURE RECEIPTS, AMOUNTED TO $3.7 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2000 AND $3.6 BILLION AT

YEAR-END 1999.

EXCEPT AS NOTED ABOVE FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO FINANCINGS, ALL

SWAPS, PURCHASED OPTIONS AND FORWARDS ARE CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE FOLLOWING

CREDIT POLICY CONSTRAINTS.

*  ONCE A COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS (SEE TABLE BELOW), NO

ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS ARE PERMITTED UNTIL THE EXPOSURE WITH THAT

COUNTERPARTY IS REDUCED TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED LIMIT.

FOR GE, GROSS PROFIT FROM SALES IS SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES LESS COSTS OF

GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD. FOR GECS, OPERATING PROFIT IS "EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME

TAXES."

EARNINGS-PER-SHARE AMOUNTS FOR EACH QUARTER ARE REQUIRED

TO BE COMPUTED INDEPENDENTLY. AS A RESULT, THEIR SUM DOES NOT EQUAL THE TOTAL

YEAR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE AMOUNTS FOR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2000 AND 1999,

AND FOR BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2000. PER-SHARE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED

FOR THE 3-FOR-1 STOCK SPLIT EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 27, 2000.
