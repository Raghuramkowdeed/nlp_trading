THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN

ON APRIL 10, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A PLAN (THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN) TO CREATE A SIMPLE, MORE VALUABLE COMPANY BY REDUCING THE SIZE OF ITS FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES THROUGH THE SALE OF MOST OF THE ASSETS OF GE CAPITAL AND ALIGNING A SMALLER GE CAPITAL WITH GE'S INDUSTRIAL GROWTH. WE EXPECT GE CAPITAL TO RELEASE APPROXIMATELY $35 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS TO GE (SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL) AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF GE CAPITAL ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE ARE AHEAD OF OUR PLAN, HAVING SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH BUYERS FOR $157 BILLION OF ENDING NET INVESTMENT (ENI), EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY OF WHICH $104 BILLION HAS CLOSED. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR INITIATIVE TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, WE COMPLETED THE SPLIT-OFF OF OUR REMAINING INTEREST IN GE CAPITAL'S NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL FINANCE BUSINESS, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL, TO HOLDERS OF GE COMMON STOCK, WHICH RESULTED IN A $20.4 BILLION BUYBACK OF GE COMMON STOCK (671.4 MILLION SHARES) IN 2015. COMBINED WITH CASH DIVIDENDS OF $4.3 BILLION, GE CAPITAL RETURNED ABOUT $25 BILLION TO GE IN 2015. IN CONNECTION WITH THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, WE COMPLETED A LEGAL REORGANIZATION OF GE CAPITAL THAT INCLUDED A MERGER OF GE CAPITAL INTO GE, A GUARANTEE BY GE OF GE CAPITAL DEBT, AND AN EXCHANGE OF $36 BILLION OF GE CAPITAL DEBT FOR NEW GE NOTES. THE RESULT OF ALL THESE ACTIONS REDUCED GE CAPITAL'S TOTAL ASSETS BY 38% FROM $501 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 TO $312 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. WE INCURRED CHARGES OF $22 BILLION RELATED TO THESE ACTIONS.

GIVEN THE PROGRESS OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN TO DATE, WE EXPECT TO LARGELY COMPLETE THAT PLAN BY THE END OF 2016 AND ARE ON TRACK TO FILE FOR RESCISSION OF GE CAPITAL'S DESIGNATION AS A NONBANK SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (NONBANK SIFI) IN EARLY 2016.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE ACTIVITIES IS DESCRIBED IN THE GE CAPITAL – GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN SECTION OF THE MD&A AND NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENT

IN ALL OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WE ENCOUNTER AGGRESSIVE AND ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT, IN GENERAL, WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH GE CAPITAL ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, LEASING COMPANIES, INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES, FINANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURERS AND INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANIES.

AS A DIVERSE GLOBAL COMPANY, WE ARE AFFECTED BY WORLD ECONOMIES, INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS, COMMODITY PRICES, SUCH AS THE PRICE OF OIL, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY VOLATILITY. OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE.



PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE LONG AND PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS,



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS AND



MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REGULATORY STANDARDS.

THESE FACTORS ARE DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT MD&A.

GE HAS DISCUSSED THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN WITH ITS REGULATORS AND STAFF OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (FSOC) AND PLANS TO FILE ITS APPLICATION WITH THE FSOC IN EARLY 2016 TO TERMINATE THE FSOC'S DESIGNATION OF GE CAPITAL AS A NONBANK SIFI. WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL SPLIT-OFF, AND THE FRB'S SUBSEQUENT APPROVAL OF GE CAPITAL'S APPLICATION TO DEREGISTER AS A SAVING AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY, GE CAPITAL IS NO LONGER A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY. IN ADDITION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DECEMBER 2015 REORGANIZATION DESCRIBED IN THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN SECTION OF THE MD&A, GE CAPITAL'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED UNDER A NEW INTERNATIONAL HOLDING COMPANY, GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED. GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GE CAPITAL WITH ITS OWN CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND IS SUPERVISED BY THE U.K. PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA). THE PRA'S SUPERVISION INCLUDES CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS THAT COULD IMPACT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO GE CAPITAL, AND GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO SUCH SUPERVISION EVEN IF GE CAPITAL'S DESIGNATION AS A NONBANK SIFI IS TERMINATED.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES

INTEREST ON BORROWINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES AMOUNTED TO $3.5 BILLION, $2.7 BILLION AND $2.9 BILLION IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR BORROWINGS ARE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHERE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.3 BILLION (INCLUDING $0.1 BILLION IN DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT COST), $1.6 BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. GE CAPITAL AVERAGE BORROWINGS DECLINED FROM 2014 TO 2015 AND FROM 2013 TO 2014. INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN FLAT OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A MIX SHIFT IN FUNDING SOURCES, IN ADDITION TO DECLINING GLOBAL BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES. GE CAPITAL AVERAGE BORROWINGS WERE $217.5 BILLION, $267.6 BILLION AND $297.3 BILLION IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE GE CAPITAL AVERAGE COMPOSITE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE (INCLUDING INTEREST ALLOCATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS) WAS 2.6% IN 2015, 2.6% IN 2014 AND 2.6% IN 2013. IN 2015, GE CAPITAL AVERAGE ASSETS CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN LINE WITH THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN. SEE THE LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A FOR A DISCUSSION OF LIQUIDITY, BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT.

IT IS OUR POLICY TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL INTEREST EXPENSE THAT IS EITHER DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE OR RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON A MARKET BASED LEVERAGE RATIO, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ASSETS FOR THE SPECIFIC DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. INTEREST EXPENSE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT THAT IS NOT ASSUMED BY THE BUYER OR REQUIRED TO BE REPAID AS A RESULT OF THE DISPOSAL TRANSACTION IS REFLECTED IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER THE DISPOSAL OCCURS.

2015 – 2014 COMMENTARY



POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS COST INCREASED IN 2015, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF LOWER DISCOUNT RATES AND NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LOSS AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AND BY CHANGES TO PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS.



IN 2015, WE AMENDED OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS AFFECTING POST-65 RETIREE HEALTH AND RETIREE LIFE INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTION PARTICIPANTS. THESE PLAN AMENDMENTS REDUCED OUR PRINCIPAL POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $3.3 BILLION.

2014 – 2013 COMMENTARY



POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS COST DECREASED DUE TO HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES AND LOWER LOSS AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER EXPECTED INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS.



WE UPDATED OUR MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 BASED ON TABLES ISSUED BY THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES TO REFLECT LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES. THE NEW MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED OUR PRINCIPAL POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY $4.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2014.

THE INCREASE IN THE UNDERFUNDING OF OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUISITION OF ALSTOM AND LIABILITY GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES, EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE.



THE DECREASE IN THE PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS DEFICIT WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PLAN AMENDMENTS.

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) DETERMINES MINIMUM PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. WE DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN EITHER 2015 OR 2014. ON AN ERISA BASIS, OUR PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE IS THAT THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS APPROXIMATELY 98% FUNDED AT JANUARY 1, 2016. THE ERISA FUNDED STATUS IS HIGHER THAN THE GAAP FUNDED STATUS (73% FUNDED) PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ERISA PRESCRIBED INTEREST RATE IS CALCULATED USING AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE. AS A RESULT, THE ERISA INTEREST RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE YEAR-END GAAP DISCOUNT RATE. THE HIGHER ERISA INTEREST RATE LOWERS PENSION LIABILITIES FOR ERISA FUNDING PURPOSES. OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE PROJECTS NO REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2016 AND APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION IN PROJECTED CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2017.

WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.9 BILLION TO OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2016, AS COMPARED TO $0.5 BILLION IN 2015 AND $0.7 BILLION IN 2014. GE CAPITAL IS A MEMBER OF CERTAIN GE PENSION PLANS. AS A RESULT OF THE GE EXIT PLAN, GE CAPITAL WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OBLIGATIONS FOR THESE PENSION PLANS. THESE OBLIGATIONS DO NOT RELATE TO THE VERTICALS AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE IN GE CAPITAL'S OTHER CONTINUING OPERATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. IN 2015, THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OBLIGATIONS RECOGNIZED BY GE CAPITAL WAS $0.1 BILLION. THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS RECORDED AS A CONTRA EXPENSE FOR GE AS GE'S FUTURE PENSION OBLIGATIONS WILL BE PAID BY GE CAPITAL. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THE ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PENSION FUNDING DOES NOT AFFECT CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS BUT RATHER WILL BE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF THE PENSION LIABILITY WHEN PAID.

WE ALSO EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.5 BILLION TO OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS IN 2016 SIMILAR TO OUR ACTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.5 BILLION IN BOTH 2015 AND 2014.

THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND FUTURE EFFECTS ON OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BENEFIT PLANS AND THE EFFECTS OF THIS ACTIVITY ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEE THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A AND NOTES 12 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

GE PAYS THE INCOME TAXES IT OWES IN EVERY COUNTRY IT DOES BUSINESS.  WHILE GE AND GE CAPITAL FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN, MANY FACTORS IMPACT OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND CASH TAX PAYMENTS.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IS THAT WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN APPROXIMATELY 180 COUNTRIES AND MORE THAN HALF OF OUR REVENUE IS EARNED OUTSIDE THE U.S., OFTEN IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER TAX RATES THAN IN THE U.S.  WE REINVEST MOST OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS OVERSEAS TO BE ABLE TO FUND OUR ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  OUR TAX LIABILITY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY U.S. AND FOREIGN TAX INCENTIVES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, LIKE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; AND BY ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND TAX LAW CHANGES.  FINALLY, OUR TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED, AND SETTLEMENTS OF ISSUES RAISED IN THESE AUDITS SOMETIMES AFFECT OUR TAX RATES.

GE AND GE CAPITAL FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THIS ENABLES GE AND GE CAPITAL TO USE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS OF ONE MEMBER OF THE GROUP TO REDUCE THE TAX THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE BY ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE GROUP. THE GE CAPITAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF THESE TAX REDUCTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED RETURN. GE MAKES CASH PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL FOR TAX REDUCTIONS AND GE CAPITAL PAYS FOR TAX INCREASES AT THE TIME GE'S TAX PAYMENTS ARE DUE.

2015 – 2014 COMMENTARY



THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS GREATER THAN 35% DUE TO CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN.



AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN 2015 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, WE INCURRED TAX EXPENSE OF $6.3 BILLION RELATED TO EXPECTED REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND WRITE-OFF OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.



THE INCREASE IN THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX EXPENSE INCURRED AS PART OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN.



THE CONSOLIDATED TAX PROVISION INCLUDES $1.6 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION FOR GE (EXCLUDING GE CAPITAL) FOR 2014 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 72

2014 – 2013 COMMENTARY



THE DECREASE IN THE CONSOLIDATED PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED BENEFITS FROM LOWER TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.



THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXED AT RATES ABOVE THE AVERAGE RATE.

ON JANUARY 2, 2013, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012 WAS ENACTED AND THE LAW EXTENDED SEVERAL

PROVISIONS, INCLUDING A TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE U.S. TAX PROVISION DEFERRING TAX ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME AND CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESS CREDITS, RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2012. UNDER ACCOUNTING RULES, A TAX LAW CHANGE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CALCULATING THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD ENACTED. BECAUSE THE EXTENSION WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN 2013, TAX EXPENSE IN 2013 REFLECTED RETROACTIVE EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUSLY EXPIRED PROVISIONS.

BENEFITS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS

ABSENT THE EFFECTS OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE USE OF GLOBAL FUNDING STRUCTURES. THERE IS A BENEFIT FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS AS NON-U.S. INCOME IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE. THESE NON-U.S. EARNINGS HAVE BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CURRENT U.S. INCOME TAX. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS. THE RATE OF TAX ON OUR INDEFINITELY REINVESTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS IS BELOW THE 35% U.S. STATUTORY RATE BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND BECAUSE GE FUNDS CERTAIN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS THROUGH FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LOW FOREIGN TAXES.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BENEFIT RELATED TO BUSINESS OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE TAX ON THAT INCOME IS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE IS DERIVED FROM OUR GECAS AIRCRAFT LEASING OPERATIONS LOCATED IN IRELAND AND FROM OUR POWER SERVICES MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS LOCATED IN HUNGARY. NO OTHER OPERATION IN ANY ONE COUNTRY ACCOUNTS FOR A MATERIAL PORTION OF THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THE BENEFIT.

WE EXPECT OUR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM NON-U.S. INCOME TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE TO CONTINUE, SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN U.S. OR FOREIGN LAW. IN ADDITION, SINCE THIS BENEFIT DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENT'S INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST AMOUNTS OUTSIDE THE U.S., OUR TAX PROVISION WILL INCREASE TO THE EXTENT WE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVEST FOREIGN EARNINGS.

OTHER INFORMATION

TO THE EXTENT NON-U.S. OPERATING INCOME INCREASES, WE WOULD EXPECT TAX BENEFITS TO INCREASE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT'S INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THOSE EARNINGS. INCLUDED IN 2015 IS A TAX EXPENSE OF $6.1 BILLION RELATED TO THE EXPECTED REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND WRITE-OFF OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN.

THE TAX BENEFIT FROM NON-U.S. INCOME TAXED AT A LOCAL COUNTRY RATHER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE IS REPORTED IN THE CAPTION "TAX ON GLOBAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXPORTS" IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RECONCILIATION IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND THE CONSOLIDATED EFFECTIVE RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS, IS PROVIDED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A AND NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GEOGRAPHIC DATA

OUR GLOBAL ACTIVITIES SPAN ALL GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND PRIMARILY ENCOMPASS MANUFACTURING FOR LOCAL AND EXPORT MARKETS, IMPORT AND SALE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN OTHER REGIONS, LEASING OF AIRCRAFT, SOURCING FOR OUR PLANTS DOMICILED IN OTHER GLOBAL REGIONS AND PROVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES WITHIN THESE REGIONAL ECONOMIES. THUS, WHEN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS EXPERIENCE CURRENCY AND/OR ECONOMIC STRESS, WE OFTEN HAVE INCREASED EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN RISKS, BUT ALSO OFTEN HAVE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES THROUGH PURCHASES OF COMPANIES OR ASSETS AT REDUCED PRICES AND LOWER U.S. DEBT FINANCING COSTS.

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR NON-U.S. ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS ARE AFFECTED BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE. WE USE A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES TO MANAGE THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE, INCLUDING SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND SELECTIVE HEDGING OF SIGNIFICANT CROSS-CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. SUCH PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES ARE THE EURO, THE POUND STERLING, THE BRAZILIAN REAL AND THE CHINESE RENMINBI.



CASH AND EQUIVALENTS INCREASED $0.5 BILLION

. GE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS DECREASED $5.5 BILLION DUE TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $16.4 BILLION, MORE THAN OFFSET BY $10.4 BILLION USED TO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES (PRIMARILY ALSTOM) AND $12.1 BILLION CASH RETURNED TO INVESTORS IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OF $9.3 BILLION AND BUYBACK OF TREASURY STOCK OF $2.8 BILLION (CASH BASIS).

, PRIMARILY DUE TO PURCHASES OF TIME DEPOSITS AT GE CAPITAL OF $10.4 BILLION.



ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DECREASED $202.6 BILLION



OTHER GE CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED $9.3 BILLION

, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE ALSTOM ACQUISITION OF $5.6 BILLION AND TAXES PAYABLE OF $2.7 BILLION.



BORROWINGS DECREASED $63.1 BILLION

, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET REPAYMENTS ON GE CAPITAL BORROWINGS OF $55.3 BILLION, ALONG WITH AN $8.9 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE BALANCES DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET INCREASE IN BORROWINGS BY GE OF $2.0 BILLION.



LIABILITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DECREASED $81.7 BILLION

, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE DISPOSITION OF CONSUMER BUSINESSES OF $69.1 BILLION (INCLUDING THE SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL SPLIT-OFF), CLL BUSINESSES OF $11.6 BILLION AND REAL ESTATE OF $1.7 BILLION. SEE NOTE 2 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.



RETAINED EARNINGS DECREASED $15.3 BILLION

, DUE TO COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $9.1 BILLION IN ADDITION TO A NET LOSS OF $6.1 BILLION.



COMMON STOCK HELD IN TREASURY INCREASED $20.9 BILLION

, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL SHARE EXCHANGE OF $20.4 BILLION AND BUYBACK OF TREASURY STOCK OF $3.3 BILLION (BOOK BASIS). THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TREASURY STOCK DISPOSITIONS OF $2.8 BILLION, PRIMARILY STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OF $1.8 BILLION.



NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS DECREASED $6.8 BILLION

, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GE CAPITAL PREFERRED SHARE EXCHANGE OF $4.9 BILLION AND THE SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL SPLIT-OFF OF $2.8 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS RELATED TO THE ALSTOM ACQUISITION OF $0.7 BILLION. THE IMPACT OF THE PREFERRED SHARE EXCHANGE IS ALSO THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS

WE MAINTAIN A STRONG FOCUS ON LIQUIDITY. AT BOTH GE AND GE CAPITAL WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY TO HELP PROVIDE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGHOUT BUSINESS CYCLES.

OUR LIQUIDITY AND BORROWING PLANS FOR GE AND GE CAPITAL ARE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR ANNUAL FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES. AT GE, OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING PLANS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO FUND OUR OPERATING COMMITMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE PRIMARILY PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS FOR INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT, PAYROLL AND GENERAL EXPENSES (INCLUDING PENSION FUNDING). WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND GROWTH OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING PAYING DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASING SHARES, INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUIRING INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. AT GE, WE RELY PRIMARILY ON CASH GENERATED THROUGH OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM GE CAPITAL, AND ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY MAINTAINED A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT WE REGULARLY USE TO FUND OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., PRINCIPALLY WITHIN THE QUARTERS.

GE CAPITAL HAS HISTORICALLY RELIED ON THE UNSECURED TERM DEBT MARKETS, THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, DEPOSITS, SECURED FUNDING, RETAIL FUNDING PRODUCTS, BANK BORROWINGS AND SECURITIZATIONS TO FUND ITS BALANCE SHEET. SUBSEQUENT TO APRIL 10, 2015 AND WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, WE DO NOT PLAN TO ISSUE ANY

INCREMENTAL

GE CAPITAL SENIOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT FOR FOUR YEARS. FURTHERMORE WE HAVE REDUCED OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM $25 BILLION TO $5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND WITH OUR EXECUTED AND CURRENT DISPOSITION PLANS WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED OUR RELIANCE ON DEPOSITS AND SECURITIZATION. TODAY, WE MAINLY RELY ON EXCESS CASH POSITIONS,

CASH GENERATED THROUGH DISPOSITIONS

,

AND THE CASH FLOW FROM OUR VERTICALS BUSINESS TO FUND OUR DEBT MATURITIES AND OUR OPERATING AND INTEREST EXPENSE COSTS. GE CAPITAL'S LIQUIDITY POSITION IS TARGETED TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER BOTH NORMAL AND STRESSED CONDITIONS. WE EXPECT TO MAINTAIN AN ELEVATED LIQUIDITY POSITION AS WE GENERATE CASH FROM ASSET SALES, RETURNING TO MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS IN 2019. DURING THIS PERIOD WE EXPECT TO HAVE EXCESS INTEREST COSTS AS ASSET SALES OUTPACE OUR DEBT MATURITIES. WHILE WE MAINTAIN ELEVATED LIQUIDITY LEVELS, WE MAY ENGAGE IN LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS BUYING BACK DEBT, BASED ON MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR EXCESS INTEREST COSTS. IN 2015, WE REPURCHASED $1 BILLION OF LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT. IN ADDITION, WE REPURCHASED $0.8 BILLION OF DEBT FOR WHICH WE HAD THE RIGHT TO CALL.

OUR 2016 GE CAPITAL FUNDING PLAN ANTICIPATES REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ($42.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015), PRINCIPALLY THROUGH DISPOSITIONS, ASSET SALES AND CASH ON HAND. LONG-TERM MATURITIES AND EARLY REDEMPTIONS WERE $41.3 BILLION IN 2015.

WE MAINTAIN A DETAILED LIQUIDITY POLICY FOR GE CAPITAL THAT REQUIRES GE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE LIQUIDITY POLICY DEFINES GE CAPITAL'S LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCE UNDER DIFFERENT STRESS SCENARIOS BASED ON ITS LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES TO ESCALATE POTENTIAL ISSUES. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR GE CAPITAL'S ACCESS TO FUNDING MARKETS AND ITS LIQUIDITY PROFILE THROUGH TRACKING EXTERNAL INDICATORS AND TESTING VARIOUS STRESS SCENARIOS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND ESTABLISHES ESCALATION PROCEDURES IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE. GE CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE NEED TO MODIFY THE EXISTING CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN DUE TO THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN.

AS PART OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2015 GE CAPITAL COMMENCED PRIVATE OFFERS TO EXCHANGE UP TO $30 BILLION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING DEBT FOR NEW NOTES WITH MATURITIES OF SIX MONTHS, FIVE YEARS, TEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS. ON OCTOBER 19, 2015, GIVEN THE HIGH LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION, THE OFFERING WAS INCREASED BY $6 BILLION WITH THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $36 BILLION (REPRESENTING $31 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND $5 BILLION OF PREMIUM) OF OUTSTANDING NOTES BEING TENDERED FOR EXCHANGE AND SETTLED ON OCTOBER 26, 2015. THE NEW NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED AT CLOSING ARE COMPOSED OF $15.3 BILLION OF 0.964% SIX MONTH NOTES DUE APRIL 2016, £0.8 BILLION OF 1.363% SIX MONTH NOTES DUE APRIL 2016, $6.1 BILLION OF 2.342% NOTES DUE 2020, $2.0 BILLION OF 3.373% NOTES DUE 2025 AND $11.5 BILLION OF 4.418% NOTES DUE 2035. OF THE $16.2 BILLION EXCHANGED INTO SIX MONTH NOTES, $1.3 BILLION HAD BEEN IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. GE CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPURCHASE DEBT WHILE MAINTAINING OUR LIQUIDITY AT THE LEVELS COMMUNICATED AS PART OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN. THE NEW NOTES HAVE BEEN FULLY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY GE.

ON DECEMBER 2, 2015, $87.7 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES AND $4.9 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS ASSUMED BY GE UPON ITS MERGER WITH GE CAPITAL. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON MAY 28, 2015, GE ISSUED €3,150 MILLION SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, COMPOSED OF €650 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2020, €1,250 MILLION OF 1.250% NOTES DUE 2023 AND €1,250 MILLION OF 1.875% NOTES DUE 2027. ON OCTOBER 9, 2015, $2.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUED BY GE MATURED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, GE CAPITAL REDUCED THE OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER TO $5 BILLION, CONSISTENT WITH THE ANNOUNCED GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN.

WE SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING. DURING THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS OF 2015, WE COMPLETED $2.1 BILLION OF NON-RECOURSE ISSUANCES AND $3.4 BILLION OF NON-RECOURSE BORROWINGS MATURED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, CONSOLIDATED NON-RECOURSE SECURITIZATION BORROWINGS WERE $3.1 BILLION.

*NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 80

WE HAVE EIGHT DEPOSIT-TAKING BANKS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AND ONE DEPOSIT-TAKING BANK IN THE U.S., GE CAPITAL BANK, AN INDUSTRIAL BANK (IB), WHICH IS ALSO CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE IB CURRENTLY ISSUES CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT (CDS) IN MATURITY TERMS UP TO 10 YEARS.

EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISKS

EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISKS ARE MANAGED WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MATCH FUNDING AND SELECTIVE USE OF DERIVATIVES. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND MARKET RISKS BECAUSE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN DIVERSE MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND LOCAL FUNDING IS NOT ALWAYS EFFICIENT. IN ADDITION, WE USE DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE DEBT WE ARE ISSUING TO MATCH THE FIXED OR FLOATING NATURE OF THE ASSETS WE ARE ORIGINATING. WE APPLY STRICT POLICIES TO MANAGE EACH OF THESE RISKS, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS ON SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES. FOLLOWING IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USING SO-CALLED "SHOCK" TESTS THAT SEEK TO MODEL THE EFFECTS OF SHIFTS IN RATES. SUCH TESTS ARE INHERENTLY LIMITED BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS USED (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A FORECAST; ACTUAL EFFECTS WOULD DEPEND ON MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING MARKET FACTORS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THAT TIME.



IT IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. WE FUND OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS USING DEBT OR A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS SO THAT THE INTEREST RATES OF OUR BORROWINGS MATCH THE EXPECTED INTEREST RATE PROFILE ON OUR ASSETS. TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING ACTIONS, WE ASSUMED THAT, ON JANUARY 1, 2016, INTEREST RATES DECREASED BY 100 BASIS POINTS ACROSS THE YIELD CURVE (A "PARALLEL SHIFT" IN THAT CURVE) AND FURTHER ASSUMED THAT THE DECREASE REMAINED IN PLACE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE YEAR-END 2015 PORTFOLIO AND HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT, WE ESTIMATED THAT OUR CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, STARTING IN JANUARY 2016, WOULD DECLINE BY LESS THAN $0.3 BILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE.



IT IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS EITHER WITHIN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OR USING THE PROTECTION OF HEDGE STRATEGIES. WE ANALYZED YEAR-END 2015 CONSOLIDATED CURRENCY EXPOSURES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, TO IDENTIFY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THEIR RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. FOR SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE THEN EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF A 10% SHIFT IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THOSE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR, HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT. THIS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT OUR 2016 CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS WOULD DECLINE BY LESS THAN $0.2 BILLION AS A RESULT OF SUCH A SHIFT IN EXCHANGE RATES. THIS ANALYSIS EXCLUDES ANY TRANSLATION IMPACT FROM CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS

CREDIT RATINGS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, GE'S AND GE CAPITAL'S LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS SERVICE (S&P) WERE AA+ AND THE SHORT-TERM FUNDING RATING FROM S&P WERE A-1+. THE RATING OUTLOOK FOR GE WAS DOWNGRADED FROM STABLE TO NEGATIVE ON OCTOBER 7, 2015, WHILE THE RATING OUTLOOK FOR GE CAPITAL REMAINS STABLE. ON APRIL 10, 2015, MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY'S) DOWNGRADED THE SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING FOR GE TO A1 FROM AA3 FOLLOWING GE'S APRIL 10 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN. GE'S P-1 SHORT-TERM RATING WAS AFFIRMED. MOODY'S AFFIRMED GE CAPITAL'S A1/P-1 RATINGS. THE RATING OUTLOOK FOR GE AND GE CAPITAL WERE STABLE. WE ARE DISCLOSING THESE RATINGS TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND THE EFFECTS OF OUR RATINGS ON OUR COSTS OF FUNDS. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT A DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATINGS, OUR RATINGS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A REVISION OR WITHDRAWAL AT ANY TIME BY THE ASSIGNING RATING ORGANIZATION, AND EACH RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER RATING.

PRINCIPAL DEBT AND DERIVATIVE CONDITIONS

CERTAIN OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CAN BE TERMINATED

IF SPECIFIED CREDIT RATINGS ARE NOT MAINTAINED AND CERTAIN DEBT AND DERIVATIVES AGREEMENTS OF OTHER CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HAVE PROVISIONS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THESE CREDIT RATINGS.

FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN OUR POSITIONS. WE MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL DEFAULT AND NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF OUR STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS) ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS. WHERE WE HAVE AGREED TO NETTING OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES WITH A COUNTERPARTY, WE OFFSET OUR EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND APPLY THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED TO US TO DETERMINE THE NET EXPOSURE. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE NET EXPOSURES AGAINST DEFINED LIMITS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE, INCLUDING REQUIRING ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 81

SWAP, FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE EXECUTED UNDER STANDARD MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT TYPICALLY CONTAIN MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3 OR OTHER RATINGS LEVELS AGREED UPON WITH THE COUNTERPARTY. IN CERTAIN OF THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS, THE COUNTERPARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE SHORT-TERM RATINGS OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. THE NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITY AFTER CONSIDERATION OF NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, OUTSTANDING INTEREST PAYMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTED BY US UNDER THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $0.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. SEE NOTES 20 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RISK EXPOSURES, OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES, AND THE EFFECTS OF THIS ACTIVITY ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEE NOTES 20 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT AND GE GUARANTEE OF CERTAIN GE CAPITAL DEBT

GE PROVIDES IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT SUPPORT TO GE CAPITAL THROUGH COMMITMENTS, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND OPERATING SUPPORT.

AS PART OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, ON APRIL 10, 2015, GE AND GE CAPITAL ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THEIR EXISTING FINANCIAL SUPPORT AGREEMENT. UNDER THIS AMENDMENT (THE AMENDMENT), THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE (THE GUARANTEE) OF THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON ALL TRADABLE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES AND ALL COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY GE CAPITAL IDENTIFIED IN THE AMENDMENT. THE GUARANTEE REPLACED THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMPANY MAKE CERTAIN INCOME MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. GE CAPITAL'S U.S. PUBLIC INDENTURES WERE CONCURRENTLY AMENDED TO PROVIDE THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE BY THE COMPANY SET FORTH IN THE GUARANTEE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE BALANCE OF THIS DEBT THAT GE ASSUMED WAS $85.1 BILLION, AND THE GUARANTEE APPLIED TO APPROXIMATELY $85.8 BILLION OF GE CAPITAL DEBT.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS – OVERVIEW FROM 2013 THROUGH 2015

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS

WE EVALUATE OUR CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE BY REVIEWING OUR INDUSTRIAL (NON-GE CAPITAL) BUSINESSES AND GE CAPITAL BUSINESSES SEPARATELY. CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (CFOA) IS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH GENERATION FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES ALSO HAVE LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE VIA THE PUBLIC CAPITAL MARKETS.

WITH RESPECT TO GE CFOA, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS USEFUL TO SUPPLEMENT OUR GE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND TO EXAMINE IN A BROADER CONTEXT THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE AND REQUIRE CASH.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 82

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CASH IN GE CFOA IS CUSTOMER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS COLLECTING CASH RESULTING FROM PRODUCT OR SERVICES SALES. SEE THE INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND ELIMINATIONS SECTION FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GE CAPITAL. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OPERATING USE OF CASH IS TO PAY OUR SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, TAX AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES. DIVIDENDS FROM GE CAPITAL REPRESENT THE DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTION OF GE CAPITAL RETAINED EARNINGS, AND ARE DISTINCT FROM CASH FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WITHIN THE GE CAPITAL BUSINESSES.

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND ELIMINATIONS

EFFECTS OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN RELATED COMPANIES ARE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS, ARE ELIMINATED AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GE CAPITAL DIVIDENDS TO GE; GE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES SOLD TO GE CAPITAL; GE CAPITAL SERVICES FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT AND MATERIAL PROCUREMENT; BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT LEASED BETWEEN GE AND GE CAPITAL; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND OTHER SERVICES SOLD TO GE CAPITAL BY GE; AIRCRAFT ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT ARE INSTALLED ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY GE CAPITAL FROM THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; EXPENSES RELATED TO PARENT-SUBSIDIARY PENSION PLANS, AND VARIOUS INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ALLOCATIONS OF GE CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS.

GE SELLS CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES TO GE CAPITAL IN PART TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN RESULT IN CASH GENERATION OR CASH USE. DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, GE RECEIVES CASH FROM THE SALE OF RECEIVABLES TO GE CAPITAL. IT ALSO FOREGOES COLLECTION OF CASH ON RECEIVABLES SOLD. THE INCREMENTAL AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED FROM SALES OF RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF THE CASH GE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE COLLECTED HAD THOSE RECEIVABLES NOT BEEN SOLD, REPRESENTS THE CASH GENERATED OR USED IN THE PERIOD RELATING TO THIS ACTIVITY. THE INCREMENTAL CASH GENERATED IN GE CFOA FROM SELLING THESE RECEIVABLES TO GE CAPITAL INCREASED GE'S CFOA BY $1.6 BILLION, $2.2 BILLION AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

EXPOSURES

VENEZUELA

THE RESULTS OF OUR VENEZUELAN BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN REPORTED UNDER HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ACCOUNTING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2010, AT WHICH TIME THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR VENEZUELAN ENTITIES WAS CHANGED FROM THE BOLIVAR TO THE U.S. DOLLAR.

OUR ACTIVITIES RELATED TO VENEZUELA GENERATED REVENUES OF LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, CONSISTING OF BOTH EXPORTS TO AND OPERATIONS WITHIN THE COUNTRY. THE MAJORITY OF THESE REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND EURO BUT WE ALSO TRANSACT IN BOLIVARS FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA, DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE EXCHANGE RATE FOR REMEASUREMENT OF BOLIVAR-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OPERATED THREE DIFFERENT EXCHANGE MECHANISMS: THE GOVERNMENT-OPERATED CENCOEX (THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE MECHANISM), THE GOVERNMENT-OPERATED AUCTION BASED SICAD MECHANISM AND AN OPEN MARKET MARGINAL CURRENCY SYSTEM (SIMADI). THE SIMADI MECHANISM IS INTENDED TO OPERATE WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS AND ITS EXCHANGE RATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2015 WAS APPROXIMATELY 198 BOLIVARS PER U.S. DOLLAR COMPARED TO SICAD AT 13.5 BOLIVARS PER U.S. DOLLAR.

AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, WE REMEASURE THE NET MONETARY ASSETS OF OUR VENEZUELAN BUSINESSES USING THE RATE WE EXPECT TO SETTLE THEM AT, INCLUDING THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THESE BUSINESSES OPERATE WERE NOT SELECTED FOR PARTICIPATION IN ANY SICAD AUCTIONS DURING 2015. IN LIGHT OF CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING AVAILABILITY OF EXCHANGE MECHANISMS AND DECREASING LIQUIDITY IN THOSE MECHANISMS, WE COMPLETED AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF EACH OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WITHIN VENEZUELA DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015. BASED ON THAT REVIEW, WE DECIDED TO REDUCE CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN VENEZUELA AND TO BEGIN ACCESSING THE SIMADI MARKET TO OBTAIN U.S. DOLLARS, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOR OUR RESIDUAL OIL & GAS AND POWER OPERATIONS. OUR APPLIANCES BUSINESS IN VENEZUELA, WHICH IS CONDUCTED THROUGH AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT, SIMILARLY CONCLUDED THAT THE SIMADI EXCHANGE MECHANISM PROVIDES THE MOST APPROPRIATE RATE FOR MEASURING ITS NET MONETARY ASSETS. WE ALSO CONCLUDED, BASED ON OUR REVIEW, CONSOLIDATING OUR REMAINING VENEZUELAN OPERATIONS REMAINS APPROPRIATE.

USE OF THE SIMADI RATE TO REMEASURE OUR VENEZUELAN NET MONETARY ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 RESULTED IN EXCHANGE RATE LOSSES OF $83 MILLION. RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12 MILLION ALSO WERE RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW DISCUSSED ABOVE. NET MONETARY ASSETS SUBJECT TO REMEASUREMENT AT THE SIMADI RATE WERE APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION WITHIN OUR APPLIANCES EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT. IN ADDITION TO OUR BOLIVAR-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS, WE ALSO HAVE NON-BOLIVAR CREDIT EXPOSURES OF APPROXIMATELY $292 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND RECOVERABLE AMOUNTS OF NON-MONETARY ASSETS IN VENEZUELA OF APPROXIMATELY $89 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, WHICH CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF INVENTORY AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

OIL & GAS INDUSTRY

THE SHARP DECLINE EXPERIENCED IN OIL PRICES AND THE PROSPECT OF A CONTINUATION OF PREVAILING OIL PRICES COULD HAVE MIXED IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE COMPETE. IN GENERAL, LOWER OIL PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN OIL IMPORTING COUNTRIES WHILE CAUSING NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS IN MANY ENERGY-EXPORTING COUNTRIES. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, OUR OIL & GAS BUSINESS CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN ORDERS, SOME PROJECT COMMENCEMENT DELAYS AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN RESPONSE TO THIS UNCERTAIN INDUSTRY OUTLOOK, WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE COST ACTIONS WITH AN INCREASED FOCUS ON EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY. WE EXPECT THAT ONGOING LOW OIL PRICES WILL PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT TO OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH LOWER DIRECT MATERIAL AND OTHER VARIABLE COSTS AS WELL AS THROUGH THE EXPECTED STIMULUS-EFFECT ON GROWTH IN THE U.S. AND IN OTHER ECONOMIES THAT RELY ON ENERGY IMPORTS, INCLUDING EUROPE, JAPAN AND INDIA.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY OF THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES REFLECT OUR BEST JUDGMENT ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THESE CONDITIONS CHANGE FROM THOSE EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD CHANGE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, INCREASES IN RESERVES FOR CONTINGENCIES, ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER EFFECTS. ALSO SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH DISCUSSES OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF PROFITS OVER THE MULTIPLE-YEAR TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENTS, CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF FUTURE MONITORING, MAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL EVENTS; THE AMOUNT OF PERSONNEL, SPARE PARTS AND OTHER RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE SERVICES; AND FUTURE BILLING RATE, COST CHANGES AND CUSTOMERS' UTILIZATION OF ASSETS. WE ROUTINELY REVIEW ESTIMATES UNDER PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS AND REGULARLY REVISE THEM TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN OUTLOOK.

WE ALSO REGULARLY ASSESS CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT CONTRACTUAL PENALTIES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET OUR ACCUMULATED INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF CUSTOMER TERMINATION. WE GAIN INSIGHT INTO FUTURE UTILIZATION AND COST TRENDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT RISK, THROUGH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE CLOSE INTERACTION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT COMES WITH SUPPLYING CRITICAL SERVICES AND PARTS OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. REVISIONS MAY AFFECT A PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENT'S TOTAL ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY RESULTING IN AN ADJUSTMENT OF EARNINGS; SUCH ADJUSTMENTS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $1.4 BILLION, $1.0 BILLION AND $0.3 BILLION IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. WE PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE LOSSES WHEN THEY BECOME EVIDENT.

FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1 AND 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

ASSET IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INVOLVES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY AND IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR CRITERIA INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION. OUR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INVOLVE OUR FINANCE, RISK AND ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGERS. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH DISCUSSES THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1 AND 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED TYPICALLY REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DETERMINING WHICH UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED ASSET, THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, THEIR AMOUNT, AND THE ASSET'S RESIDUAL VALUE, IF ANY. IN TURN, MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS REQUIRES A DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE. WE DERIVE THE REQUIRED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FROM OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS PLANS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, OUR INTERNAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE AND INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE.

OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF ASSETS IN CAPITAL, AND IS PARTICULARLY SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. THEREFORE, WE TEST RECOVERABILITY OF EACH AIRCRAFT IN OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO AT LEAST ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, WE PERFORM QUARTERLY EVALUATIONS IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN AIRCRAFT ARE RE-LEASED, CURRENT LEASE TERMS HAVE CHANGED OR A SPECIFIC LESSEE'S CREDIT STANDING CHANGES. WE CONSIDER MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS GLOBAL DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RENTALS AND RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION RECEIVED ROUTINELY FROM INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS. ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM FUTURE LEASES ARE REDUCED FOR EXPECTED DOWNTIME BETWEEN LEASES AND FOR ESTIMATED COSTS REQUIRED TO PREPARE AIRCRAFT TO BE REDEPLOYED. FAIR VALUE USED TO MEASURE IMPAIRMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES WHICH ARE BENCHMARKED AGAINST THIRD-PARTY APPRAISER CURRENT MARKET VALUES FOR AIRCRAFT OF SIMILAR TYPE AND AGE.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AND OUR EXPOSURE TO THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRY IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 7 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH YEAR USING DATA AS OF JULY 1 OF THAT YEAR. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: IN STEP ONE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS FAIR VALUE; IN STEP TWO, WHICH IS APPLIED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS DERIVED BY DEDUCTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS EQUITY, AND COMPARING THAT AMOUNT WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. WE DETERMINED FAIR VALUES FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING THE MARKET APPROACH, WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, OR THE INCOME APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WE ASSESS THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY BASED UPON THE RELEVANCE AND AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA AT THE TIME WE PERFORM THE VALUATION. IF MULTIPLE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES ARE USED, THE RESULTS ARE WEIGHTED APPROPRIATELY.

VALUATIONS USING THE MARKET APPROACH ARE DERIVED FROM METRICS OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES OR HISTORICALLY COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES IS BASED ON THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE GIVING CONSIDERATION TO RISK PROFILES, SIZE, GEOGRAPHY, AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A MARKET APPROACH IS LIMITED TO REPORTING UNITS FOR WHICH THERE ARE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO OUR BUSINESSES.

UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED RATE. WE USE OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM FUTURE GROWTH RATES BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT VIEWS OF THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EACH BUSINESS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ASSUMED IN OUR FORECASTS. WE DERIVE OUR DISCOUNT RATES USING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND ANALYZING PUBLISHED RATES FOR INDUSTRIES RELEVANT TO OUR REPORTING UNITS TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING. WE USE DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND IN OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORECASTS. DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR REPORTING UNIT VALUATIONS RANGED FROM 10.0% TO 15.5%.

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STEP ONE TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH OF THE GE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED FOR ANY OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 88

WE REVIEW IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINED USEFUL LIVES AND SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OCCURRED REQUIRES COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT TO THE SUM OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. WE TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR VALUE METHOD SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FOR OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES REMAINING IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WE PERIODICALLY TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT OUR DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS AND PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS.

FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1 AND 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BUSINESSES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE REPRESENT COMPONENTS THAT MEET THE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS TO BE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE PRESENTED AS SINGLE ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, IF NECESSARY, TO RECOGNIZE THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COST TO SELL. FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT NO LONGER QUALIFY TO BE PRESENTED AS HELD FOR INVESTMENT MUST BE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COST TO SELL, WITH THAT AMOUNT REPRESENTING A NEW COST BASIS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER.

THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUES IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS COMPLEX AND IS DEPENDENT UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE NATURE OF THE POTENTIAL SALES TRANSACTION (FOR EXAMPLE, ASSET SALE VERSUS SALE OF LEGAL ENTITY), COMPOSITION OF ASSETS AND/OR BUSINESSES IN THE DISPOSAL GROUP, THE COMPARABILITY OF THE DISPOSAL GROUP TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS WITH THIRD PARTY PURCHASERS, ETC. SUCH FACTORS BEAR DIRECTLY ON THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL FAIR VALUES AND THE SELECTION OF THE BEST ESTIMATES. KEY ASSUMPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION.

WE REVIEW ALL BUSINESSES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE EACH REPORTING PERIOD TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXISTING CARRYING AMOUNTS ARE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN COMPARISON TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES.

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE ACTUARIAL MODELS THAT MEASURE PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED EFFECTS ON OPERATIONS. TWO ASSUMPTIONS – DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS – ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF PLAN EXPENSE AND ASSET/LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST ANNUALLY ON A PLAN AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC BASIS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT AGE, MORTALITY AND TURNOVER, AND UPDATE THEM TO REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE. ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WILL OFTEN DIFFER FROM ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED PAYMENTS. WE DISCOUNT THOSE CASH PAYMENTS USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MARKET-OBSERVED YIELDS FOR HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. LOWER DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE; HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES DECREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE.

OUR DISCOUNT RATES FOR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WERE 4.38%, 4.02% AND 4.85%, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING MARKET INTEREST RATES.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 89

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE LONG-TERM RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL BENEFIT PLANS' ASSETS, WE FORMULATE VIEWS ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD. WE EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET TRENDS AND HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG A NUMBER OF KEY VARIABLES THAT IMPACT ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED EARNINGS GROWTH, INFLATION, VALUATIONS, YIELDS AND SPREADS, USING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES. WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXPECTED VOLATILITY BY ASSET CLASS AND DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS CLASSES TO DETERMINE EXPECTED OVERALL PORTFOLIO RESULTS GIVEN CURRENT AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS. ASSETS IN OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS EARNED 0.6% IN 2015, AND HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL RETURNS OF 6.4%, 5.0%, AND 8.5% PER YEAR IN THE 5-, 10- AND 25-YEAR PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL 10- AND 25- YEAR RETURNS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY INVESTMENT LOSSES IN 2008. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE, PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT AND TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE ASSUMED A 7.5% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 7.5% IN 2015 AND 2014 AND 8.0% IN 2013.

CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.



DISCOUNT RATE – A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2 BILLION AND WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT YEAR-END BY ABOUT $2.2 BILLION.



EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS – A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD INCREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2 BILLION.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION PLANS IS PROVIDED IN THE OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION – POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A AND IN NOTE 12 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

OUR ANNUAL TAX RATE IS BASED ON OUR INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. TAX LAWS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS BY THE TAXPAYER AND RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTAL TAXING AUTHORITIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR TAX EXPENSE AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING EVALUATING UNCERTAINTIES. WE REVIEW OUR TAX POSITIONS QUARTERLY AND ADJUST THE BALANCES AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. OUR INCOME TAX RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE TAX RATE ON OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THIS RATE DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT IS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT ABOUT AND INTENTIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, APPROXIMATELY $104 BILLION AND $119 BILLION OF EARNINGS, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. SUCH ASSETS ARISE BECAUSE OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS FROM NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. THESE SOURCES OF INCOME RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES. WE USE OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR SHORT- AND LONG-RANGE BUSINESS FORECASTS TO PROVIDE INSIGHT. FURTHER, OUR GLOBAL AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY VARIOUS PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF FUTURE DEDUCTIONS. AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATED TO NON-U.S. NET OPERATING LOSSES, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WERE $5.1 BILLION AND $5.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, INCLUDING $0.8 BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, ASSOCIATED WITH LOSSES REPORTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR REAL ESTATE AND CONSUMER BUSINESSES AND OUR LOSS ON THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN. SUCH YEAR-END 2015 AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY RECOVERABLE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY EXPIRATION PERIODS. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON INCOME TAXES IS PROVIDED IN THE OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION – INCOME TAXES SECTION WITHIN THE MD&A AND IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY PRICES. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AS HEDGES REQUIRES THAT, AT INCEPTION AND OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND RELATED DERIVATIVE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES ACCOUNTING ARE COMPLEX. FAILURE TO APPLY THIS COMPLEX GUIDANCE CORRECTLY WILL RESULT IN ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE BEING REPORTED IN EARNINGS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

IN EVALUATING WHETHER A PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, WE TEST EFFECTIVENESS AT INCEPTION AND EACH REPORTING PERIOD THEREAFTER BY DETERMINING WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OFFSET, WITHIN A SPECIFIED RANGE, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM. IF FAIR VALUE CHANGES FAIL THIS TEST, WE DISCONTINUE APPLYING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO THAT RELATIONSHIP PROSPECTIVELY. FAIR VALUES OF BOTH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE CALCULATED USING INTERNAL VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATING MARKET-BASED ASSUMPTIONS, SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY CONFIRMATION, AS APPLICABLE.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 1, 9, 20 AND 27

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EVERY REPORTING PERIOD INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES. OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING PURCHASE ACCOUNTING APPLIED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE IMPAIRED. UPON CLOSING AN ACQUISITION, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED AND INTEGRATE THE ACQUISITION AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. THE SIZE, SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY OF AN ACQUISITION WILL AFFECT THE TIME IT TAKES TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO RECORD THE ACQUIRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. IT MAY TAKE UP TO ONE YEAR TO FINALIZE THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES USED IN THE PRELIMINARY PURCHASE ACCOUNTING. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY REVISED, WHICH COULD AFFECT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN IMPAIRED ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS DETERMINED AS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OFTEN INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS ABOUT ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE THAT FACTORS IN BOTH RISK AND LIQUIDITY PREMIUMS, IDENTIFYING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, WEIGHTING THOSE DIFFERENCES ACCORDINGLY AND THEN MAKING THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE MARKET TRANSACTIONS TO REFLECT THE RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR ASSET BEING VALUED.

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND UNRESOLVED MATTERS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND RESULT FROM EVENTS OR ACTIONS BY OTHERS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN A FUTURE LOSS. SUCH CONTINGENCIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS, LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PRODUCT QUALITY AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM OTHER EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS.

WHEN A LOSS IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE ULTIMATE LOSS. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW-END OF SUCH RANGE. HOWEVER, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A LOSS WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CONTINGENCY IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS OR A RANGE OF LOSS MAY NOT BE PRACTICABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FUTURE EVENTS AND DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES THAT WILL DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE CONTINGENCY. MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SUCH MATTERS TO BE RESOLVED OVER MANY YEARS, DURING WHICH TIME RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEW INFORMATION MUST BE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATED TO DETERMINE BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS. WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE, DISCLOSURE IS PROVIDED.

DISCLOSURE ALSO IS PROVIDED WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LOSS WILL BE INCURRED OR WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF A LOSS WILL EXCEED THE RECORDED PROVISION. WE REGULARLY REVIEW ALL CONTINGENCIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS HAS CHANGED AND TO ASSESS WHETHER A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS CAN BE MADE. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DEVELOPMENT OF A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF LOSS OR A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS IS COMPLEX WHEN THE OUTCOME IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH OR DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE COURT SYSTEM AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES. SUCH FACTORS BEAR DIRECTLY ON WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND BOUNDARIES OF HIGH AND LOW ESTIMATES.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2014-09,

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

, WHICH REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO WHICH IT EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED FOR THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. THE ASU WILL REPLACE MOST EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE IN GAAP WHEN IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE. IN JULY 2015, THE FASB APPROVED A ONE-YEAR DEFERRAL OF THIS STANDARD, WITH A REVISED EFFECTIVE DATE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, ALTHOUGH NOT PRIOR TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016. THE STANDARD PERMITS THE USE OF EITHER THE RETROSPECTIVE OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE (CUMULATIVE EFFECT) TRANSITION METHOD. WE ARE EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT ASU 2014-09 WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. WE HAVE NOT YET SELECTED A TRANSITION METHOD AND CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE STANDARD ON OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL REPORTING.

IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2015-02,

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

. THE ASU AMENDS THE CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE FOR VIES AND GENERAL PARTNERS' INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND MODIFIES THE EVALUATION OF WHETHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND SIMILAR LEGAL ENTITIES ARE VIES OR VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES. UPON ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENT ON JANUARY 1, 2016, WE WILL DECONSOLIDATE CERTAIN ENTITIES WHERE WE NO LONGER MEET THE DEFINITION OF PRIMARY BENEFICIARY UNDER THE REVISED GUIDANCE. THE EFFECT OF DECONSOLIDATION ON TOTAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NET OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE ENTITIES, IS EXPECTED TO BE IMMATERIAL. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO CONSOLIDATE ANY INCREMENTAL ENTITIES AS A RESULT OF ADOPTION. AS A RESULT OF THE MODIFIED EVALUATION OF WHETHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND SIMILAR LEGAL ENTITIES ARE VIES OR VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES, WE WILL HAVE INCREMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF UNCONSOLIDATED VIES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2015-16,

SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING FOR MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS

. THE ASU ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN ACQUIRER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS RETROSPECTIVELY. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE EFFECT THAT THE ASU WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON ANY MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS IDENTIFIED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

OUR OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES, INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.3 BILLION IN 2015 AND APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION IN EACH OF THE YEARS 2014 AND 2013. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $0.3 BILLION IN 2016 AND $0.2 BILLION IN 2017.

IN 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO DREDGE PCB-CONTAINING SEDIMENT FROM THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE CONSENT DECREE PROVIDED THAT THE DREDGING WOULD BE PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES. PHASE 1 WAS COMPLETED IN MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009. FOLLOWING PHASE 1, THE EPA CONDUCTED A PEER REVIEW OF THE PROJECT, MADE MODIFICATIONS AND GE AGREED TO PERFORM PHASE 2. WE INCREASED OUR RESERVE BY $0.8 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS OF COMPLETING PHASE 2. BETWEEN 2012 AND 2015, GE COMPLETED PHASE 2 AND THE EPA CONFIRMS THAT ALL DREDGING HAS BEEN PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED CONSENT DECREE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY RETAINS SUFFICIENT RESERVES TO ADDRESS REMAINING OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OBLIGATIONS REQUIRED FOR ALL POST-DREDGING WORK.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN 2000, GE AND THE EPA ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE RELATING TO PCB CLEANUP OF THE HOUSATONIC RIVER IN MASSACHUSETTS. IN 2012, THE EPA ISSUED A STATUS REPORT DESCRIBING POTENTIAL CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES TO A 10-MILE STRETCH OF THE RIVER DOWNSTREAM FROM A PREVIOUSLY REMEDIATED AREA. IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE EPA RELEASED AN INTENDED FINAL DECISION FOR THE SO CALLED "REST OF RIVER". THIS IS NOT THE EPA'S FINAL DECISION, RATHER, THE CONSENT DECREE PROVIDES FOR DISCUSSIONS AND A DETAILED DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS BETWEEN GE AND THE EPA, AFTER WHICH THE EPA WILL ISSUE ITS FINAL DECISION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, GE BELIEVES THAT IT HAS RECORDED ADEQUATE RESERVES TO COVER FUTURE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXPECTED FINAL REMEDY.

ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH MEASURES REVENUE EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ACQUISITIONS, BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS OF ESTABLISHED, ONGOING OPERATIONS BY EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE, WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING TRENDS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH SEPARATELY FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRENDS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND ENABLES A MORE DIRECT COMPARISON TO OTHER NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THE TERM "ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH" MAY BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY BY OTHER COMPANIES AND UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH THIS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON COMPARABILITY OF ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE GROWTH FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY, WE BELIEVE THAT THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL IN ASSESSING TRENDS OF THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES OR COMPANIES AND MAY THEREFORE BE A USEFUL TOOL IN ASSESSING PERIOD-TO-PERIOD PERFORMANCE TRENDS.

INCLUDES AVERAGE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, CALCULATED USING A FIVE-POINT AVERAGE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF ASSETS HELD BY GE TO SUPPORT GE CAPITAL.

OUR INDUSTRIAL ROTC CALCULATION EXCLUDES EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM THE NUMERATOR. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CLEARER WAY TO MEASURE THE ONGOING TREND IN RETURN ON INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS TO THE EXTENT THAT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS HAVE AFFECTED OUR REPORTED RESULTS. OUR INDUSTRIAL SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY USED IN THE DENOMINATOR IS ADJUSTED FOR DEBT, REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF ASSETS HELD BY THE GE PARENT TO SUPPORT GE CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL DENOMINATOR IN MEASURING THE RETURN ON OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. INDUSTRIAL ROTC WAS 16.9% IN 2015 VERSUS 14.0% IN 2014 AND 14.3% IN 2013. IN 2015, A 19% INCREASE IN THE ADJUSTED INDUSTRIAL RETURN WAS COMBINED WITH A 1% DECREASE IN THE ADJUSTED INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL. THIS DECREASE IN CAPITAL WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY SHARE BUYBACKS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING U.S DOLLAR. OUR CALCULATION OF THE RETURN ON INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADJUSTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE RESULT IN A MORE RELEVANT MEASURE FOR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL CONTINUING OPERATIONS, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, AND TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL CONTINUING OPERATIONS WITH THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES.

WE REFER TO CASH GENERATED BY OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AS "INDUSTRIAL CFOA," WHICH WE DEFINE AS GE'S CASH FROM CONTINUING OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY GE FROM GE CAPITAL. THIS INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING GE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES SOLD TO GE CAPITAL; GE CAPITAL SERVICES FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT AND MATERIAL PROCUREMENT; BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILES) LEASED BETWEEN GE AND GE CAPITAL; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND OTHER SERVICES SOLD TO GE CAPITAL BY GE; AIRCRAFT ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT ARE INSTALLED ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY GE CAPITAL FROM THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; AND VARIOUS INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ALLOCATIONS OF GE CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO COMPARE GE'S OPERATING CASH FLOWS WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF GE CAPITAL DIVIDENDS, SINCE THESE DIVIDENDS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND CAN VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THESE MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO CASH FLOW RESULTS OF COMPANIES THAT CONTAIN BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, BUT BELIEVES THAT THIS COMPARISON IS AIDED BY THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS OF DIVIDENDS PAID BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS AND THE SEPARATE PRESENTATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES (GE CAPITAL) CASH FLOWS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MEASURES OF INDUSTRIAL CFOA PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH USEFUL MEASURES TO COMPARE THE CAPACITY OF OUR INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS TO GENERATE OPERATING CASH FLOWS WITH THE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF OTHER NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES AND AS SUCH PROVIDE USEFUL MEASURES TO SUPPLEMENT THE REPORTED GAAP CFOA MEASURE.

WE BELIEVE THAT FREE CASH FLOW IS A USEFUL FINANCIAL METRIC TO ASSESS OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE OUR GROWTH. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING FREE CASH FLOW SEPARATELY FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRENDS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND ENABLES A MORE DIRECT COMPARISON TO OTHER NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING FREE CASH FLOW PLUS PROCEEDS FROM BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL PERFORMANCE AGAINST PERFORMANCE TARGETS. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THE TERM FREE CASH FLOW MAY BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY BY OTHER COMPANIES AND UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH THIS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON COMPARABILITY OF ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE GROWTH FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY, WE BELIEVE THAT THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL IN ASSESSING TRENDS OF THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES OR COMPANIES AND MAY THEREFORE BE A USEFUL TOOL IN ASSESSING PERIOD-TO-PERIOD PERFORMANCE TRENDS.

WE HAVE PROVIDED THE GE CAPITAL RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY ON A BASIS THAT REFLECTS THE USE OF LIQUIDITY AS A REDUCTION OF DEBT. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS RATIO, WE HAVE ALSO ADJUSTED CASH AND DEBT BALANCES TO INCLUDE AMOUNTS CLASSIFIED AS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A USEFUL COMPARISON TO A GAAP-BASED RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY BECAUSE LIQUIDITY BALANCES MAY BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT. THE USEFULNESS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE MAY BE LIMITED, HOWEVER, AS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY AT ANY POINT IN TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNT THAT COULD PRACTICALLY BE APPLIED TO REDUCE OUTSTANDING DEBT. DESPITE THIS POTENTIAL LIMITATION, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE, CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE, PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY BE MORE COMPARABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESSES.

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT BY EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY, WE PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF ASSETS REQUIRING CAPITAL TO FUND OUR CAPITAL SEGMENT AS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY RESULTED FROM DEBT ISSUANCES TO PRE-FUND FUTURE DEBT MATURITIES AND WILL NOT BE USED TO FUND ADDITIONAL ASSETS. LIQUIDITY CONSISTS OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND CERTAIN HIGH QUALITY INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS. AS A GENERAL MATTER, INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN LIQUIDITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY LIQUID, GIVING US THE ABILITY TO READILY CONVERT THEM TO CASH. PROVIDING THIS MEASURE WILL HELP INVESTORS MEASURE HOW WE ARE PERFORMING AGAINST OUR PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED GOAL TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 109

REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION

GE CAPITAL IS A NONBANK SIFI AND AS A RESULT SUBJECT TO FRB SUPERVISION. WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL SPLIT-OFF, AND THE FRB'S SUBSEQUENT APPROVAL OF GE CAPITAL'S APPLICATION TO DEREGISTER AS A SAVING AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY, GE CAPITAL IS NO LONGER A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY.

ON JULY 20, 2015 THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED A FINAL ORDER APPLYING ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS TO GE CAPITAL AS A NONBANK SIFI.

THE FINAL ORDER STAGGERS THE APPLICATION OF THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS WITH THE FIRST SET OF STANDARDS BECOMING APPLICABLE ON JANUARY 1, 2016 AND THE SECOND SET BECOMING APPLICABLE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. UNDER THE STANDARDS APPLICABLE ON JANUARY 1, 2016 GE CAPITAL BECAME SUBJECT TO THE FRB'S CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK USING THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO CALCULATE RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS. GE CAPITAL ALSO BECAME SUBJECT TO A LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR) OF 90% UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2016. AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2016, GE CAPITAL WILL NEED TO MAINTAIN 100% LCR COVERAGE.

IF GE CAPITAL IS STILL A NONBANK SIFI ON JANUARY 1, 2018 THE SECOND SET OF ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS WILL APPLY. THESE STANDARDS INCLUDE STRESS TESTING AND CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FRB'S MORE FORMAL COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) REGULATIONS, ENHANCED LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, ENHANCED GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS, DAILY LIQUIDITY CALCULATIONS, ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND A MARKET TERMS REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GE CAPITAL.

WHILE THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS DO NOT SUBJECT GE CAPITAL TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S CAPITAL PLAN RULE APPLICABLE TO LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNTIL THE CAPITAL PLANNING CYCLE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018, GE CAPITAL CONDUCTS AT A MINIMUM AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THEIR CAPITAL ADEQUACY PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING A PLAN FOR DIVIDENDS TO US, THE PARENT. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON A FORWARD-LOOKING ASSESSMENT OF THEIR MATERIAL ENTERPRISE RISKS AND INVOLVES THE CONSIDERATION OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO INCLUDES AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY LEVELS, AS WELL AS INCORPORATING RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS. THE MOST RECENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY REVIEW, WHICH CONTEMPLATED THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, WAS APPROVED BY THE GE CAPITAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RISK COMMITTEE IN OCTOBER 2015. WHILE A NONBANK SIFI LIKE GE CAPITAL IS CURRENTLY NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FRB APPROVAL TO PAY A DIVIDEND, IT MAY NOT, UNDER FRB REGULATIONS, CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND MANNER.

AS A NONBANK SIFI, GE CAPITAL IS ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL RESOLUTION PLAN TO THE FRB AND FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC). GE CAPITAL SUBMITTED ITS FIRST RESOLUTION PLAN TO THE FRB AND FDIC ON JUNE 30, 2014 AND FEEDBACK WAS PROVIDED ON JULY 28, 2015. GE CAPITAL'S SECOND RESOLUTION PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO THE FRB AND FDIC ON DECEMBER 31, 2015. GE CAPITAL'S RESOLUTION PLAN DESCRIBES HOW GE CAPITAL COULD BE RESOLVED UNDER EXISTING INSOLVENCY REGIMES IN A MANNER THAT MITIGATES POTENTIAL DISRUPTION TO THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WITHOUT THE USE OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OR TAXPAYER FUNDS. IF THE FRB AND FDIC DETERMINE THAT THEIR RESOLUTION PLAN IS DEFICIENT, THE DFA AUTHORIZES THE FRB AND FDIC TO IMPOSE MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ON GE CAPITAL OR RESTRICT THEIR GROWTH OR ACTIVITIES UNTIL THEY SUBMIT A PLAN REMEDYING THE DEFICIENCIES. IF THE FRB AND FDIC ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT GE CAPITAL HAS NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED THE DEFICIENCIES, THEY COULD ORDER GE CAPITAL TO DIVEST ASSETS OR OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THEIR ORDERLY RESOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF THEIR FAILURE.

GE CAPITAL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE VOLCKER RULE, WHICH U.S. REGULATORS FINALIZED ON DECEMBER 10, 2013. THE RULE PROHIBITS COMPANIES THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH U.S. INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FROM ENGAGING IN "PROPRIETARY TRADING" OR ACQUIRING OR RETAINING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN, OR SPONSORING OR ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH, A "HEDGE FUND" OR A "PRIVATE EQUITY FUND." PROPRIETARY TRADING AND FUND INVESTING, AS PROHIBITED BY THE RULE, ARE NOT CORE ACTIVITIES FOR GE CAPITAL.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, ON APRIL 10, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF ITS FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. GE HAS DISCUSSED THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, WITH ITS REGULATORS AND STAFF OF THE FSOC AND PLANS TO FILE ITS APPLICATION WITH THE FSOC IN EARLY 2016 TO TERMINATE THE FSOC'S DESIGNATION OF GE CAPITAL AS A NONBANK SIFI.

IN ADDITION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DECEMBER 2015 REORGANIZATION DESCRIBED IN THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN SECTION OF THE MD&A, GE CAPITAL'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED UNDER A NEW INTERNATIONAL HOLDING COMPANY, GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED. GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GE CAPITAL WITH ITS OWN CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND IT IS SUPERVISED BY THE U.K. PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA). THE PRA'S SUPERVISION INCLUDES CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS THAT COULD IMPACT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO GE CAPITAL, AND GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO SUCH SUPERVISION EVEN IF GE CAPITAL'S DESIGNATION AS A NONBANK SIFI IS TERMINATED.

RISK MANAGEMENT

REFER TO GE'S 2016 PROXY STATEMENT FOR BOARD COMMITTEE CHANGES EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2016.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 111

A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO RISK IS IMPORTANT IN A DIVERSIFIED ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE EXECUTING ACCORDING TO OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND THAT WE ONLY ACCEPT RISK FOR WHICH WE ARE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED. WE EVALUATE RISK AT THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION LEVEL, AND EVALUATE AGGREGATED RISK AT THE CUSTOMER, INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AND COLLATERAL-TYPE LEVELS, WHERE APPROPRIATE. THIS SECTION DESCRIBES OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES DURING 2015; REFER TO GE'S PROXY STATEMENT FOR BOARD COMMITTEE CHANGES EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2016.

RESPONSIBILITIES

GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

THE GE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOARD) HAS OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT WITH A FOCUS ON THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS FACING THE COMPANY, INCLUDING STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 112

SENIOR MANAGEMENT

THE GE BOARD'S RISK OVERSIGHT PROCESS BUILDS UPON MANAGEMENT'S RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PROCESSES, WHICH INCLUDE STANDARDIZED REVIEWS OF LONG-TERM STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL PLANNING; EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION; CODE OF CONDUCT COMPLIANCE UNDER THE COMPANY'S THE SPIRIT & THE LETTER; REGULATORY COMPLIANCE; HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE; FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONTROLLERSHIP; AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY.

THE CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING AND COORDINATING RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION ON AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE BASIS. IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF KEY BUSINESS RISKS, PROVIDING FOR APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OF THE BUSINESSES' MANAGEMENT OF THESE RISKS WITHIN GE BOARD GUIDELINES, AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

OPERATING REVIEWS

CORPORATE AUDIT STAFF & GE CAPITAL AUDIT

ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE GOVERNANCE, PROCESSES, CONTROLS AND ACCURACY OF GE'S AND GE CAPITAL'S FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE REPORTING.

THE POLICY COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD

IS A MANAGEMENT-LEVEL COMMITTEE THAT FURTHER ASSISTS IN ASSESSING AND MITIGATING RISK. THE POLICY COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD, MEMBERS OF WHICH PARTICIPATED IN EIGHT COMPLIANCE OPERATING REVIEWS IN 2015, IS CHAIRED BY THE COMPANY'S GENERAL COUNSEL AND INCLUDES THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND OTHER SENIOR-LEVEL FUNCTIONAL LEADERS. IT HAS PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE MATTERS ACROSS THE COMPANY.

GE BLUEPRINT REVIEWS

ARE INTEGRATED BUSINESS PLANNING REVIEWS ACROSS GE THAT EVALUATE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, OPERATING AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE, AND ENTERPRISE RISKS. BLUEPRINT REVIEWS ARE HELD AT LEAST FOUR TIMES PER YEAR AND INCLUDE THE MOST SENIOR GE BUSINESS LEADERS.

GE CAPITAL'S ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

OVERSEES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GE CAPITAL'S RISK APPETITE, AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT'S ESTABLISHMENT OF APPROPRIATE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE ENTERPRISE RISKS ARE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED, AND CONTROLLED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON GE CAPITAL'S ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE CAN BE FOUND IN THE GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION SECTION BELOW.

RISK MANAGERS

RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGEMENT AND ARE CARRIED OUT THROUGH RISK MANAGERS WHO ARE OPERATIONALLY INTEGRATED INTO EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE RISK MANAGERS BRING DEEP DOMAIN EXPERTISE TO THE BUSINESSES' OPERATIONS AND CORE PROCESSES. BOTH RISK MANAGERS AND THE BUSINESS LEADERSHIP TEAMS HAVE SPECIFIC, ENTERPRISE RISK FOCUSED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR OVERALL RISK FRAMEWORK.

RISK MITIGATION & COMMUNICATION

RISKS IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES ARE PRIORITIZED AND, DEPENDING ON THE PROBABILITY AND SEVERITY OF THE RISK, ESCALATED AS APPROPRIATE. SENIOR MANAGEMENT DISCUSSES THESE RISKS PERIODICALLY AND ASSIGNS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM TO THE BUSINESSES. THE ASSIGNED OWNERS CONTINUALLY MONITOR, EVALUATE AND REPORT ON RISKS FOR WHICH THEY BEAR RESPONSIBILITY. ENTERPRISE RISK LEADERS WITHIN EACH BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTION ARE RESPONSIBLE TO PRESENT RISK ASSESSMENTS AND KEY RISKS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. WE HAVE GENERAL RESPONSE STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING RISKS, WHICH CATEGORIZE RISKS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL AVOID, TRANSFER, REDUCE OR ACCEPT THE RISK. THESE RESPONSE STRATEGIES ARE TAILORED TO ENSURE THAT RISK LEVELS ARE WITHIN THE COMPANY'S RISK APPETITE.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 113

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE RISK INVOLVED AND THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR FUNCTION AFFECTED, WE USE A WIDE VARIETY OF RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES, INCLUDING DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY, STANDARDIZED PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC PLANNING REVIEWS, OPERATING REVIEWS, INSURANCE, AND HEDGING. AS A MATTER OF POLICY, WE GENERALLY HEDGE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. OUR SERVICE BUSINESSES EMPLOY A COMPREHENSIVE TOLLGATE PROCESS LEADING UP TO AND THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF A CONTRACTUAL SERVICE AGREEMENT TO MITIGATE LEGAL, FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS. FURTHERMORE, WE CENTRALLY MANAGE SOME RISKS BY PURCHASING INSURANCE, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY BALANCING THE LEVEL OF RISK RETAINED OR ASSUMED WITH THE COST OF TRANSFERRING RISK TO OTHERS. WE MANAGE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATIONS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND CUSTOMER DEMAND BY MONITORING INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDING BY ADJUSTING CAPACITY, IMPLEMENTING COST REDUCTIONS AND ENGAGING IN MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.

GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION

GE CAPITAL PROMOTES A STRONG CULTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT, COMBINED WITH A RISK FRAMEWORK THAT EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTS APPROPRIATE RISK AWARENESS, BEHAVIORS AND SOUND RISK-BASED DECISION MAKING. GE CAPITAL'S RISK FRAMEWORK RECOGNIZES THAT EFFECTIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT MUST INCLUDE THREE DISTINCT LINES OF DEFENSE MADE UP OF GE CAPITAL'S BUSINESS UNITS, CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION.

BUSINESS UNITS OWN AND MANAGE RISK AS A FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE WITH DEEP RISK EXPERTISE. THE GE CAPITAL CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION PROVIDES INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AND CHALLENGE AS A SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE. THE SENIOR RISK PROFESSIONALS HAVE, ON AVERAGE, OVER 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. GE CAPITAL AUDIT PROVIDES THE THIRD LINE OF DEFENSE.

CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT LEVERAGES THE RISK INFRASTRUCTURE IN EACH OF GE CAPITAL'S BUSINESS UNITS, WHICH HAVE ADOPTED AN APPROACH THAT CORRESPONDS TO GE CAPITAL'S OVERALL RISK POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND REVIEW MECHANISMS. GE CAPITAL'S RISK INFRASTRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ALL RISKS RELEVANT TO ITS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT THAT, IF THEY MATERIALIZED, COULD PREVENT GE CAPITAL FROM ACHIEVING ITS RISK OBJECTIVES OR RESULT IN LOSSES. THESE RISKS COMPRISE GE CAPITAL'S ENTERPRISE RISK UNIVERSE, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING RISKS: STRATEGIC, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT, MARKET, COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL (INCLUDING FINANCIAL, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES AND LEGAL). REPUTATIONAL RISK IS CONSIDERED AND MANAGED ACROSS EACH OF THE CATEGORIES.

GE CAPITAL CONTINUES TO ENHANCE ITS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES CONSISTENT WITH THE HEIGHTENED SUPERVISORY EXPECTATIONS APPLICABLE TO IT AS A NONBANK SIFI. AS A RESULT, GE CAPITAL IS EXECUTING ON STRATEGIC PROGRAMS AND AN EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF DELIVERABLES TO IMPROVE DATA AND REPORTING SYSTEMS, RISK AND GOVERNANCE PROCESSES AND OTHER ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES INCLUDING CAPITAL PLANNING, MODELS, VALUATIONS AND REGULATORY REPORTING.

THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND GE CAPITAL BOARD ESTABLISH GE CAPITAL'S RISK APPETITE AND OVERSEE ITS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.  ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE GE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS MUST COMPLY WITH APPROVAL LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GE CAPITAL BOARD OR WITHIN THE BUSINESS UNITS PURSUANT TO DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY, AND THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GE CAPITAL BOARD RETAIN APPROVAL AUTHORITY FOR SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, BORROWINGS AND INVESTMENTS.

GE CAPITAL'S ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (ERMC), WHICH COMPRISES THE MOST SENIOR LEADERS OF GE CAPITAL, OVERSEES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GE CAPITAL'S RISK APPETITE, AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT'S ESTABLISHMENT OF APPROPRIATE SYSTEMS (INCLUDING POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES) TO ENSURE ENTERPRISE RISKS ARE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED, AND CONTROLLED. THE ERMC HAS DELEGATED THE MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC RISKS TO VARIOUS SUB-COMMITTEES, INCLUDING THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE, CAPITAL PLANNING COMMITTEE, ALLOWANCE AND VALUATION RISK COMMITTEE, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK COMMITTEE, MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION COMMITTEE AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE. A SIMILAR COMMITTEE STRUCTURE, WHERE APPROPRIATE, IS REPLICATED AT THE BUSINESS UNIT LEVEL.

THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GE CAPITAL BOARD PERIODICALLY REVIEW AND APPROVE KEY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND THEY MEET WITH GE CAPITAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AT THESE MEETINGS, GE CAPITAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON THE RISK ISSUES, STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE OF THE BUSINESS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 114

GE CAPITAL'S CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE ERMC, UPDATES GE CAPITAL'S ENTERPRISE RISK APPETITE STATEMENT ANNUALLY. THIS DOCUMENT ARTICULATES THE ENTERPRISE RISK OBJECTIVES, ITS KEY UNIVERSE OF RISKS AND THE SUPPORTING LIMIT STRUCTURE. GE CAPITAL'S RISK APPETITE IS DETERMINED RELATIVE TO ITS DESIRED RISK OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CREDIT RATINGS, CAPITAL LEVELS, LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS, EARNINGS, DIVIDENDS AND COMPLIANCE. GE CAPITAL DETERMINES ITS RISK APPETITE THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF PORTFOLIO ANALYTICS, INCLUDING STRESS TESTING AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL MEASUREMENT, EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT OF SENIOR RISK OFFICERS, CURRENT PORTFOLIO LEVELS, STRATEGIC PLANNING, AND REGULATORY AND RATING AGENCY EXPECTATIONS.

THE ENTERPRISE RISK APPETITE STATEMENT IS PRESENTED TO THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GE CAPITAL BOARD FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL AT LEAST ANNUALLY. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE STATUS OF GE CAPITAL'S PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE LIMITS IS REVIEWED BY THE GE RISK COMMITTEE, THE GE CAPITAL BOARD AND THE ERMC.

GE CAPITAL MONITORS ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY INCLUDING THROUGH ECONOMIC CAPITAL, REGULATORY CAPITAL, SCENARIO ANALYSIS AND ENTERPRISE STRESS TESTING METHODOLOGIES. GE CAPITAL'S ECONOMIC CAPITAL METHODOLOGY USES INTERNAL MODELS TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL UNEXPECTED LOSSES ACROSS DIFFERENT PORTFOLIOS WITH A CONFIDENCE LEVEL EQUIVALENT TO AN A CREDIT AGENCY RATING. GE CAPITAL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FRB'S CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK USING THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO CALCULATE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AND IT USES SCENARIO ANALYSIS AND STRESS TESTING FOR RISK, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PURPOSES AND AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF GE CAPITAL'S OVERALL PLANNING PROCESSES. SCENARIO ANALYSIS AND STRESS TESTING RESULTS INFORM KEY STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO DECISIONS SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM EXPECTED REGULATORY CAPITAL LEVELS IN SEVERE BUT PLAUSIBLE STRESSES,

CAPITAL ALLOCATION, ASSIST IN DEVELOPING THE RISK APPETITE AND LIMITS AND HELP IN ASSESSING PRODUCT SPECIFIC RISK TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND MODIFICATION OF PRODUCT STRUCTURES. THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GE CAPITAL BOARD REVIEW THESE RESULTS AND THEIR EXPECTED IMPACT ON CAPITAL LEVELS AND METRICS. THE GE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE GE CAPITAL BOARD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS, AS WELL AS APPROVING GE CAPITAL'S ANNUAL CAPITAL PLAN AND CAPITAL ACTIONS. IF GE CAPITAL IS STILL A NON-BANK SIFI ON JANUARY 1, 2018, IT WILL ALSO BECOME SUBJECT TO STRESS TESTING AND CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FRB'S MORE FORMAL COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) REGULATIONS, ENHANCED LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, ENHANCED GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS, DAILY LIQUIDITY CALCULATIONS, ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND A MARKET TERMS REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GE CAPITAL.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 115

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS," AS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) SECTION AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES.

GE'S CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION LEVERAGES THE RISK FRAMEWORK IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH HAVE ADOPTED AN APPROACH THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE COMPANY'S OVERALL RISK POLICIES, GUIDELINES AND REVIEW MECHANISMS. OUR RISK FRAMEWORK OPERATES AT THE BUSINESS AND FUNCTIONAL LEVELS AND IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY, EVALUATE AND MITIGATE RISKS WITHIN EACH OF THE RISK CATEGORIES BELOW.

OUR BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER AND ADDRESS RISKS, SOME OF WHICH WILL CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO BE DIFFERENT – SOMETIMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT – THAN WE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE. BELOW, WE DESCRIBE CERTAIN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL, AND LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. OUR REACTIONS TO MATERIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS' REACTIONS TO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WILL AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

STRATEGIC RISKS

STRATEGIC RISK RELATES TO THE COMPANY'S FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS AND STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH: THE GLOBAL MACRO-ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE; MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; AND OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, COMPETITIVE THREATS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT INNOVATION, AND PUBLIC POLICY.

GLOBAL MACRO-ENVIRONMENT - OUR GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS.

WE OPERATE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD AND SERVE CUSTOMERS IN APPROXIMATELY 180 COUNTRIES. IN 2015, APPROXIMATELY 55% OF OUR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLANS AND STRATEGIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS. THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION, CURRENCY VOLATILITY, CURRENCY CONTROLS AND ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED DEFAULT ON SOVEREIGN DEBT. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS CAN BE HEDGED USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION MAY DECREASE OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS A RESULT OF MORE VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS.

M&A/RESTRUCTURING - THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS.

WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION AND COLLABORATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED COST SAVINGS FROM RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER MARGIN RATES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ANTICIPATED RETURNS FROM THE ALSTOM ACQUISITION INCLUDE COST AND GROWTH SYNERGY BENEFITS OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD THAT WE MAY NOT FULLY REALIZE. WE ALSO PARTICIPATE IN A NUMBER OF JOINT VENTURES WITH OTHER COMPANIES OR GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES IN VARIOUS MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES WHERE WE MAY HAVE A LESSER DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL, LEGAL OR COMPLIANCE RISKS. WE ARE SELLING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND BUSINESSES IN NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, AND WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF OTHER ASSETS AND BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR EXECUTING ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, OR WITH THE EXCLUSION OF ASSETS THAT MUST BE DIVESTED OR RUN OFF SEPARATELY. AFTER REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH A BUYER OR SELLER FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF A BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE PROPOSED SALE OF APPLIANCES TO HAIER, THE TRANSACTION REMAINS SUBJECT TO NECESSARY REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS AS WELL AS THE SATISFACTION OF PRE-CLOSING CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM COMPLETING THE TRANSACTION. DISPOSITIONS MAY ALSO INVOLVE CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESS, SUCH AS THROUGH CONTINUING EQUITY OWNERSHIP, TRANSITION SERVICE AGREEMENTS, GUARANTEES, INDEMNITIES OR OTHER CURRENT OR CONTINGENT FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, PERFORMANCE BY THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES OR OTHER CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 116

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO OURS.

OUR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING OR SELLING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE OF OURS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY US TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY. WE COULD ALSO FACE COMPETITION IN SOME COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE NOT INVESTED IN AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO. WE ALSO FACE ATTEMPTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR IT SYSTEMS OR PRODUCTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPROPERLY ACQUIRING OUR TRADE SECRETS OR CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AS A RESULT OF SUCH AN INCIDENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURE OR RETAIN OWNERSHIP OR RIGHTS TO USE DATA IN CERTAIN SOFTWARE ANALYTICS OR SERVICES OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF SUCH CLAIMS, RESPONDING TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. IF GE IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR WE COULD BE ENJOINED FROM OFFERING SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR RENEW FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES WE NEED IN THE FUTURE, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

OPERATIONAL RISK RELATES TO RISKS ARISING FROM SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, PEOPLE AND EXTERNAL EVENTS THAT AFFECT THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESSES. IT INCLUDES PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE AND EXECUTION; PRODUCT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND DATA PROTECTION AND SECURITY, INCLUDING CYBER SECURITY; SUPPLY CHAIN AND BUSINESS DISRUPTION; AND OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING HUMAN RESOURCES AND REPUTATION.

OPERATIONS - WE MAY FACE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WE ARE DEPENDENT ON MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING PRODUCT LINES, MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INTRODUCTIONS AND PRODUCT AND SERVICE INNOVATIONS FOR CONTINUED REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH.

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR BOTH OUR AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE OR USE LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. WHILE WE HAVE BUILT EXTENSIVE OPERATIONAL PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT OUR PRODUCT DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICING, AND OTHER SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE, MEET THE MOST RIGOROUS QUALITY STANDARDS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE OR OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WILL NOT EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL PROCESS FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THROUGH CYBER ATTACKS AND OTHER INTENTIONAL ACTS, THAT COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL PRODUCT, SAFETY, REGULATORY OR ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT OR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS, OPERATIONAL FAILURES OR QUALITY ISSUES, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES, ATTRITION OR LABOR RELATIONS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR PROJECTS WHERE WE TAKE ON THE FULL SCOPE OF ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION OR OTHER SERVICES, THE POTENTIAL RISK IS GREATER THAT OPERATIONAL, QUALITY OR OTHER ISSUES AT PARTICULAR PROJECTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GE'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND REQUIRE SKILLED TALENT. OUR LONG-TERM OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP, INTRODUCE, AND MARKET NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO MODIFY EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO CUSTOMIZE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND OUTCOMES IN LINE WITH OUR PROJECTED PERFORMANCE AND/OR COST ESTIMATES.

CYBERSECURITY - INCREASED CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS, VULNERABILITIES, THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED COMPUTER CRIME COULD POSE A RISK TO OUR SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS, SERVICES AND DATA.

INCREASED GLOBAL CYBERSECURITY VULNERABILITIES, THREATS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED CYBER-RELATED ATTACKS POSE A RISK TO THE SECURITY OF GE'S AND ITS CUSTOMERS', PARTNERS', SUPPLIERS' AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS' PRODUCTS, SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF GE'S AND ITS CUSTOMERS' DATA. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS BY EMPLOYING A NUMBER OF MEASURES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE TRAINING, MONITORING AND TESTING, AND MAINTENANCE OF PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS AND CONTINGENCY PLANS, WE REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO ADDITIONAL KNOWN OR UNKNOWN THREATS. WE ALSO MAY HAVE ACCESS TO SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL OR PERSONAL DATA OR INFORMATION IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES THAT IS SUBJECT TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND CUSTOMER-IMPOSED CONTROLS. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL OR PERSONAL DATA OR INFORMATION, WE MAY BE VULNERABLE TO MATERIAL SECURITY BREACHES, THEFT, MISPLACED OR LOST DATA, PROGRAMMING ERRORS, EMPLOYEE ERRORS AND/OR MALFEASANCE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE COMPROMISING OF SENSITIVE, CONFIDENTIAL OR PERSONAL DATA OR INFORMATION, IMPROPER USE OF OUR SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS OR NETWORKS, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, DISCLOSURE, MODIFICATION OR DESTRUCTION OF INFORMATION, DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, PRODUCTION DOWNTIMES AND OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS. IN ADDITION, A CYBER-RELATED ATTACK COULD RESULT IN OTHER NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION OR COMPETITIVENESS, REMEDIATION OR INCREASED PROTECTION COSTS, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 117

SUPPLY CHAIN - SIGNIFICANT RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, SUPPLIER QUALITY AND SOURCING ISSUES OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. SOME OF THESE SUPPLIERS OR THEIR SUB-SUPPLIERS ARE LIMITED- OR SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. QUALITY AND SOURCING ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RESULT IN LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

FINANCIAL RISKS

FINANCIAL RISK RELATES TO OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO BROAD MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES; CREDIT RISK; AND LIQUIDITY RISK, INCLUDING RISK RELATED TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND OUR AVAILABILITY AND COST OF FUNDING. CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS ARISING FROM A CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY FAILURE TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE FACE CREDIT RISK IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS IN OUR GE CAPITAL INVESTING, LENDING AND LEASING ACTIVITIES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACTIVITIES. LIQUIDITY RISK REFERS TO THE POTENTIAL INABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OR CONTINGENT FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS (WHETHER ON- OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET) AS THEY ARISE, AND COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT AN INSTITUTION'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OVERALL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS.

ECONOMY/COUNTER-PARTIES - A DETERIORATION OF CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE OR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, OR THE SOUNDNESS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTS WE DEAL WITH, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CONDITIONS IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, POWER GENERATION, OIL AND GAS, RENEWABLES, HEALTHCARE, HOME BUILDING AND OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY FASHION AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS DETERIORATION, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, LOW OIL PRICES OR DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING DUE TO SLOWER GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OTHER CHALLENGES AFFECTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. IN PARTICULAR, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, AND THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL IS CORRELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF SLOW GROWTH IN THE U.S. OR INTERNATIONALLY THAT RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAFFIC COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. SERVICE CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OR CUSTOMER DYNAMICS SUCH AS EARLY AIRCRAFT RETIREMENTS, REDUCED ELECTRICITY DEMAND IN OUR POWER AND RENEWABLE ENERGY BUSINESSES OR DECLINES IN ORDERS, PROJECT COMMENCEMENT DELAYS AND PRICING PRESSURES ON OUR OIL & GAS BUSINESS FROM LOW OIL PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IF SLOWER GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IF CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DETERIORATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND TAX ASSETS. DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES, IMPAIRMENTS OR WRITE-OFFS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, GE CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION, GE CAPITAL'S CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL HELD CANNOT BE REALIZED THROUGH SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES INSUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS EXPOSURE TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF CASH ON DEPOSIT AND UNSECURED DEBT INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING TO CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTES 20 AND 27

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY LOSSES OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE'S OR GE CAPITAL'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 118

FUNDING ACCESS/COSTS - FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, OR CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, FUNDING COSTS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION.

THE MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, GE AND GE CAPITAL'S LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS SERVICE (S&P) WAS AA+ (THE SECOND HIGHEST OF 22 RATING CATEGORIES) WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY'S) FOR GE AND FOR GE CAPITAL WAS A1 (THE FIFTH HIGHEST OF 21 CREDIT RATINGS), BOTH WITH STABLE OUTLOOKS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, GE AND GE CAPITAL'S SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING FROM S&P WAS A-1+ (THE HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF SIX CATEGORIES) AND FROM MOODY'S WAS P-1 (THE HIGHEST RATING CATEGORY OF FOUR CATEGORIES). THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS. VARIOUS DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION.

FURTHERMORE, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE UNSECURED DEBT MARKETS TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR TERM AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MATURITIES FOR 2016 AND BEYOND, EXTERNAL CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING AT PARTICULAR TIMES OR INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDING, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING OR CAUSE AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING COSTS INCLUDE DECREASED CAPACITY AND INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUERS, AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS ARISING IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE OR CHINA FROM DEVELOPMENTS IN SOVEREIGN DEBT SITUATIONS, CURRENCY MOVEMENTS OR OTHER POTENTIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS. IF GE OR GE CAPITAL'S COST OF FUNDING WERE TO INCREASE, IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND RESULT IN LOWER NET INTEREST MARGINS, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AS WELL AS LOWER RETURNS ON SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND INVESTED CAPITAL.

SOCIAL COSTS - SUSTAINED INCREASES IN PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS COSTS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. GAAP REQUIRES THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USE TO ESTIMATE PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2016 ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO EQUITY. AT THE END OF 2015, THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED, ON A GAAP BASIS, BY $16.9 BILLION, AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN, AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD A PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $6.1 BILLION. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). FAILURE TO ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS DRIVEN BY VARIOUS FACTORS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE A CONTINUED ENVIRONMENT OF LOW INTEREST RATES OR SUSTAINED MARKET VOLATILITY, COULD ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY OUR PENSION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, SEE THE OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION – POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS SECTION AND NOTES 12 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE ALSO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES – PENSION ASSUMPTIONS SECTION FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY OUR PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

LEGAL & COMPLIANCE RISKS

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK RELATES TO RISKS ARISING FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND ACTION, INCLUDING RESULTING FROM THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT; AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE WITH INTEGRITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO FINANCIAL REPORTING, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY RISK INCLUDES THE RISK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR REGULATORY ACTIONS WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COST ON US OR CAUSE US TO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS OR PRACTICES.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 119

REGULATORY - WE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND NON-U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN WAYS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS BY RESTRICTING EXISTING ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTS, SUBJECTING THEM TO ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITING THEM OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR, SUBSTANTIAL REVISIONS THAT U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERTAKING OR CONSIDERING IN AREAS SUCH AS THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CONSUMER LENDING, FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION IN RESPONSE TO CURRENCY VOLATILITY, TRADE CONTROLS, THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKET AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON GE'S, GE CAPITAL'S OR OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES' STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS, SALES, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, EFFORTS BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE COSTS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REIMBURSEMENTS AND INCREASED UTILIZATION CONTROLS RELATED TO THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. CONTINUED GOVERNMENT SCRUTINY, INCLUDING REVIEWS OF THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (U.S. FDA) MEDICAL DEVICE PRE-MARKET AUTHORIZATION AND POST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE PROCESSES, MAY IMPACT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SLOW OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE BEEN, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE, PARTICIPATING IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH STRICT GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS. INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STATUS IN THESE PROJECTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

DODD-FRANK - UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO PRUDENTIAL OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS A RESULT OF GE CAPITAL'S DESIGNATION AS A NONBANK SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (NONBANK SIFI), WHICH SUBJECTS US TO INCREASED AND EVOLVING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

GE CAPITAL IS A NONBANK SIFI AND AS A RESULT IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FRB) SUPERVISION. ON JULY 20, 2015 THE FRB PUBLISHED A FINAL ORDER THAT APPLIES ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS TO GE CAPITAL AS A NONBANK SIFI. THE FINAL ORDER STAGGERS THE APPLICATION OF THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS WITH THE FIRST SET OF STANDARDS BECOMING APPLICABLE ON JANUARY 1, 2016 AND THE SECOND SET BECOMING APPLICABLE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. UNDER THE STANDARDS APPLICABLE ON JANUARY 1, 2016 GE CAPITAL BECAME SUBJECT TO THE FRB'S CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK USING THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO CALCULATE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A 90% LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND A 100% RATIO THEREAFTER. IF GE CAPITAL IS STILL A NONBANK SIFI ON JANUARY 1, 2018 THE SECOND SET OF ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS WILL APPLY. THESE STANDARDS WOULD INCLUDE STRESS TESTING AND CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FRB'S MORE FORMAL COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) REGULATIONS, ENHANCED LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, ENHANCED GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS, DAILY LIQUIDITY CALCULATIONS, ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND A MARKET TERMS REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GE CAPITAL. GE CAPITAL PLANS TO FILE AN APPLICATION WITH THE FSOC IN EARLY 2016 TO TERMINATE THE FSOC'S DESIGNATION OF GE CAPITAL AS A NONBANK SIFI, BUT THE TIMELINE FOR THE FSOC TO ACT ON THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNCERTAIN AND A FAVORABLE FSOC DECISION IS NOT ASSURED. UNTIL THE FSOC APPROVES THE TERMINATION OF GE CAPITAL'S DESIGNATION AS A NONBANK SIFI, GE CAPITAL WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND, DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF FAVORABLE FSOC ACTION, MAY NEED TO DELAY PLANNED COST REDUCTIONS AND POTENTIAL CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS SECTION. WE, OUR REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE SUBJECT TO CONTINUING SCRUTINY BY REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH MAY, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND DAMAGES. SINCE CLOSING OUR ACQUISITION OF ALSTOM'S THERMAL, RENEWABLES AND GRID BUSINESSES IN NOVEMBER 2015, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH LEGACY MATTERS INVOLVING THOSE BUSINESSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL AND THAT WE ARE NOW INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING. IN ADDITION TO COMMERCIAL DISPUTES ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THERE ARE ALSTOM LEGACY MATTERS IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT INCLUDE ALLEGED ANTI-COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES OR IMPROPER PAYMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE ALLEGED CONDUCT PREDATED OUR ACQUISITION OF THE RELEVANT ALSTOM BUSINESSES, WE MAY NEVERTHELESS BE HELD LIABLE FOR FINES, JUDGMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH CURRENTLY PENDING OR FUTURE PROCEEDINGS. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REMEDIAL ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED SITES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF A STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE THAT WE COMPLETED IN 2015 AND ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION FOR A STRETCH OF THE HOUSATONIC RIVER IN MASSACHUSETTS, AS DESCRIBED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS SECTION. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THE CURRENT ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT MEAN THAT LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THERE ARE 14 LAWSUITS RELATING TO PENDING MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE CLAIMS IN WHICH WMC, OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS THAT WE SOLD IN 2007, IS A PARTY. THE ADVERSE PARTIES IN THESE CASES ARE SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR PARTIES CLAIMING TO ACT ON THEIR BEHALF. WHILE THE ALLEGED CLAIMS FOR RELIEF VARY FROM CASE TO CASE, THE COMPLAINTS AND COUNTERCLAIMS IN THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY ASSERT CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, INDEMNIFICATION, AND/OR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, AND SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE (REPURCHASE) AND/OR MONETARY DAMAGES. BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2013, WMC ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENTS THAT REDUCED ITS EXPOSURE ON CLAIMS ASSERTED IN CERTAIN SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE CLAIM AMOUNTS REPORTED HEREIN REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THESE SETTLEMENTS.

FIVE WMC CASES ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT. FOUR OF THESE CASES WERE INITIATED IN 2012, AND ONE WAS INITIATED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2013. DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY (DEUTSCHE BANK) IS THE ADVERSE PARTY IN FOUR CASES, AND LAW DEBENTURE TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK (LAW DEBENTURE) IS THE ADVERSE PARTY IN ONE CASE. THE DEUTSCHE BANK COMPLAINTS ASSERT CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $4,300 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND SEEK TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY $1,800 MILLION. THE LAW DEBENTURE COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND ALLEGES LOSSES ON THESE LOANS IN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION.

FOUR WMC CASES ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AGAINST US BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (US BANK), ONE OF WHICH WAS INITIATED BY WMC SEEKING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT. THREE OF THESE CASES WERE FILED IN 2012, AND ONE WAS FILED IN 2011. THE MINNESOTA CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND DO NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES SOUGHT. ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2014, US BANK FILED A PETITION FOR INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF TRUSTS IN MINNESOTA STATE COURT SEEKING AUTHORIZATION AND INSTRUCTION FOR US BANK TO IMPLEMENT THE TERMS OF A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REACHED WITH WMC TO COMPROMISE, SETTLE, AND RELEASE ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE SECURITIZATIONS AT ISSUE IN THESE FOUR LAWSUITS.

IN FEBRUARY 2015, TWO BONDHOLDERS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, AND IN RESPONSE THE COURT HELD AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON FEBRUARY 1, 2016.

IN LIGHT OF THE STATE COURT ACTION SEEKING APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE DISTRICT COURT HAS STAYED FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN THE FOUR CASES UNTIL APRIL 2016.

FOUR CASES ARE PENDING AGAINST WMC IN NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT, ALL OF WHICH WERE INITIATED BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR SECURITIES ADMINISTRATORS. THESE CASES INVOLVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, CLAIMS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY $4,559 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. ONE OF THESE LAWSUITS WAS INITIATED BY DEUTSCHE BANK IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2013 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC AND BARCLAYS BANK PLC. IT INVOLVES CLAIMS AGAINST WMC ON APPROXIMATELY $1,000 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND DOES NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES SOUGHT. THE SECOND CASE, IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF IS THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON (BNY), WAS INITIATED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2012 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC, J.P. MORGAN MORTGAGE ACQUISITION CORPORATION AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. BNY ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $1,300 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $650 MILLION. THE THIRD CASE WAS INITIATED BY BNY IN NOVEMBER 2013 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC, J.P. MORGAN MORTGAGE ACQUISITION CORPORATION AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. IN THIS CASE, BNY ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $1,300 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS, AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $600 MILLION. ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2015, THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS THIS CASE ON STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS GROUNDS, AND THE PLAINTIFF FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL ON OCTOBER 21, 2015. THE FOURTH CASE WAS FILED IN OCTOBER 2014 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS WMC, J.P. MORGAN MORTGAGE ACQUISITION CORPORATION AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. THE PLAINTIFF, BNY, ASSERTS CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $959 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $475 MILLION.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 121

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, TWO CASES WERE PENDING AGAINST WMC IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2015. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2015, WMC CONCLUDED A SETTLEMENT OF ONE OF THESE CASES, RESULTING IN THE DISMISSAL OF THE LAWSUIT WITH PREJUDICE. THIS CASE, WHICH BNY FILED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2012, INVOLVED CLAIMS ON APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND ALLEGED DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $378 MILLION. IN 2014, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE ON THE CLAIMS ARISING FROM A PORTION OF THE LOANS HELD IN THE TRUST, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2015. ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2015, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE ON THE REMAINING CLAIMS IN THE CASE, AND THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTEE DECLARED THIS SETTLEMENT EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 20, 2015 AND THE CASE WAS FORMALLY DISMISSED ON OCTOBER 23, 2015. THE REMAINING CASE WAS INITIATED BY THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY (FHFA) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2012. IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2013, DEUTSCHE BANK, IN ITS ROLE AS SECURITIZATION TRUSTEE, INTERVENED AS A PLAINTIFF AND FILED A COMPLAINT RELATING TO APPROXIMATELY $1,300 MILLION OF LOANS AND ALLEGING LOSSES IN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION. IN DECEMBER 2013, THE DISTRICT COURT ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING WMC'S MOTION TO DISMISS BUT, ON ITS OWN MOTION, ORDERED RE-BRIEFING ON SEVERAL ISSUES RAISED BY WMC'S MOTION TO DISMISS IN FEBRUARY 2015. ON JULY 10, 2015, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED AN ORDER DISMISSING THE LAWSUIT AS TIME-BARRED UNDER THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. DEUTSCHE BANK FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL FROM THIS ORDER OF DISMISSAL ON AUGUST 13, 2015.

THE AMOUNTS OF THE CLAIMS AT ISSUE IN THESE CASES (DISCUSSED ABOVE) REFLECT THE PURCHASE PRICE OR UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS AT ISSUE AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND DO NOT GIVE EFFECT TO PAY DOWNS, ACCRUED INTEREST OR FEES, OR POTENTIAL RECOVERIES BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. ALL OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS INVOLVED IN THESE LAWSUITS ARE INCLUDED IN WMC'S REPORTED CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

IN DECEMBER 2015, WE LEARNED THAT, AS PART OF CONTINUING INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATION OF SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY, AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989 (FIRREA) BY WMC AND ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF THE ORIGINATION, PURCHASE OR SALE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED SUBPOENAS FOR DOCUMENTS TO WMC AND GE CAPITAL IN JANUARY 2016. WE WILL COOPERATE WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS AT AN EARLY STAGE.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF ALSTOM'S THERMAL, RENEWABLES AND GRID BUSINESSES IN NOVEMBER 2015, WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH LEGACY MATTERS INVOLVING THOSE BUSINESSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL AND THAT WE ARE NOW INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY ALSTOM, FOLLOWING A EUROPEAN UNION INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES IN THE SALE OF GAS-INSULATED SWITCHGEARS THAT BEGAN IN 2004 AND CONCLUDED WITH ALSTOM'S PAYMENT OF A €79 MILLION FINE IN 2014, IN SEPTEMBER 2013 THE ISRAELI ANTITRUST AUTHORITY ISSUED A DECISION WHEREBY ALSTOM, SIEMENS AG AND ABB LTD. WERE HELD LIABLE FOR AN ALLEGED ANTI-COMPETITIVE ARRANGEMENT IN THE GAS-INSULATED SWITCHGEARS MARKET IN ISRAEL. WHILE THERE IS NO FINE IN CONNECTION WITH THAT DECISION, CLAIMANTS BROUGHT CIVIL ACTIONS IN 2013 SEEKING DAMAGES OF APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION AND $600 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE ALLEGED CONDUCT UNDERLYING THE DECISION THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT IN ISRAEL. IN MARCH 2015, THE COURT CONSOLIDATED THE CIVIL ACTIONS INTO ONE PROCEEDING AS TO LIABILITY, BUT NO TRIAL DATE HAS YET BEEN SET.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN 2000, GE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE RELATING TO PCB CLEANUP OF THE HOUSATONIC RIVER IN MASSACHUSETTS. IN 2012, THE EPA ISSUED A STATUS REPORT DESCRIBING POTENTIAL CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES TO A 10-MILE STRETCH OF THE RIVER DOWNSTREAM FROM A PREVIOUSLY REMEDIATED AREA. IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE EPA RELEASED AN INTENDED FINAL DECISION FOR THE SO CALLED "REST OF RIVER". THIS IS NOT THE EPA'S FINAL DECISION, RATHER, THE CONSENT DECREE PROVIDES FOR DISCUSSIONS AND A DETAILED DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS BETWEEN GE AND EPA, AFTER WHICH THE EPA WILL ISSUE ITS FINAL DECISION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, GE BELIEVES THAT IT HAS RECORDED ADEQUATE RESERVES TO COVER FUTURE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXPECTED FINAL REMEDY.

THE COMPANY IS REPORTING THE FOLLOWING MATTER IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEC REQUIREMENTS TO DISCLOSE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS A PARTY POTENTIALLY INVOLVING MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000 OR GREATER. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN OCTOBER 2014, THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS SEEKING PENALTIES UNDER THE CLEAN AIR AND RESOURCE AND CONSERVATION RECOVERY ACTS IN CONNECTION WITH A FACILITY SOLD TO MOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, INC. IN 2006. THE ALLEGATIONS RELATE TO IMPROPER OPERATION OF POLLUTION CONTROL MONITORING EQUIPMENT BY INCINERATOR OPERATORS. THE MATTER WAS RESOLVED THROUGH A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK THAT WAS FILED DECEMBER 4, 2015, AND PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT GE PAID A PENALTY OF $2.3 MILLION ON JANUARY 4, 2016.

MANAGEMENT AND AUDITOR'S REPORTS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

WE BELIEVE THAT GREAT COMPANIES ARE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF RELIABLE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE LAW. FOR GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, THAT FOUNDATION INCLUDES RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT OF, AND AN UNYIELDING DEDICATION TO, CONTROLLERSHIP. THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES IN THIS REPORT ARE ONE PRODUCT OF OUR COMMITMENT TO HIGH-QUALITY FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN ADDITION, WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ADOPT APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE DEVOTE OUR FULL RESOURCES TO ENSURING THAT THOSE POLICIES ARE APPLIED PROPERLY AND CONSISTENTLY AND WE DO OUR BEST TO FAIRLY PRESENT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT IS COMPLETE AND UNDERSTANDABLE.

MEMBERS OF OUR CORPORATE LEADERSHIP TEAM REVIEW EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES ROUTINELY ON MATTERS THAT RANGE FROM OVERALL STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO STAFFING AND COMPLIANCE. OUR BUSINESS LEADERS MONITOR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING SYSTEMS, ENABLING US TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CONCERNS AT AN EARLY STAGE AND POSITIONING US TO RESPOND RAPIDLY. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OVERSEES MANAGEMENT'S BUSINESS CONDUCT, AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, OVERSEES OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. WE CONTINUALLY EXAMINE OUR GOVERNANCE PRACTICES IN AN EFFORT TO ENHANCE INVESTOR TRUST AND IMPROVE THE BOARD'S OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS. THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES ANNUALLY CONDUCT A PERFORMANCE SELF-EVALUATION AND RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS. OUR LEAD DIRECTOR CHAIRED THREE MEETINGS OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS THIS YEAR, HELPING US SHARPEN OUR FULL BOARD MEETINGS TO BETTER COVER SIGNIFICANT TOPICS. COMPENSATION POLICIES FOR OUR EXECUTIVES ARE ALIGNED WITH THE LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF GE INVESTORS.

WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A DYNAMIC SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES—INCLUDING INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING—DESIGNED TO ENSURE RELIABLE FINANCIAL RECORDKEEPING, TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE, AND PROTECTION OF PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE RECRUIT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN A WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL TEAM. OUR INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF OUR CORPORATE AUDIT STAFF, CONDUCTS THOUSANDS OF FINANCIAL, COMPLIANCE AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT AUDITS EACH YEAR. OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSEES THE SCOPE AND EVALUATES THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THESE AUDITS, AND MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE REGULARLY ATTEND GE CAPITAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CORPORATE AUDIT STAFF AND CONTROLLERSHIP COUNCIL MEETINGS. OUR GLOBAL INTEGRITY POLICIES—"THE SPIRIT & THE LETTER"—REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND POLICY, AND PERTAIN TO SUCH VITAL ISSUES AS UPHOLDING FINANCIAL INTEGRITY AND AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THESE INTEGRITY POLICIES ARE AVAILABLE IN 35 LANGUAGES, AND ARE PROVIDED TO ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES, HOLDING EACH OF THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMPLIANCE. OUR STRONG COMPLIANCE CULTURE REINFORCES THESE EFFORTS BY REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO RAISE ANY COMPLIANCE CONCERNS AND BY PROHIBITING RETRIBUTION FOR DOING SO. TO FACILITATE OPEN AND CANDID COMMUNICATION, WE HAVE DESIGNATED OMBUDSPERSONS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY TO ACT AS INDEPENDENT RESOURCES FOR REPORTING INTEGRITY OR COMPLIANCE CONCERNS. WE HOLD OUR DIRECTORS, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO THE SAME INTEGRITY STANDARDS.

WE ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FULL AND OPEN PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND RELY FOR THIS PURPOSE ON OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING OUR DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE, WHICH COMPRISES SENIOR EXECUTIVES WITH DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE RELATED NEEDS OF OUR INVESTORS. WE ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO REVIEW OUR COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, TO EVALUATE THE FAIRNESS OF OUR FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES, AND TO REPORT THEIR FINDINGS TO US. IN 2015, WE FURTHER ENSURED STRONG DISCLOSURE BY HOLDING APPROXIMATELY 125 ANALYST AND INVESTOR MEETINGS WITH GE LEADERSHIP PRESENT.

WE WELCOME THE STRONG OVERSIGHT OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING ACTIVITIES BY OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, KPMG LLP, ENGAGED BY AND REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. U.S. LEGISLATION REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR AUDITORS TO RENDER AN OPINION ON SUCH CONTROLS. OUR REPORT AND THE KPMG LLP REPORT FOR 2015 FOLLOW.

MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. WITH OUR PARTICIPATION, AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS CONDUCTED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK AND CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015.

ON NOVEMBER 2, 2015, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF ALSTOM'S THERMAL, RENEWABLES AND GRID BUSINESSES. AS PERMITTED FOR RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, MANAGEMENT HAS EXCLUDED THE ACQUIRED ALSTOM BUSINESSES FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE EXCLUDED ALSTOM BUSINESSES REPRESENT TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL REVENUES OF 3.5 PERCENT AND 1.7 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT ON OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THEIR REPORT FOLLOWS.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

UNDER THE DIRECTION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE EVALUATED OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015.

OTHER THAN AS EXPLAINED BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

ON NOVEMBER 2, 2015, WE CLOSED THE ACQUISITION OF ALSTOM'S THERMAL, RENEWABLE, AND GRID BUSINESSES.  AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING, BREADTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE TRANSACTION, WE INCREASED THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES INVOLVED IN THE APPLICATION OF OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES AND CONTROLS TO THE FINANCIAL CLOSING AND REPORTING PROCESSES AND TO REACH A PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION.  DURING 2016, WE EXPECT THE FOLLOWING WILL OCCUR WITH RESPECT TO THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES: (1) PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS WILL BE FINALIZED, (2) THEY WILL CONTINUE THE TRANSITION TO OUR ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES AND PROCESSES, AND (3) THEIR SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO OUR FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THESE ACTIONS MAY PRECIPITATE CHANGES IN PROCESSES OR CONTROLS.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO SHAREOWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (THE "COMPANY") AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, AND THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015. WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013) ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION ("COSO"). THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

ON NOVEMBER 2, 2015, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF ALSTOM'S THERMAL, RENEWABLES AND GRID BUSINESSES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "ACQUIRED BUSINESSES"), AND MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES' INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ASSOCIATED WITH TOTAL ASSETS REPRESENTING 3.5 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, AND TOTAL REVENUES REPRESENTING 1.7 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND OTHER INCOME, INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE COMPANY ALSO EXCLUDED AN EVALUATION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013) ISSUED BY COSO.

OUR AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE. THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION APPEARING ON PAGES 129, 133 AND 135 IS PRESENTED FOR PURPOSES OF ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RATHER THAN TO PRESENT THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES. THE CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE AUDITING PROCEDURES APPLIED IN THE AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND, IN OUR OPINION, IS FAIRLY STATED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS IN RELATION TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 135

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR AFFILIATES – ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. TO DETERMINE IF WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY, WE FIRST EVALUATE IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) MODEL TO THE ENTITY, OTHERWISE, THE ENTITY IS EVALUATED UNDER THE VOTING INTEREST MODEL.

WHERE WE HOLD CURRENT OR POTENTIAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE US THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, COMBINED WITH A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT GIVES US THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OR THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THAT VIE. RIGHTS HELD BY OTHERS TO REMOVE THE PARTY WITH POWER OVER THE VIE ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNLESS ONE PARTY CAN EXERCISE THOSE RIGHTS UNILATERALLY. WHEN CHANGES OCCUR TO THE DESIGN OF AN ENTITY, WE RECONSIDER WHETHER IT IS SUBJECT TO THE VIE MODEL. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE.

WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN OTHER ENTITIES WHERE WE CURRENTLY HOLD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTING RIGHTS OR WHERE WE EXERCISE CONTROL THROUGH SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS OR AS A GENERAL PARTNER. WHERE WE ARE A GENERAL PARTNER, WE CONSIDER SUBSTANTIVE REMOVAL RIGHTS HELD BY OTHER PARTNERS IN DETERMINING IF WE HOLD A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. WE REEVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THESE ENTITIES WHEN OUR VOTING OR SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS CHANGE.

ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, BUT OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A VOTING INTEREST OF 20% TO 50%. ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. RESULTS OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN, AND ADVANCES TO, ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS IN THE CAPTION "ALL OTHER ASSETS" IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, WHICH REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN SUCH ASSETS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT-YEAR'S PRESENTATION. CERTAIN COLUMNS AND ROWS MAY NOT ADD DUE TO THE USE OF ROUNDED NUMBERS. PERCENTAGES PRESENTED ARE CALCULATED FROM THE UNDERLYING NUMBERS IN MILLIONS.

UPON CLOSING AN ACQUISITION, WE CONSOLIDATE THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. THE SIZE, SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY OF AN ACQUISITION CAN AFFECT THE TIME NECESSARY TO ADJUST THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND BOOKS AND RECORDS TO OUR STANDARDS. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES WILL BE NECESSARY TO THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND PRESENTATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS THE ACQUIRED COMPANY IS FULLY ASSIMILATED.

FINANCIAL DATA AND RELATED MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

GE.

THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OTHER THAN GE CAPITAL, WHOSE CONTINUING OPERATIONS ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS, GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS AMONG SUCH AFFILIATES.

GE CAPITAL.

THIS REFERS TO GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC), OR ITS SUCCESSOR GE CAPITAL GLOBAL HOLDINGS, LLC (GECGH), AND IS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OF GE CAPITAL GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS AMONG SUCH AFFILIATES.

CONSOLIDATED.

THIS REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF GE AND GE CAPITAL, GIVING EFFECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND GE CAPITAL.

OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THESE COMPRISE OUR NINE BUSINESSES, FOCUSED ON THE BROAD MARKETS THEY SERVE: POWER, RENEWABLE ENERGY, OIL & GAS, ENERGY MANAGEMENT, AVIATION, HEALTHCARE, TRANSPORTATION, APPLIANCES & LIGHTING AND CAPITAL.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 136

UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, INFORMATION IN THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED. SEE NOTE 2.

THE EFFECTS OF TRANSLATING TO U.S. DOLLARS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES, WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS.

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, UNEMPLOYMENT, MARKET LIQUIDITY, THE REAL ESTATE MARKET, ETC.), WHICH AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES CONTEMPLATE CURRENT CONDITIONS AND HOW WE EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, AS APPROPRIATE, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IN 2016 ACTUAL CONDITIONS COULD BE WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED IN THOSE ESTIMATES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, SUCH CHANGES COULD RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, ESTABLISHMENT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE MARKS ON BUSINESSES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE CARRIED AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, AND INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES.

THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN

REORGANIZATION AND EXCHANGE OFFERS

DURING DECEMBER 2015, GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION MERGED INTO GE. THE MERGER AND CREATION OF A NEW INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY WAS PART OF A REORGANIZATION OF GE CAPITAL'S BUSINESSES (THE REORGANIZATION) PURSUANT TO WHICH GE SEPARATED GE CAPITAL'S INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. OPERATIONS. GE CAPITAL'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED UNDER A NEW INTERNATIONAL HOLDING COMPANY (GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED), WHICH HAS A SEPARATE CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND WILL BE SUPERVISED BY THE U.K. PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY. THE REORGANIZATION, DEBT EXCHANGE OFFERS (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND ESTABLISHMENT OF GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED WERE INTENDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO ESTABLISH AN EFFICIENT AND SIMPLIFIED CAPITAL STRUCTURE THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO GE CAPITAL'S REGULATORS, A KEY STEP IN TERMINATING THE NONBANK SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DESIGNATION FOR GE CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, THE DEBT EXCHANGE OFFERS WERE DESIGNED TO ALIGN THE LIABILITIES OF GE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED TO ITS ASSETS FROM A MATURITY PROFILE AND LIQUIDITY STANDPOINT, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ASSET SALES, AND WHERE APPROPRIATE, SHORTENING THE MATURITY PROFILE OF TARGETED LIABILITIES.

AS PART OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2015 GE CAPITAL COMMENCED PRIVATE OFFERS TO EXCHANGE UP TO APPROXIMATELY $30,000 MILLION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING DEBT FOR NEW NOTES WITH MATURITIES OF SIX MONTHS, FIVE YEARS, TEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS. ON OCTOBER 19, 2015, GIVEN THE HIGH LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION, THE OFFERING WAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $6,000 MILLION WITH THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $36,000 MILLION (REPRESENTING $31,000 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND $5,000 MILLION OF PREMIUM) OF OUTSTANDING NOTES BEING TENDERED FOR EXCHANGE AND SETTLED ON OCTOBER 26, 2015. THE NEW NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED AT CLOSING ARE COMPOSED OF $15,268 MILLION OF 0.964% SIX MONTH NOTES DUE APRIL 2016, £778 MILLION OF 1.363% SIX MONTH NOTES DUE APRIL 2016, $6,107 MILLION OF 2.342% NOTES DUE 2020, $1,979 MILLION OF 3.373% NOTES DUE 2025 AND $11,465 MILLION OF 4.418% NOTES DUE 2035. OF THE $16,160 MILLION EXCHANGED INTO THE SIX MONTH NOTES, $1,297 MILLION HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. GE CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPURCHASE DEBT WHILE MAINTAINING OUR LIQUIDITY AT THE LEVELS COMMUNICATED AS PART OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN. THE NEW NOTES HAVE BEEN FULLY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY GE.

IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION, GE CAPITAL HAD $5,000 MILLION IN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF SERIES A, B AND C PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING. IN CONNECTION WITH THE REORGANIZATION, ON DECEMBER 3, 2015, HOLDERS WHO PREVIOUSLY HELD GE CAPITAL PREFERRED STOCK WERE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $5,950 MILLION OF NEW GE SERIES A, B AND C PREFERRED STOCK. THE SERIES A, B AND C PREFERRED STOCK BEAR AN INITIAL FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 4.00%, 4.10% AND 4.20%, RESPECTIVELY, THROUGH THEIR INITIAL CALL DATE AND ARE CALLABLE ON JUNE 15, 2022, DECEMBER 15, 2022 AND JUNE 15, 2023, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSEQUENT TO THE CALL DATE, THE SERIES A, B AND C PREFERRED STOCK WILL BEAR A FLOATING INTEREST RATE

EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 2.28%, 2.32% AND 2.37%, RESPECTIVELY, THEREAFTER.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK ON DECEMBER 3, 2015, IN RESPONSE TO INVESTOR FEEDBACK, GE LAUNCHED AN EXCHANGE OFFER ON DECEMBER 18, 2015 THAT ALLOWED GE PREFERRED STOCK INVESTORS TO EXCHANGE THEIR EXISTING SERIES A, B AND C PREFERRED STOCK INTO A SERIES D GE PREFERRED STOCK. THESE SERIES D INSTRUMENTS BEAR AN INITIAL FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 5.00% THROUGH JANUARY 21, 2021, WILL BEAR A FLOATING RATE EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 3.33% THEREAFTER AND ARE CALLABLE ON JANUARY 21, 2021.

ON JANUARY 20, 2016, $2,687 MILLION OF SERIES A, $2,008 MILLION OF SERIES B AND $999 MILLION OF SERIES C WERE EXCHANGED INTO $5,694 MILLION SERIES D GE PREFERRED STOCK. POST EXCHANGE, $91 MILLION OF SERIES A, $64 MILLION OF SERIES B AND $95 MILLION OF SERIES C GE PREFERRED STOCK REMAIN OUTSTANDING.

GUARANTEE

AS PART OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, THE COMPANY AND GE CAPITAL ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THEIR EXISTING FINANCIAL SUPPORT AGREEMENT. UNDER THIS AMENDMENT (THE AMENDMENT), THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE (THE GUARANTEE) OF THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON ALL TRADABLE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES AND ALL COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY GE CAPITAL IDENTIFIED IN THE AMENDMENT. IN THE AGGREGATE, THE GUARANTEE APPLIED TO APPROXIMATELY $85,829 MILLION OF GE CAPITAL DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE GUARANTEE REPLACED THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMPANY MAKE CERTAIN INCOME MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. GE CAPITAL'S U.S. PUBLIC INDENTURES WERE CONCURRENTLY AMENDED TO PROVIDE THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE BY THE COMPANY SET FORTH IN THE GUARANTEE.

SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL EXCHANGE OFFER

ON AUGUST 5, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL FINANCE BUSINESS, SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL, AS A FIRST STEP IN A PLANNED, STAGED EXIT FROM THAT BUSINESS

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP.

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

WE RECORD ALL SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES ONLY WHEN A FIRM SALES AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED AND COLLECTABILITY OF THE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE SALES PRICE IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOMETIMES INCLUDE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS. MOST OF OUR MULTIPLE COMPONENT ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN THE HEALTHCARE SEGMENT. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS USUALLY INVOLVE AN UPFRONT DELIVERABLE OF LARGE MACHINERY OR EQUIPMENT AND FUTURE SERVICE DELIVERABLES SUCH AS INSTALLATION, COMMISSIONING, TRAINING OR THE FUTURE DELIVERY OF ANCILLARY PRODUCTS. IN MOST CASES, THE RELATIVE VALUES OF THE UNDELIVERED COMPONENTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE OVERALL ARRANGEMENT AND ARE TYPICALLY DELIVERED WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CORE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED. IN SUCH AGREEMENTS, SELLING PRICE IS DETERMINED FOR EACH COMPONENT AND ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL OF THE SEPARATE SELLING PRICES AND TOTAL CONTRACT CONSIDERATION (I.E., DISCOUNT) IS ALLOCATED PRO RATA ACROSS EACH OF THE COMPONENTS IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO EACH COMPONENT IS OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED AND OBTAINED PRIMARILY FROM SOURCES SUCH AS THE SEPARATE SELLING PRICE FOR THAT OR A SIMILAR ITEM OR FROM COMPETITOR PRICES FOR SIMILAR ITEMS. IF SUCH EVIDENCE IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE, WHICH IS ESTABLISHED CONSISTENT WITH THE PRICING STRATEGY OF THE BUSINESS AND CONSIDERS PRODUCT CONFIGURATION, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER TYPE, AND OTHER MARKET SPECIFIC FACTORS.

EXCEPT FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF GOODS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 104, REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE OFTEN SELL CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN. WE USE OUR ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE TO ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR SUCH RETURNS WHEN WE RECORD THE SALE. IN SITUATIONS WHERE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS BASED ON SELLER OR CUSTOMER-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE CRITERIA, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE HAVE RELIABLY DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL SPECIFIED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET OR WHEN FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OCCURS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE PROVIDE GOODS FOR TRIAL AND EVALUATION PURPOSES, WE ONLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE AFTER CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OCCURS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, WE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR ANTICIPATED LOSSES BEFORE WE RECORD SALES.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 139

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON AGREEMENTS FOR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES UNDER POWER GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS, NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES, LARGER OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS, AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS, MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, LOCOMOTIVE PRODUCTION CONTRACTS, AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, USING LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION AND PRODUCTION CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. WE ESTIMATE TOTAL LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUE NET OF PRICE CONCESSIONS AS WELL AS TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS. FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER POWER GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS, NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES, AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS, MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS AND LOCOMOTIVE PRODUCTION CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES AS WE COMPLETE MAJOR CONTRACT-SPECIFIED DELIVERABLES, MOST OFTEN WHEN CUSTOMERS RECEIVE TITLE TO THE GOODS OR ACCEPT THE SERVICES AS PERFORMED. FOR LARGER OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES BASED ON OUR PROGRESS TOWARD CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN RELATION TO OUR ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE MEASURE LONG-TERM CONTRACT REVENUES BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY FOR SALES OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT. DELIVERY OF COMMERCIAL ENGINES AND NON-U.S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT OCCURS ON SHIPMENT; DELIVERY OF MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT SOLD TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AGENCIES THEREOF OCCURS UPON RECEIPT OF A MATERIAL INSPECTION AND RECEIVING REPORT, DD FORM 250 OR MEMORANDUM OF SHIPMENT. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES ARE COMPLEX EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURED TO CUSTOMER ORDER UNDER A VARIETY OF SOMETIMES COMPLEX, LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS. WE MEASURE SALES OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES AND COSTS FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINE AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRICE CONCESSIONS AND PERFORMANCE-RELATED GUARANTEES AS WELL AS MATERIAL, LABOR AND OVERHEAD COSTS. WE MEASURE REVENUE FOR MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS NOT SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC CONTRACT ON A SPECIFICALLY MEASURED OUTPUT BASIS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE; CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, WE MAKE SUCH PROVISION ONLY IF SUCH LOSSES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE HIGHLY PROBABLE SALES OF SPARE PARTS AND SERVICES FOR THOSE ENGINES.

WE SELL PRODUCT SERVICES UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT MAINTENANCE OR EXTENDED WARRANTY AGREEMENTS IN OUR AVIATION, POWER, OIL & GAS AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS, WHERE COSTS OF PERFORMING SERVICES ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. WE ALSO SELL SIMILAR LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES IN OUR HEALTHCARE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SEGMENTS, WHERE SUCH COSTS GENERALLY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. FOR THE AVIATION, POWER, OIL & GAS AND TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE RELATED SALES BASED ON THE EXTENT OF OUR PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. FOR THE HEALTHCARE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS AND EXPENSE RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

GE CAPITAL REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME)

WE USE THE INTEREST METHOD TO RECOGNIZE INCOME ON LOANS. INTEREST ON LOANS INCLUDES ORIGINATION, COMMITMENT AND OTHER NON-REFUNDABLE FEES RELATED TO FUNDING (RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD). WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED INTEREST INCOME THAT WAS ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED FROM THE BORROWER IS REVERSED, UNLESS THE TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT PERMIT CAPITALIZATION OF ACCRUED INTEREST TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE.

PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN.

WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONACCRUAL, NON-RESTRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOANS ONLY WHEN (A) PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE LOAN'S ORIGINAL TERMS AND (B) FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED. WHEN WE AGREE TO RESTRUCTURED TERMS WITH THE BORROWER, WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY ASSURED THAT WE WILL RECOVER FULL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS, AND SUCH LOANS PASS UNDERWRITING REVIEWS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE APPLIED TO NEW LOANS.

WE RECOGNIZE FINANCING LEASE INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD TO PRODUCE A LEVEL YIELD ON FUNDS NOT YET RECOVERED. ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF THE LEASED ASSET AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. WE USE VARIOUS SOURCES OF DATA IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED FOR THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC ASSET UNDER LEASE. GUARANTEES OF RESIDUAL VALUES BY UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES ARE CONSIDERED PART OF MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN ESTIMATING RESIDUAL VALUES INCLUDE ESTIMATED NET CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERM, ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF FUTURE REMARKETING, AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COMPONENT PART AND SCRAP METAL PRICES, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 140

WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF UNDERLYING LEASES.

BUSINESSES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE REPRESENT COMPONENTS THAT MEET ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS TO BE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE PRESENTED AS SINGLE ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, IF NECESSARY, TO RECOGNIZE THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COST TO SELL. FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT NO LONGER QUALIFY TO BE PRESENTED AS HELD FOR INVESTMENT MUST BE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COST TO SELL, WITH THAT AMOUNT REPRESENTING A NEW COST BASIS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER.

THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUES IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS COMPLEX AND IS DEPENDENT UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE NATURE OF THE POTENTIAL SALES TRANSACTION (FOR EXAMPLE, ASSET SALE VERSUS SALE OF LEGAL ENTITY), COMPOSITION OF ASSETS AND/OR BUSINESSES IN THE DISPOSAL GROUP, THE COMPARABILITY OF THE DISPOSAL GROUP TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS WITH THIRD PARTY PURCHASERS ETC. SUCH FACTORS BEAR DIRECTLY ON THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL FAIR VALUES AND THE SELECTION OF THE BEST ESTIMATES. KEY ASSUMPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION.

WE REVIEW ALL BUSINESSES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE EACH REPORTING PERIOD TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXISTING CARRYING AMOUNTS ARE FULLY RECOVERABLE IN COMPARISON TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COST OF GE MANUFACTURING PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. IN 2015, WE CHANGED THE METHOD OF DEPRECIATING ITS U.S. ASSETS FROM AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED ON A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA TO A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN ORDER TO ALIGN AND HARMONIZE OUR METHODOLOGY FOR MANUFACTURING PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. THIS CHANGE IN ESTIMATE WAS MADE PROSPECTIVELY AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2015, AND HAD AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT FOR 2015. AS A RESULT, AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2015, GE MANUFACTURING PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

THE COST OF GE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS ON OPERATING LEASES IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER THE LEASE TERM OR OVER THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT.

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED FINANCING RECEIVABLE. SUCH AN ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO PROVIDE FOR LOSSES ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT CONDITIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES. WRITE-OFFS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES WHEN WE JUDGE THE PRINCIPAL TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE AND SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES ARE ADDED TO THE ALLOWANCE AT THE TIME CASH IS RECEIVED ON A WRITTEN-OFF ACCOUNT.

"IMPAIRED" LOANS ARE DEFINED AS LARGER-BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. A PORTION OF OUR CLL NONACCRUAL RECEIVABLES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS DEFINITION, AS THEY REPRESENT SMALLER-BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS THAT WE EVALUATE COLLECTIVELY BY PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT.

SPECIFIC RESERVES ARE RECORDED FOR INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED LOANS TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. CERTAIN LOANS CLASSIFIED AS IMPAIRED MAY NOT REQUIRE A RESERVE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY COLLECT THE UNPAID BALANCE (THROUGH COLLECTION OR COLLATERAL REPOSSESSION).

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 141

"DELINQUENT" RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS. RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DELINQUENT WHEN PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE RESTRUCTURED TERMS, BUT MAY REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A PERIOD OF SATISFACTORY PAYMENT PERFORMANCE BY THE BORROWER AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF COLLECTION.

OUR COMMERCIAL LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF LOANS AND LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH LARGER-BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES AND SMALLER-BALANCE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES. LOSSES ON SUCH LOANS AND LEASES ARE RECORDED WHEN PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO FOR POTENTIAL SPECIFIC CREDIT OR COLLECTION ISSUES THAT MIGHT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT.

FOR LARGER-BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES, WE CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL STATUS, PAYMENT HISTORY, COLLATERAL VALUE, INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND GUARANTOR SUPPORT RELATED TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. ANY DELINQUENCIES OR BANKRUPTCIES ARE INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT REQUIRING FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF COLLECTABILITY. WE ROUTINELY RECEIVE FINANCIAL AS WELL AS RATING AGENCY REPORTS ON OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE ELEVATE FOR FURTHER ATTENTION THOSE CUSTOMERS WHOSE OPERATIONS WE JUDGE TO BE MARGINAL OR DETERIORATING. WE ALSO ELEVATE CUSTOMERS FOR FURTHER ATTENTION WHEN WE OBSERVE A DECLINE IN COLLATERAL VALUES FOR ASSET-BASED LOANS. WHILE COLLATERAL VALUES ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, WHEN WE OBSERVE SUCH A DECLINE, WE EVALUATE RELEVANT MARKETS TO ASSESS RECOVERY ALTERNATIVES.

MEASUREMENT OF THE LOSS ON OUR IMPAIRED COMMERCIAL LOANS IS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN'S EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OR THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, NET OF EXPECTED SELLING COSTS, IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL DEPENDENT. WE DETERMINE WHETHER A LOAN IS COLLATERAL DEPENDENT IF THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. AFTER PROVIDING FOR SPECIFIC INCURRED LOSSES, WE THEN DETERMINE AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED IN THE BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BUT CANNOT YET BE IDENTIFIED TO A SPECIFIC LOAN OR LEASE. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED UPON VARIOUS STATISTICAL ANALYSES CONSIDERING HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY AND AGING, AS WELL AS OUR VIEW ON CURRENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IT IS PREPARED BY EACH RESPECTIVE LINE OF BUSINESS.

WHEN WE REPOSSESS COLLATERAL IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN, WE WRITE DOWN THE RECEIVABLE AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. REPOSSESSED COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION "ALL OTHER ASSETS" IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

WRITE-OFFS ON LARGER-BALANCE IMPAIRED COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE BASED ON AMOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY. WRITE-OFFS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORKOUT PLAN OR RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN, VALUATION OF THE COLLATERAL AND THE PRIORITIZATION OF OUR CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY. WRITE-OFFS ARE RECOGNIZED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES PRIMARILY IN THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS DEEMED ALL OR A PORTION OF THE FINANCING RECEIVABLE TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE. IF FORECLOSURE IS PROBABLE, THE WRITE-OFF IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL LESS COSTS TO SELL. SMALLER-BALANCE, HOMOGENEOUS COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF AT THE EARLIER OF WHEN DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE OR AT 180 DAYS PAST DUE.

PARTIAL SALES OF BUSINESS INTERESTS

GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF AFFILIATE SHARES WHERE WE RETAIN A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY. GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES THAT RESULT IN OUR LOSS OF A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS ALONG WITH REMEASUREMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON ANY INVESTMENTS IN THE ENTITY THAT WE RETAINED.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

DEBT SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE INCLUDED IN CASH EQUIVALENTS UNLESS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 142

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REPORT INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 19 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY, NET OF APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS.

WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR AMORTIZED COST, WE EVALUATE OTHER QUALITATIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. WE ALSO EVALUATE QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDING DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. IF WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, WE CONSIDER THE SECURITY TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AND WE RECORD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY'S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS RECOVERABLE AMOUNT IN EARNINGS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY'S RECOVERABLE AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. IF WE INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE SECURITY IS ALSO CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AND WE RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY'S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, WE CONSIDER THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION. IF WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY, WE CONSIDER THE SECURITY TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AND WE RECORD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SECURITY'S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS.

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

ALL INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR REALIZABLE VALUES. COST FOR A PORTION OF GE U.S. INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) BASIS. COST OF OTHER GE INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS. LIFO WAS USED FOR 34% AND 40% OF GE INVENTORIES AT 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT TEST IT AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. A REPORTING UNIT IS THE OPERATING SEGMENT, OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THAT OPERATING SEGMENT (THE COMPONENT LEVEL) IF DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PREPARED AND REGULARLY REVIEWED BY SEGMENT MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, COMPONENTS ARE AGGREGATED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT IF THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL. WE USE A MARKET APPROACH, WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, OR THE INCOME APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES. WHEN A PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DISPOSED, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSITION BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESS OR BUSINESSES DISPOSED AND THE PORTION OF THE REPORTING UNIT THAT WILL BE RETAINED.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. THE COST OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET'S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE, EXCEPT THAT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED IN RELATION TO TOTAL RELATED SALES. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND, IF IMPAIRED, WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE BASED ON EITHER DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AS REQUIRED.

THE COST OF INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS IS AMORTIZED IN PROPORTION TO ESTIMATED TOTAL RELATED SALES; COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET'S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS

OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PROVIDING INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE FOR LIFE AND HEALTH RISKS AND PROVIDING CERTAIN ANNUITY PRODUCTS. TWO PRIMARY PRODUCT TYPES ARE PROVIDED: TRADITIONAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITH SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY AND/OR MORBIDITY RISKS, WHILE INVESTMENT CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITHOUT SUCH RISKS.

FOR SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE, WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME OVER THE TERMS OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS, GENERALLY ON A PRO-RATA BASIS. FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING LONG-TERM CARE, TERM, WHOLE LIFE AND ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ANNUITANT, WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME WHEN DUE.

PREMIUMS RECEIVED ON INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (INCLUDING ANNUITIES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY RISK) ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUES BUT RATHER AS DEPOSIT LIABILITIES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FOR CHARGES AND ASSESSMENTS ON THESE CONTRACTS, MOSTLY FOR MORTALITY, CONTRACT INITIATION, ADMINISTRATION AND SURRENDER. AMOUNTS CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

LIABILITIES FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE PRESENT VALUE OF SUCH BENEFITS LESS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE NET PREMIUMS BASED ON MORTALITY, MORBIDITY, INTEREST AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AT THE TIME THE POLICIES WERE ISSUED OR ACQUIRED. LIABILITIES FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS EQUAL THE ACCOUNT VALUE, THAT IS, THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES TO THE BENEFIT OF THE CONTRACT OR POLICYHOLDER INCLUDING CREDITED INTEREST AND ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE.

LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATIONS FOR REPORTED AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED CLAIMS AND THE RELATED ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES. LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED THROUGH CURRENT OPERATIONS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE INCLUDING CERTAIN ASSETS WITHIN OUR PENSION PLANS AND RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS.

FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A MARKET PARTICIPANT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA, INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES, WHILE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT OUR MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. PREFERENCE IS GIVEN TO OBSERVABLE INPUTS. THESE TWO TYPES OF INPUTS CREATE THE FOLLOWING FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

LEVEL 1 –

QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 2 –

QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS WHOSE INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR WHOSE SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE.

LEVEL 3 –

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL ARE UNOBSERVABLE.

WE MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO VALUE INSTRUMENTS USING THE BEST AND MOST RELEVANT DATA AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT REVIEW VALUATION, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT PRICE VALIDATION FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS. WITH REGARD TO LEVEL 3 VALUATIONS (INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS VALUED BY THIRD PARTIES), WE PERFORM A VARIETY OF PROCEDURES TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE VALUATIONS. SUCH REVIEWS, WHICH MAY BE PERFORMED QUARTERLY, MONTHLY OR WEEKLY, INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FAIR VALUE CHANGE EXCEEDS PREDEFINED THRESHOLDS (AND/OR DOES NOT CHANGE) AND CONSIDER THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS OTHER PUBLISHED DATA, SUCH AS RATING AGENCY MARKET REPORTS AND CURRENT APPRAISALS. THESE REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED WITHIN EACH BUSINESS BY THE ASSET AND RISK MANAGERS, PRICING COMMITTEES AND VALUATION COMMITTEES. A DETAILED REVIEW OF METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS PERFORMED BY INDIVIDUALS INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS WITH A FAIR VALUE EXCEEDING PREDEFINED THRESHOLDS. THIS DETAILED REVIEW MAY INCLUDE THE USE OF A THIRD-PARTY VALUATION FIRM.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 144

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE DIFFERENT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1. LEVEL 1 SECURITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES.

FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR WHICH MARKET PRICES ARE OBSERVABLE FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INVESTMENT SECURITIES BUT NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE FOR EACH OF THOSE INVESTMENTS INDIVIDUALLY (THAT IS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PRICING INFORMATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT SECURITY AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE), WE OBTAIN PRICING INFORMATION FROM AN INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDOR. THE PRICING VENDOR USES VARIOUS PRICING MODELS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE. THE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS TO THE MODEL OF THE PRICING VENDOR ARE DERIVED FROM MARKET OBSERVABLE SOURCES INCLUDING: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS, OFFERS, AND OTHER MARKET-RELATED DATA. SINCE MANY FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE METHODOLOGY OF THE PRICING VENDOR USES AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS APPLICABLE SUCH AS BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS, AND MATRIX PRICING. THE PRICING VENDOR CONSIDERS AVAILABLE MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS IN DETERMINING THE EVALUATION FOR A SECURITY. THUS, CERTAIN SECURITIES MAY NOT BE PRICED USING QUOTED PRICES, BUT RATHER DETERMINED FROM MARKET OBSERVABLE INFORMATION. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 AND PRIMARILY COMPRISE OUR PORTFOLIO OF CORPORATE FIXED INCOME, AND GOVERNMENT, MORTGAGE AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. IN INFREQUENT CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR PRICING VENDORS MAY PROVIDE US WITH VALUATIONS THAT ARE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE CLASSIFY THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN LEVEL 3.

ANNUALLY, WE CONDUCT REVIEWS OF OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR TO VALIDATE THAT THE INPUTS USED IN THAT VENDOR'S PRICING PROCESS ARE DEEMED TO BE MARKET OBSERVABLE AS DEFINED IN THE STANDARD. WHILE WE ARE NOT PROVIDED ACCESS TO PROPRIETARY MODELS OF THE VENDOR, OUR REVIEWS HAVE INCLUDED ON-SITE WALK-THROUGHS OF THE PRICING PROCESS, METHODOLOGIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR EACH ASSET CLASS AND LEVEL FOR WHICH PRICES ARE PROVIDED. OUR REVIEWS ALSO INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR A SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ACROSS ASSET CLASSES, CREDIT RATING LEVELS AND VARIOUS DURATIONS, A PROCESS WE PERFORM EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE PRICING VENDOR HAS AN ESTABLISHED CHALLENGE PROCESS IN PLACE FOR ALL SECURITY VALUATIONS, WHICH FACILITATES IDENTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF POTENTIALLY ERRONEOUS PRICES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM OUR PRICING VENDOR ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT PRICES) AND ARE CLASSIFIED APPROPRIATELY IN THE HIERARCHY.

WE USE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES AS OUR PRIMARY BASIS FOR VALUATION WHEN THERE IS LIMITED, OR NO, RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY FOR A SPECIFIC INSTRUMENT OR FOR OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT SHARE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. WE HAVE NOT ADJUSTED THE PRICES WE HAVE OBTAINED. INVESTMENT SECURITIES PRICED USING NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. AS IS THE CASE WITH OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR, THIRD-PARTY BROKERS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THEIR PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL CONDUCT REVIEWS OF VENDORS, AS APPLICABLE, SIMILAR TO THE REVIEWS PERFORMED OF OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR. IN ADDITION, WE CONDUCT INTERNAL REVIEWS OF PRICING FOR ALL SUCH INVESTMENT SECURITIES QUARTERLY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS OF VALUATIONS USED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE REVIEWS ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PRICES THAT APPEAR STALE, THOSE THAT HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRIOR VALUATIONS, AND OTHER ANOMALIES THAT MAY INDICATE THAT A PRICE MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUES PROVIDED BY THE BROKERS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL THE ASSETS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE (EXIT PRICES).

DERIVATIVES.

WE USE CLOSING PRICES FOR DERIVATIVES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE TRADED EITHER ON EXCHANGES OR LIQUID OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING INTERNAL MODELS. THE MODELS MAXIMIZE THE USE OF MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES AND BOTH FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 PRIMARILY REPRESENT INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 PRIMARILY REPRESENT EQUITY DERIVATIVES AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY OR PREPAYMENT FEATURES.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 145

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

CERTAIN ASSETS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS. THESE ASSETS ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AN ONGOING BASIS, BUT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE ASSETS CAN INCLUDE LOANS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE HELD FOR SALE, IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN THEY ARE IMPAIRED AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, IF WE SELL A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND RETAIN A NONCONTROLLING STAKE IN THE ENTITY. ASSETS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE WHEN IMPAIRED AND RETAINED INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE UNLESS FURTHER IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS AND FOR CERTAIN ASSETS WITHIN OUR PENSION PLANS AND RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE.

WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICING ON RECENT CLOSED MARKET TRANSACTIONS, TO VALUE LOANS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2. WHEN THIS DATA IS UNOBSERVABLE, WE USE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USING CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATE DATA ADJUSTED FOR INHERENT CREDIT RISK, AND SUCH LOANS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. WHEN APPROPRIATE, LOANS MAY BE VALUED USING COLLATERAL VALUES (SEE LONG-LIVED ASSETS BELOW).

COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.

COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE. WHEN MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA IS UNAVAILABLE, INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRICING SOURCES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE VALUED USING NET ASSET VALUES. THE NET ASSET VALUES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REDEEMABLE AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. INVESTMENTS IN COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

. FAIR VALUES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AIRCRAFT AND REAL ESTATE, ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED INTERNALLY AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVED SALES TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR ASSETS. IN OTHER INSTANCES, FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL TYPES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE COMPARABLE OBSERVED SALES TRANSACTION DATA, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY AND CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL APPRAISAL INFORMATION. ADJUSTMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY VALUATIONS MAY BE PERFORMED IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MARKET COMPARABLES ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL OR APPRAISAL INFORMATION MAY NOT BE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND THE OCCURRENCE OF MARKET EVENTS SINCE RECEIPT OF THE INFORMATION.

RETAINED INVESTMENTS IN FORMERLY CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL THAT RESULTS IN DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY, THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF OUR RETAINED NONCONTROLLING STAKE IS VALUED USING MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, OR IF NOT AVAILABLE, AN INCOME APPROACH, A MARKET APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH APPROACHES AS APPROPRIATE. IN APPLYING THESE METHODOLOGIES, WE RELY ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS, FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, MARKET OBSERVABLE PRICING MULTIPLES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, AND POSSIBLE CONTROL PREMIUM. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 3, AS APPROPRIATE, DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO EARLY ADOPT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2014-08,

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (TOPIC 205) AND PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT (TOPIC 360): REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DISCLOSURES OF DISPOSALS OF COMPONENTS OF AN ENTITY

. THIS ASU CHANGED THE CRITERIA FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION, THE DISPOSAL OF A COMPONENT OR GROUP OF COMPONENTS MUST REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT THAT HAS, OR WILL HAVE, A MAJOR EFFECT ON AN ENTITY'S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE ASU ALSO EXPANDED THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE TRANSACTIONS THAT MEET THE NEW CRITERIA TO BE CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE REVISED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL DISPOSALS (OR CLASSIFICATIONS AS HELD FOR SALE) OF COMPONENTS OF AN ENTITY AND FOR BUSINESSES THAT, UPON ACQUISITION, ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE ON OR AFTER ADOPTION. EARLY ADOPTION WAS PERMITTED FOR DISPOSALS (OR CLASSIFICATIONS AS HELD FOR SALE) THAT HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 146

REPORTED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE EFFECTS OF APPLYING THE REVISED GUIDANCE WILL VARY BASED UPON THE NATURE AND SIZE OF FUTURE DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT FEWER DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS WILL MEET THE NEW CRITERIA TO BE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2014, WE ADOPTED ASU 2013-05,

FOREIGN CURRENCY MATTERS

(TOPIC 830).

PARENT'S ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OR GROUPS OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY OR OF AN INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN ENTITY

. UNDER THE REVISED GUIDANCE, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOREIGN ENTITY WILL BE RELEASED INTO EARNINGS IN THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: (A) THE SALE OF A SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF NET ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY THAT REPRESENTS A COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF THAT ENTITY, (B) THE LOSS OF A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN ENTITY, OR (C) WHEN THE ACCOUNTING FOR AN INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN ENTITY CHANGES FROM THE EQUITY METHOD TO FULL CONSOLIDATION. THE REVISED GUIDANCE APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO TRANSACTIONS OR EVENTS OCCURRING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2014.

ON JANUARY 1, 2014, WE ADOPTED ASU 2013-11,

PRESENTATION OF AN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT WHEN A NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD, A SIMILAR TAX LOSS, OR A TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARD EXISTS

. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT IS REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED AS A REDUCTION TO A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IF THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE TAX POSITION WOULD REDUCE THE AVAILABLE TAX LOSS OR TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARD INSTEAD OF RESULTING IN A CASH TAX LIABILITY. THE ASU APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT EXIST AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE AND REDUCED BOTH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCOME TAX LIABILITIES (INCLUDING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS) BY $1,224 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2014.

WMC

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF WMC, OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS. WMC SUBSTANTIALLY DISCONTINUED ALL NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, AND IS NOT A LOAN SERVICER. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, WMC RETAINED CERTAIN REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO LOANS SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES PRIOR TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUSINESS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS THAT HAD AN EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT. ALL CLAIMS RECEIVED BY WMC FOR EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT HAVE EITHER BEEN RESOLVED OR ARE NO LONGER BEING PURSUED.

THE REMAINING ACTIVE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR ADMINISTRATORS SEEKING RECOVERY FROM WMC FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ON MORTGAGE LOANS THAT SERVE AS COLLATERAL FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, SUCH CLAIMS CONSISTED OF $2,887 MILLION OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS GENERALLY SUBMITTED BEFORE THE FILING OF A LAWSUIT (COMPARED TO $3,694 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014) AND $8,047 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST WMC IN LITIGATION WITHOUT MAKING A PRIOR CLAIM (LITIGATION CLAIMS) (COMPARED TO $9,225 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014). THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THESE CLAIMS, $10,934 MILLION, REFLECTS THE PURCHASE PRICE OR UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES OF THE LOANS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO PAY DOWNS OR POTENTIAL RECOVERIES BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WHICH IN MANY CASES ARE SUBSTANTIAL, NOR TO ACCRUED INTEREST OR FEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $112 MILLION OF REPURCHASE CLAIMS RELATING TO ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS THAT ARE NOT IN LITIGATION AND THAT ARE BEYOND THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. WMC BELIEVES THAT REPURCHASE CLAIMS BROUGHT BASED UPON REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE MORE THAN SIX YEARS BEFORE WMC WAS NOTIFIED OF THE CLAIM WOULD BE DISALLOWED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AND THE JUNE 11, 2015 DECISION OF THE NEW YORK COURT OF APPEALS IN ACE SECURITIES CORP. V. DB STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, INC., ON THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS PERIOD GOVERNING SUCH CLAIMS.

RESERVES RELATED TO REPURCHASE CLAIMS MADE AGAINST WMC WERE $875 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, REFLECTING A NET INCREASE TO RESERVES IN THE YEAR DECEMBER 31, 2015 OF $66 MILLION DUE TO INCREMENTAL PROVISIONS NET OF SETTLEMENTS.

THE RESERVE ESTIMATE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT RECENT SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY AND IS BASED UPON WMC'S EVALUATION OF THE REMAINING EXPOSURES AS A PERCENTAGE OF ESTIMATED LIFETIME MORTGAGE LOAN LOSSES WITHIN THE POOL OF LOANS SUPPORTING EACH SECURITIZATION FOR WHICH TIMELY CLAIMS HAVE BEEN ASSERTED IN LITIGATION AGAINST WMC. SETTLEMENTS IN PRIOR PERIODS REDUCED WMC'S EXPOSURE ON CLAIMS ASSERTED IN CERTAIN SECURITIZATIONS AND THE CLAIM AMOUNTS REPORTED ABOVE GIVE EFFECT TO THESE SETTLEMENTS.

GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ACTIVITY AND WMC'S CONTINUING EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE LAWSUITS INVOLVING CLAIMS MADE AGAINST WMC, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE LOSSES WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH WMC'S PAST EXPERIENCE. ADVERSE CHANGES TO WMC'S ASSUMPTIONS SUPPORTING THE RESERVE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THESE RESERVES. WMC ESTIMATES A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FROM $0 TO APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION OVER ITS RECORDED RESERVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. THIS ESTIMATE INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND MAY NOT REFLECT THE RANGE OF UNCERTAINTIES AND UNPREDICTABLE OUTCOMES INHERENT IN LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE MATTERS DISCUSSED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN WMC'S LEGAL STRATEGY. THIS ESTIMATE EXCLUDES ANY POSSIBLE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION ON THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS OR AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY, AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989 (FIRREA) INVESTIGATION DISCUSSED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AS WMC IS UNABLE AT THIS TIME TO DEVELOP SUCH A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THERE WERE 14 LAWSUITS INVOLVING CLAIMS MADE AGAINST WMC ARISING FROM ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ON MORTGAGE LOANS INCLUDED IN 13 SECURITIZATIONS. THE ADVERSE PARTIES IN THESE CASES ARE SECURITIZATION TRUSTEES OR PARTIES CLAIMING TO ACT ON THEIR BEHALF. ALTHOUGH THE ALLEGED CLAIMS FOR RELIEF VARY FROM CASE TO CASE, THE COMPLAINTS AND COUNTERCLAIMS IN THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY ASSERT CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, INDEMNIFICATION, AND/OR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, AND SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE (REPURCHASE OF DEFECTIVE MORTGAGE LOAN) AND/OR MONEY DAMAGES. ADVERSE COURT DECISIONS, INCLUDING IN CASES NOT INVOLVING WMC, COULD RESULT IN NEW CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS ON ADDITIONAL LOANS. HOWEVER, WMC CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, BASED ON CAUSATION AND MATERIALITY REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OR IMPACT OF THESE DEFENSES AND OTHER FACTORS, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF ANY LOSS ULTIMATELY INCURRED BY WMC ON THESE CLAIMS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 151

WMC HAS ALSO RECEIVED INDEMNIFICATION DEMANDS, NEARLY ALL OF WHICH ARE UNSPECIFIED, FROM DEPOSITORS/UNDERWRITERS/SPONSORS OF RMBS IN CONNECTION WITH LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY RMBS INVESTORS CONCERNING ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS IN THE SECURITIZATION OFFERING DOCUMENTS TO WHICH WMC IS NOT A PARTY OR, IN TWO CASES, INVOLVING MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE CLAIMS MADE AGAINST RMBS SPONSORS. WMC BELIEVES THAT IT HAS DEFENSES TO THESE DEMANDS.

TO THE EXTENT WMC IS REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS, WMC'S LOSS ALSO WOULD BE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PAY DOWNS, ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES, AND THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. THE RESERVE AND ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS REFLECT JUDGMENT, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, AND A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CLAIM AND SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY, PENDING AND THREATENED LITIGATION, COURT DECISIONS REGARDING WMC'S LEGAL DEFENSES, INDEMNIFICATION DEMANDS, GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY, AND OTHER VARIABLES IN THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY. ACTUAL LOSSES ARISING FROM CLAIMS AGAINST WMC COULD EXCEED THESE AMOUNTS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS COULD RESULT IF ACTUAL CLAIM RATES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, LITIGATION AND INDEMNIFICATION ACTIVITY, ADVERSE COURT DECISIONS, ACTUAL SETTLEMENT RATES OR LOSSES WMC INCURS ON REPURCHASED LOANS DIFFER FROM ITS ASSUMPTIONS.

NOTE 8. ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUISITIONS

ON NOVEMBER 2, 2015, WE ACQUIRED THE THERMAL, RENEWABLES AND GRID BUSINESSES FROM ALSTOM. THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS €9,200 MILLION ($10,135 MILLION), NET OF CASH ACQUIRED OF APPROXIMATELY €1,600 MILLION ($1,765 MILLION). AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE ACQUIRED ALSTOM BUSINESSES HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, DIRECTLY AFFECTING ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING RELATED TO THREE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF SEVERAL NEW, JOINTLY-OWNED ENTITIES. GIVEN THE TIMING AND COMPLEXITY OF THE ACQUISITION, THE PRESENTATION OF THESE BUSINESSES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, IS PRELIMINARY AND LIKELY TO CHANGE IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS. WE WILL COMPLETE OUR POST-CLOSING PROCEDURES AND PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION NO LATER THAN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016.

AS NOTED ABOVE, WE FORMED THREE CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES WITH ALSTOM IN GRID TECHNOLOGY, RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND FRENCH STEAM POWER. IN ADDITION, GE CONTRIBUTED ITS DIGITAL ENERGY BUSINESS TO THE GRID TECHNOLOGY JOINT VENTURE.

ALSTOM HOLDS REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO ITS INTEREST IN EACH JOINT VENTURE, WHICH, IF EXERCISED, WOULD REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OF THEIR INTEREST DURING SEPTEMBER 2018 OR SEPTEMBER 2019 FOR THE GRID TECHNOLOGY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY JOINT VENTURES. ALSTOM ALSO HOLDS SIMILAR REDEMPTION RIGHTS FOR THE GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND FRENCH STEAM POWER JOINT VENTURE, THAT ARE EXERCISABLE DURING THE FIRST FULL CALENDAR QUARTER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE FIFTH OR SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE REDEMPTION PRICE WOULD GENERALLY BE EQUAL TO ALSTOM'S INITIAL INVESTMENT PLUS ANNUAL ACCRETION OF 3% FOR THE GRID TECHNOLOGY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY JOINT VENTURES AND PLUS ANNUAL ACCRETION OF 2% FOR THE NUCLEAR AND FRENCH STEAM POWER JOINT VENTURE, WITH POTENTIAL UPSIDE SHARING BASED ON AN EBITDA MULTIPLE. ALSTOM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL REDEMPTION RIGHTS IN OTHER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL AS A CALL OPTION TO REQUIRE GE TO SELL ALL OF ITS INTERESTS IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY JOINT VENTURE AT THE HIGHER OF FAIR VALUE OR ALSTOM'S INITIAL INVESTMENT PLUS ANNUAL ACCRETION OF 3% DURING THE MONTH OF MAY IN THE YEARS 2016 THROUGH 2019 AND ALSO UPON A DECISION TO IPO THE JOINT VENTURE.

GE HOLDS A CALL OPTION ON ALSTOM'S INTEREST IN THE GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND FRENCH STEAM POWER JOINT VENTURE AT THE SAME AMOUNT AS ALSTOM'S REDEMPTION PRICE IN THE EVENT THAT ALSTOM EXERCISES ITS PUT OPTION IN THE GRID TECHNOLOGY OR RENEWABLE ENERGY JOINT VENTURES. GE ALSO HAS CALL OPTIONS ON ALSTOM'S INTEREST IN THE THREE JOINT VENTURES IN OTHER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HOLDS A PREFERRED INTEREST IN THE GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND FRENCH STEAM POWER JOINT VENTURE, GIVING IT CERTAIN PROTECTIVE RIGHTS.

THE ACQUISITION AND ALLIANCES WITH ALSTOM AFFECTED OUR POWER, ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SEGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ON INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF VARIABLES, INCLUDING OPERATING PERFORMANCE, PURCHASE ACCOUNTING EFFECTS AND EXPECTED SYNERGIES. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT ELAPSED BETWEEN SIGNING AND CLOSING, THE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESSES WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF UNCERTAINTY AMONG ALSTOM CUSTOMERS REGARDING THE EXECUTION OF THE TRANSACTION. THIS AFFECTED THE OVERALL VALUATION OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AT THE TIME OF CLOSE AND, ACCORDINGLY, IS REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, INCLUDING A PRELIMINARY VALUATION OF NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST, AT THE TIME OF CLOSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $13,700 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THE PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY $13,500 MILLION OF GOODWILL AND $4,065 MILLION OF AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE PRELIMINARY FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IS APPROXIMATELY $3,600 MILLION, WHICH CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2,900 MILLION FOR ALSTOM'S REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE THREE JOINT VENTURES (PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM TOTAL EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) AND $700 MILLION FOR ALL OTHER NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST.

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN APPROVAL BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, GE PLEDGED TO SELL CERTAIN OF ALSTOM'S GAS-TURBINE ASSETS AND ITS POWER SYSTEMS MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARY TO ANSALDO ENERGIA SPA (ANSALDO) AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION FOR APPROXIMATELY €120 MILLION. THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE PAID BY ANSALDO OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON FEBRUARY 25, 2016.

ON JANUARY 30, 2015, WE ACQUIRED MILESTONE AVIATION GROUP (MILESTONE AVIATION), A HELICOPTER LEASING BUSINESS, FOR APPROXIMATELY $1,750 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OUR CAPITAL SEGMENT. THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY $730 MILLION AND AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $345 MILLION.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 159

ON JUNE 2, 2014, WE ACQUIRED CAMERON'S RECIPROCATING COMPRESSION DIVISION FOR $550 MILLION. THE DIVISION PROVIDES RECIPROCATING COMPRESSION EQUIPMENT AND AFTERMARKET SERVICES FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, GAS PROCESSING, GAS DISTRIBUTION AND INDEPENDENT POWER INDUSTRIES. THE DIVISION IS INCLUDED IN OUR OIL & GAS SEGMENT. THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION AND AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, WE ACQUIRED SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SEGMENT. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2014, WE ACQUIRED API HEALTHCARE (API) FOR $340 MILLION IN CASH. API IS A HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS PROVIDER. THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION AND AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION. ON MARCH 21, 2014, WE ACQUIRED CERTAIN THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. LIFE-SCIENCE BUSINESSES FOR $1,065 MILLION IN CASH. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS ACQUIRED, HYCLONE, IS A LEADING MANUFACTURER OF PRODUCTS USED TO SUPPORT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION. THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY $695 MILLION AND AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION.

GOODWILL BALANCES ASSOCIATED WITH ALSTOM AND THEIR ALLOCATIONS TO SEGMENTS ARE PRELIMINARY.

GOODWILL BALANCES INCREASED BY $12,319 MILLION IN 2015, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ALSTOM AND MILESTONE AVIATION ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE EFFECTS OF THE STRONGER U.S DOLLAR AND DISPOSALS.

GOODWILL BALANCES INCREASED $70 MILLION IN 2014, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS AT HEALTHCARE AND OIL & GAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE EFFECTS OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH YEAR USING DATA AS OF JULY 1 OF THAT YEAR. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: IN STEP ONE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS FAIR VALUE; IN STEP TWO, WHICH IS APPLIED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS DERIVED BY DEDUCTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS EQUITY, AND COMPARING THAT AMOUNT WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. WE DETERMINED FAIR VALUES FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING THE MARKET APPROACH, WHEN AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, OR THE INCOME APPROACH, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WE ASSESS THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY BASED UPON THE RELEVANCE AND AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA AT THE TIME WE PERFORM THE VALUATION. IF MULTIPLE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES ARE USED, THE RESULTS ARE WEIGHTED APPROPRIATELY.

VALUATIONS USING THE MARKET APPROACH ARE DERIVED FROM METRICS OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES OR HISTORICALLY COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE BUSINESSES IS BASED ON THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE GIVING CONSIDERATION TO RISK PROFILES, SIZE, GEOGRAPHY, AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A MARKET APPROACH IS LIMITED TO REPORTING UNITS FOR WHICH THERE ARE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO OUR BUSINESSES.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 160

UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED RATE. WE USE OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM FUTURE GROWTH RATES BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT VIEWS OF THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EACH BUSINESS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ASSUMED IN OUR FORECASTS. WE DERIVE OUR DISCOUNT RATES USING A CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL AND ANALYZING PUBLISHED RATES FOR INDUSTRIES RELEVANT TO OUR REPORTING UNITS TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING. WE USE DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND IN OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORECASTS. DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR REPORTING UNIT VALUATIONS RANGED FROM 10.0% TO 15.5%.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STEP ONE TESTING, THE FAIR VALUES OF EACH OF THE GE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES; THEREFORE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED FOR ANY OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED.

WHILE ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS PASSED STEP ONE OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IN 2015, WE IDENTIFIED ONE REPORTING UNIT FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE. DUE TO THE SHARP DECLINE EXPERIENCED IN OIL PRICES AND THE PROSPECT OF A CONTINUATION OF PREVAILING OIL PRICES, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTING UNIT, WITHIN OUR CAPITAL OPERATING SEGMENT, HAS BEEN IMPACTED AND WAS IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 13%. DUE TO THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN OIL PRICES, WE PERFORMED AN IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER USING DATA AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WHICH RESULTED IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTING UNIT BEING IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 12%. THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTING UNIT WAS $1,386 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 2% OF OUR TOTAL GOODWILL. OUR OIL & GAS BUSINESS HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN ORDERS, PROJECT COMMENCEMENT DELAYS AND PRICING PRESSURES, WHICH AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OIL & GAS REPORTING UNITS. WHILE THE GOODWILL OF THESE REPORTING UNITS IS NOT CURRENTLY IMPAIRED, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY AND THE IMPACT IT MAY HAVE ON THESE BUSINESSES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOODWILL IS RECOVERABLE FOR ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE GOODWILL WILL NOT BE IMPAIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN 2014, WE IDENTIFIED ONE REPORTING UNIT FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE. WITHIN OUR ENERGY MANAGEMENT OPERATING SEGMENT, THE POWER CONVERSION REPORTING UNIT WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE A FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 10%. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE POWER CONVERSION REPORTING UNIT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OVER ITS CARRYING VALUE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A STABILIZATION OF THE BUSINESS AND COST CUTTING MEASURES. IN ADDITION, OUR CARRYING VALUE HAS DECREASED DUE TO CURRENCY EFFECTS OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR.

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 12. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

ABOUT OUR PLANS

WE SPONSOR A NUMBER OF PENSION PLANS, INCLUDING OUR TWO PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS FOR CERTAIN U.S. EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS OTHER AFFILIATE PENSION PLANS. OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, THE GE PENSION PLAN AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN, ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. A SUMMARY OF OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS ALSO PROVIDED.

THE GE PENSION PLAN IS A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT COVERS 231,000 RETIREES AND BENEFICIARIES, 167,000 VESTED FORMER EMPLOYEES AND 75,000 ACTIVE EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS. THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN THAT PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFITS TO HIGHER-LEVEL, LONGER-SERVICE EMPLOYEES. THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN ANNUITY BENEFIT IS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BY AN INSTALLMENT BENEFIT. WE USE A DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THESE PLANS.

ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WE MEASURE OUR PLAN ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE AND THE OBLIGATIONS AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ESTIMATED PAYMENTS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. PARTICIPANTS EARN BENEFITS BASED ON THEIR SERVICE AND PAY. THOSE ESTIMATED PAYMENT AMOUNTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND WHAT WE ASSUMED ARE RECORDED IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY EACH PERIOD. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE AMORTIZED INTO EARNINGS OVER THE REMAINING AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES OR THE EXPECTED LIFE OF PARTICIPANTS, AS APPLICABLE, WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN.

THE COST OF OUR PLANS

THE AMOUNT WE REPORT IN OUR EARNINGS AS PENSION COST CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.



SERVICE COST - THE COST OF BENEFITS EARNED.



PRIOR SERVICE COST AMORTIZATION – THE EFFECT OF BENEFIT CHANGES RESULTING FROM PLAN AMENDMENTS.



EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS – THE RETURN WE EXPECT TO EARN ON PLAN INVESTMENTS.



INTEREST COST – THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST ON THE PENSION OBLIGATION DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME.



NET ACTUARIAL LOSS AMORTIZATION – CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF THE NET PENSION OBLIGATION (BASED ON ASSUMPTION CHANGES AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE).



CURTAILMENT LOSS – IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED (DUE TO AN EVENT, SUCH AS THE SALE OF A BUSINESS, WHICH SHORTENS FUTURE SERVICE OR ELIMINATES FUTURE BENEFITS).

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN PENSION CALCULATIONS

ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS NECESSITATE THE USE OF ASSUMPTIONS TO REFLECT THE UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS WILL BE PAID. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL DEPEND UPON WHEN PARTICIPANTS RETIRE, THE AMOUNT OF THEIR BENEFIT AT RETIREMENT AND HOW LONG THEY LIVE. TO REFLECT THE OBLIGATION IN TODAY'S DOLLARS, WE DISCOUNT THE FUTURE PAYMENTS USING A RATE THAT MATCHES THE TIME FRAME OVER WHICH THE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE. WE ALSO NEED TO ASSUME A LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN THAT WILL BE EARNED ON INVESTMENTS USED TO FUND THESE PAYMENTS.

WE EVALUATE THESE ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY. WE EVALUATE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS PERIODICALLY, SUCH AS RETIREMENT AGE, MORTALITY AND TURNOVER, AND UPDATE THEM AS NECESSARY TO REFLECT OUR ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE.

THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES ISSUED NEW MORTALITY TABLES IN 2014 PROJECTING LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES THAT RESULTED IN HIGHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR U.S. COMPANIES. WE UPDATED OUR MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF $3,953 MILLION IN OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS' BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

WE DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELDS ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES THAT HAVE MATURITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE TIMING OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS. LOWER DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND PENSION EXPENSE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR; HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE.

THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN THAT WILL BE EARNED ON THE INVESTMENTS USED TO FUND THE PENSION OBLIGATION. TO DETERMINE THIS RATE, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND TARGET COMPOSITION OF PLAN INVESTMENTS, OUR HISTORICAL RETURNS EARNED, AND OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE.

THE COMPENSATION ASSUMPTION IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE ANNUAL RATE AT WHICH PAY OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS WILL GROW. IF THE RATE OF GROWTH ASSUMED INCREASES, THE SIZE OF THE PENSION OBLIGATION WILL INCREASE, AS WILL THE AMOUNT RECORDED IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS.

OTHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE ALSO ADMINISTER OTHER PENSION PLANS, INCLUDING LEGACY PLANS THAT WERE PART OF ACQUISITIONS. OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2015 INCLUDED 53 U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS WITH ASSETS OR OBLIGATIONS GREATER THAN $50 MILLION. THESE OTHER PENSION PLANS COVER 60,000 RETIREES AND BENEFICIARIES, 58,000 VESTED FORMER EMPLOYEES AND 39,000 ACTIVE EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO SPONSOR A NUMBER OF POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS (RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS). PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS COVER APPROXIMATELY 189,000 RETIREES AND DEPENDENTS.

IN JUNE 2015, WE AMENDED OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS SUCH THAT, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, OUR CURRENT POST-65 RETIREE HEALTH PLANS WILL BE CLOSED TO CERTAIN PRODUCTION RETIREES, EMPLOYEES, AND THEIR ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS. IN LIEU OF CURRENT POST-65 RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS, CURRENT RETIRED PRODUCTION PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS WHO ARE 65 ON OR BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2018, WILL RECEIVE A RETIREMENT REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT (RRA) TO HELP PAY FOR ELIGIBLE EXPENSES INCURRED FOR COVERAGE PURCHASED THROUGH A PRIVATE EXCHANGE. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR CURRENT POST-65 RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS WHO RETIRE BY JUNE 23, 2019 AND THEIR ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS WILL ALSO RECEIVE THE RRA WHEN THEY TURN AGE 65 AND ENROLL IN INDIVIDUAL MEDICARE COVERAGE PURCHASED THROUGH A PRIVATE EXCHANGE. ALSO, IN JUNE 2015, WE AMENDED OUR COMPANY-PROVIDED RETIREE LIFE INSURANCE SO THAT IT WILL BE CLOSED TO PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE AFTER JUNE 23, 2019. THESE PLAN AMENDMENTS REDUCED OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $3,300 MILLION.

FOR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS, THE ESTIMATED PRIOR SERVICE CREDIT AND NET ACTUARIAL GAIN TO BE AMORTIZED IN 2016 WILL BE $165 MILLION AND $55 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARABLE AMOUNTS AMORTIZED IN 2015, RESPECTIVELY, WERE AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AND $289 MILLION OF NET ACTUARIAL LOSS FOR THE OTHER PENSION PLANS AND $8 MILLION OF PRIOR SERVICE CREDIT AND $25 MILLION OF NET ACTUARIAL GAIN FOR THE PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS.

OUR FUNDING POLICY

OUR POLICY FOR FUNDING THE GE PENSION PLAN IS TO CONTRIBUTE AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND TAX LAWS. WE MAY DECIDE TO CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEYOND THIS LEVEL. WE DID NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2015 AND 2014. THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER U.S. LAW DO NOT REQUIRE A CONTRIBUTION TO BE MADE IN 2016.

WE EXPECT TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS UNDER OUR GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AND EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $930 MILLION TO OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2016. IN 2015, COMPARATIVE AMOUNTS WERE $233 MILLION AND $549 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

WE FUND RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS AND THE RETIREE LIFE INSURANCE TRUST AT OUR DISCRETION. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $490 MILLION IN 2016 TO FUND SUCH BENEFITS. IN 2015, WE CONTRIBUTED $501 MILLION FOR THESE PLANS.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PENSION PLANS AND PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 27.

NOTE 13. ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES LIABILITIES FOR VARIOUS ITEMS INCLUDING DEFERRED INCOME, INTEREST ON TAX LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS EXCLUDE POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND, WHEN DATES AND AMOUNTS OF SUCH COSTS ARE NOT KNOWN, ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW END OF SUCH RANGE. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION EXPOSURE WILL EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED. HOWEVER, DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE STATUS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SITES, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. TOTAL RESERVES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS, WERE $1,869 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 171

NOTE 14. INCOME TAXES

GE AND GE CAPITAL FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THIS ENABLES GE AND GE CAPITAL TO USE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS OF ONE MEMBER OF THE GROUP TO REDUCE THE TAX THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE BY ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE GROUP. THE GE CAPITAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF THESE TAX REDUCTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED RETURN. GE MAKES CASH PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL FOR TAX REDUCTIONS AND GE CAPITAL PAYS FOR TAX INCREASES AT THE TIME GE'S TAX PAYMENTS ARE DUE.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR TAX LIABILITY, RETURN ON INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, GE CAPITAL WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ITS NON-U.S. ASSETS WHILE CONTINUING TO OPERATE APPROPRIATELY CAPITALIZED NON-U.S. BUSINESSES WITH SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS RELATED TO GE CAPITAL'S VERTICAL FINANCING BUSINESSES, ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES, GECAS AND HEALTHCARE EQUIPMENT FINANCE. AS A RESULT OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, GE CAPITAL RECOGNIZED A TAX EXPENSE OF $6,327 MILLION IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS DURING 2015. THIS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF $3,548 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF EXCESS FOREIGN CASH AND THE WRITE-OFF OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $2,779 MILLION THAT WILL NO LONGER BE SUPPORTED UNDER THIS PLAN.

THE REPATRIATION OF CASH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT, PRIOR TO THE APPROVAL OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN, WERE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN GE CAPITAL'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. GE CAPITAL'S INDEFINITELY REINVESTED EARNINGS HAVE ALSO BEEN REDUCED BY CHARGES RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPOSITION OF INTERNATIONAL ASSETS. THE REMAINDER OF THE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED EARNINGS WILL CONTINUE TO BE REINVESTED IN THE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL BASE OF ASSETS THAT WILL REMAIN AFTER THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN IS FULLY EXECUTED. THE WRITE-OFF OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS LARGELY RELATES TO OUR TREASURY OPERATIONS IN IRELAND WHERE THE TAX BENEFITS WILL NO LONGER BE APPARENT TO BE REALIZED UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GE CAPITAL EXIT PLAN. THESE CHARGES, WHICH INCREASE THE 2015 CONSOLIDATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 77.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS, ARE REPORTED IN THE LINES "TAX ON GLOBAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXPORTS", AND "ALL OTHER-NET" IN THE RECONCILIATION OF U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE TO ACTUAL INCOME TAX RATE."

UNRECOGNIZED TAX POSITIONS

ANNUALLY, WE FILE OVER 5,500 INCOME TAX RETURNS IN OVER 300 GLOBAL TAXING JURISDICTIONS. WE ARE UNDER EXAMINATION OR ENGAGED IN TAX LITIGATION IN MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS. DURING 2015, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) COMPLETED THE AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2010-2011, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN ISSUES THAT REMAIN UNDER EXAMINATION. DURING 2013, THE IRS COMPLETED THE AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2008-2009, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN ISSUES THAT REMAIN UNDER EXAMINATION. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER U.S. TAX DEFICIENCY ISSUES AND REFUND CLAIMS FOR PREVIOUS YEARS WERE UNRESOLVED. THE IRS HAS DISALLOWED THE TAX LOSS ON OUR 2003 DISPOSITION OF ERC LIFE REINSURANCE CORPORATION. WE HAVE CONTESTED THE DISALLOWANCE OF THIS LOSS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE UNRESOLVED ITEMS COULD BE RESOLVED DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR BALANCE OF "UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS" – THAT IS, THE AGGREGATE TAX EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TAX RETURN POSITIONS AND THE BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE OUTCOME OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES OR CLAIMS IS LIKELY TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MADE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES. RESOLUTION OF AUDIT MATTERS, INCLUDING THE IRS AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2008-2011, REDUCED OUR 2015 AND 2013 CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATES BY 4.4 AND 1.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR 2015, THE AMOUNT SHOWN AS "ADDITIONS FOR TAX POSITIONS OF PRIOR YEARS" RELATES PRIMARILY ($1,054 MILLION) TO THE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF UNCERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES FOR ACQUIRED ALSTOM BUSINESSES.  OF THE TOTAL 2015 ADDITIONS FOR TAX POSITIONS OF PRIOR YEARS, $445 MILLION RELATES TO AMOUNTS THAT WOULD NOT AFFECT TAX EXPENSE IF RECOGNIZED.

WE CLASSIFY INTEREST ON TAX DEFICIENCIES AS INTEREST EXPENSE; WE CLASSIFY INCOME TAX PENALTIES AS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013, $48 MILLION, $(68) MILLION AND $22 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE (INCOME), RESPECTIVELY, AND $(4) MILLION, $(45) MILLION AND AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TAX EXPENSE (INCOME) RELATED TO PENALTIES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES, AS WELL AS FROM NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, AND ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN TAXES ARE ACTUALLY PAID OR RECOVERED. DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED.

WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S. DEFERRED TAXES ON CUMULATIVE EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND, AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, WERE APPROXIMATELY $104 BILLION AND $119 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES WHEN WE PLAN TO REMIT THOSE EARNINGS.

THE INCREMENTAL SHARES WERE ISSUED IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE PREFERRED HOLDERS FOR THE LOWER DIVIDEND RATE.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXCHANGE OF THE GE CAPITAL PREFERRED STOCK INTO GE PREFERRED STOCK, GE CAPITAL ISSUED PREFERRED STOCK TO GE FOR WHICH THE AMOUNT AND TERMS MIRROR THE GE PREFERRED STOCK HELD BY EXTERNAL INVESTORS ($4,949 MILLION CARRYING VALUE AT EXCHANGE).

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 176

SUBSEQUENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK ON DECEMBER 3, 2015, IN RESPONSE TO INVESTOR FEEDBACK, GE LAUNCHED AN EXCHANGE OFFER ON DECEMBER 18, 2015 THAT ALLOWED GE PREFERRED STOCK INVESTORS TO EXCHANGE THEIR EXISTING SERIES A, B AND C PREFERRED STOCK INTO A SERIES D GE PREFERRED STOCK. THESE SERIES D INSTRUMENTS BEAR AN INITIAL FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 5.00% THROUGH JANUARY 21, 2021, WILL BEAR A FLOATING RATE EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 3.33% THEREAFTER AND ARE CALLABLE ON JANUARY 21, 2021. ON JANUARY 20, 2016, $2,687 MILLION OF SERIES A, $2,008 MILLION OF SERIES B AND $999 MILLION OF SERIES C WERE EXCHANGED INTO $5,694 MILLION SERIES D GE PREFERRED STOCK. POST EXCHANGE, $91 MILLION OF SERIES A, $64 MILLION OF SERIES B AND $95 MILLION OF SERIES C GE PREFERRED STOCK REMAIN OUTSTANDING.

ON OCTOBER 16, 2013, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY EXERCISED THEIR WARRANTS AND GE DELIVERED 10.7 MILLION SHARES TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN EQUITY OF CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES INCLUDES COMMON SHARES IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AND PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY OUR AFFILIATES.

PRIOR TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015, THE PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY GECC WAS CLASSIFIED AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, WITH DIVIDENDS PRESENTED AS NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY IN THIS NOTE, THIS PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTED TO A CORRESPONDING SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY GE AND ON JANUARY 20, 2016 A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THOSE SHARES WERE EXCHANGED INTO GE SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK. EFFECTIVE WITH THESE CHANGES, THE PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY GE IS REFLECTED IN OUR SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND DIVIDENDS ARE PRESENTED AS A REDUCTION OF NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GE IN THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS (UNDER THE CAPTION "PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS") FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND SUBSEQUENTLY.

NOTE 16. OTHER STOCK-RELATED INFORMATION

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

WE GRANT STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2007 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN. GRANTS MADE UNDER ALL PLANS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF GE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH IS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS.

STOCK OPTIONS

UNDER OUR STOCK OPTION PROGRAM, AN EMPLOYEE RECEIVES AN AWARD THAT PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE TO PURCHASE GE SHARES AT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK ON THE DATE THE AWARD IS GRANTED (THE STRIKE PRICE). THE OPTIONS BECOME EXERCISABLE IN EQUAL AMOUNTS OVER A FIVE-YEAR VESTING PERIOD AND EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE IF THEY ARE NOT EXERCISED.

STOCK OPTIONS HAVE NO FINANCIAL STATEMENT EFFECT ON THE DATE THEY ARE GRANTED BUT RATHER ARE REFLECTED OVER TIME THROUGH RECORDING COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND INCREASING SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. WE RECORD COMPENSATION EXPENSE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST, AND THAT AMOUNT IS AMORTIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE FIVE-YEAR VESTING PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, TOTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO THE AWARD IS REDUCED BY THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES THAT LEAVE GE PRIOR TO VESTING. WE ESTIMATE FORFEITURES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE AND ADJUST THE EXPENSE TO REFLECT ACTUAL FORFEITURES OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE OFFSET TO THE EXPENSE WE RECORD IS REFLECTED AS AN INCREASE IN THE "OTHER CAPITAL" COMPONENT OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY.

OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTION AWARDS MAY BE DILUTIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE MONEY (THE MARKET PRICE OF GE STOCK IS GREATER THAN THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE OPTION). WHEN AN OPTION IS DILUTIVE, IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF SHARES USED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION, WHICH WILL DECREASE EARNINGS PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT STOCK OPTIONS HAVE ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES ADDED TO THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION IS NOT ONE FOR ONE. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE (THE PORTION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OPTION AWARDS NOT YET AMORTIZED), POTENTIAL OPTION-RELATED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF GE STOCK DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD AFFECT HOW MANY OF THESE POTENTIAL SHARES ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION. THE CALCULATION ASSUMES THAT THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE, THE UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND ANY POTENTIAL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ARE USED TO BUY BACK SHARES, WHICH REDUCES THE DILUTIVE IMPACT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THERE WAS $628 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO UNVESTED OPTIONS, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD (THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD IS APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS). OF THAT TOTAL, APPROXIMATELY $159 MILLION, AFTER TAX, IS ESTIMATED TO BE RECORDED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2016.

THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF IN THE MONEY OPTIONS ON OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS HAS BEEN $0.01 OR LESS PER SHARE (1% OR LESS) FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT EARNINGS PER SHARE SEE NOTE 18.

RESTRICTED STOCK

A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD PROVIDES AN EMPLOYEE WITH THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE SHARES OF GE STOCK WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE, WHICH OCCURS IN EQUAL AMOUNTS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. UPON VESTING, EACH UNIT OF RESTRICTED STOCK IS CONVERTED INTO GE COMMON STOCK ON A ONE FOR ONE BASIS USING TREASURY STOCK SHARES. THE EXPENSE TO BE RECOGNIZED ON RESTRICTED STOCK IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE (WHICH IS ITS FAIR VALUE) TIMES THE NUMBER OF UNITS EXPECTED TO VEST. ACCORDINGLY, TOTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO THE AWARD IS REDUCED BY THE FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES THAT LEAVE GE PRIOR TO LAPSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS. THAT AMOUNT IS AMORTIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE FIVE-YEAR VESTING PERIOD. WE ESTIMATE FORFEITURES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE AND ADJUST THE EXPENSE TO REFLECT ACTUAL FORFEITURES OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE OFFSET TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS AN INCREASE IN THE "OTHER CAPITAL" COMPONENT OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY.

OF THAT TOTAL, APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION, AFTER TAX, IS ESTIMATED TO BE RECORDED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2016.

OTHER INFORMATION

WHEN OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND RESTRICTED STOCK VESTS, WE ISSUE SHARES FROM TREASURY STOCK, WHICH INCREASES SHARES OUTSTANDING. THE "OTHER CAPITAL" COMPONENT OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY IS ADJUSTED FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE STRIKE PRICE OF GE STOCK AND THE AVERAGE COST OF OUR TREASURY STOCK. WE ALSO RECORD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX BENEFITS ASSUMED (BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD ON THE GRANT DATE) AND THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT IN THE "OTHER CAPITAL" COMPONENT OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. ANY EXCESS TAX BENEFIT IS RECORDED AS A CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN OUR STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF A STOCK OPTION AWARD IS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE AWARD IS IN THE MONEY AND REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL VALUE TO THE EMPLOYEE UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION.

APPLICATION OF THIS TREATMENT HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT.

(A)

INCLUDED AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS PRESENTED.

(B)

INCLUDED IN 2013 IS A DILUTIVE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE CHANGE IN INCOME FOR FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN STOCK.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 97 MILLION, 98 MILLION AND 121 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUTSTANDING STOCK AWARDS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE THEIR EFFECT WAS ANTIDILUTIVE.

EARNINGS-PER-SHARE AMOUNTS ARE COMPUTED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET EARNINGS. AS A RESULT, THE SUM OF PER-SHARE AMOUNTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MAY NOT EQUAL THE TOTAL PER-SHARE AMOUNTS FOR NET EARNINGS.

SECURITIES REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS

OUR ISSUANCES OF SECURITIES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE LIMITED TO ACTIVITIES AT CERTAIN OF OUR FOREIGN BANKS PRIMARILY FOR PURPOSES OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT. ANY SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE REPORTED IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. NO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AS OFF-BOOK FINANCING AND WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE WERE PARTY TO NO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

WE ALSO ENTER INTO REVERSE SECURITIES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT WITH MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE WERE PARTY TO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TOTALING $11.3 BILLION, WHICH WERE REPORTED IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER THESE REVERSE SECURITIES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE TYPICALLY LEND AVAILABLE CASH AT A SPECIFIED RATE OF INTEREST AND HOLD U.S. OR HIGHLY-RATED EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. COLLATERAL VALUE IS IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS LOANED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

IN THIS SECTION, WE EXPLAIN HOW WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE OUR RISKS AND HOW THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES RELATES SOLELY TO RISK MANAGEMENT; WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVES FOR SPECULATION. AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, WE ARE EXECUTING A PLAN TO REDUCE THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, WITH THE INTENTION OF PRINCIPALLY RETAINING THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THE AFFECTED BUSINESSES HAVE EITHER BEEN SOLD OR ARE HELD FOR SALE AND ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES HEDGING ACTIVITY WILL DIMINISH SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FUTURE.

RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WE BUY, MANUFACTURE AND SELL COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS ACROSS GLOBAL MARKETS. THESE ACTIVITIES EXPOSE US TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES EARNED AND COSTS OF OPERATING OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. WHEN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH WE SELL EQUIPMENT DIFFERS FROM THE PRIMARY CURRENCY OF ONE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES (KNOWN AS ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY) AND THE EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATES, IT WILL AFFECT THE REVENUE WE EARN ON THE SALE. THESE SALES AND PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS ALSO CREATE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH EXPOSE US TO FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES BASED ON CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF A RAW MATERIAL THAT WE USE IN MANUFACTURING CAN AFFECT THE COST OF MANUFACTURING. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE THESE EXPOSURES.

WITH RESPECT TO OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES, OUR KEY EXPOSURES RELATE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK. TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE, WE SEEK TO ENSURE THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEBT WE HAVE ISSUED ALIGN WITH THE ASSETS BEING FUNDED. THE FORM (FIXED RATE OR FLOATING RATE) AND CURRENCY DENOMINATION OF THE DEBT WE ISSUE DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH ARE MARKET FACTORS (DEMAND, PRICING, ETC.) THAT AFFECT THE ECONOMICS OF THE ISSUANCE. IF THE FORM AND CURRENCY DENOMINATION OF THE DEBT DOES NOT MATCH THE ASSETS BEING FUNDED, WE TYPICALLY EXECUTE DERIVATIVES TO MEET THIS OBJECTIVE WITHIN DEFINED LIMITS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 190

FORMS OF HEDGING

IN THIS SECTION WE EXPLAIN THE HEDGING METHODS WE USE AND THEIR EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

– WE USE CASH FLOW HEDGING PRIMARILY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND TO CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT THAT WE HAVE ISSUED IN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS BACK TO OUR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. ACCORDINGLY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY IN THIS CATEGORY CONSISTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WE EXPECT TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITY RELATED TO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS. WE ALSO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE PRICE RISK ON RAW MATERIALS PURCHASED FOR USE IN MANUFACTURING.

UNDER HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE DERIVATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT IS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EACH PERIOD AND ANY RESULTING GAIN OR LOSS IS RECORDED IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED ITEM MAY CAUSE CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUES TO NOT OFFSET COMPLETELY, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS INEFFECTIVENESS. WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTION OCCURS, THESE AMOUNTS ARE RELEASED FROM SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY, IN ORDER THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL BE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS AT THE RATE LOCKED IN BY THE DERIVATIVE. THE EFFECT OF THE HEDGE IS REPORTED IN THE SAME FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM AS THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES HOW THE DERIVATIVE IS REFLECTED IN THE BALANCE SHEET AND IN EARNINGS UNDER HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE EFFECT OF THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT PRESENTED IN THIS TABLE BUT OFFSETS THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE DERIVATIVE.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

– THESE DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO HEDGE THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON DEBT THAT WE HAVE ISSUED. WE HAVE ISSUED MOSTLY FIXED RATE DEBT THAT IS USED TO FUND BOTH FIXED AND FLOATING RATE ASSETS. IN INSTANCES WHERE FIXED RATE DEBT IS FUNDING FLOATING RATE ASSETS, WE HAVE AN EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT RECEIVE A FIXED RATE AND PAY A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST TO ALIGN WITH THAT PORTION OF OUR DEBT WHICH FUNDS FLOATING RATE ASSETS. THESE SWAPS TYPICALLY MATCH THE MATURITY OF THE ASSOCIATED DEBT BEING HEDGED.

UNDER HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE DERIVATIVE IS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED DEBT IS ADJUSTED FOR THE CHANGE IN VALUE RELATED TO THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED, WITH BOTH ADJUSTMENTS OFFSET TO EARNINGS AS INTEREST EXPENSE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE WILL BE LARGELY OFFSET BY THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF AN INCREASE IN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED DEBT. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED DEBT MAY CAUSE CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUES TO NOT OFFSET COMPLETELY, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS INEFFECTIVENESS. THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES HOW THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED DEBT ARE REFLECTED IN THE BALANCE SHEET AND IN EARNINGS UNDER HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE EFFECT ON INTEREST EXPENSE OF CHANGING FROM THE FIXED RATE ON THE DEBT TO THE FLOATING RATE ON THE SWAP IS NOT SHOWN IN THIS TABLE.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

– WE INVEST IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT CONDUCT THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICES ACTIVITIES IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE US DOLLAR. WE HEDGE THE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY USING SHORT-TERM CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH WE RECEIVE US DOLLARS AND PAY FOREIGN CURRENCY AND NON-DERIVATIVES INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS DEBT DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY.

UNDER HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE PORTION OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGE OF THE DERIVATIVE OR DEBT INSTRUMENT THAT RELATES TO CHANGES IN SPOT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IS OFFSET IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RELATED TO CHANGES IN SPOT EXCHANGE RATES WILL BE OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION COMPONENT OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY. THE PORTION OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGE OF THE DERIVATIVE RELATED TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPOT AND FORWARD RATES, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE INTEREST COMPONENT, IS RECORDED IN EARNINGS EACH PERIOD AS INTEREST EXPENSE. AS A RESULT OF THIS HEDGING STRATEGY, THE INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS ARE LARGELY UNAFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY ONLY AFFECT EARNINGS IF THE HEDGED INVESTMENT IS SOLD, SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED, OR CONTROL IS LOST.

ECONOMIC HEDGES

- THESE DERIVATIVES ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FROM AN ACCOUNTING STANDPOINT (AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO THE RELATIONSHIP) BUT OTHERWISE SERVE THE SAME ECONOMIC PURPOSE AS OTHER HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS. ECONOMIC HEDGES ARE USED WHEN CHANGES IN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED ITEM ARE ALREADY RECORDED IN EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE DERIVATIVE, MAKING HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNNECESSARY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES WE RECORD THE EFFECTS OF SPOT EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES IN EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES ON THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED AS ECONOMIC HEDGES. IN THESE CASES, THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE DERIVATIVE AND HEDGED ITEM LARGELY OFFSET. WE ALSO USE ECONOMIC HEDGES WHEN WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK FOR WHICH WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR EXAMPLE, WE USE CURRENCY FORWARDS AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACTS. IN THIS CASE, THE FORECAST PERIOD IS SO LONG THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO MEET THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENT THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS IS PROBABLE. FOR THESE TYPES OF ECONOMIC HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS CURRENTLY BUT CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THEY OCCUR. AS A RESULT, EVEN THOUGH THE DERIVATIVE IS AN EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC HEDGE, THERE IS A NET EFFECT ON EARNINGS IN EACH PERIOD DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF EARNINGS RECOGNITION BETWEEN THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED ITEM.

THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF ALL DERIVATIVES THAT SERVE AS ECONOMIC HEDGES. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE MARKED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD. FOR OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, THESE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN "GE CAPITAL REVENUES FROM SERVICES". FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, THE EFFECTS ARE REPORTED IN "OTHER INCOME" OR "OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES". THE OFFSETTING EARNINGS EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO DISPLAYED IN THE TABLE BELOW. IN GENERAL, THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE HEDGED ITEM ARE RECORDED IN THE SAME FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE AS THE DERIVATIVE. THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF ECONOMIC HEDGES, AFTER CONSIDERING OFFSETS RELATED TO EARNINGS EFFECTS OF HEDGED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, IS SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET AFFECTED EARNINGS.

NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVES

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF A DERIVATIVE IS THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF THE UNDERLYING (FOR EXAMPLE, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT IN AN INTEREST RATE SWAP). THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT IS USED TO COMPUTE INTEREST OR OTHER PAYMENT STREAMS TO BE MADE UNDER THE CONTRACT AND IS A MEASURE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. WE GENERALLY DISCLOSE DERIVATIVE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ON A GROSS BASIS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $245 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 IS RELATED TO MANAGING INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK BETWEEN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. THE REMAINING DERIVATIVE NOTIONAL PRIMARILY RELATES TO HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED SALES AND PURCHASES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, COMMODITY PURCHASES AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS IN CONTRACTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.

THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW DERIVATIVES ARE REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE EXCLUSIVE OF INTEREST EARNED OR OWED ON INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES, WHICH IS PRESENTED SEPARATELY ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH COLLATERAL AND SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL REPRESENT ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY OUR DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AS SECURITY FOR AMOUNTS THEY OWE US (DERIVATIVES THAT ARE IN AN ASSET POSITION).

EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVES ON EARNINGS

ALL DERIVATIVES ARE MARKED TO FAIR VALUE ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WHETHER THEY ARE DESIGNATED IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES OR ARE USED AS ECONOMIC HEDGES. AS DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS, EACH TYPE OF HEDGE AFFECTS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIFFERENTLY. IN FAIR VALUE AND ECONOMIC HEDGES, BOTH THE HEDGED ITEM AND THE HEDGING DERIVATIVE LARGELY OFFSET IN EARNINGS EACH PERIOD. IN CASH FLOW AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVE IS OFFSET IN SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY AND INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 194

NOTE 21. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

WE USE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES PRIMARILY TO SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. INVESTORS IN THESE ENTITIES ONLY HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE ENTITY AND NOT TO OUR GENERAL CREDIT. WE DO NOT HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY VIE. WE DID NOT PROVIDE NON-CONTRACTUAL SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY TRANSFERRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES TO ANY VIE IN 2015 OR 2014.

IN EVALUATING WHETHER WE HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, WE CONSIDER THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE VIE WAS CREATED, THE IMPORTANCE OF EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES IN WHICH IT IS ENGAGED AND OUR DECISION-MAKING ROLE, IF ANY, IN THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DETERMINE THE ENTITY'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO OTHER ECONOMIC INTEREST HOLDERS. THIS EVALUATION REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF ALL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELEVANT TO DECISION-MAKING THAT AFFECTS THE ENTITY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND THE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN DECIDING WHICH DECISION-MAKING RIGHTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT.

IN DETERMINING WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS OR THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE, WE EVALUATE ALL OF OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THE ENTITY, REGARDLESS OF FORM (DEBT, EQUITY, MANAGEMENT AND SERVICING FEES, AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS). THIS EVALUATION CONSIDERS ALL RELEVANT FACTORS OF THE ENTITY'S DESIGN, INCLUDING: THE ENTITY'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO EARNINGS (LOSSES), SUBORDINATION OF OUR INTERESTS RELATIVE TO THOSE OF OTHER INVESTORS, CONTINGENT PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE EVALUATION OF EACH OF THESE FACTORS IN REACHING A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IS A MATTER THAT REQUIRES THE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT.

CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATED VIES ARE THE THREE JOINT VENTURES WE FORMED WITH ALSTOM TO FACILITATE THE ALSTOM ACQUISITION. THESE JOINT VENTURES INCLUDE GRID TECHNOLOGY, RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND FRENCH STEAM POWER. THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 WAS $11,536 MILLION, $8,739 MILLION AND $2,859 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FORMATION OF THE ALSTOM JOINT VENTURES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 8. THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE VIES DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE EXIT MECHANISMS HELD BY ALSTOM AND ARE CONSOLIDATED BY GE BECAUSE WE CONTROL ALL SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE JOINT VENTURES. AS THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE BUSINESSES, WOULD OTHERWISE BE CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE VOTING MODEL AND THEIR ASSETS CAN BE USED FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN SETTLEMENT OF THE JOINT VENTURES' OBLIGATIONS, THERE IS NO CONTINUING VIE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT FOR THESE CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES.

THE CONSOLIDATED VIES FOR WHICH WE HAVE CONTINUING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FALL INTO THREE MAIN GROUPS. WE CONSOLIDATE VIES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE VIE'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, TYPICALLY BECAUSE OF OUR ROLE AS EITHER SERVICER OR MANAGER FOR THE VIE, WHICH ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.



TRINITY COMPRISES TWO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT HOLD INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE, AND WERE FUNDED BY THE ISSUANCE OF GICS. THE GICS INCLUDE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CERTAIN HOLDERS COULD REQUIRE IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT OF THEIR INVESTMENT SHOULD THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF GE CAPITAL FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1. THE OUTSTANDING GICS ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR SCHEDULED MATURITIES AND INDIVIDUAL TERMS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE PROVISIONS PERMITTING REDEMPTION UPON A DOWNGRADE OF ONE OR MORE OF GE CAPITAL'S RATINGS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AND ARE REPORTED IN INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS.



A SECURITIZATION ENTITY WAS CREATED TO FACILITATE SECURITIZATION OF TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT SERVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND TERM MARKETS. THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED WITH THIS ENTITY ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ALL ARE NON-RECOURSE. WE PROVIDE SERVICING FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS IN THIS ENTITY.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLES IN THIS ENTITY HAVE SIMILAR RISKS AND CHARACTERISTICS TO OUR OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES AND WERE UNDERWRITTEN TO THE SAME STANDARD. ACCORDINGLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ASSETS HAS BEEN SIMILAR TO OUR OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES; HOWEVER, THE BLENDED PERFORMANCE OF THE POOLS OF RECEIVABLES IN THIS ENTITY REFLECTS THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT WE APPLY TO DETERMINE WHICH RECEIVABLES ARE SELECTED FOR TRANSFER. CONTRACTUALLY THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE TRADE RECEIVABLES MUST FIRST BE USED TO PAY THIRD-PARTY DEBT HOLDERS AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES OF THE ENTITY. EXCESS CASH FLOWS ARE AVAILABLE TO GE. THE CREDITORS OF THIS ENTITY HAVE NO CLAIM ON OTHER ASSETS OF GE.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 195



OTHER REMAINING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES RELATE PRIMARILY TO THREE CATEGORIES OF ENTITIES: (1) JOINT VENTURES THAT LEASE EQUIPMENT WITH $821 MILLION OF ASSETS AND $818 MILLION OF LIABILITIES; (2) OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN POWER GENERATING AND LEASING ACTIVITIES WITH $1,151 MILLION OF ASSETS AND $1,079 MILLION OF LIABILITIES; AND (3) INSURANCE ENTITIES THAT, AMONG OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS, PROVIDE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE FOR GE WITH $1,114 MILLION OF ASSETS AND $532 MILLION OF LIABILITIES.

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED VIES CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: ASSISTING IN THE FORMATION AND FINANCING OF THE ENTITY; PROVIDING RECOURSE AND/OR LIQUIDITY SUPPORT; SERVICING THE ASSETS; AND RECEIVING VARIABLE FEES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES BECAUSE THE NATURE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIES DOES NOT GIVE US POWER OVER DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THEIR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INVESTMENT WE HOLD.

COMMITMENTS

THE GECAS BUSINESS IN CAPITAL HAD PLACED MULTIPLE-YEAR ORDERS FOR VARIOUS BOEING, AIRBUS AND OTHER AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS WITH LIST PRICES APPROXIMATING $27,115 MILLION AND SECONDARY ORDERS WITH AIRLINES FOR USED AIRCRAFT OF APPROXIMATELY $766 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. IN OUR AVIATION SEGMENT, WE HAD COMMITTED TO PROVIDE FINANCING ASSISTANCE ON $2,565 MILLION OF FUTURE CUSTOMER ACQUISITIONS OF AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH OUR ENGINES, INCLUDING COMMITMENTS MADE TO AIRLINES IN 2015 FOR FUTURE SALES UNDER OUR GE90 AND GENX ENGINE CAMPAIGNS.

GUARANTEES

OUR GUARANTEES ARE PROVIDED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE UNDERWRITE THESE GUARANTEES CONSIDERING ECONOMIC, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK OF THE COUNTERPARTY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR GUARANTEES AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, GENERALLY THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVED, OR IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE A PREMIUM, THE AMOUNT BASED ON APPRAISAL, OBSERVED MARKET VALUES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY ASSOCIATED EXPECTED RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER RECEIVABLES, NOT NETTED AGAINST THE LIABILITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE WERE COMMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS BEYOND THOSE PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF VIES. SEE NOTE 21.

CREDIT SUPPORT.

WE HAVE PROVIDED $816 MILLION OF CREDIT SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OR ASSOCIATED COMPANIES, PREDOMINANTLY JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS, USING ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ENABLE THESE CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS OR OBTAIN DESIRED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. SHOULD THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY FAIL TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THEIR BEHALF. UNDER MOST SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, OUR GUARANTEE IS SECURED, USUALLY BY THE ASSET BEING PURCHASED OR FINANCED, OR POSSIBLY BY CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS OF THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY. THE LENGTH OF THESE CREDIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS PARALLELS THE LENGTH OF THE RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CREDIT SUPPORT WAS $36 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.

GE 2015 FORM 10-K 197

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO FUND UP TO $23 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 UNDER RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES ON A VARIETY OF LEASED EQUIPMENT. UNDER MOST OF OUR RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES, OUR COMMITMENT IS SECURED BY THE LEASED ASSET. THE LIABILITY FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WAS $10 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE ALSO HAD $449 MILLION OF OTHER INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH RELATE TO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SALES OF BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. THE LIABILITY FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WAS $347 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION.

THESE ARE AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO A BUYER OR SELLER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION IF CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION ARE ACHIEVED. AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.

PRODUCT WARRANTIES

WE PROVIDE FOR ESTIMATED PRODUCT WARRANTY EXPENSES WHEN WE SELL THE RELATED PRODUCTS. BECAUSE WARRANTY ESTIMATES ARE FORECASTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION – MOSTLY HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE – CLAIMS COSTS MAY DIFFER FROM AMOUNTS PROVIDED.

THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES ISSUED NEW MORTALITY TABLES IN 2014 PROJECTING LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES THAT RESULTED IN HIGHER POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR U.S. COMPANIES. WE UPDATED OUR MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF $612 MILLION IN OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

PLAN FIDUCIARIES OF THE GE PENSION PLAN SET INVESTMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES FOR THE GE PENSION TRUST AND OVERSEE ITS INVESTMENT ALLOCATION, WHICH INCLUDES SELECTING INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND SETTING LONG-TERM STRATEGIC TARGETS. THE PRIMARY STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ARE BALANCING INVESTMENT RISK AND RETURN AND MONITORING THE PLAN'S LIQUIDITY POSITION IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEAR-TERM BENEFIT PAYMENT AND OTHER CASH NEEDS. TARGET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES ARE ESTABLISHED AT AN ASSET CLASS LEVEL BY PLAN FIDUCIARIES. TARGET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE GUIDELINES, NOT LIMITATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PLAN FIDUCIARIES WILL APPROVE ALLOCATIONS ABOVE OR BELOW A TARGET RANGE.

ACCORDING TO STATUTE, THE AGGREGATE HOLDINGS OF ALL QUALIFYING EMPLOYER SECURITIES (E.G., GE COMMON STOCK) AND QUALIFYING EMPLOYER REAL PROPERTY MAY NOT EXCEED 10% OF THE FAIR VALUE OF TRUST ASSETS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. GE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 3.7% AND 3.8% OF THE GE PENSION TRUST ASSETS AT YEAR-END 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

THE GE PENSION PLAN HAS A BROADLY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, PRIVATE EQUITIES, REAL ESTATE AND HEDGE FUNDS; THESE INVESTMENTS ARE BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. IN NATURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, NO SECTOR CONCENTRATION OF ASSETS EXCEEDED 15% OF TOTAL GE PENSION PLAN ASSETS.

GAIN (LOSS) IS RECORDED IN GE CAPITAL REVENUES FROM SERVICES, INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES, AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES WHEN RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS.

THE TOTAL PRE-TAX AMOUNT IN AOCI RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS WAS A $49 MILLION LOSS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. WE EXPECT TO TRANSFER $134 MILLION TO EARNINGS AS AN EXPENSE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. IN BOTH 2015 AND 2014, WE RECOGNIZED INSIGNIFICANT GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT DID NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, THE MAXIMUM TERM OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS WAS 17 YEARS AND 18 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE15 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF AOCI.

FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE AMOUNT OF INEFFECTIVENESS IN THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AND AMOUNT OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF INEFFECTIVENESS WERE INSIGNIFICANT FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD.

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN OUR POSITIONS. WE MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL DEFAULT AND NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENTS) ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS. WHERE WE HAVE AGREED TO NETTING OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES WITH A COUNTERPARTY, WE NET OUR EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND APPLY THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL POSTED TO US TO DETERMINE THE EXPOSURE. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THESE NET EXPOSURES AGAINST DEFINED LIMITS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE, INCLUDING REQUIRING ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN CERTAIN OF OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE COUNTERPARTIES TO POST COLLATERAL (TYPICALLY, CASH OR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES) WHEN OUR RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE COUNTERPARTY, MEASURED AT CURRENT MARKET VALUE, EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED LIMIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH COLLATERAL WAS $3,061 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, OF WHICH $1,784 MILLION WAS CASH AND $1,277 MILLION WAS IN THE FORM OF SECURITIES HELD BY A CUSTODIAN FOR OUR BENEFIT. UNDER CERTAIN OF THESE SAME AGREEMENTS, WE POST COLLATERAL TO OUR COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR DERIVATIVE OBLIGATIONS, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH WAS $642 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, OUR EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES (INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST), NET OF COLLATERAL WE HOLD, WAS $836 MILLION. THIS EXCLUDES EXPOSURE RELATED TO EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.

ADDITIONALLY, OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-/A3 OR OTHER RATINGS LEVELS AGREED UPON WITH THE COUNTERPARTY. IN CERTAIN OF THESE MASTER AGREEMENTS, EACH PARTY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE TERMINATION IF THE SHORT-TERM RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1. OUR MASTER AGREEMENTS ALSO TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE TERMINATION RIGHTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT BY ONE OF THE PARTIES. IF AN AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED UNDER ANY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE TERMINATION AMOUNT PAYABLE WOULD BE DETERMINED ON A NET BASIS AND COULD ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY COLLATERAL POSTED. THE NET AMOUNT OF OUR DERIVATIVE LIABILITY, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY US AND OUTSTANDING INTEREST PAYMENTS WAS $690 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. THIS EXCLUDES EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.
