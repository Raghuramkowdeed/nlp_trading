WE ARE

ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED TECHNOLOGY, MEDIA, AND FINANCIAL

SERVICES CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RANGING FROM

AIRCRAFT ENGINES, POWER GENERATION, WATER PROCESSING, AND SECURITY TECHNOLOGY TO

MEDICAL IMAGING, BUSINESS AND CONSUMER FINANCING, MEDIA CONTENT AND INDUSTRIAL

DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT HAVE BROADENED

CONSIDERABLY THE SCOPE OF OUR ACTIVITIES.

IN

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, WE ENCOUNTER AGGRESSIVE AND

ABLE COMPETITION. IN MANY INSTANCES, THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY

CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES CONTINUING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL

AS CUSTOMER COMMITMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE

THAT, IN GENERAL, WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS IN MOST OF THE MAJOR

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IS ONE OF FOUR

MAJOR U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS. NBC UNIVERSAL ALSO COMPETES

WITH OTHER FILM AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS,

CABLE/SATELLITE TELEVISION NETWORKS AND THEME PARK OPERATORS. THE BUSINESSES IN

WHICH GECS ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, THRIFTS, INVESTMENT BANKS,

BROKER-DEALERS, CREDIT UNIONS, LEASING COMPANIES, CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES,

INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES AND FINANCE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH

MANUFACTURERS.

ADDRESS OUR EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION, AND OFTEN CONTAIN WORDS SUCH AS “EXPECT,” “ANTICIPATE,” “INTEND,”

“PLAN,” BELIEVE,” “SEEK,” OR “WILL.” FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR NATURE

ADDRESS MATTERS THAT ARE, TO DIFFERENT DEGREES, UNCERTAIN. FOR US, PARTICULAR

UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

THAN THOSE EXPRESSED IN OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE: THE SEVERITY AND

DURATION OF CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN

INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY AND EQUITY PRICES AND THE VALUE OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS; THE IMPACT OF U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TO RESTORE

LIQUIDITY AND STIMULATE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES; THE IMPACT OF CONDITIONS

IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF GE CAPITAL’S

FUNDING AND ON OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE GE CAPITAL’S ASSET LEVELS AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER EXPOSURE AS PLANNED; THE IMPACT OF CONDITIONS IN THE HOUSING MARKET AND

UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ON THE LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER CREDIT DEFAULTS; OUR

ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATING AND THE IMPACT ON OUR FUNDING

COSTS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IF WE DO NOT DO SO; THE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH GE CAPITAL DOES BUSINESS; THE ADEQUACY OF OUR

CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS AND OTHER CONDITIONS WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

MAINTAIN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AT THE CURRENT LEVEL; THE LEVEL OF DEMAND AND

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION, NETWORK TELEVISION,

REAL ESTATE AND HEALTHCARE; THE IMPACT OF REGULATION AND REGULATORY,

INVESTIGATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS; STRATEGIC

ACTIONS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND OUR SUCCESS IN INTEGRATING

COUNTERPARTIES HAVE AN AGREED SHARE OF REVENUES AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT AND

COMPONENT PRODUCTION RESPONSIBILITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, SUCH COUNTERPARTY

INTERESTS RANGED FROM 5% TO 49% OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS; ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTIONS TO

SUCH COUNTERPARTIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS COSTS OF PRODUCTION.

WORLDWIDE

COMPETITION FOR POWER GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS INTENSE. DEMAND FOR

POWER GENERATION IS GLOBAL AND, AS A RESULT, IS SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THE BALANCE OF

REGIONAL GROWTH AND DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO EVALUATE AS

WE PLAN FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES. DURING 2008, WE MADE A NUMBER OF

ACQUISITIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH WERE MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL AND

CITICAPITAL. IN JANUARY 2009, WE ACQUIRED INTERBANCA S.P.A., A LEADING ITALIAN

CORPORATE BANK.

WE

OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, LEASING COMPANIES, FINANCING COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH

MANUFACTURERS, AND INDEPENDENT FINANCE COMPANIES. COMPETITION RELATED TO OUR

LENDING AND LEASING OPERATIONS IS BASED ON PRICE, THAT IS INTEREST RATES AND

FEES, AS WELL AS DEAL STRUCTURE AND TERMS. PROFITABILITY IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY BY

BROAD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT CUSTOMER CREDIT QUALITY AND THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL, BUT ALSO BY SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT

RISK, OPERATING RISK AND MARKET RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RISKS. SUCCESS REQUIRES HIGH QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, CUSTOMER

AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, DIVERSIFICATION, SERVICE AND DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS, STRONG COLLATERAL AND ASSET MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE, DEAL STRUCTURING

EXPERTISE AND THE ABILITY TO REDUCE COSTS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND

PRODUCTIVITY.

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL (6.4%, 7.3% AND 8.7% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2008, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY) SELLS PRODUCTS THAT SHARE SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS −

COMPETITIVE DESIGN, EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND

SERVICE. STRONG GLOBAL COMPETITION RARELY PERMITS PREMIUM PRICING, SO COST

CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCTIVITY, IS KEY. DESPITE PRICING PRESSURES ON MANY OF

OUR PRODUCTS, WE ALSO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENTIATED, PREMIUM

PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE PROFITABLE. WHILE SOME CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS

ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED TO CONSUMER APPLICATIONS (MAJOR APPLIANCES, FOR EXAMPLE),

AND SOME PRIMARILY TO INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS (SWITCHGEAR, FOR EXAMPLE), OTHERS

ARE DIRECTED TO BOTH MARKETS (LIGHTING, FOR EXAMPLE).

WE SELL

AND SERVICE MAJOR HOME APPLIANCES INCLUDING REFRIGERATORS, FREEZERS, ELECTRIC

AND GAS RANGES, COOKTOPS, DISHWASHERS, CLOTHES WASHERS AND DRYERS, MICROWAVE

OVENS, ROOM AIR CONDITIONERS, AND RESIDENTIAL WATER SYSTEMS FOR FILTRATION,

SOFTENING AND HEATING. BRANDS ARE GE MONOGRAM®, GE PROFILETM, GE®, HOTPOINT® AND

GE CAFÉTM.

WE

MANUFACTURE CERTAIN PRODUCTS, AND ALSO SOURCE FINISHED PRODUCT AND COMPONENT

PARTS FROM THIRD-PARTY GLOBAL MANUFACTURERS. A LARGE PORTION OF OUR APPLIANCES

SALES ARE THROUGH A VARIETY OF RETAIL OUTLETS FOR REPLACEMENT OF INSTALLED

UNITS. RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS INSTALLING UNITS IN NEW CONSTRUCTION IS

OUR SECOND MAJOR U.S. CHANNEL. WE OFFER ONE OF THE LARGEST ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURER (OEM) SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE APPLIANCES INDUSTRY, PROVIDING

LIGHTING SYSTEMS.

THE

AGGREGATE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN MARKETS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

GENERALLY LAGS OVERALL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES. IN

GE-FUNDED

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $3.0 BILLION IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007,

AND $2.8 BILLION IN 2006. IN ADDITION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FROM

CUSTOMERS, PRINCIPALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TOTALED $1.3 BILLION, $1.1 BILLION

INFRASTRUCTURE’S ENERGY BUSINESS ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FUNDED

PRIMARILY BY GE.

EXPENDITURES

REPORTED ABOVE REFLECT THE DEFINITION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED BY

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. FOR OPERATING AND MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES, WE CONSIDER AMOUNTS SPENT ON PRODUCT AND SERVICES TECHNOLOGY TO

INCLUDE OUR REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES, BUT ALSO AMOUNTS FOR

IMPROVING OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR PLANT,

EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES. ON THIS BASIS, OUR TECHNOLOGY EXPENDITURES IN 2008 WERE

$5.3 BILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF

REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION

ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A

DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO

APPROXIMATELY $0.3 BILLION IN 2008 AND $0.2 BILLION IN 2007. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT

THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN THE

RANGE OF $0.3 BILLION TO $0.4 BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

IN

NOVEMBER 2006, THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT APPROVED A CONSENT

DECREE, WHICH HAD BEEN AGREED TO BY GE AND THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), THAT REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EPA’S 2002 DECISION TO DREDGE POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL

(PCB)-CONTAINING SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE DREDGING WILL BE

PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES WITH AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE AFTER THE

FIRST PHASE. UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO REIMBURSE THE EPA

FOR ITS PAST AND FUTURE PROJECT OVERSIGHT COSTS AND TO PERFORM THE FIRST PHASE

OF DREDGING, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO PROCEED FROM MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009.

AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PEER REVIEW, CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR 2010, WE MAY BE

RESPONSIBLE FOR FURTHER COSTS. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, INCLUDED LIABILITIES FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE

COSTS OF THE AGREED UPON REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES.

(12)

THE

UNPRECEDENTED CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY AFFECT THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF GE CAPITAL’S FUNDING.

THE

FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF

VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION, PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON FINANCIAL AND OTHER

ASSET PRICES GENERALLY AND ON THE CREDIT AVAILABILITY FOR CERTAIN ISSUERS. THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK RECENTLY CREATED A NUMBER OF

PROGRAMS TO HELP STABILIZE CREDIT MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND RESTORE

LIQUIDITY. MANY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALSO CREATED OR ANNOUNCED SIMILAR

MEASURES FOR INSTITUTIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE

IMPROVED CONDITIONS IN THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THESE PROGRAMS, INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY, WILL CONTINUE TO

HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON THE MARKETS OVERALL, OR WILL RESOLVE THE CREDIT OR

LIQUIDITY ISSUES OF COMPANIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAMS.

A LARGE

PORTION OF GE CAPITAL’S BORROWINGS HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

TERM DEBT MARKETS. GE CAPITAL HAS CONTINUED TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND, AS

PLANNED, HAS REDUCED ITS OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE TO $67 BILLION AT

THE END OF 2008. GE CAPITAL HAS ALSO ISSUED TERM DEBT, MAINLY DEBT GUARANTEED BY

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION UNDER THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY

GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, ON A NON-GUARANTEED BASIS.

ALTHOUGH THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM DEBT MARKETS HAVE REMAINED AVAILABLE TO

GE CAPITAL TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS AND DEBT MATURITIES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT SUCH MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE COST

OF SUCH FUNDING WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE. IF CURRENT LEVELS OF MARKET

DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY CONTINUE OR WORSEN, OR IF WE CANNOT FURTHER REDUCE GE

CAPITAL’S ASSET LEVELS AS PLANNED IN 2009, WE WOULD SEEK TO REPAY COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND TERM DEBT AS IT BECOMES DUE OR TO MEET OUR OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS BY

USING THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY (CPFF) AND THE

TLGP, APPLYING THE NET PROCEEDS OF OUR OCTOBER 2008 EQUITY OFFERING AND THE

INVESTMENT BY BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC., DRAWING UPON CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED

LENDING AGREEMENTS PRIMARILY PROVIDED BY GLOBAL BANKS AND/OR SEEKING OTHER

SOURCES OF FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE TLGP AND THE

CPFF WILL BE EXTENDED BEYOND THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION, OR THAT, UNDER SUCH

EXTREME MARKET CONDITIONS, CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED LENDING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER

FUNDING SOURCES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR SUFFICIENT.

OUR 2009

FUNDING PLAN ANTICIPATES APPROXIMATELY $45 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED

LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCE. IN JANUARY 2009, WE COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $11.0

BILLION OF FUNDING UNDER THE TLGP. WE ALSO ISSUED $5.1 BILLION IN NON-GUARANTEED

SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT WITH A MATURITY OF 30 YEARS UNDER THE NON-GUARANTEE

OPTION OF THE TLGP. THESE ISSUANCES, ALONG WITH THE $13.4 BILLION OF PRE-FUNDING

DONE IN DECEMBER 2008, BRING OUR AGGREGATE ISSUANCES TO $29.5 BILLION OR 66% OF

OUR ANTICIPATED 2009 FUNDING PLAN. ADDITIONALLY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE

90% COMPLETE WITH OUR 2009 FUNDING PLAN BY JUNE 30, 2009.

DIFFICULT

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETS HAVE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF GE CAPITAL AND WE DO NOT

EXPECT THESE CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

DRAMATIC

DECLINES IN THE HOUSING MARKET, WITH FALLING HOME PRICES AND INCREASING

FORECLOSURES AND UNEMPLOYMENT, HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT WRITE-DOWNS OF ASSET

VALUES BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES AND

MAJOR COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANKS. THESE WRITE-DOWNS, INITIALLY OF

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES BUT SPREADING TO CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AND OTHER

DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, HAVE CAUSED MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SEEK

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, TO MERGE WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND, IN SOME CASES, TO

FAIL. MANY LENDERS AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS HAVE REDUCED AND, IN SOME CASES,

CEASED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO BORROWERS INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THIS MARKET TURMOIL AND TIGHTENING OF CREDIT HAVE LED TO AN INCREASED LEVEL OF

COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER DELINQUENCIES, LACK OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, INCREASED

MARKET VOLATILITY AND WIDESPREAD REDUCTION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY GENERALLY. IF

THESE CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE

ABLE TO RECOVER FULLY THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS SUCH AS GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLES. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE ESTABLISHED

ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES IN GE CAPITAL’S PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE, SIGNIFICANT AND UNEXPECTED FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE

ECONOMY AND IN DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE THESE

ALLOWANCES AND WRITE-OFFS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE, COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS

,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

(13)

THE

SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GE

CAPITAL.

GE

CAPITAL HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND

ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE GE CAPITAL TO

CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OF ITS COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. IN ADDITION,

GE CAPITAL’S CREDIT RISK MAY BE INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY IT CANNOT

BE REALIZED UPON SALE OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE

FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO IT. GE CAPITAL ALSO HAS

EXPOSURE TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF UNSECURED DEBT

INSTRUMENTS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. GE CAPITAL HAS POLICIES RELATING

TO INITIAL CREDIT RATING REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXPOSURE LIMITS TO COUNTERPARTIES

(AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 29 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT),

WHICH MITIGATE CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER,

THAT ANY LOSSES OR IMPAIRMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WOULD

NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITAL’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN WHICH GE CAPITAL PARTICIPATES ARE HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN.

GE

CAPITAL PARTICIPATES IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IN TWO WAYS: IT

PROVIDES FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION, REFINANCING AND RENOVATION OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTIES AND IT ALSO ACQUIRES AN EQUITY POSITION IN VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTIES. THE PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT

UPON THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET IN WHICH THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED AND THE

PERCEIVED VALUE OF THAT MARKET AT THE TIME OF SALE. SUCH ACTIVITY MAY VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, A SLOWDOWN IN

GENERAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND RECENT DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS HAVE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT, THE VALUE

OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS GE CAPITAL HOLDS. UNDER CURRENT MARKET AND CREDIT

CONDITIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES GE CAPITAL WILL

COMPLETE OR THE NET SALES PROCEEDS IT WILL REALIZE. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENTALS WILL CONTINUE AT THEIR CURRENT

LEVELS GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH GE

CAPITAL CONTINUES TO HOLD ITS EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THESE PROPERTIES WHICH MAY

RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS.

GE

CAPITAL IS ALSO A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDER IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THAT HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES AND HOME SALE

VOLUMES, JOB LOSSES, CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY

IMPACT THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF OUR MORTGAGE LOANS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES ON THESE MORTGAGE LOANS IS BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF CURRENT AND

HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND LOAN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS OTHER MANAGEMENT

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY BE INACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN THIS

ENVIRONMENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, CREDIT

PERFORMANCE WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED AND, AS A RESULT,

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT GE CAPITAL’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FAILURE

TO MAINTAIN OUR “TRIPLE-A” CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF

FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY, COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS.

THE

MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY

WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN DECEMBER 2008,

STANDARD & POOR’S RATINGS SERVICES AFFIRMED OUR AND GE CAPITAL’S “AAA”

LONG-TERM AND “A-1+” SHORT-TERM CORPORATE CREDIT RATINGS BUT REVISED ITS RATINGS

OUTLOOK FROM STABLE TO NEGATIVE BASED PARTLY ON THE CONCERNS REGARDING GE

CAPITAL’S FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FUNDING IN LIGHT OF CAPITAL MARKET TURMOIL. ON

JANUARY 24, 2009, MOODY’S INVESTMENT SERVICES PLACED THE LONG-TERM RATINGS OF GE

AND GE CAPITAL ON REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE. THE FIRM’S “PRIME-1” SHORT-TERM

RATINGS WERE AFFIRMED. MOODY’S SAID THE REVIEW FOR DOWNGRADE IS BASED PRIMARILY

UPON HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING GE CAPITAL’S ASSET QUALITY AND EARNINGS

PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE DIFFICULT FINANCIAL MARKETS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR 2009 OPERATIONAL AND FUNDING PLAN FOR GE

CAPITAL OR, IN THE EVENT OF FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, THAT

COMPLETION OF OUR PLAN AND ANY OTHER STEPS WE MIGHT TAKE IN RESPONSE WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN OUR “TRIPLE-A” RATINGS. FAILURE TO DO SO

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS AND RELATED MARGINS, LIQUIDITY,

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS. VARIOUS DEBT INSTRUMENTS,

GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL

IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, BUT NONE ARE TRIGGERED IF OUR RATINGS ARE

REDUCED TO AA-/AA3 OR A-1+/P-1 OR HIGHER.

(14)

CURRENT

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE ALSO MAY

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR

NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES.

INFRASTRUCTURE, CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL AND MEDIA BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR,

CONDITIONS IN THE AIR AND RAIL TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY GENERATION, HEALTHCARE,

NETWORK TELEVISION AND OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIES WE SERVE. AS A RESULT OF SLOWING

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND

BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, REDUCED LEVELS OF CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES

CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE

DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING

FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL

PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE

PROJECTS, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US IN A TIMELY

FASHION. CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY RECOVER OUR

CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. FURTHER, OUR VENDORS MAY BE EXPERIENCING

SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS

TO US. ALTHOUGH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS EXPECTED TO ENACT

VARIOUS ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAMS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE TIMING

AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN CONTINUES

FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OR THERE IS SIGNIFICANT FURTHER DETERIORATION IN THE

GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR

GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS.

WE

CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PART OF THE WORLD. IN 2008,

APPROXIMATELY 53% OF OUR REVENUES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL COMPETITION.

THEY ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY. POLITICAL CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE, CAN INTERFERE WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF OUR

ACTIVITIES IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. WHILE SOME OF THESE RISKS CAN BE HEDGED

USING DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOME ARE INSURABLE, SUCH

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE COSTLY AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR

ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH MITIGATION HAS DECREASED OR BECOME EVEN MORE COSTLY AS

A RESULT OF RECENT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.

THE

SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES FOR STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.

WITH

RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE

CANDIDATES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS AND

OTHER BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL AND

TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND

BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES. WHEN WE DECIDE TO

SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING BUYERS OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER (AS WAS THE

CASE WITH OUR CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS IN 2008), WHICH COULD DELAY THE

ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY DISPOSE OF A

BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. THESE

DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL AND CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE SOME POTENTIAL SELLERS MAY HOLD ONTO ASSETS PENDING A

REBOUND IN PRICES AND BUYERS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING THE NECESSARY

FINANCING. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY SELL A BUSINESS WHOSE

SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN WHICH CASE OUR DECISION

WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SACRIFICED ENTERPRISE VALUE.

THERE

ARE RISKS INHERENT IN OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE

MARKET PRICE AND VOLUME OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE,

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. THESE MAY ARISE FROM GENERAL STOCK MARKET

CONDITIONS, THE IMPACT OF THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, A CHANGE IN SENTIMENT IN THE MARKET

REGARDING US OR OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR FROM OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THE

AMOUNTS AND FREQUENCY OF SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDENDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

(15)

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE

AND FOREIGN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, IN

RESPONSE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL NOT BE

CHANGED IN WAYS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND

OBJECTIVES OR AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON INVESTMENT BY MAKING EXISTING PRACTICES MORE

RESTRICTED, SUBJECT TO ESCALATING COSTS OR PROHIBITED OUTRIGHT. IN PARTICULAR,

WE EXPECT U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO UNDERTAKE A SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW AND

REVISION OF THE REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF BANK AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND TAX LAWS AND REGULATION, WHICH MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON

GE CAPITAL’S STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY RISKS FROM LAWS THAT REDUCE THE ALLOWABLE LENDING RATE OR LIMIT

CONSUMER BORROWING, LOCAL LIQUIDITY REGULATIONS THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF

NOT BEING ABLE TO RETRIEVE ASSETS, AND CHANGES TO TAX LAW THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GE’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE

ACTIVE BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES IS TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS

REDUCTION DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF

U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS

REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT

WITH INTERNATIONAL TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO

COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER FOREIGN FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT

THE END OF 2009, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AND HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CONGRESS

ON FIVE PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING IN OCTOBER OF 2008, BUT THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN THE EVENT THIS PROVISION IS

NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2009, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF

THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2010.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. WE AND OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE AT TIMES

BEING REVIEWED OR INVESTIGATED BY REGULATORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES OR THE ASSERTION OF PRIVATE LITIGATION CLAIMS AND

DAMAGES. THESE INCLUDE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANTITRUST

DIVISION AND THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) OF THE MARKETING

AND SALES OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

TO MUNICIPALITIES BY CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF GE CAPITAL AND AN INVESTIGATION BY

THE SEC OF POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN

ACCOUNTING ISSUES, AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT. ADDITIONALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER

OF REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. THESE INCLUDE THE DREDGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS FROM A

40-MILE STRETCH OF THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK STATE, AS DESCRIBED IN

ITEM 1. “BUSINESS” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3. “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT

AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS

THAT LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED

WITH CERTAINTY, WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, DISCOUNT RATES, AND OTHER

FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EQUITY, AND PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT OF

INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME

OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY

CHANGE BASED ON CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS WE USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR 2009 ARE

THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLANS ASSETS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A

REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED GAINS (LOSSES) – NET, BENEFIT PLANS. AT THE

END OF 2008, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF OUR U.S. PRINCIPAL PENSION

PLANS WAS $45.1 BILLION AND ASSETS WERE $40.7 BILLION. FOR A DISCUSSION

REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION PLAN

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES – PENSION ASSUMPTIONS IN

PART II, ITEM 7. “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” AND NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT

DIRECTLY RELATED, KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO

LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PENSION PLANS AS

REQUIRED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN JANUARY 2005, THE STAFF OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) INFORMED US THAT IT HAD COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION AND

REQUESTED CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF HEDGE

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES BY US AND GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION. IN

AUGUST 2005, THE SEC STAFF ADVISED US THAT THE SEC HAD ISSUED A FORMAL ORDER OF

INVESTIGATION IN THE MATTER. THE SEC INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING AND THE SEC

STAFF HAS TAKEN TESTIMONY IN THIS MATTER AND HAS REQUESTED INFORMATION ABOUT

OTHER GE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING ITEMS RELATED TO REVENUE

RECOGNITION AND OUR CASH FLOW PRESENTATIONS.

WE

CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE ONGOING SEC INVESTIGATION AND TO DISCUSS THE

INVESTIGATION AND ISSUES ARISING IN THAT INVESTIGATION AND OUR INTERNAL REVIEW

OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING MATTERS WITH THE SEC STAFF WITH A GOAL OF COMPLETING OUR

REVIEW AND RESOLVING THESE MATTERS. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, WE HAVE HAD

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SEC STAFF CONCERNING RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS. IN

SEPTEMBER 2008, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED A “WELLS NOTICE” ADVISING US THAT IT IS

CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING TO THE SEC THAT IT BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION

AGAINST GE FOR POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS. WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED

THAT THE ISSUES THE STAFF MAY RECOMMEND THAT THE SEC PURSUE RELATE TO THE

APPLICATION OF SFAS 133 IN 2002 AND 2003 WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVES FORMERLY USED TO HEDGE THE RISK OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVES IN WHICH A FEE WAS A PART OF THE

CONSIDERATION FOR THE DERIVATIVE; A CHANGE IN 2002 IN OUR ACCOUNTING FOR PROFITS

ON CERTAIN AFTERMARKET SPARE PARTS PRIMARILY IN OUR AVIATION BUSINESS; CERTAIN

2003 AND EARLIER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES IN OUR RAIL

BUSINESS; AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION ON PRODUCT SALES

SUBJECT TO IN-TRANSIT RISK OF DAMAGE, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR HEALTHCARE,

INFRASTRUCTURE AND INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS. WE HAVE ALREADY DISCLOSED THESE ITEMS IN

PREVIOUSLY FILED SEC REPORTS, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECTS ON PARTICULAR PERIODS AND

CORRECTED OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THEM. THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF THESE ITEMS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS A REDUCTION IN NET

EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN THE PERIOD FROM 2001 THROUGH DECEMBER

31, 2007. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF REMEDIAL ACTIONS AND INTERNAL CONTROL

ENHANCEMENTS, ALSO AS DESCRIBED IN OUR SEC REPORTS. ALL OF THESE ITEMS WERE

REVIEWED OR DISCUSSED WITH KPMG, WHICH AUDITED OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THROUGHOUT THE PERIODS IN QUESTION.

WE

DISAGREE WITH THE SEC STAFF REGARDING THIS RECOMMENDATION AND HAVE BEEN IN

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STAFF, INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL RESOLUTION OF THE

MATTER. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL HAVE

THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ANY DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE SEC STAFF WITH RESPECT TO

ITS RECOMMENDATION THROUGH THE WELLS PROCESS WITH THE FULL COMMISSION. IF THE

COMMISSION WERE TO AUTHORIZE AN ACTION AGAINST GE, IT COULD SEEK AN INJUNCTION

AGAINST FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS,

INCLUDING POTENTIALLY SECTIONS 13(A), 13(B), AND 10(B) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND

SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT, THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES, AND OTHER

RELIEF WITHIN THE COMMISSION’S AUTHORITY. IF WE WERE TO RESOLVE THE MATTER

THROUGH A SETTLEMENT, WE WOULD NEITHER ADMIT NOR DENY THE PROPOSED ALLEGATIONS

BUT COULD AGREE TO THE RESOLUTION AND ENTRY OF AN INJUNCTION. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT WE AND THE SEC WOULD REACH AGREEMENT ON A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AS

A RESULT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS.

IN JULY

AND SEPTEMBER 2008, SHAREHOLDERS FILED TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS UNDER THE

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

CONNECTICUT NAMING US AS DEFENDANT, AS WELL AS OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THESE TWO ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AND IN JANUARY

2009, A CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ALLEGING THAT WE AND OUR CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS THAT ARTIFICIALLY

INFLATED OUR STOCK PRICE BETWEEN MARCH 12, 2008 AND APRIL 10, 2008, WHEN WE

ANNOUNCED THAT OUR RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 WOULD NOT MEET OUR

PREVIOUS GUIDANCE AND WE ALSO LOWERED OUR FULL YEAR GUIDANCE FOR 2008. THIS

CASE, WHICH SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, IS AT AN EARLY STAGE AND WE INTEND TO

DEFEND OURSELVES VIGOROUSLY. IN ADDITION, IN AUGUST 2008, SHAREHOLDERS FILED TWO

PURPORTED DERIVATIVE ACTIONS IN NEW YORK STATE COURT AGAINST OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD AND US (AS NOMINAL

DEFENDANT) FOR ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND OTHER CLAIMS IN CONNECTION

WITH THESE EVENTS. IN DECEMBER 2008, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION TO DISMISS THE ACTIONS WITHOUT

PREJUDICE.

(17)

IN

OCTOBER 2008, SHAREHOLDERS FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION UNDER THE FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK NAMING US AS DEFENDANT, AS WELL AS OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT DURING A CONFERENCE CALL

WITH ANALYSTS ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS CONCERNING (I) THE STATE OF GE’S FUNDING, CASH FLOWS, AND LIQUIDITY

AND (II) THE QUESTION OF ISSUING ADDITIONAL EQUITY, WHICH CAUSED ECONOMIC LOSS

TO THOSE SHAREHOLDERS WHO PURCHASED GE STOCK BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 25, 2008 AND

OCTOBER 2, 2008, WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THE PRICING OF A COMMON STOCK OFFERING. THIS

CASE, WHICH SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, IS AT THE EARLIEST STAGE AND WE INTEND TO

DEFEND OURSELVES VIGOROUSLY.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ)

AND THE SEC ARE CONDUCTING AN INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATION OF MARKETING AND SALES

OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO

MUNICIPALITIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTIGATION, TWO SUBSIDIARIES OF GE

CAPITAL HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH

THE INVESTIGATION: GE FUNDING CMS (TRINITY FUNDING CO.) AND GE FUNDING CAPITAL

MARKET SERVICES, INC. (GE FCMS). GE CAPITAL HAS COOPERATED AND CONTINUES TO

COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE SEC AND DOJ IN THIS MATTER. IN JULY 2008, GE FCMS

RECEIVED A “WELLS NOTICE” ADVISING THAT THE SEC STAFF IS CONSIDERING

RECOMMENDING THAT THE SEC BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION OR INSTITUTE AN

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE BIDDING FOR VARIOUS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES OF

GE FCMS. GE FCMS IS ONE OF SEVERAL INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS THAT RECEIVED WELLS

NOTICES DURING 2008. GE FCMS DISAGREES WITH THE SEC STAFF REGARDING THIS

RECOMMENDATION AND HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STAFF, INCLUDING DISCUSSION

OF POTENTIAL RESOLUTION OF THE MATTER. GE FCMS INTENDS TO CONTINUE THESE

DISCUSSIONS AND UNDERSTANDS THAT IT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ANY

DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE SEC STAFF WITH RESPECT TO ITS RECOMMENDATION THROUGH THE

WELLS PROCESS WITH THE FULL COMMISSION. IN MARCH 2008, GE FCMS AND TRINITY

FUNDING CO., LLC (TRINITY FUNDING) WERE SERVED WITH A FEDERAL CLASS ACTION

COMPLAINT ASSERTING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. THIS ACTION HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH

OTHER RELATED ACTIONS IN A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PROCEEDING IN THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN ADDITION, GE

FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING ALSO RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF

THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT AND FLORIDA ON BEHALF OF A WORKING GROUP OF STATE

ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN JUNE 2008. GE FCMS AND TRINITY FUNDING ARE COOPERATING WITH

THOSE INVESTIGATIONS.

IN JUNE

2008, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION

ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT AT A POWER COGENERATION PLANT IN

HOMER CITY, PA. THE PLANT IS OPERATED EXCLUSIVELY BY EME HOMER CITY GENERATION

L.P., AND IS OWNED AND LEASED TO EME HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P. BY SUBSIDIARIES

OF GE CAPITAL. THE NOTICE OF VIOLATION DOES NOT INDICATE A SPECIFIC PENALTY

AMOUNT BUT MAKES REFERENCE TO STATUTORY FINES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES AND THAT EME HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P. IS OBLIGATED TO

INDEMNIFY GE CAPITAL’S SUBSIDIARIES AND PAY ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

MATTER.

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN APRIL 2006 THE EPA INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT WAS

CONTEMPLATING SEEKING $990,000 IN PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT

AT ITS MT. VERNON, INDIANA PLASTICS FACILITY. THE EPA ASSERTED THAT THE COMPANY

FAILED TO ADEQUATELY CONTROL EMISSIONS FROM VALVES AND INLET PIPES IN AN

UNDERGROUND PIPING SYSTEM. WE DISAGREED WITH THOSE ASSERTIONS, AND THE EPA

MODIFIED ITS POSITION TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS. IN AUGUST

2007, OWNERSHIP OF THE FACILITY WAS TRANSFERRED TO SABIC INNOVATIVE PLASTICS AS

PART OF THE SALE OF GE'S PLASTICS BUSINESS. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE SALE,

SABIC HAS AGREED TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CIVIL SANCTIONS OR

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THIS MATTER.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OPERATIONS

OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMBINE THE INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING, SERVICES

AND MEDIA BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (GE) WITH THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. (GECS OR

FINANCIAL SERVICES).

IN THE

ACCOMPANYING ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WE SOMETIMES USE INFORMATION

DERIVED FROM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BUT NOT PRESENTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). CERTAIN OF THESE DATA ARE CONSIDERED “NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES” UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

RULES. FOR SUCH MEASURES, WE HAVE PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL EXPLANATIONS AND

RECONCILIATIONS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SECTION.

WE

PRESENT MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS IN FIVE PARTS: OVERVIEW OF OUR

EARNINGS FROM 2006 THROUGH 2008, GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT, SEGMENT OPERATIONS,

GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, WE

REFER TO CAPTIONS SUCH AS REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

SIMPLY AS “REVENUES” AND “EARNINGS” THROUGHOUT THIS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS. SIMILARLY, DISCUSSION OF OTHER MATTERS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS UNLESS OTHERWISE

INDICATED.

OVERVIEW

OF OUR EARNINGS FROM 2006 THROUGH 2008

OUR

RESULTS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS REFLECT OUR STRATEGY TO STRENGTHEN OUR POSITION

AS A WORLDWIDE GROWTH COMPANY OPERATING IN DIVERSE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE

MAINTAIN STRONG MARKET-LEADER POSITIONS. DURING 2008, WE ENCOUNTERED

UNPRECEDENTED CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT

AFFECTED ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES. OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD OUR CONSOLIDATED

REVENUES GREW 20% ON ORGANIC GROWTH THAT AVERAGED 6% PER YEAR, YET EARNINGS

DECLINED 6%. OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES WERE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED

AS EARNINGS FELL 24% ON A 16% INCREASE IN REVENUES OVER THIS THREE-YEAR

PERIOD.

THE

INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS WILL SHOW HOW OUR GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION AND RISK

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES HAVE HELPED US TO GROW REVENUES AND INDUSTRIAL EARNINGS TO

RECORD LEVELS AND TO OUTPERFORM OUR PEERS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. WE

ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE DISPOSITION OF OUR LESS STRATEGIC BUSINESSES, OUR

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OUR INVESTMENT IN BUSINESSES WITH STRONG GROWTH

POTENTIAL HAVE POSITIONED US WELL FOR THE FUTURE.

ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE (19% AND 18% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL

SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) WAS WELL POSITIONED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS THE WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR ENERGY, AND FOR ALTERNATIVE

SOURCES OF POWER, SUCH AS WIND AND THERMAL, ROSE TO NEW LEVELS. THIS RESULTED IN

A 53% INCREASE IN REVENUES AND A 73% INCREASE IN SEGMENT PROFIT OVER THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND

SERVICES AT ENERGY, OIL & GAS AND WATER.

TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE (25% AND 29% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL

SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) GREW REVENUES 23% AND EARNINGS 12% OVER THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD AS WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING TECHNOLOGIES AND

SERVICES AT AVIATION AND TRANSPORTATION AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AT

HEALTHCARE. AVIATION CONTINUED TO GROW REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO RECORD LEVELS AS

ONE OF THE WORLD’S LEADING PROVIDERS OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND SERVICES. THE

AVIATION ORDERS BACKLOG ALSO CONTINUED TO GROW, POSITIONING US WELL FOR THE

FUTURE. PRODUCT SERVICES AND SALES OF OUR EVOLUTION SERIES LOCOMOTIVES

CONTRIBUTED TO TRANSPORTATION’S GROWTH OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WE HAVE

INVESTED HEAVILY IN EXPANDING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORM. HEALTHCARE REALIZED BENEFITS

FROM THE ACQUISITION OF IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION IN 2006, EXPANDING THE BREADTH

OF OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS TO THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. HEALTHCARE WAS

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE EFFECTS OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT ON U.S. EQUIPMENT

SALES. IN ADDITION, LOWER SALES OF SURGICAL IMAGING EQUIPMENT RESULTED FROM A

REGULATORY SUSPENSION ON SHIPMENTS AT ONE OF OUR FACILITIES. WE BEGAN SHIPPING

SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008. ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS OFFERS

PROTECTION AND PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS SUCH AS SAFE FACILITIES, PLANT AUTOMATION,

POWER CONTROL AND SENSING APPLICATIONS.

NBC

UNIVERSAL (10% AND 11% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT

PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) IS A DIVERSIFIED MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY THAT HAS

GROWN THROUGH BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. WHILE THE TELEVISION BUSINESS

CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGED BY THE EFFECTS OF A DIFFICULT ECONOMY, OUR CABLE

BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW AND BECOME MORE PROFITABLE. OUR FILM BUSINESS ALSO

CONTINUES TO PERFORM WELL, WITH CONSISTENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO

EARNINGS.

(22)

CAPITAL

FINANCE (37% AND 39% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL SEGMENT

PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) IS A STRONG, FOCUSED BUSINESS WITH LEADING POSITIONS IN

SEVERAL MID-MARKET, CORPORATE AND CONSUMER FINANCING SEGMENTS. OUR PERFORMANCE

HAS BEEN STRONG OVER THE LONG-TERM, WITH SOLID RISK MANAGEMENT AND UNDERWRITING

THROUGH VARIOUS CREDIT CYCLES. MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

CHANGES, SPECIFICALLY THE DISRUPTIONS IN CAPITAL MARKETS, CHALLENGING CREDIT

MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND RISING UNEMPLOYMENT. OUR EARNINGS IN 2008 AND 2007 WERE

$8.6 BILLION AND $12.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT THE CURRENT CHALLENGING

CREDIT AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT TO CONTINUE TO AFFECT OUR EARNINGS IN 2009.

THROUGHOUT 2008, WE TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, SHIFTED TEAMS FROM

ORIGINATION TO COLLECTION AND MAINTAINED A PROACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT FOCUS. OUR

FOCUS IS TO MANAGE THROUGH THE CURRENT CHALLENGING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND

REPOSITION GE CAPITAL AS A DIVERSELY FUNDED AND SMALLER FINANCE

COMPANY.

CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL (7% AND 3% OF CONSOLIDATED THREE-YEAR REVENUES AND TOTAL

SEGMENT PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY) IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. REFLECTIVE OF THE DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET, CONSUMER

& INDUSTRIAL REVENUES HAVE DECLINED OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD. IN RESPONSE

TO THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, IN 2007, CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL BEGAN A

RESTRUCTURING PLAN FOCUSED ON REDUCING MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND TRANSFERRING

WORK TO LOWER-COST COUNTRIES. DESPITE THESE COST REDUCTION EFFORTS, SEGMENT

PROFIT DECLINED ON HIGHER MATERIAL AND OTHER COSTS.

OVERALL,

ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED $7.4 BILLION, $7.7 BILLION AND $3.9 BILLION TO

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CONSOLIDATED

EARNINGS INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $0.8 BILLION IN 2008, AND $0.5 BILLION IN BOTH

2007 AND 2006, FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. WE INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS AS QUICKLY AS

POSSIBLE. ONLY REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM THE DATE WE COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION

THROUGH THE END OF THE FOURTH FOLLOWING QUARTER ARE ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH

BUSINESSES. DISPOSITIONS ALSO AFFECTED OUR ONGOING RESULTS THROUGH HIGHER

REVENUES OF $0.1 BILLION IN 2008 AND LOWER REVENUES OF $3.6 BILLION AND $1.3

BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THIS RESULTED IN HIGHER EARNINGS OF $0.4

BILLION IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007, AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2006.

SIGNIFICANT

MATTERS RELATING TO OUR STATEMENT OF EARNINGS ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, WE COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL OUR

JAPANESE PERSONAL LOAN BUSINESS (LAKE) UPON DETERMINING THAT, DESPITE

RESTRUCTURING, JAPANESE REGULATORY LIMITS FOR INTEREST CHARGES ON UNSECURED

PERSONAL LOANS DID NOT PERMIT US TO EARN AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN. DURING 2008, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WHICH INCLUDED LAKE, ALONG WITH OUR

JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP IN GE

NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD. IN DECEMBER 2007, WE COMPLETED THE EXIT OF WMC AS A

RESULT OF CONTINUED PRESSURES IN THE U.S. SUBPRIME MORTGAGE INDUSTRY. BOTH OF

THESE BUSINESSES WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE CAPITAL FINANCE

SEGMENT.

IN

AUGUST 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR PLASTICS BUSINESS. WE SOLD THIS

BUSINESS BECAUSE OF ITS CYCLICALITY, RISING COSTS OF NATURAL GAS AND RAW

MATERIALS, AND THE DECISION TO REDEPLOY CAPITAL RESOURCES INTO HIGHER-GROWTH

BUSINESSES. DURING 2006, WE SOLD OUR ADVANCED MATERIALS BUSINESS.

IN 2006,

WE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED OUR PLANNED EXIT OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESSES THROUGH

THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES AND

THE EUROPEAN LIFE AND HEALTH OPERATIONS OF GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS CORPORATION

(GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS) AND THE SALE OF GE LIFE, OUR U.K.-BASED LIFE INSURANCE

OPERATION, TO SWISS REINSURANCE COMPANY (SWISS RE), AND THE SALE, THROUGH A

SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERING, OF OUR REMAINING 18% INVESTMENT IN GENWORTH

FINANCIAL, INC. (GENWORTH), OUR FORMERLY WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY THAT CONDUCTED

MOST OF OUR CONSUMER INSURANCE BUSINESS, INCLUDING LIFE AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE

OPERATIONS.

WE

REPORTED THE BUSINESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SEE

NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

WE DECLARED $12.6 BILLION IN

DIVIDENDS IN 2008.

COMMON PER-SHARE DIVIDENDS OF $1.24 WERE UP 8% FROM

2007, FOLLOWING A 12% INCREASE FROM THE PRECEDING YEAR. ON FEBRUARY 6, 2009, OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.31 PER SHARE OF

COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS PAYABLE APRIL 27, 2009, TO SHAREOWNERS OF RECORD AT CLOSE

OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009. THIS PAYMENT WILL COMPLETE THE DIVIDEND FOR

THE FIRST HALF OF 2009. THE BOARD WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S

DIVIDEND LEVEL FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2009 IN LIGHT OF THE GROWING UNCERTAINTY

IN THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, RISING UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE

RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE RATING AGENCIES. IN 2008, WE DECLARED $0.1 BILLION

IN PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS.

(23)

EXCEPT

AS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE ANALYSIS IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION PRESENTS THE

RESULTS OF GE (WITH GECS INCLUDED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS) AND GECS. SEE THE SEGMENT

OPERATIONS SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE BUSINESSES WITHIN GE

AND GECS.

GE SALES OF PRODUCT SERVICES

WERE $35.5 BILLION IN 2008, A 10% INCREASE FROM 2007. INCREASES IN PRODUCT

SERVICES IN 2008 AND 2007 WERE LED BY GROWTH AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. OPERATING PROFIT FROM PRODUCT SERVICES WAS $9.3

BILLION IN 2008, UP 3% FROM 2007.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

COSTS WERE $2.2 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION AND $2.3 BILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COST DECREASED IN 2008 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF

PRIOR YEARS’ INVESTMENT GAINS, HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES AND BENEFITS FROM NEW

HEALTHCARE SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL COSTS OF PLAN

BENEFITS RESULTING FROM UNION NEGOTIATIONS AND A PENSIONER INCREASE IN 2007. THE

COST INCREASED IN 2007 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF PLAN BENEFIT CHANGES RESULTING FROM

NEW U.S. LABOR AGREEMENTS AND INCREASES IN RETIREE MEDICAL AND DRUG COSTS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE YEAR AND EFFECTS OF

RECENT INVESTMENT GAINS. THE COST INCREASED IN 2006 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE

EFFECTS OF PRIOR-YEARS’ INVESTMENT LOSSES AND LOWER DISCOUNT RATES.

CONSIDERING

THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED

RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF ASSETS IN WHICH OUR PLANS ARE INVESTED, WE HAVE

ASSUMED THAT LONG-TERM RETURNS ON OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL BE 8.5%

FOR COST RECOGNITION IN 2009, THE SAME LEVEL AS WE ASSUMED IN 2008, 2007 AND

2006. GAAP PROVIDES RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSUMED AND ACTUAL

RETURNS OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF

EMPLOYEES.

WE

EXPECT THE COSTS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS IN 2009 TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS

THE 2008 COSTS. THE EFFECTS OF DECREASING DISCOUNT RATES (PRINCIPAL PENSION

PLANS’ DISCOUNT RATE DECREASING FROM 6.34% TO 6.11%) WILL BE LARGELY OFFSET BY

PRIOR-YEARS’ INVESTMENT GAINS AND BENEFITS FROM NEW HEALTHCARE SUPPLIER

CONTRACTS. ASSUMING OUR 2009 ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT

BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS (E.G., EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS, DISCOUNT RATES AND

HEALTHCARE TREND RATES), WE EXPECT THAT COSTS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

WILL INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION IN 2010 AS COMPARED TO 2009,

PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION OF OUR UNAMORTIZED LOSSES RELATING TO OUR

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS.

OUR

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS WERE UNDERFUNDED BY $4.4 BILLION AT THE END OF 2008 AS

COMPARED TO OVERFUNDED BY $16.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE GE PENSION PLAN WAS UNDERFUNDED BY $0.9 BILLION AND THE GE

SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN, WHICH IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN, HAD A PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION OF $3.5 BILLION. THE REDUCTION IN SURPLUS FROM YEAR-END 2007 WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ASSET INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM THE

DETERIORATING MARKET CONDITIONS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN 2008. OUR PRINCIPAL

PENSION PLANS’ ASSETS DECREASED FROM $59.7 BILLION AT THE END OF 2007 TO $40.7

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, A 28.2% DECLINE IN INVESTMENT VALUES DURING THE

YEAR. ASSETS OF THE GE PENSION PLAN ARE HELD IN TRUST, SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF

PLAN PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL COMPANY OPERATIONS.

ALTHOUGH THE REDUCTION IN PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN 2008 WILL IMPACT FUTURE PENSION

PLAN COSTS, THE COMPANY’S REQUIREMENT TO MAKE FUTURE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

TRUST WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

ON AN

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) BASIS, THE GE PENSION PLAN

REMAINS FULLY FUNDED AT JANUARY 1, 2009. WE WILL NOT MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THE GE PENSION PLAN IN 2009. ASSUMING OUR 2009 ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT

WITH OUR CURRENT BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS (E.G., EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AND

INTEREST RATES), WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GE PENSION

PLAN IN 2010.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS FOR OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS WAS

$2.4 BILLION LESS THAN THE RESPECTIVE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE

COMPARABLE AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $1.6 BILLION. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE

$0.7 BILLION TO OUR OTHER PENSION PLANS IN 2009, COMPARED WITH ACTUAL

CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.6 BILLION AND $0.7 BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR PRINCIPAL RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE PLANS OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE

OF RELATED ASSETS BY $10.8 BILLION AND $11.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. WE FUND OUR RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO

BASIS. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $0.7 BILLION TO THESE PLANS IN 2009 COMPARED WITH

ACTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.6 BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007.

THE

FUNDED STATUS OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLANS AND FUTURE EFFECTS ON

OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. SEE

NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT FUNDED STATUS, COMPONENTS OF EARNINGS EFFECTS AND ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS.

GE OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES

ARE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THESE COSTS WERE 12.9%, 14.2%

AND 14.3% OF TOTAL GE SALES IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

(24)

INTEREST ON BORROWINGS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL CHARGES

AMOUNTED TO $26.2 BILLION, $23.8 BILLION AND $18.9

BILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

BORROWINGS ARE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHERE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $25.1 BILLION,

$22.7 BILLION AND $17.8 BILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. AVERAGE

BORROWINGS INCREASED OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD. INTEREST RATES INCREASED FROM

2006 TO 2007 ATTRIBUTABLE TO RISING CREDIT SPREADS. INTEREST RATES HAVE

DECREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008 IN LINE WITH GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. GECS AVERAGE

BORROWINGS WERE $521.2 BILLION, $456.4 BILLION AND $389.0 BILLION IN 2008, 2007

AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. GECS AVERAGE COMPOSITE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE WAS 4.8%

IN 2008, 5.0% IN 2007 AND 4.6% IN 2006. IN 2008, GECS AVERAGE ASSETS OF $667.2

BILLION WERE 13% HIGHER THAN IN 2007, WHICH IN TURN WERE 17% HIGHER THAN IN

2006. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR COMPOSITE RATES WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE THROUGH

2009 AS A RESULT OF DECREASED BENCHMARK RATES GLOBALLY. HOWEVER, THESE DECREASES

IN BENCHMARK RATES WILL BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CREDIT SPREADS AND FEES

ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES AND HIGHER CASH BALANCES RESULTING FROM

PRE-FUNDING OF DEBT MATURITIES AND THE NEED TO MAINTAIN GREATER LIQUIDITY IN THE

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. SEE THE LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS SECTION FOR A DISCUSSION

OF LIQUIDITY, BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT.

INCOME TAXES

ARE A SIGNIFICANT

COST. AS A GLOBAL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, OUR TAX RATES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MIX OF EARNINGS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE GLOBAL

EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, LEGISLATION,

ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND TAX CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR INCOME. OUR TAX

RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED AND SETTLEMENTS OF ISSUES RAISED IN THESE AUDITS

SOMETIMES AFFECT OUR TAX PROVISIONS.

INCOME

TAXES ON CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE 5.5% IN 2008

COMPARED WITH 15.6% IN 2007 AND 16.9% IN 2006. OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE

DECREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A REDUCTION DURING 2008 OF

INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCREASED THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF TAX

BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS ON THE TAX RATE. IN ADDITION,

EARNINGS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008. THE

INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCLUDES A BENEFIT

FROM THE 2008 DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST, OUTSIDE THE U.S., PRIOR-YEAR

EARNINGS BECAUSE THE USE OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS NO LONGER REQUIRED THE

REPATRIATION OF THOSE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS.

OUR

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2006 TO 2007 AS THE TAX BENEFIT ON

THE DISPOSITION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN SES AND AN INCREASE IN FAVORABLE

SETTLEMENTS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES MORE THAN OFFSET A DECREASE IN THE BENEFIT FROM

LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WHICH IN 2006 INCLUDED ONE-TIME TAX

BENEFITS FROM PLANNING TO USE NON-U.S. TAX NET OPERATING LOSSES.

A MORE

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND THE

CONSOLIDATED RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS,

IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM

8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT. THE

NATURE OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ASSOCIATED INCOME TAXES DIFFER FOR GE AND FOR

GECS AND A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF EACH IS PRESENTED IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT

FOLLOW.

BECAUSE

GE TAX EXPENSE DOES NOT INCLUDE TAXES ON GECS EARNINGS, THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE IS BEST ANALYZED IN RELATION TO GE EARNINGS EXCLUDING GECS. GE PRE-TAX

EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING GECS EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS, WERE $13.7 BILLION, $12.8 BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION FOR 2008, 2007

AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. ON THIS BASIS, GE’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 24.9% IN

2008, 21.8% IN 2007 AND 21.9% IN 2006.

RESOLUTION

OF AUDIT MATTERS REDUCED THE GE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD. THE

EFFECTS OF SUCH RESOLUTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING CAPTIONS IN NOTE 7 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

THE GE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008 BECAUSE OF THE 4.5 PERCENTAGE

POINT LOWER 2008 BENEFIT FROM FAVORABLE AUDIT RESOLUTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT IN LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL

OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.

(25)

THE GE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECLINED SLIGHTLY FROM 2006 TO 2007 BECAUSE THE 3.5

PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER 2007 BENEFIT FROM FAVORABLE AUDIT RESOLUTIONS WAS

LARGELY OFFSET BY A 3.3 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE BENEFIT IN LOWER-TAXED

EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING AUDIT RESOLUTIONS AND THE EFFECT OF

TAX LAW CHANGES. THE 2006 BENEFIT FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS

FROM PLANNING TO USE NON-U.S. NET OPERATING LOSSES AGAINST PROFITABLE

OPERATIONS.

THE 2006

GE RATE REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE AUDIT RESOLUTIONS SHOWN ABOVE AND THE BENEFIT OF

LOWER-TAXED EARNINGS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS INCLUDING TAX BENEFITS FROM PLANNING

TO USE NON-U.S. NET OPERATING LOSSES AGAINST PROFITABLE OPERATIONS.

THE GECS

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS (44.0)% IN 2008, COMPARED WITH 9.9% IN 2007 AND 12.0% IN

2006. GE AND GECS FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN THAT

ENABLES GE TO USE GECS TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS TO REDUCE THE TAX THAT

OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE BY GE. THE GECS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR EACH

PERIOD REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF THESE TAX REDUCTIONS. GE MAKES CASH PAYMENTS TO

GECS FOR THESE TAX REDUCTIONS AT THE TIME GE’S TAX PAYMENTS ARE

DUE.

THE GECS

RATE DECREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF A REDUCTION DURING 2008 OF

INCOME IN HIGHER-TAXED JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCREASED THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF TAX

BENEFITS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS ON THE TAX RATE, REDUCING THE RATE

32.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION, EARNINGS FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS

INCREASED FROM 2007 TO 2008, CAUSING AN ADDITIONAL 20.7 PERCENTAGE POINT RATE

REDUCTION. THE INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL OPERATIONS

INCLUDES 6.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE 2008 DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST,

OUTSIDE THE U.S., PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS BECAUSE THE USE OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS NO

LONGER REQUIRED THE REPATRIATION OF THOSE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS.

THE GECS

INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2006 TO 2007 AS THE TAX BENEFIT ON THE

DISPOSITION OF ITS INVESTMENT IN SES AND GROWTH IN LOWER-TAXED GLOBAL EARNINGS,

WHICH DECREASED THE GECS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 4.0 AND 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO U.S.

AND NON-U.S. AUDIT ACTIVITY AND FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE 2006 BENEFIT OF THE

REORGANIZATION, DISCUSSED BELOW, OF OUR AIRCRAFT LEASING BUSINESS, WHICH

INCREASED THE RATE 1.6 AND 1.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A

RESULT OF THE REPEAL OF THE EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME (ETI) TAXING REGIME AS PART

OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT), OUR AIRCRAFT LEASING

BUSINESS NO LONGER QUALIFIES FOR A REDUCED U.S. TAX RATE. HOWEVER, THE ACT ALSO

EXTENDED TO AIRCRAFT LEASING THE U.S. TAX DEFERRAL BENEFITS THAT WERE ALREADY

AVAILABLE TO OTHER GE NON-U.S. ACTIVE OPERATIONS. THESE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES,

COUPLED WITH A REORGANIZATION OF OUR AIRCRAFT LEASING BUSINESS AND A FAVORABLE

IRISH RULING, DECREASED THE GECS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 1.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN

2006.

GLOBAL

RISK MANAGEMENT

A

DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO RISK IS IMPORTANT IN A DIVERSIFIED ORGANIZATION SUCH AS

OURS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE EXECUTING ACCORDING TO OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES AND THAT WE ONLY ACCEPT RISK FOR WHICH WE ARE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED.

IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO MANAGE RISK AT THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION LEVEL, AND

TO CONSIDER AGGREGATE RISK AT THE CUSTOMER, INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AND

COLLATERAL-TYPE LEVELS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

THE GE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAINTAINS OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISK OVERSIGHT, WITH A

FOCUS ON THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS FACING GE. THE BOARD'S AUDIT COMMITTEE

OVERSEES GE’S RISK POLICIES AND PROCESSES RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS. THE BOARD'S PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES COMMITTEE

OVERSEES RISKS INVOLVED IN GE’S PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES, THE ENVIRONMENT AND

SIMILAR MATTERS. THE BOARD’S MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

OVERSEES RISK RELATED TO COMPENSATION.

(26)

THE

BOARD’S OVERSIGHT PROCESS BUILDS UPON OUR MANAGEMENT’S RISK MANAGEMENT AND

ASSESSMENT PROCESSES, WHICH INCLUDE LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING, EXECUTIVE

DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION, REGULATORY AND LITIGATION COMPLIANCE REVIEWS,

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE REVIEWS, GECS CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION AND THE CORPORATE

RISK COMMITTEE. EACH YEAR, MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD JOINTLY DEVELOP A LIST OF

MAJOR RISKS THAT GE PLANS TO ADDRESS. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EITHER THE BOARD OR

ONE OF ITS COMMITTEES DEDICATES A PORTION OF THEIR MEETINGS TO REVIEW AND

DISCUSS THESE RISK TOPICS IN GREATER DETAIL. STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS ARE

COVERED IN THE CEO’S REPORT ON OPERATIONS TO THE BOARD AT REGULARLY SCHEDULED

BOARD MEETINGS. AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RECEIVES A RISK

UPDATE FROM THE GECS RISK OFFICER, WHICH FOCUSES ON GECS RISK STRATEGY AND ITS

FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING ITS PROCESSES FOR MANAGING CREDIT AND

MARKET RISK WITHIN ITS PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, EACH YEAR, AND IN SOME YEARS MORE

FREQUENTLY, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RECEIVES A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT FROM GE’S

TREASURER ON GECS CAPITAL MARKETS EXPOSURE AND ITS LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISKS

AND A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT FROM GE’S GENERAL COUNSEL COVERING COMPLIANCE ISSUES.

EACH YEAR, THE COMMITTEE ALSO REVIEWS AND DISCUSSES TOPICS RELATED TO THE

FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS, INCLUDING AN UPDATE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,

CONTROLLERSHIP, INSURANCE, TAX STRATEGIES AND POLICIES, ACCOUNTING AND NUMEROUS

REPORTS ON REGULATION, COMPLIANCE, LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS AFFECTING GE

BUSINESSES.

THE GECS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OVERSEES THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, AND APPROVES ALL

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT BORROWINGS AND

INVESTMENTS. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS MUST COMPLY WITH

APPROVAL LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE GECS BOARD.

THE GECS

CHIEF RISK OFFICER IS RESPONSIBLE, WITH THE CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION, FOR

ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR THE MEASUREMENT, REPORTING AND LIMITING OF RISK; FOR

MANAGING AND EVALUATING RISK MANAGERS; FOR APPROVING RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES;

AND FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS ACROSS THE

ORGANIZATION. THE GECS CORPORATE RISK FUNCTION ANALYZES CERTAIN BUSINESS RISKS

AND ASSESSES THEM IN RELATION TO AGGREGATE RISK APPETITE AND APPROVAL LIMITS SET

BY THE GECS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THRESHOLD

RESPONSIBILITY FOR IDENTIFYING, QUANTIFYING AND MITIGATING RISKS IS ASSIGNED TO

OUR INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES. WE EMPLOY PROPRIETARY ANALYTIC MODELS TO ALLOCATE

CAPITAL TO OUR FINANCING ACTIVITIES, TO IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF RISK AND

TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF RISK WE WILL TAKE FOR EACH PRODUCT LINE. THIS APPROACH

ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP EARLY SIGNALS THAT MONITOR CHANGES IN RISK AFFECTING

PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AND ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO. OTHER CORPORATE

FUNCTIONS SUCH AS CONTROLLERSHIP, FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ANALYSIS, TREASURY,

LEGAL AND OUR CORPORATE AUDIT STAFF SUPPORT BUSINESS-LEVEL RISK MANAGEMENT.

BUSINESSES THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, HEDGE FINANCIAL RISK WITH DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS MUST DO SO USING OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED TREASURY FUNCTION, PROVIDING

ASSURANCE THAT THE BUSINESS STRATEGY COMPLIES WITH OUR CORPORATE POLICIES AND

ACHIEVES ECONOMIES OF SCALE. WE REVIEW RISKS PERIODICALLY WITH BUSINESS-LEVEL

RISK MANAGERS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

DEDICATED

RISK PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE BUSINESSES INCLUDE UNDERWRITERS, PORTFOLIO

MANAGERS, COLLECTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING SPECIALISTS, AND SPECIALIZED

ASSET MANAGERS WHO EVALUATE LEASED ASSET RESIDUALS AND REMARKET OFF-LEASE

EQUIPMENT. THE SENIOR RISK OFFICERS HAVE, ON AVERAGE, OVER 25 YEARS OF

EXPERIENCE.

WE

MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS INCLUDING LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET AND GOVERNMENT AND

REGULATORY RISKS.

·

LIQUIDITY

RISK IS THE RISK OF BEING UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE LIABILITY MATURITIES, FUND

ASSET GROWTH AND MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGH ACCESS TO FUNDING AT

REASONABLE MARKET RATES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR LIQUIDITY AND

HOW WE MANAGE THIS RISK CAN BE FOUND IN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND

LIQUIDITY SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN NOTES 18 AND 29 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

·

CREDIT

RISK IS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS ARISING FROM A CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY

FAILURE TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE FACE CREDIT RISK IN OUR

INVESTING, LENDING AND LEASING ACTIVITIES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ACTIVITIES (SEE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY AND

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTIONS OF THIS ITEM AND NOTES 1, 9, 12,

13, 29 AND 31 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

“FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT).

·

MARKET

RISK IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF INVESTMENT AND OTHER ASSET AND

LIABILITY PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RESIDUAL VALUES

OF LEASED ASSETS. THIS RISK IS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH

AS INTEREST AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND EQUITY AND COMMODITY PRICES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF OUR ONGOING INVESTING AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND

LIQUIDITY SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN NOTES 6, 9, 12, 14, 28 AND 29 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

(27)

·

GOVERNMENT

AND REGULATORY RISK IS THE RISK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES WILL IMPLEMENT NEW LAWS OR RULES, AMEND EXISTING LAWS OR

RULES, OR INTERPRET OR ENFORCE THEM IN WAYS THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO HAVE TO

CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS OR PRACTICES. WE MANAGE THESE RISKS THROUGH THE

GECS BOARD, OUR POLICY COMPLIANCE REVIEW BOARD AND OUR CORPORATE RISK

COMMITTEE.

OTHER

RISKS INCLUDE NATURAL DISASTERS, AVAILABILITY OF NECESSARY MATERIALS, GUARANTEES

OF PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. THESE TYPES OF RISKS ARE OFTEN

INSURABLE, AND SUCCESS IN MANAGING THESE RISKS IS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY THE

BALANCE BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF RISK RETAINED OR ASSUMED AND THE COST OF

TRANSFERRING RISK TO OTHERS.

OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT APPROACH HAS THE FOLLOWING MAJOR TENETS: A BROAD SPREAD OF RISK BASED

ON MANAGED EXPOSURE LIMITS; SENIOR, SECURED COMMERCIAL FINANCINGS; AND A HOLD TO

MATURITY MODEL WITH TRANSACTIONS UNDERWRITTEN TO OUR “ON-BOOK”

STANDARDS.

THE GECC

FINANCING PORTFOLIOS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 70% COMMERCIAL AND 30% CONSUMER RISK

ACTIVITIES, WITH 53% OF THE PORTFOLIO OUTSIDE THE U.S. EXPOSURE TO DEVELOPING

MARKETS IS 11% OF THE PORTFOLIO AND IS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR EASTERN EUROPEAN

BANKING OPERATIONS AND MEXICAN COMMERCIAL FINANCING ACTIVITIES - WHERE WE HAVE

OPERATED FOR OVER 10 YEARS - AND VARIOUS MINORITY OWNED JOINT

VENTURES.

THE

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO HAS A MAXIMUM SINGLE INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION OF 6%,

EXCLUDING THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT FINANCING AND THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE

BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE DIVERSIFIED SEPARATELY WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE PORTFOLIOS.

67% OF ALL COMMERCIAL EXPOSURES ARE LESS THAN $100 MILLION TO ANY ONE CUSTOMER,

WHILE 55% ARE LESS THAN $50 MILLION. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT FINANCING BUSINESS

OWNS 1,494 AIRCRAFT – 56% ARE NARROW BODY PLANES AND PREDOMINANTLY NEWER,

HIGH-DEMAND MODELS, WHILE ONLY 15% ARE SMALLER REGIONAL JETS AND OLDER BOEING

737 CLASSIC AIRCRAFT. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE FLEET IS 7 YEARS AND OUR CUSTOMERS

INCLUDE OVER 230 AIRLINES LOCATED IN 70 COUNTRIES. LEASED COLLATERAL REPRESENTS

ASSET TYPES WE HAVE OVER 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE MANAGING.

THE

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BUSINESS CONSISTS OF A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO,

A REAL ESTATE LENDING PORTFOLIO, AND A SINGLE TENANT FINANCING PORTFOLIO. THE

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT AND LENDING PORTFOLIOS ARE GLOBAL AND CONSIST OF

APPROXIMATELY 8,000 INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES IN 2,600 CITIES IN 31 COUNTRIES WITH

AN AVERAGE PROPERTY INVESTMENT OF UNDER $10 MILLION.

·

OUR

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 3,200 PROPERTIES

LOCATED IN 900 CITIES AND 22 COUNTRIES, WITH 71% OF THIS PORTFOLIO OUTSIDE

THE U.S., PRIMARILY LOCATED IN EUROPE, THE U.K., ASIA, CANADA AND MEXICO,

ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF PROPERTY TYPES INCLUDING OFFICE,

INDUSTRIAL/WAREHOUSE, AND

MULTIFAMILY.

·

OUR

REAL ESTATE LENDING PORTFOLIO IS SECURED BY APPROXIMATELY 4,800 PROPERTIES

IN 1,900 CITIES AND 25 COUNTRIES, WITH 44% OF THE ASSETS SECURING THIS

PORTFOLIO LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF PROPERTY

TYPES INCLUDING OFFICE, MULTIFAMILY AND

HOTEL.

·

THE

SINGLE TENANT FINANCING PORTFOLIO HAS APPROXIMATELY 4,200 PROPERTIES IN

1,360 CITIES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND AN AVERAGE LOAN SIZE UNDER $3

MILLION.

THE U.S.

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO INCLUDES PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD AND SALES FINANCING FOR

OVER 56 MILLION CONSUMERS. THE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE U.S. AND

NO METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN 4% OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE

AVERAGE CREDIT LINE FOR THE PRIVATE LABEL PORTFOLIO IS $600. THE NON-U.S.

PORTFOLIO ACCOUNTS FOR 80% OF ALL CONSUMER RISK ACTIVITIES AND INCLUDES CONSUMER

MORTGAGES, AUTO LOANS, PERSONAL LOANS AND CREDIT CARD FINANCING IN 43 COUNTRIES.

WESTERN EUROPE, THE U.K., EASTERN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND ARE THE

PRIMARY NON-U.S. MARKETS. MORTGAGES REPRESENT 43% OF THE TOTAL CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO. THE AVERAGE LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) AT ORIGINATION OF THE TOTAL GLOBAL

MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO IS APPROXIMATELY 74%. WESTERN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND NEW

ZEALAND, IRELAND AND THE U.K. ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE MORTGAGE

BOOK. GE EMPLOYEES UNDERWRITE ALL MORTGAGES AND ORIGINATE TO HOLD ALL MORTGAGES

ON BOOK. WE EXITED THE U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS IN 2007.

THE U.K.

MORTGAGE BUSINESS TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING CRITERIA THROUGHOUT 2008 AND REDUCED

VOLUME BY 54% IN RESPONSE TO THE WEAKENING HOME PRICE ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.K.

SINCE MID-2006, THE FIRST MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED IN THE U.K. THAT WERE

GREATER THAN 80% LTV ARE COVERED BY PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR THE MORTGAGE

BALANCE IN EXCESS OF 80%. INSURED MORTGAGES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 73% OF THE

PORTFOLIO ABOVE 80% LTV AT ORIGINATION.

THE

AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND MORTGAGES ARE GENERALLY PRIME CREDIT, AND 94% OF THE

PORTFOLIO IS COVERED BY PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE

MORTGAGE, WHICH IS CUSTOMARY IN THIS MARKET.

(28)

THE

FRENCH MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO IS GENERALLY PRIME CREDIT, AND 29% IS INSURED FOR

MORTGAGE LOANS GREATER THAN 80% LTV (FOR THE MORTGAGE BALANCE IN EXCESS OF

80%).

FINANCIAL

RESULTS OF OUR GLOBAL ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS ARE AFFECTED BY

CURRENCY EXCHANGE. WE USE A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES TO MANAGE THE EFFECTS OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE, INCLUDING SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND

SELECTIVE HEDGING OF SIGNIFICANT CROSS-CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. SUCH PRINCIPAL

CURRENCIES ARE THE POUND STERLING, THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE CANADIAN

DOLLAR.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

OUR

OPERATIONS, LIKE OPERATIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES,

INVOLVE THE USE, DISPOSAL AND CLEANUP OF SUBSTANCES REGULATED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A SIZABLE NUMBER OF

REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS. SUCH STATUTES REQUIRE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FUND REMEDIATION

ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF FAULT, LEGALITY OF ORIGINAL DISPOSAL OR OWNERSHIP OF A

DISPOSAL SITE. EXPENDITURES FOR SITE REMEDIATION ACTIONS AMOUNTED TO

APPROXIMATELY $0.3 BILLION IN 2008 AND $0.2 BILLION IN 2007. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT

THAT SUCH REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURES IN THE

RANGE OF $0.3 BILLION TO $0.4 BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

IN

NOVEMBER 2006, THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT APPROVED A CONSENT

DECREE, WHICH HAD BEEN AGREED TO BY GE AND THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), THAT REPRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EPA’S 2002 DECISION TO DREDGE POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL

(PCB)-CONTAINING SEDIMENTS IN THE UPPER HUDSON RIVER. THE DREDGING WILL BE

PERFORMED IN TWO PHASES WITH AN INTERVENING PEER REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE AFTER THE

FIRST PHASE. UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO REIMBURSE THE EPA

FOR ITS PAST AND FUTURE PROJECT OVERSIGHT COSTS AND TO PERFORM THE FIRST PHASE

OF DREDGING, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO PROCEED FROM MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2009.

AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PEER REVIEW, CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR 2010, WE MAY BE

RESPONSIBLE FOR FURTHER COSTS. OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, INCLUDED LIABILITIES FOR THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE

COSTS OF THE AGREED UPON REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES.

STATEMENT. WITHIN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GE

AND GECS ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO PERMIT MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL

CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

COMPRISE

MAINLY INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT SECURITIES SUPPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO ANNUITANTS AND

POLICYHOLDERS IN OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND HOLDERS OF GUARANTEED

INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (GICS). INVESTMENT SECURITIES AMOUNTED TO $41.4 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED WITH $45.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. OF THE

AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HELD DEBT SECURITIES WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF $33.9 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

(RMBS) AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS) WITH ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES OF $4.3 BILLION AND $2.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON DEBT

SECURITIES WERE $5.4 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND DECEMBER

31, 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON RMBS AND CMBS

OF $1.1 BILLION AND $0.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2008, AS COMPARED WITH $0.2

BILLION AND AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT, RESPECTIVELY, AT THE END OF 2007.

UNREALIZED LOSSES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING MARKET DETERIORATION, AND

WE BELIEVE PRIMARILY REPRESENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR LIQUIDITY ON INVESTMENT-GRADE

SECURITIES.

OF THE

$4.3 BILLION OF RMBS, OUR EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME CREDIT WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3

BILLION, AND THOSE SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY HELD TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS TO

HOLDERS OF GICS. A MAJORITY OF THESE SECURITIES HAVE RECEIVED INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. WE PURCHASED NO SUCH SECURITIES

IN 2008 AND AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUCH SECURITIES IN 2007. THESE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED PRIMARILY BY POOLS OF INDIVIDUAL DIRECT-MORTGAGE

LOANS, AND DO NOT INCLUDE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, A MAJORITY OF OUR EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME

CREDIT RELATED TO INVESTMENT SECURITIES BACKED BY MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED IN

2006 AND 2005.

WE

REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND

MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION

AND, FOR SECURITIES WITH FIXED MATURITIES, WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE

WITH TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. QUALITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE

FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, AS WELL AS OUR INTENT

AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY TO MATURITY OR UNTIL FORECASTED RECOVERY. IN

ADDITION, OUR EVALUATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, CONSIDERED THE CONTINUING MARKET

DETERIORATION THAT RESULTED IN THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND THE HISTORIC LEVELS OF

PRICE VOLATILITY AND CREDIT SPREADS. WITH RESPECT TO CORPORATE BONDS, WE PLACED

GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE ISSUERS. WITH RESPECT TO RMBS AND

CMBS, WE PLACED GREATER EMPHASIS ON OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CASH FLOWS

FROM THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND, WITH RESPECT TO RMBS, WE CONSIDERED THE

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS, PRINCIPALLY MONOLINE INSURANCE. OUR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INVOLVE OUR FINANCE, RISK AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGERS.

WHEN AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED FOR A DEBT SECURITY, THE CHARGE

HAS TWO COMPONENTS: (1) THE LOSS OF CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS DUE TO THE INABILITY

OF THE ISSUER (OR THE INSURER, IF APPLICABLE) TO PAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE; AND (2)

THE EFFECTS OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, EXCLUSIVE OF CREDIT LOSSES, ON THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITY (PRINCIPALLY LIQUIDITY DISCOUNTS AND INTEREST RATE

EFFECTS). IF THE EXPECTED LOSS DUE TO CREDIT REMAINS UNCHANGED FOR THE REMAINING

TERM OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT, THE LATTER PORTION OF THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

SUBSEQUENTLY ACCRETED TO EARNINGS AS INTEREST INCOME OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF

THE INSTRUMENT. WHEN A SECURITY IS INSURED, A CREDIT LOSS EVENT IS DEEMED TO

HAVE OCCURRED IF THE INSURER IS EXPECTED TO BE UNABLE TO COVER ITS OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE RELATED INSURANCE CONTRACT.

(38)

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES TOTALED $1.6 BILLION IN 2008 AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2007. IN

2008, WE RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO

RETAINED INTERESTS IN OUR SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS, RMBS AND CORPORATE DEBT

SECURITIES OF INFRASTRUCTURE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MEDIA COMPANIES. IN

2007, WE RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR OUR RETAINED

INTERESTS IN OUR SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS. INVESTMENTS IN RETAINED INTERESTS

IN SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS ALSO DECREASED BY $0.1 BILLION DURING 2008,

REFLECTING DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF 2007.

MONOLINE

INSURERS (MONOLINES) PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENT

SECURITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES INSURED BY MONOLINES

TOTALED $3.1 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.1 BILLION OF OUR $1.3 BILLION INVESTMENT IN

SUBPRIME RMBS. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE MONOLINES HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED BY THE

RATING AGENCIES, A MAJORITY OF THE $3.1 BILLION IS INSURED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE

MONOLINES. THE MONOLINE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL STRESS FROM

INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL LOANS UNDERLYING INSURED

SECURITIES. WE REGULARLY MONITOR CHANGES TO THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF THE

SECURITIES WE HOLD, AND THE ABILITY OF THESE INSURERS TO PAY CLAIMS ON

SECURITIES WITH EXPECTED LOSSES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, IF THE MONOLINES WERE

UNABLE TO PAY OUR ANTICIPATED CLAIMS BASED ON THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF

THE SECURITIES, WE WOULD HAVE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.3 BILLION, OF

WHICH $0.1 BILLION WOULD RELATE TO EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND THE REMAINING $0.2

BILLION WOULD RELATE TO OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

OUR

QUALITATIVE REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY ISSUERS’ SECURITIES THAT ARE “AT-RISK”

OF IMPAIRMENT, THAT IS, WITH A POSSIBILITY OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

RECOGNITION IN THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS. OF SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, $0.7 BILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSS WAS AT RISK OF BEING CHARGED

TO EARNINGS ASSUMING NO FURTHER CHANGES IN PRICE, AND THAT AMOUNT PRIMARILY

RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN RMBS AND CMBS SECURITIES, EQUITY SECURITIES,

SECURITIZATION RETAINED INTERESTS, AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND MEDIA COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION

OF EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL, REGIONAL AND FOREIGN BANKS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, WITH ASSOCIATED UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $0.4 BILLION.

CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY CAUSE INCREASED LEVELS OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES TOTALED $5.7

BILLION, INCLUDING $3.5 BILLION AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER, COMPARED WITH

UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $1.3 BILLION, INCLUDING $0.5 BILLION AGED 12 MONTHS OR

LONGER AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. OF THE AMOUNT AGED 12 MONTHS OR LONGER AT DECEMBER

31, 2008, MORE THAN 80% OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE

INVESTMENT-GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, OF THE AMOUNT AGED

12 MONTHS OR LONGER, $1.9 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION RELATED TO STRUCTURED

SECURITIES (MORTGAGE-BACKED, ASSET-BACKED AND SECURITIZATION RETAINED INTERESTS)

AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENT

SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE

INTEND TO HOLD THEM AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAIR VALUES

EXCEED THEIR AMORTIZED COST AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD ALL SUCH DEBT

SECURITIES UNTIL THEIR MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUES USED TO DETERMINE THESE

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE THOSE DEFINED BY RELEVANT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

AND ARE NOT A FORECAST OF FUTURE GAINS OR LOSSES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,

SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

, FOR

ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER,

OUR METHODOLOGY REMAINED CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR QUARTERS FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE

OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TRADING IN VOLATILE MARKETS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ABOUT OUR APPLICATION OF SFAS 157 IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 28 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

WORKING CAPITAL

, REPRESENTING

GE CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, LESS GE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND PROGRESS

COLLECTIONS, WAS $3.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, DOWN $2.5 BILLION FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2007, REFLECTING HIGHER PROGRESS COLLECTIONS AT ENERGY. AS

ENERGY DELIVERS UNITS OUT OF ITS BACKLOG OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PROGRESS

COLLECTIONS OF $13.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WILL BE EARNED, AFFECTING

WORKING CAPITAL ADVERSELY. NONETHELESS, OUR PERFORMANCE IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE

IN 2009 AS A RESULT OF OUR OPERATING COUNCIL’S INITIATIVES (E.G., LEAN PROJECTS

ON CYCLE TIME), WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET THE DECREASE IN PROGRESS

COLLECTIONS.

WE

DISCUSS CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, TWO IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF WORKING

CAPITAL, IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

(39)

CURRENT RECEIVABLES

FOR GE

AMOUNTED TO $15.1 BILLION AT BOTH THE END OF 2008 AND 2007, AND INCLUDED $11.3

BILLION DUE FROM CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF 2008 COMPARED WITH $11.0 BILLION AT THE

END OF 2007. GE CURRENT RECEIVABLES TURNOVER WAS 7.5 IN 2008, COMPARED WITH 7.3

IN 2007. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM

8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

INVENTORIES

FOR GE AMOUNTED TO

$13.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, UP $0.8 BILLION FROM THE END OF 2007.

THIS INCREASE REFLECTED HIGHER INVENTORIES FROM PURCHASES AT ENERGY

INFRASTRUCTURE. GE INVENTORY TURNOVER WAS 8.0 AND 8.3 IN 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES

IS OUR

LARGEST CATEGORY OF ASSETS AND REPRESENTS ONE OF OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF

REVENUES. A DISCUSSION OF THE QUALITY OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE FINANCING

RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO FOLLOWS. FOR PURPOSES OF THAT DISCUSSION, “DELINQUENT”

RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE; AND “NONEARNING”

RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE (OR FOR WHICH COLLECTION

HAS OTHERWISE BECOME DOUBTFUL).

OUR

PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS DIVERSE AND NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO

MAJOR U.S. BANKS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE HAD LESS CONSUMER EXPOSURE, WHICH OVER

TIME HAS HAD HIGHER LOSS RATES THAN COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE. OUR CONSUMER EXPOSURE

IS LARGELY NON-U.S. AND PRIMARILY COMPRISES MORTGAGE, SALES FINANCE, AUTO AND

PERSONAL LOANS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN AND ASIAN COUNTRIES. OUR U.S. CONSUMER

FINANCING RECEIVABLES COMPRISE 7% OF OUR TOTAL PORTFOLIO. OF THOSE,

APPROXIMATELY 42% RELATE PRIMARILY TO CREDIT CARDS, WHICH ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO

PROFIT AND LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RETAILER (THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE

REFLECTED IN GECS REVENUES), AND HAVE A SMALLER AVERAGE BALANCE AND LOWER LOSS

SEVERITY AS COMPARED TO BANK CARDS. THE REMAINING 58% ARE SALES FINANCE

RECEIVABLES, WHICH PROVIDE ELECTRONICS, RECREATION, MEDICAL AND HOME IMPROVEMENT

FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS. IN 2007, WE EXITED THE U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS AND WE

HAVE NO U.S. AUTO OR STUDENT LOANS.

OUR

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY COMPRISES SENIOR, SECURED POSITIONS WITH

COMPARATIVELY LOW LOSS HISTORY. THE SECURED RECEIVABLES IN THIS PORTFOLIO ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF ASSET CLASSES, INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL-RELATED

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT; COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE; VEHICLES,

AIRCRAFT, AND EQUIPMENT USED IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION,

MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES. IN

ADDITION, 2% OF THIS PORTFOLIO IS UNSECURED CORPORATE DEBT.

LOSSES

ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES

US TO MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. SUCH

ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR

CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT

OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY

RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL

VALUES, AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK

EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS, AND EVALUATES RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR INDIVIDUAL

LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE

MAJORITY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES OF $5.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND

$4.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, IS DETERMINED BASED UPON A FORMULAIC

APPROACH. FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES

ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES IS PROVIDED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

SECTION IN PART II, ITEM 7. “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” AND NOTES 1 AND 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

A

PORTION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IS RELATED TO SPECIFIC RESERVES ON LOANS

THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED UNDER SFAS 114,

ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR

IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN

. UNDER SFAS 114, INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED LOANS ARE

DEFINED AS LARGER BALANCE OR RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT

THE LENDER WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO ORIGINAL

CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. THESE SPECIFIC RESERVES AMOUNT TO $0.6

BILLION AND $0.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007,

THE

PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, WAS $377.8

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND $388.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. FINANCING

RECEIVABLES, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES, DECREASED $10.5 BILLION FROM DECEMBER

31, 2007, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF COMMERCIAL AND EQUIPMENT SECURITIZATION AND

SALES ($36.7 BILLION), THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR ($29.4 BILLION) AND DISPOSITIONS

($7.0 BILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CORE GROWTH ($42.9 BILLION) AND ACQUISITIONS

($31.9 BILLION).

RELATED

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES TOTALED $8.0 BILLION (2.1% OF OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES) AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED WITH $5.5 BILLION (1.4% OF OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. RELATED NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31,

2007, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, ALONG WITH THE INCREASINGLY

CHALLENGING GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TOTALED $5.3 BILLION COMPARED WITH

$4.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, REPRESENTING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO AND REFLECTING THE THEN CURRENT CREDIT AND

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES INCREASED $1.1 BILLION FROM DECEMBER

31, 2007, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND NONEARNING

RECEIVABLES REFLECTING THE CONTINUED WEAKENED ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

COINCIDENT WITH THE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT, WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

DELINQUENCIES IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2008, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. AS

THE ENVIRONMENT WORSENED IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR, WE RECOGNIZED

PROVISIONS ACCORDINGLY.

CLL – EQUIPMENT AND LEASING AND

OTHER.

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $1.5 BILLION REPRESENTED 19.1% OF TOTAL

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES

AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DECLINED FROM 70.4% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

TO 58.6% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN SECURED EXPOSURES

WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE SPECIFIC RESERVES BASED UPON THE STRENGTH OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL VALUES.

CLL – COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL.

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $1.1 BILLION REPRESENTED 14.1% OF TOTAL

2007, TO 36.8% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE RATIO OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AS A

PERCENTAGE OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 1.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, TO

1.8% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN NONEARNING RECEIVABLES

IN SECURED LENDING IN MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS, AUTO AND TRANSPORTATION, AND

CONSUMER MANUFACTURING COMPANIES.

GE MONEY – NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGES.

NONEARNING RECEIVABLES OF $3.3 BILLION REPRESENTED 41.5% OF

TOTAL NONEARNING RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 10.0% AT DECEMBER

31, 2007, TO 11.5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. OUR NON-U.S. MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO HAS A

LOAN-TO-VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 74% AT ORIGINATION AND THE VAST MAJORITY ARE

FIRST LIEN POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE CARRY MORTGAGE INSURANCE ON MOST FIRST

MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED AT A LOAN-TO-VALUE ABOVE 80%. IN 2008, OUR NONEARNING

RECEIVABLES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINING U.K. HOUSING MARKET

AND OUR ALLOWANCE INCREASED ACCORDINGLY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD FORECLOSED

ON FEWER THAN 1,000 HOUSES IN THE U.K.

GE MONEY – U.S. INSTALLMENT AND

LOSSES AS A PERCENT OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM 191.3% AT DECEMBER

31, 2007, TO 224.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, REFLECTING THE EFFECTS OF THE

CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN OUR U.S. PORTFOLIO IN CONNECTION WITH RISING

UNEMPLOYMENT.

OF NONEARNING RECEIVABLES DECREASED FROM 432.0% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, TO 267.5%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THIS IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE DISPOSITION OF OUR

THAILAND AUTO BUSINESS, THE DECISION TO DISPOSE OF OUR U.K. AUTO BUSINESS, AND

THE EFFECTS OF RECOVERIES.

DELINQUENCY

RATES ON EQUIPMENT FINANCING LOANS AND LEASES INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007,

AND DECEMBER 31, 2006, TO DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE

INCLUSION OF THE CITICAPITAL ACQUISITION AND SANYO ACQUISITION IN JAPAN, WHICH

CONTRIBUTED AN ADDITIONAL 12 AND 9 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, AS WELL AS DETERIORATION IN OUR U.S. COMMERCIAL MIDDLE MARKET AND CERTAIN

EUROPEAN PORTFOLIOS. THE CURRENT FINANCIAL MARKET TURMOIL AND TIGHT CREDIT

CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE TO LEAD TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL DELINQUENCIES

AND PROVISIONS FOR FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AT CLL.

DELINQUENCY

RATES ON CONSUMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND

DECEMBER 31, 2006, TO DECEMBER 31, 2008, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF RISING

UNEMPLOYMENT, AN INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND LOWER VOLUME.

THIS HAS RESULTED IN CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN OUR U.S. AND U.K. PORTFOLIOS. IN

RESPONSE, GE MONEY HAS CONTINUED TO TIGHTEN UNDERWRITING STANDARDS GLOBALLY,

INCREASED FOCUS ON COLLECTION EFFECTIVENESS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS PROCESS OF

REGULARLY REVIEWING AND ADJUSTING RESERVE LEVELS. WE EXPECT THE GLOBAL

ENVIRONMENT, ALONG WITH U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, TO CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE IN

2009, WHICH MAY RESULT IN HIGHER PROVISIONS FOR LOAN LOSSES AND COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT GE MONEY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, ROUGHLY 40% OF

OUR U.S.-MANAGED PORTFOLIO, WHICH CONSISTED OF CREDIT CARDS, INSTALLMENT AND

REVOLVING LOANS, WAS RECEIVABLE FROM SUBPRIME BORROWERS. WE HAD NO U.S. SUBPRIME

(44)

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS

TOTALED $81.8 BILLION AND $15.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER

31, 2008. GOODWILL INCREASED $0.6 BILLION FROM 2007, PRIMARILY FROM ACQUISITIONS

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $0.2 BILLION RELATING TO OUR COST METHOD INVESTMENT IN

FGIC CORPORATION DURING 2008. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF

THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

LIQUIDITY

AND BORROWINGS

WE

MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY TO HELP ENSURE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT FUNDING AT ACCEPTABLE

COSTS TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGHOUT BUSINESS

CYCLES. WE RELY ON CASH GENERATED THROUGH OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS

UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, TERM DEBT,

BANK DEPOSITS, BANK BORROWINGS, SECURITIZATION AND OTHER RETAIL FUNDING

PRODUCTS.

THE

GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED VOLATILITY, WHICH

HAS AFFECTED BOTH THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF OUR FUNDING SOURCES. IN THIS

CURRENT VOLATILE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES TO

STRENGTHEN OUR LIQUIDITY, MAINTAIN OUR DIVIDEND, AND MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST CREDIT

RATINGS. SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE.

·

REDUCED

THE GECS DIVIDEND TO GE FROM 40% TO 10% OF GECS EARNINGS AND SUSPENDED OUR

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

·

RAISED

$15 BILLION IN CASH THROUGH COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK OFFERINGS IN

OCTOBER 2008 AND CONTRIBUTED $5.5 BILLION TO GE CAPITAL. IN FEBRUARY 2009,

THE GE BOARD AUTHORIZED A CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION OF UP TO $9.5 BILLION TO GE

CAPITAL, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE MADE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2009.

·

REDUCED

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AT GECS TO $72 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008.

·

TARGETED

TO FURTHER REDUCE GECS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS TO $50 BILLION BY THE

END OF 2009 AND TO TARGET COMMITTED CREDIT LINES EQUAL TO GECS COMMERCIAL

PAPER BORROWINGS GOING FORWARD.

·

GROWN

OUR ALTERNATIVE FUNDING TO $54 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, INCLUDING $36

BILLION OF BANK DEPOSITS.

·

REGISTERED

TO USE THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY (CPFF) FOR

UP TO $98 BILLION, WHICH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH OCTOBER 31,

2009.

·

REGISTERED

TO USE THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION’S (FDIC) TEMPORARY

LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP) FOR APPROXIMATELY $126

BILLION.

·

AT

GECS, WE ARE MANAGING COLLECTIONS VERSUS ORIGINATIONS TO HELP SUPPORT

LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND ARE ESTIMATING $25 BILLION OF EXCESS COLLECTIONS IN

2009.

THROUGHOUT

THIS PERIOD OF VOLATILITY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MEET OUR FUNDING

NEEDS AT ACCEPTABLE COSTS. WE CONTINUE TO ACCESS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS

WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.

DURING

2008, GECS AND ITS AFFILIATES ISSUED $84.3 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED

LONG-TERM DEBT. THIS DEBT WAS BOTH FIXED AND FLOATING RATE AND WAS ISSUED TO

INSTITUTIONAL AND RETAIL INVESTORS IN THE U.S. AND 17 OTHER GLOBAL MARKETS.

MATURITIES FOR THESE ISSUANCES RANGED FROM ONE TO 40 YEARS.

(45)

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE FDIC ADOPTED THE TLGP TO ADDRESS DISRUPTIONS IN

THE CREDIT MARKET, PARTICULARLY THE INTERBANK LENDING MARKET, WHICH REDUCED

BANKS’ LIQUIDITY AND IMPAIRED THEIR ABILITY TO LEND. THE GOAL OF THE TLGP IS TO

DECREASE THE COST OF BANK FUNDING SO THAT BANK LENDING TO CONSUMERS AND

BUSINESSES WILL NORMALIZE. THE TLGP GUARANTEES CERTAIN NEWLY ISSUED SENIOR,

UNSECURED DEBT OF BANKS, THRIFTS, AND CERTAIN HOLDING COMPANIES. UNDER THE

FDIC’S FINAL RULE ADOPTED ON NOVEMBER 21, 2008, CERTAIN SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT

ISSUED BEFORE JUNE 30, 2009, WITH A MATURITY OF GREATER THAN 30 DAYS THAT

MATURES ON OR PRIOR TO JUNE 30, 2012, IS AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM.

GECC HAS ELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

PROGRAM RANGE FROM 50 TO 100 BASIS POINTS ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS AND VARY

ACCORDING TO THE MATURITY OF THE DEBT ISSUANCE. GECC ALSO PAYS AN ADDITIONAL 10

BASIS POINTS, AS IT IS NOT AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. ON FEBRUARY 10,

2009, IN A JOINT STATEMENT, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FDIC, THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

(OTS) ANNOUNCED THAT, FOR AN ADDITIONAL PREMIUM, THE FDIC WILL EXTEND THE DEBT

GUARANTEE PROGRAM OF THE TLGP THROUGH OCTOBER 2009.

INCLUDED

IN GECS ISSUANCES ABOVE IS $13.4 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT

ISSUED BY GECC IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 UNDER THE TLGP WITH VARYING

MATURITIES UP TO JUNE 30, 2012. ADDITIONALLY, GECC HAD COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $21.8

BILLION OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHICH WAS ISSUED UNDER THE TLGP (WHICH

IS REQUIRED FOR ALL COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 30

DAYS).

IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, GE CAPITAL EXTENDED $21.8 BILLION OF CREDIT TO U.S.

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING 5 MILLION NEW ACCOUNTS, AND $7.7 BILLION OF CREDIT

(INCLUDING UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS OF $2.5 BILLION) TO U.S. COMPANIES, WITH AN

AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE OF $2.4 MILLION.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, GECS ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER INTO THE CPFF. THE LAST

TRANCHE OF THIS COMMERCIAL PAPER MATURES IN FEBRUARY 2009. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE FURTHER UTILIZATION OF THE CPFF, IT REMAINS AVAILABLE UNTIL OCTOBER

31, 2009. WE INCURRED $0.6 BILLION OF FEES FOR OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE TLGP AND

CPFF PROGRAMS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2008.

OUR 2009

FUNDING PLAN ANTICIPATES APPROXIMATELY $45 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED

LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCE. IN JANUARY 2009, WE COMPLETED ISSUANCES OF $11.0

BILLION FUNDING UNDER THE TLGP. WE ALSO ISSUED $5.1 BILLION IN NON-GUARANTEED

SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT WITH A MATURITY OF 30 YEARS UNDER THE NON-GUARANTEE

OPTION OF THE TLGP. THESE ISSUANCES, ALONG WITH THE $13.4 BILLION OF PRE-FUNDING

DONE IN DECEMBER 2008, BRING OUR AGGREGATE ISSUANCES TO $29.5 BILLION OR 66% OF

OUR ANTICIPATED 2009 FUNDING PLAN. ADDITIONALLY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE

90% COMPLETE WITH OUR 2009 FUNDING PLAN BY JUNE 30, 2009.

WE

MAINTAIN SECURITIZATION CAPABILITY IN MOST OF THE ASSET CLASSES WE HAVE

TRADITIONALLY SECURITIZED. HOWEVER, THESE CAPABILITIES HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE

TO BE, MORE LIMITED THAN IN 2007. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EXECUTE NEW

SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZING BANK COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS. SECURITIZATION

PROCEEDS WERE $17.8 BILLION AND $76.8 BILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS AND THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARABLE AMOUNTS WERE $23.4

BILLION AND $84.4 BILLION, FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2007, RESPECTIVELY.

WE HAVE

SUCCESSFULLY GROWN OUR ALTERNATIVE FUNDING TO $54 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

INCLUDING $36 BILLION OF BANK DEPOSITS. DEPOSITS INCREASED BY $24.8 BILLION

SINCE JANUARY 1, 2008. WE HAVE DEPOSIT-TAKING CAPABILITY AT NINE BANKS OUTSIDE

OF THE U.S. AND TWO BANKS IN THE U.S. – GE MONEY BANK INC., A FEDERAL SAVINGS

BANK (FSB), AND GE CAPITAL FINANCIAL INC., AN INDUSTRIAL BANK (IB). THE FSB AND

IB CURRENTLY ISSUE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITS (CDS) DISTRIBUTED BY BROKERS IN

MATURITY TERMS FROM THREE MONTHS TO TEN YEARS. TOTAL OUTSTANDING CDS AT THESE

TWO BANKS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WERE $24.5 BILLION. WE EXPECT DEPOSITS TO

CONTINUE TO GROW AND CONSTITUTE A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL FUNDING IN THE

FUTURE.

IN THE

EVENT WE CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCESS OUR NORMAL SOURCES OF FUNDING, WE HAVE A

NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE, INCLUDING CASH BALANCES

AND COLLECTIONS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CREDIT LINES. IN THE EVENT THESE

SOURCES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPAY COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM DEBT AS IT BECOMES

DUE OR TO MEET OUR OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WE CAN ACCESS THE CPFF AND THE TLGP

AND/OR SEEK OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING.

OUR CASH

AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $48.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE

WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH IS

AVAILABLE TO HELP MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS. WE ALSO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH

FROM THE PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS OF LOANS AND RENTALS FROM LEASED ASSETS, WHICH

HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN INVESTED IN ASSET GROWTH. AT GECS, WE ARE MANAGING

COLLECTIONS VERSUS ORIGINATIONS TO HELP SUPPORT LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND ARE

ESTIMATING $25 BILLION OF EXCESS COLLECTIONS IN 2009.

(46)

COMMITTED,

UNUSED CREDIT LINES TOTALING $60.0 BILLION HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO US BY 65

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THESE LINES INCLUDE $37.4 BILLION

OF REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH WE CAN BORROW FUNDS FOR PERIODS

EXCEEDING ONE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, $21.3 BILLION ARE 364-DAY LINES THAT CONTAIN A

TERM-OUT FEATURE THAT ALLOWS US TO EXTEND BORROWINGS FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE

OF EXPIRATION OF THE LENDING AGREEMENT.

EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE

RISKS

ARE MANAGED WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MATCH FUNDING

AND SELECTIVE USE OF DERIVATIVES. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND MARKET RISKS BECAUSE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN DIVERSE

MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND LOCAL FUNDING IS NOT ALWAYS EFFICIENT. IN ADDITION,

WE USE DERIVATIVES TO ADJUST THE DEBT WE ARE ISSUING TO MATCH THE FIXED OR

FLOATING NATURE OF THE ASSETS WE ARE ACQUIRING. WE APPLY STRICT POLICIES TO

MANAGE EACH OF THESE RISKS, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS ON DERIVATIVES MARKET-MAKING

OR OTHER SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES. FOLLOWING IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL

EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USING SO-CALLED

“SHOCK” TESTS THAT MODEL EFFECTS OF SHIFTS IN RATES. THESE ARE NOT

FORECASTS.

·

IT

IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. WE FUND OUR

FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS USING DEBT OR A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS SO THAT THE INTEREST RATES OF OUR BORROWINGS MATCH THE

EXPECTED YIELDS ON OUR ASSETS. TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR POSITIONS,

WE ASSUMED THAT, ON JANUARY 1, 2009, INTEREST RATES INCREASED BY 100 BASIS

POINTS ACROSS THE YIELD CURVE (A “PARALLEL SHIFT” IN THAT CURVE) AND

FURTHER ASSUMED THAT THE INCREASE REMAINED IN PLACE FOR 2009. WE

ESTIMATED, BASED ON THE YEAR-END 2008 PORTFOLIO AND HOLDING EVERYTHING

ELSE CONSTANT, THAT OUR 2009 CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS WOULD DECLINE BY

$0.1 BILLION.

·

IT

IS OUR POLICY TO MINIMIZE CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS

EITHER WITHIN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OR USING THE PROTECTION OF HEDGE

STRATEGIES. WE ANALYZED YEAR-END 2008 CONSOLIDATED CURRENCY EXPOSURES,

INCLUDING DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, TO IDENTIFY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THEIR RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES. FOR SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE THEN EVALUATED THE EFFECTS

OF A 10% SHIFT IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THOSE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S.

DOLLAR. THIS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INCONSEQUENTIAL

EFFECT ON 2009 EARNINGS OF SUCH A SHIFT IN EXCHANGE

RATES.

CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY

SHAREOWNERS’

EQUITY DECREASED BY $10.9 BILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH INCREASES OF $4.1

BILLION AND $2.9 BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

OVER THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD, NET EARNINGS INCREASED EQUITY BY $17.4 BILLION, $22.2 BILLION

AND $20.7 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF $12.6 BILLION,

$11.7 BILLION AND $10.7 BILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY.

ELEMENTS

OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REDUCED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $30.2 BILLION IN

2008, COMPARED WITH INCREASES OF $5.1 BILLION AND $0.1 BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUSIVE OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPONENTS OF

THESE CHANGES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

·

CHANGES

IN BENEFIT PLANS REDUCED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $13.3 BILLION IN 2008,

REFLECTING DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AS A RESULT OF MARKET

CONDITIONS AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS COMPARED

WITH INCREASES OF $2.6 BILLION AND $0.3 BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, ADOPTION OF SFAS 158,

EMPLOYERS’ ACCOUNTING FOR

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, AT DECEMBER

31, 2006, REDUCED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $3.8 BILLION. FURTHER INFORMATION

ABOUT CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLANS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

·

CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS DECREASED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $11.0 BILLION IN

2008 AND INCREASED EQUITY BY $4.5 BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION IN 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY. CHANGES IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS REFLECT

THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR NET INVESTMENT IN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT HAVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S.

DOLLAR. AT THE END OF 2008, THE U.S. DOLLAR WAS STRONGER AGAINST MOST

MAJOR CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE POUND STERLING, THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND

THE EURO, COMPARED WITH A WEAKER DOLLAR AGAINST THOSE CURRENCIES AT THE

END OF 2007 AND 2006. THE DOLLAR WAS WEAKER AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN IN

2008 AND 2007.

·

NET

UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES REDUCED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY

$3.2 BILLION IN 2008, REFLECTING ADVERSE MARKET CONDITIONS ON THE FAIR

VALUE OF SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE, PRIMARILY CORPORATE

DEBT AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES DECREASED SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $1.5 BILLION AND

$0.2 BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

INVESTMENT SECURITIES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

(47)

·

CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES DECREASED

SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY BY $2.7 BILLION IN 2008, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE

EFFECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ON INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS. THE

CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES

DECREASED EQUITY BY $0.5 BILLION IN 2007 AND INCREASED EQUITY BY $0.2

BILLION IN 2006. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES

IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 29 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART

II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT.

AS

DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS LIQUIDITY AND BORROWINGS SECTION, IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008 WE TOOK A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN OUR LIQUIDITY,

MAINTAIN OUR DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST CREDIT RATINGS ON OUR BORROWING

CAPABILITY. ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT AFFECTED OUR 2008 SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY

INCLUDED.

·

WE

RAISED $12.0 BILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF 547.8 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK AT AN ISSUANCE PRICE OF $22.25 PER

SHARE.

·

WE

ISSUED 30,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK AND RELATED WARRANTS FOR $3.0

BILLION IN PROCEEDS.

·

WE

SUSPENDED OUR SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM.

AS A

RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, OTHER CAPITAL INCREASED BY $14.3 BILLION IN 2008,

COMPARED WITH INCREASES OF $0.6 BILLION AND $0.3 BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY.

OVERVIEW

OF OUR CASH FLOW FROM 2006 THROUGH 2008

CONSOLIDATED

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WERE $48.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AN INCREASE OF

$32.5 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AMOUNTED TO $15.7

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, AN INCREASE OF $1.6 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31,

2006.

WE

EVALUATE OUR CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE BY REVIEWING OUR INDUSTRIAL (NON-FINANCIAL

SERVICES) BUSINESSES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES SEPARATELY. CASH FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES (CFOA) IS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH GENERATION FOR OUR

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. THE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES ALSO HAVE LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE

VIA THE PUBLIC CAPITAL MARKETS. OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES USE A VARIETY

OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS. CASH FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES

BUSINESSES IS PRIMARILY PROVIDED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKETS, AS WELL AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES

COLLECTIONS, SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS.

GE

CASH FLOW

GE CFOA

IS A USEFUL MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE FOR OUR NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND TOTALED

$19.1 BILLION IN 2008, $23.3 BILLION IN 2007 AND $23.8 BILLION IN 2006.

GENERALLY, FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR EARNINGS – FOR EXAMPLE, PRICING, VOLUME,

COSTS AND PRODUCTIVITY – AFFECT CFOA SIMILARLY. HOWEVER, WHILE MANAGEMENT OF

WORKING CAPITAL, INCLUDING TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AND PAYMENTS AND LEVELS OF

INVENTORY, AFFECTS OPERATING RESULTS ONLY INDIRECTLY, THE EFFECT OF THESE

PROGRAMS ON CFOA CAN BE SIGNIFICANT.

OUR GE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS SHOWS CFOA IN THE REQUIRED FORMAT. WHILE THAT DISPLAY IS

OF SOME USE IN ANALYZING HOW VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AFFECTED OUR

YEAR-END CASH POSITIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO USEFUL TO SUPPLEMENT THAT

DISPLAY AND TO EXAMINE IN A BROADER CONTEXT THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE

AND REQUIRE CASH.

THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CASH IN CFOA IS CUSTOMER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, THE LARGEST

OF WHICH IS COLLECTING CASH FOLLOWING A PRODUCT OR SERVICES SALE. GE OPERATING

CASH COLLECTIONS INCREASED BY $12.7 BILLION IN 2008 AND $12.2 BILLION IN 2007.

THESE INCREASES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN COMPARABLE GE OPERATING

SEGMENT REVENUES, COMPRISING ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE,

NBC UNIVERSAL AND CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL. ANALYSES OF OPERATING SEGMENT

REVENUES DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING SEGMENT OPERATIONS SECTION IS THE BEST WAY

OF UNDERSTANDING THEIR CUSTOMER-RELATED CFOA.

THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT OPERATING USE OF CASH IS TO PAY OUR SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, TAX

AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES NECESSARY IN

A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL ORGANIZATION. GE OPERATING CASH PAYMENTS INCREASED BY $12.0

BILLION IN 2008 AND BY $10.2 BILLION IN 2007, COMPARABLE TO THE INCREASES IN GE

TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES.

DIVIDENDS

FROM GECS REPRESENTED DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTION OF GECS RETAINED EARNINGS,

INCLUDING SPECIAL DIVIDENDS FROM PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS SALES, AND ARE

DISTINCT FROM CASH FROM CONTINUING OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESSES, WHICH INCREASED IN 2008 BY $6.2 BILLION TO $31.2 BILLION,

FOLLOWING AN INCREASE OF $3.4 BILLION IN 2007. THE AMOUNTS WE SHOW IN GE CFOA

ARE THE TOTAL DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING NORMAL DIVIDENDS AS WELL AS ANY SPECIAL

DIVIDENDS FROM EXCESS CAPITAL, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM GECS BUSINESS SALES.

BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, WE REDUCED OUR DIVIDEND FROM GECS FROM

40% TO 10% OF GECS EARNINGS.

GE SELLS

CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES TO GECS IN PART TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR INDUSTRIAL

BUSINESSES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN RESULT IN CASH GENERATION OR CASH USE IN ANY

GIVEN PERIOD. THE INCREMENTAL CASH GENERATED OR USED FROM THE SALE OF CUSTOMER

RECEIVABLES (NET EFFECT) IS THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED FOR RECEIVABLES SOLD IN

A PERIOD LESS THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLECTED ON RECEIVABLES PREVIOUSLY SOLD. THIS

NET EFFECT REPRESENTS THE CASH GENERATED OR USED IN THE PERIOD RELATED TO THIS

ACTIVITY. THE INCREMENTAL CASH GENERATED IN GE CFOA FROM SELLING THESE

RECEIVABLES TO GECS DECREASED GE CFOA BY $0.1 BILLION IN 2008, AND INCREASED GE

CFOA BY $0.3 BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE

26 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND

GECS.

GECS

CASH FLOW

GECS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AGGREGATED $37.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED

WITH $9.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. GECS CFOA TOTALED $31.2 BILLION IN 2008,

COMPARED WITH $25.0 BILLION IN 2007. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

INCREASED COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST FROM LOANS AND FINANCE LEASES AND RENTAL

INCOME FROM OPERATING LEASES, RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM CORE GROWTH AND CURRENCY

EXCHANGE; AND INCREASES IN CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM COUNTERPARTIES ON

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN

INTEREST PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM INCREASED BORROWINGS AND TAXES

PAID.

GECS

PRINCIPAL USE OF CASH HAS BEEN INVESTING IN ASSETS TO GROW ITS BUSINESSES. OF

THE $28.6 BILLION THAT GECS INVESTED DURING 2008, $17.4 BILLION WAS USED FOR

ADDITIONS TO FINANCING RECEIVABLES; $13.3 BILLION WAS USED TO INVEST IN NEW

EQUIPMENT, PRINCIPALLY FOR LEASE TO OTHERS; AND $25.0 BILLION WAS USED FOR

ACQUISITIONS OF NEW BUSINESSES, THE LARGEST OF WHICH WERE MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL,

CITICAPITAL AND BANK BPH IN 2008. THIS USE OF CASH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $11.0 BILLION AND

PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES OF $10.1

BILLION.

GECS

PAID DIVIDENDS TO GE THROUGH A DISTRIBUTION OF ITS RETAINED EARNINGS, INCLUDING

SPECIAL DIVIDENDS FROM PROCEEDS OF CERTAIN BUSINESS SALES. DIVIDENDS PAID TO GE

TOTALED $2.4 BILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH $7.3 BILLION IN 2007. THERE WERE NO

SPECIAL DIVIDENDS PAID TO GE IN 2008, COMPARED WITH $2.4 BILLION IN 2007. DURING

2008, GECS BORROWINGS WITH MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS DECREASED BY $31.3

BILLION. NEW BORROWINGS OF $122.5 BILLION HAVING MATURITIES LONGER THAN 90 DAYS

WERE ADDED DURING 2008, WHILE $67.1 BILLION OF SUCH LONG-TERM BORROWINGS WERE

RETIRED.

INTERCOMPANY

ELIMINATIONS

EFFECTS

OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN RELATED COMPANIES ARE ELIMINATED AND CONSIST PRIMARILY

OF GECS DIVIDENDS TO GE; GE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES SOLD TO GECS; GECS SERVICES FOR

TRADE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT AND MATERIAL PROCUREMENT; BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

(INCLUDING AUTOMOBILES) LEASED BY GE FROM GECS; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND

OTHER SERVICES SOLD TO GECS BY GE; AIRCRAFT ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT ARE

INSTALLED ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY GECS FROM THIRD-PARTY PRODUCERS FOR LEASE TO

OTHERS; MEDICAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURED BY GE THAT IS LEASED BY GECS TO OTHERS;

AND VARIOUS INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ALLOCATIONS OF GE CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS.

SEE NOTE 26 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

(49)

THE LACK

OF A CURRENT-YEAR COUNTERPART TO LAST YEAR’S $2.4 BILLION GECS SPECIAL DIVIDEND

AND A $2.5 BILLION DECREASE IN GECS ORDINARY DIVIDEND ARE THE PRIMARY REASONS

FOR THE DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS REFERRED TO

PAYMENTS FOR OTHER LIABILITIES.

VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE

SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO IMPROVE SHAREOWNER RETURNS AND AS AN

ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING. THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WE ENGAGE IN ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BEYOND IMPROVING RETURNS,

THESE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS SERVE AS FUNDING SOURCES FOR A VARIETY OF

DIVERSIFIED LENDING AND SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS.

OUR

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED USING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES),

PRINCIPALLY QSPES. CERTAIN OF OUR VIES ARE CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE WE ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE ENTITY. OUR INTERESTS IN OTHER

VIES, INCLUDING QSPES AND VIES FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES, FINANCING RECEIVABLES OR EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE $26.6 BILLION

AND $21.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, A DECREASE OF $5.8 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION

FROM 2007, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, VARIABLE INTERESTS IN

UNCONSOLIDATED VIES OTHER THAN QSPES WERE $2.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.2

BILLION FROM 2007. OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS RELATED TO SUCH ENTITIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WAS $4.0 BILLION, UP $1.5 BILLION FROM 2007, AND INCLUDES OUR

INVESTMENT IN THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES AND OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO FUND

NEW INVESTMENTS BY THESE ENTITIES.

(50)

QSPES

THAT WE USE FOR SECURITIZATION ARE FUNDED WITH ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

TERM DEBT. THE ASSETS WE SECURITIZE INCLUDE: RECEIVABLES SECURED BY EQUIPMENT,

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, FLOORPLAN INVENTORY

RECEIVABLES, GE TRADE RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS ORIGINATED AND UNDERWRITTEN

BY US IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OFF-BALANCE

SHEET SECURITIZATION ENTITIES HELD $52.6 BILLION IN TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL

ASSETS, DOWN $3.6 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2007. ASSETS HELD BY THESE ENTITIES ARE

OF EQUIVALENT CREDIT QUALITY TO OUR ON-BOOK ASSETS. WE MONITOR THE UNDERLYING

CREDIT QUALITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR ROLE AS SERVICER AND APPLY RIGOROUS

CONTROLS TO THE EXECUTION OF SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY SUPPORT DISCUSSED BELOW, INVESTORS IN THESE ENTITIES HAVE

RECOURSE ONLY TO THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION INCLUDED $10.4 BILLION IN

RETAINED INTERESTS RELATED TO THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE HELD BY QSPES AND VIES FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND TAKE TWO FORMS: (1) SELLERS’ INTERESTS, WHICH ARE

CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES, AND (2) SUBORDINATED INTERESTS, DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT TO SENIOR INTERESTS, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED

AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES WAS $4.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, DOWN $0.1

BILLION FROM 2007. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES WAS $6.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, UP $0.6 BILLION

FROM 2007. CERTAIN OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR WITH CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. DURING BOTH 2008 AND 2007, WE RECOGNIZED

DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE ON THOSE RETAINED INTERESTS OF $0.1 BILLION. FOR THOSE

RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES, WE RECOGNIZED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $0.3 BILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH $0.1

BILLION IN 2007. OUR RECOURSE LIABILITY IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS WAS AN

INCONSEQUENTIAL AMOUNT IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007.

WE ARE

PARTY TO VARIOUS CREDIT ENHANCEMENT POSITIONS WITH SECURITIZATION ENTITIES,

INCLUDING LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEE AND

REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS, AND HAVE PROVIDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE

OF ESTIMATED LOSSES ON SUCH POSITIONS. THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON

PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. SHOULD MARKET CONDITIONS

DETERIORATE, ACTUAL LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER. OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS UNDER SUCH

AGREEMENTS WAS LIMITED TO $2.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. BASED ON OUR

EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT, UNDER ANY PLAUSIBLE FUTURE ECONOMIC SCENARIO, THE

LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENT WE PROVIDE TO

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE DID

NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT TO CONSOLIDATED VIES, UNCONSOLIDATED VIES OR QSPES BEYOND

WHAT WE ARE CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE IN EITHER 2008 OR 2007. WE DO NOT

HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY VIES OR QSPES.

THE FASB

CURRENTLY HAS A PROJECT ON ITS AGENDA THAT RECONSIDERS THE ACCOUNTING FOR VIES

AND SECURITIZATION. WHILE FINAL GUIDANCE HAS NOT YET BEEN ISSUED, IT IS LIKELY

THAT THE BOARD WILL ELIMINATE THE SCOPE EXCLUSION IN FASB INTERPRETATION (FIN)

46(R) RELATED TO QSPES, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION OF A MAJORITY OF THE

QSPES WE USE FOR SECURITIZATION. IN ADDITION, PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE CRITERIA

FOR DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

SECURITIZATIONS THAT QUALIFY FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT AND GAIN

RECOGNITION. A REVISED STANDARD IS EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED LATER IN 2009 AND COULD

BE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR 2010 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AND OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH QSPES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 30 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

DEBT

INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND COVENANTS

THE

MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR DEBT. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY

WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. IN DECEMBER 2008,

STANDARD & POOR’S RATINGS SERVICES AFFIRMED OUR AND GE CAPITAL’S “AAA”

LONG-TERM AND “A-1+” SHORT-TERM CORPORATE CREDIT RATINGS BUT REVISED ITS RATINGS

OUTLOOK FROM STABLE TO NEGATIVE BASED PARTLY ON THE CONCERNS REGARDING GE

CAPITAL’S FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FUNDING IN LIGHT OF CAPITAL MARKET TURMOIL. ON

JANUARY 24, 2009, MOODY’S INVESTMENT SERVICES PLACED THE LONG-TERM RATINGS OF GE

AND GE CAPITAL ON REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE. THE FIRM’S “PRIME-1” SHORT-TERM

RATINGS WERE AFFIRMED. MOODY’S SAID THE REVIEW FOR DOWNGRADE IS BASED PRIMARILY

UPON HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING GE CAPITAL’S ASSET QUALITY AND EARNINGS

PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. VARIOUS DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND

COVENANTS WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT OF

A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, BUT NONE ARE TRIGGERED IF OUR RATINGS ARE REDUCED TO

AA-/AA3 OR A-1+/P-1 OR HIGHER. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN OUR TRIPLE-A RATING,

BUT WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MAJOR OPERATIONAL IMPACTS SHOULD THAT

CHANGE.

GE, GECS

AND GE CAPITAL HAVE DISTINCT BUSINESS CHARACTERISTICS THAT THE MAJOR DEBT RATING

AGENCIES EVALUATE BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY.

(51)

QUANTITATIVE

MEASURES INCLUDE.

·

EARNINGS

AND PROFITABILITY, REVENUE GROWTH, THE BREADTH AND DIVERSITY OF SOURCES OF

INCOME AND RETURN ON ASSETS

·

ASSET

QUALITY, INCLUDING DELINQUENCY AND WRITE-OFF RATIOS AND RESERVE

COVERAGE

·

FUNDING

REPORTING QUALITY, INCLUDING CLARITY, COMPLETENESS AND TRANSPARENCY OF ALL

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

COMMUNICATIONS

GE

CAPITAL’S RATINGS ARE SUPPORTED CONTRACTUALLY BY A GE COMMITMENT TO MAINTAIN THE

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AT A SPECIFIED LEVEL AS DESCRIBED

BELOW.

BEYOND

CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED LENDING AGREEMENTS, OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE

MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM FUNDING, MONETIZATION, ASSET SECURITIZATION, CASH RECEIPTS

FROM OUR LENDING AND LEASING ACTIVITIES, SHORT-TERM SECURED FUNDING ON GLOBAL

ASSETS AND POTENTIAL SALES OF OTHER ASSETS.

PRINCIPAL DEBT CONDITIONS

ARE

DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE

FOLLOWING CONDITIONS RELATE TO GE AND GECS.

·

SWAP,

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED UNDER STANDARD

MASTER AGREEMENTS CONTAINING MUTUAL DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE

ABILITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY TO REQUIRE ASSIGNMENT OR TERMINATION IF THE

LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW

A–/A3. IN CERTAIN OF THESE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, THE COUNTERPARTY

ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE ASSIGNMENT OR TERMINATION IF THE

SHORT-TERM RATING OF THE APPLICABLE GE ENTITY WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1/P-1.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR EXPOSURE AFTER CONSIDERATION OF NETTING ARRANGEMENTS

AND COLLATERAL UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $4.0 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

·

IF

GE CAPITAL’S RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES, WHICH WAS 1.24:1 AT THE

END OF 2008, WERE TO DETERIORATE TO 1.10:1, GE HAS COMMITTED TO CONTRIBUTE

CAPITAL TO GE CAPITAL. GE ALSO GUARANTEED CERTAIN ISSUANCES OF GECS

SUBORDINATED DEBT HAVING A FACE AMOUNT OF $0.8 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

·

IN

CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FOR WHICH GECC RECEIVES

EQUITY CREDIT BY RATING AGENCIES, GE HAS AGREED TO PROMPTLY RETURN TO GECC

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS OR OTHER PAYMENTS IT RECEIVES FROM GECC DURING

EVENTS OF DEFAULT OR INTEREST DEFERRAL PERIODS UNDER SUCH SUBORDINATED

DEBENTURES. THERE WERE $7.3 BILLION OF SUCH DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE

FOLLOWING CONDITIONS RELATE TO CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.

·

IF

THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL OR CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 30 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT WERE TO BE REDUCED BELOW A–1/P–1, GE

CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE LIQUIDITY FOR THOSE

ENTITIES OR PROVIDE FUNDS TO RETIRE THE OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE

MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT GE CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IN THE

EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS DETERMINED BY CONTRACT, AND AMOUNTED TO $3.8

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

(52)

·

ONE

GROUP OF CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HOLDS INVESTMENT SECURITIES FUNDED BY THE

ISSUANCE OF GICS. IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO

FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW

A-1+/P-1, GE CAPITAL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY $3.5

BILLION OF CAPITAL TO SUCH ENTITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, PURSUANT TO

LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY GECC. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ENTITIES’

LIABILITIES EXCEED THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

THEIR ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT DRAWN UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT, GE CAPITAL

COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUCH EXCESS AMOUNT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE VALUE OF THESE ENTITIES’ LIABILITIES WAS $10.7 BILLION AND THE FAIR

VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS WAS $9.2 BILLION (WHICH INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES

ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $2.1 BILLION). WITH RESPECT TO THESE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, WE INTEND TO HOLD THEM AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS

THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAIR VALUES EXCEED THEIR AMORTIZED COST AND WE HAVE THE

ABILITY TO HOLD ALL SUCH DEBT SECURITIES UNTIL

MATURITY.

·

ANOTHER

CONSOLIDATED ENTITY ALSO ISSUES GICS WHERE PROCEEDS ARE LOANED TO GE

CAPITAL. IF THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO FALL BELOW

AA-/AA3 OR ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GE

CAPITAL COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UP TO APPROXIMATELY $4.7 BILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 TO REPAY HOLDERS OF

GICS.

IN OUR

HISTORY, WE HAVE NEVER VIOLATED ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS AT GE, GECS OR GE

CAPITAL.

ON

NOVEMBER 12, 2008, THE FDIC APPROVED GE CAPITAL’S APPLICATION FOR DESIGNATION AS

AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY UNDER THE FDIC’S TLGP. QUALIFYING DEBT ISSUED BY GE CAPITAL

IS GUARANTEED UNDER THE DEBT GUARANTEE PROGRAM OF THE FDIC’S TLGP AND IS BACKED

BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE FDIC’S GUARANTEE UNDER

THE TLGP IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE MATURITY OF THE DEBT OR JUNE 30,

2012.  THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT GE CAPITAL IS PERMITTED TO HAVE

ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING UNDER THE DEBT GUARANTEE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME IS

APPROXIMATELY $126 BILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, GE CAPITAL HAD ISSUED AND

OUTSTANDING, $35.2 BILLION OF SENIOR, UNSECURED DEBT THAT WAS GUARANTEED BY THE

FDIC. GE CAPITAL AND GE ENTERED INTO AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY DESIGNATION AGREEMENT

AND GE CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF A MASTER AGREEMENT, EACH ENTERED INTO

WITH THE FDIC. THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A

REQUIREMENT THAT GE AND GE CAPITAL REIMBURSE THE FDIC FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT THE

FDIC PAYS TO HOLDERS OF DEBT THAT IS GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE THAT WE CONSIDER

TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE

THEY INHERENTLY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ALL OF THESE

ESTIMATES REFLECT OUR BEST JUDGMENT ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES

FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS BASED ON INFORMATION

AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF SUCH CONDITIONS

PERSIST LONGER OR DETERIORATE FURTHER THAN EXPECTED, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD CHANGE, WHICH MAY RESULT

IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, ESTABLISHMENT OF

VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES, AMONG

OTHER EFFECTS. ALSO SEE NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, IN

PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE HAVE

SELECTED FROM ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES.

LOSSES ON FINANCING

RECEIVABLES

ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH REQUIRES US TO

MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. SUCH

ESTIMATE REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ADJUSTED FOR

CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF RELEVANT

OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY

RATES, FINANCIAL HEALTH OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SECTORS, COLLATERAL

VALUES, AND THE PRESENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES. OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESS INCLUDES STANDARDS AND POLICIES FOR REVIEWING MAJOR RISK

EXPOSURES AND CONCENTRATIONS, AND EVALUATES RELEVANT DATA EITHER FOR INDIVIDUAL

LOANS OR FINANCING LEASES, OR ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

FURTHER

INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN THE GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION AND FINANCIAL

RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY – FINANCING RECEIVABLES SECTION OF THIS ITEM, THE ASSET

IMPAIRMENT SECTION THAT FOLLOWS AND IN NOTES 1, 12 AND 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

(53)

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM

PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS

REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF PROFITS OVER THE

MULTIPLE-YEAR TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENTS, CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE

FREQUENCY AND EXTENT OF FUTURE MONITORING, MAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL EVENTS; THE

AMOUNT OF PERSONNEL, SPARE PARTS AND OTHER RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE

SERVICES; AND FUTURE BILLING RATE AND COST CHANGES. WE ROUTINELY REVIEW

ESTIMATES UNDER PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS AND REGULARLY REVISE THEM TO ADJUST

FOR CHANGES IN OUTLOOK. WE ALSO REGULARLY ASSESS CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK INHERENT

IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATED

EARNINGS, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT CONTRACTUAL PENALTIES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO

OFFSET OUR ACCUMULATED INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF CUSTOMER TERMINATION. WE GAIN

INSIGHT INTO FUTURE UTILIZATION AND COST TRENDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT RISK, THROUGH

OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE CLOSE INTERACTION WITH

OUR CUSTOMERS THAT COMES WITH SUPPLYING CRITICAL SERVICES AND PARTS OVER

EXTENDED PERIODS. REVISIONS THAT AFFECT A PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENT’S TOTAL

ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY RESULT IN AN ADJUSTMENT OF EARNINGS; SUCH ADJUSTMENTS

DECREASED EARNINGS BY $0.2 BILLION IN 2008 AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY $0.4

BILLION AND $0.8 BILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. WE PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE

LOSSES WHEN THEY BECOME EVIDENT.

CARRYING

AMOUNTS FOR PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS IN PROGRESS AT BOTH DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, WERE $5.5 BILLION, AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE LINE, “CONTRACT COSTS

AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS” IN NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM

10-K REPORT.

FURTHER

INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENT

INVOLVES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENTS.

WE REGULARLY

REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND

MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION

AND, FOR SECURITIES WITH FIXED MATURITIES, WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE

WITH TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE SECURITY. QUALITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE

FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, AS WELL AS OUR INTENT

AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY TO MATURITY OR UNTIL FORECASTED RECOVERY. OUR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INVOLVE OUR FINANCE, RISK AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGERS. SEE NOTE 28 IN PART

II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSES THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT

SECURITIES.

FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IS PROVIDED IN THE

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY – INVESTMENT SECURITIES SECTION OF THIS ITEM

AND IN NOTES 1, 9 AND 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

WE REVIEW

LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING

WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED TYPICALLY REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DETERMINING WHICH UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE DIRECTLY

RELATED TO THE POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED ASSET, THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS

WILL OCCUR, THEIR AMOUNT, AND THE ASSET’S RESIDUAL VALUE, IF ANY. IN TURN,

MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS REQUIRES A DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH

IS BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE. WE DERIVE THE REQUIRED UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FROM OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS

PLANS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WE USE OUR INTERNAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES

DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATE, QUOTED MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE

AND INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE.

COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT ARE A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF ASSETS IN CAPITAL FINANCE, AND ARE

PARTICULARLY SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. THEREFORE, WE TEST RECOVERABILITY

OF EACH AIRCRAFT IN OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

ADDITIONALLY, WE PERFORM QUARTERLY EVALUATIONS IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN

AIRCRAFT ARE RE-LEASED, CURRENT LEASE TERMS HAVE CHANGED OR A SPECIFIC LESSEE’S

CREDIT STANDING CHANGES. WE CONSIDER MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS GLOBAL DEMAND

FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RENTALS AND RESIDUAL VALUES ARE

BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION RECEIVED ROUTINELY FROM

INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS. ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM FUTURE LEASES ARE REDUCED FOR

EXPECTED DOWNTIME BETWEEN LEASES AND FOR ESTIMATED TECHNICAL COSTS REQUIRED TO

PREPARE AIRCRAFT TO BE REDEPLOYED. FAIR VALUE USED TO MEASURE IMPAIRMENT IS

BASED ON CURRENT MARKET VALUES FROM INDEPENDENT APPRAISERS.

WE

RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON OUR OPERATING LEASE PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT OF $0.1 BILLION IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON

FINANCING RECEIVABLES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN 2008

AND 2007.

(54)

FURTHER

INFORMATION ON IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AND OUR EXPOSURE TO THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION

INDUSTRY IS PROVIDED IN THE OPERATIONS – OVERVIEW SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN

NOTES 14 AND 31 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8.

“FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

REAL ESTATE.

WE REVIEW OUR

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT ROUTINELY OR WHEN EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

THE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED FOR BOTH ESTIMATING VALUE AND THE RECOVERABILITY

ANALYSIS ARE INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL, AND REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED LEASE

PROFILES, AVAILABLE INDUSTRY INFORMATION ABOUT EXPECTED TRENDS IN RENTAL,

OCCUPANCY AND CAPITALIZATION RATES AND EXPECTED BUSINESS PLANS, WHICH INCLUDE

OUR ESTIMATED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE ASSET. OUR PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED, BOTH

GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY ASSET TYPE. HOWEVER, THE GLOBAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IS

SUBJECT TO PERIODIC CYCLES THAT CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET

VALUES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR CAPITAL FINANCE REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED VALUE BY ABOUT $4 BILLION. AT DECEMBER

31, 2007, THE ESTIMATED VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY ABOUT $3 BILLION.

THIS DECLINE IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO REFLECTED SALES OF

PROPERTIES WITH A BOOK VALUE OF $5.8 BILLION, RESULTING IN PRE-TAX GAINS OF $1.9

BILLION, AND ALSO REFLECTED DETERIORATION IN CURRENT AND EXPECTED REAL ESTATE

MARKET LIQUIDITY AND MACROECONOMIC TRENDS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, RESULTING IN

DECLINING MARKET OCCUPANCY RATES AND MARKET RENTS AS WELL AS INCREASES IN OUR

ESTIMATES OF MARKET CAPITALIZATION RATES BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA. DECLINES IN

ESTIMATED VALUE OF REAL ESTATE BELOW CARRYING VALUE RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES

WHEN THE AGGREGATE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES USED IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE

MEASUREMENT ARE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT. AS SUCH, ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE

PORTFOLIO WILL NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. WHEN WE

RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT, THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE UNDERLYING ASSET WHICH IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET DATA, INCLUDING CURRENT

CAPITALIZATION RATES. DURING 2008, CAPITAL FINANCE REAL ESTATE RECOGNIZED

PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENTS OF $0.3 BILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT, AS

COMPARED TO $0.2 BILLION IN 2007.  CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS OR PROLONGED MARKET ILLIQUIDITY MAY RESULT IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENTS

BEING RECOGNIZED. FURTHERMORE, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO

FORECASTED VALUATION TRENDS, ESPECIALLY IN ILLIQUID MARKETS, RESULTS IN INHERENT

IMPRECISION IN REAL ESTATE VALUE ESTIMATES. FURTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN

THE GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION OF THIS ITEM AND IN NOTE 16 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT HAS FALLEN BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT

ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE OR A DECISION TO SELL OR DISPOSE ALL OR A

PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT. DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED

REQUIRES VALUATION OF THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING UNIT, WHICH WE ESTIMATE USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD. FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTING UNITS, THESE CASH

FLOWS ARE REDUCED FOR ESTIMATED INTEREST COSTS. ALSO, WHEN DETERMINING THE

AMOUNT OF GOODWILL TO BE ALLOCATED TO A BUSINESS DISPOSITION FOR A FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESS, WE REDUCE THE CASH PROCEEDS WE RECEIVE FROM THE SALE BY THE

AMOUNT OF DEBT WHICH IS ALLOCATED TO THE SOLD BUSINESS IN ORDER TO BE CONSISTENT

WITH THE REPORTING UNIT VALUATION METHODOLOGY. WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS

APPROPRIATE, WE USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW RESULTS. IN APPLYING THIS METHODOLOGY, WE RELY ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS, FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS

AND MARKET DATA.

IF THIS

ANALYSIS INDICATES GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED, MEASURING THE IMPAIRMENT REQUIRES A

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF EACH IDENTIFIED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSET. IN THIS

CASE, WE SUPPLEMENT THE CASH FLOW APPROACH DISCUSSED ABOVE WITH INDEPENDENT

APPRAISALS, AS APPROPRIATE.

GIVEN

THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OUR

STATED STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR CAPITAL FINANCE ENDING NET INVESTMENT, WE

RE-TESTED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNITS WITHIN CAPITAL FINANCE

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. IN PERFORMING THIS ANALYSIS, WE REVISED OUR

ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT RATES, AS APPROPRIATE, TO REFLECT

CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. IN EACH CASE, NO

IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED. REPORTING UNITS WITHIN CAPITAL FINANCE ARE CLL, GE

MONEY, REAL ESTATE, ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GECAS, WHICH HAD GOODWILL

BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OF $12.8 BILLION, $9.1 BILLION, $1.2 BILLION,

$2.2 BILLION AND $0.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

WE

REVIEW IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINED USEFUL LIVES AND SUBJECT TO

AMORTIZATION FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINING WHETHER AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS OCCURRED REQUIRES COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT TO THE SUM OF

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. WE TEST

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR

VALUE METHOD SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FOR OUR INSURANCE ACTIVITIES

REMAINING IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WE PERIODICALLY TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT OUR

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS AND PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS.

(55)

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT.

PENSION ASSUMPTIONS

ARE

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS TO THE ACTUARIAL MODELS THAT MEASURE PENSION BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED EFFECTS ON OPERATIONS. TWO ASSUMPTIONS – DISCOUNT RATE

AND EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS – ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF PLAN EXPENSE AND

ASSET/LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST

ANNUALLY ON A PLAN AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC BASIS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, SUCH AS RETIREMENT AGE, MORTALITY AND

TURNOVER, AND UPDATE THEM TO REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE

FUTURE. ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WILL OFTEN DIFFER FROM ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

ACCUMULATED

AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE EXPRESSED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE

CASH PAYMENTS. WE DISCOUNT THOSE CASH PAYMENTS USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF

MARKET-OBSERVED YIELDS FOR HIGH QUALITY FIXED INCOME SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES

THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. LOWER DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE

PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE; HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES

DECREASE PRESENT VALUES AND SUBSEQUENT-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE.

OUR

DISCOUNT RATES FOR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND

2006 WERE 6.11%, 6.34% AND 5.75%, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING MARKET INTEREST

RATES.

TO

DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE

CONSIDER CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND

EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. IN DEVELOPING FUTURE

RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL BENEFIT PLANS’ ASSETS, WE EVALUATE GENERAL

MARKET TRENDS AS WELL AS KEY ELEMENTS OF ASSET CLASS RETURNS SUCH AS EXPECTED

EARNINGS GROWTH, YIELDS AND SPREADS ACROSS A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL SCENARIOS.

ASSETS IN OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS DECLINED 28.2% IN 2008, AND HAD AVERAGE

ANNUAL EARNINGS OF 3.3%, 4.0% AND 10.1% PER YEAR IN THE FIVE-, 10- AND 25-YEAR

PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2007, ASSETS IN OUR PRINCIPAL

PENSION PLANS EARNED 13.6% AND HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS OF 14.9%, 9.2% AND

12.2% PER YEAR IN THE FIVE-, 10- AND 25-YEAR PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE,

PAST RETURN RESULTS, AND OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, WE HAVE

ASSUMED AN 8.5% LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON THOSE ASSETS.

SENSITIVITY

TO CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS

FOLLOWS.

·

DISCOUNT

RATE – A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE PENSION

COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.2

BILLION.

·

EXPECTED

RETURN ON ASSETS – A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

ASSETS WOULD INCREASE PENSION COST IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR BY $0.3

BILLION.

INCOME TAXES

. OUR ANNUAL TAX

RATE IS BASED ON OUR INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES

AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. TAX LAWS ARE

COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS BY THE TAXPAYER AND RESPECTIVE

GOVERNMENTAL TAXING AUTHORITIES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING

OUR TAX EXPENSE AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING EVALUATING

UNCERTAINTIES UNDER FIN 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES

. WE REVIEW OUR TAX POSITIONS QUARTERLY AND ADJUST THE BALANCES AS

NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. OUR INCOME TAX RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED

BY THE TAX RATE ON OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO LOCAL COUNTRY TAX LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, THIS RATE DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT IS DETERMINED BY

MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT ABOUT AND INTENTIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE OPERATIONS OF

THE COMPANY. DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE

INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. SUCH ASSETS ARISE

BECAUSE OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES

OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS FROM NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND

CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL

SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED

OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. THESE SOURCES OF

INCOME INHERENTLY RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES. WE USE OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE

AND OUR SHORT AND LONG-RANGE BUSINESS FORECASTS TO PROVIDE INSIGHT. FURTHER, OUR

GLOBAL AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY

VARIOUS PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE THE

RECOVERABILITY OF FUTURE DEDUCTIONS. AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

RELATED TO NON-U.S. NET OPERATING LOSSES, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WERE $1.8

BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH

YEAR-END 2008 AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY RECOVERABLE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE

STATUTORY EXPIRATION PERIODS. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS

ESTABLISHED.

FURTHER

INFORMATION ON INCOME TAXES IS PROVIDED IN THE OPERATIONS – OVERVIEW SECTION OF

THIS ITEM AND IN NOTES 7 AND 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.

WE

USE DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO

INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY PRICES. ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVES AS HEDGES REQUIRES THAT, AT INCEPTION AND OVER THE TERM OF THE

ARRANGEMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND RELATED DERIVATIVE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES

ACCOUNTING ARE COMPLEX. FAILURE TO APPLY THIS COMPLEX GUIDANCE CORRECTLY WILL

RESULT IN ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE BEING REPORTED IN

EARNINGS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGED ITEM.

IN

EVALUATING WHETHER A PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, WE

TEST EFFECTIVENESS AT INCEPTION AND EACH REPORTING PERIOD THEREAFTER BY

DETERMINING WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OFFSET, WITHIN A

SPECIFIED RANGE, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM. IF FAIR VALUE

CHANGES FAIL THIS TEST, WE DISCONTINUE APPLYING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO THAT

RELATIONSHIP PROSPECTIVELY. FAIR VALUES OF BOTH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND

THE HEDGED ITEM ARE CALCULATED USING INTERNAL VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATING

MARKET-BASED ASSUMPTIONS, SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY CONFIRMATION.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE $12.6 BILLION AND

$5.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES IS

PROVIDED IN NOTES 18, 23 AND 29 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART

II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K

REPORT.

INVESTMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN

EARNINGS

INCLUDE RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER SFAS 155,

ACCOUNTING FOR

CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

, AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF $2.6

BILLION AT YEAR-END 2008. THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ON THESE

ASSETS, FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE, WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH

THOSE CHANGES OCCUR. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF

THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WE HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE VALUED AT $2.7

BILLION AT YEAR-END 2008, WHICH REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS

TO SELL. THOSE SALES ARE EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM

8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF THIS FORM 10-K REPORT, WE

ALSO HAVE ASSETS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS, PRIMARILY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES,

CARRIED AT $5.0 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2008, WHICH REPRESENTS THE LOWER OF CARRYING

AMOUNT OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL IS LOWER THAN CARRYING VALUE, ANY

FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL BE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS IN

THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR.

(57)

OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES

ARE

RECORDED AS LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED WHEN

THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED

THE RECORDED PROVISION. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE OFTEN RESOLVED OVER LONG TIME

PERIODS. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FORECASTS THAT

OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS

REGULATORS.

INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN NOTES 20 AND 31 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8. “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” OF

OTHER

INFORMATION

NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

ON

SEPTEMBER 15, 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

,

WHICH DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING THAT VALUE

AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARD APPLIED

PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED AFTER JANUARY 1,

2008, FOR MEASUREMENTS OF THE FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RECURRING

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; ON JANUARY 1,

2009, THE STANDARD APPLIES TO ALL REMAINING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, INCLUDING

NON-RECURRING VALUATIONS OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUCH AS THOSE

USED IN MEASURING IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER

LONG-LIVED ASSETS. IT ALSO APPLIES TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF NON-FINANCIAL

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONSUMMATED

AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009.

ON

DECEMBER 4, 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 141(R),

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH

IS EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JANUARY 1, 2009. THIS STANDARD WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE

THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS BOTH DURING THE PERIOD OF THE

ACQUISITION AND IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE

ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS ARE THE FOLLOWING.

·

IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ASSET,

WITH THE COST RECOGNIZED AS THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS REALIZED OR

ABANDONED. IPR&D IS PRESENTLY EXPENSED AT THE TIME OF THE

ACQUISITION.

·

CONTINGENT

CONSIDERATION WILL GENERALLY BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH SUBSEQUENT

ADJUSTMENTS RECOGNIZED IN OPERATIONS. CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION IS

PRESENTLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE

PRICE.

·

DECREASES

IN VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON ACQUIRED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOGNIZED

IN OPERATIONS. SUCH CHANGES PREVIOUSLY WERE CONSIDERED TO BE SUBSEQUENT

CHANGES IN CONSIDERATION AND WERE RECORDED AS DECREASES IN

GOODWILL.

·

TRANSACTION

COSTS WILL GENERALLY BE EXPENSED. CERTAIN SUCH COSTS ARE PRESENTLY TREATED

AS COSTS OF THE ACQUISITION.

GENERALLY,

THE EFFECTS OF SFAS 141(R) WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, WE EXPENSED AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DIRECT COSTS RELATED TO BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS THAT WERE IN PROCESS, BUT NOT COMPLETED BY THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

SFAS 141(R).

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP)

FAS 141(R)-A,

ACCOUNTING FOR

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARISE

FROM CONTINGENCIES

, A PROPOSED FSP WHICH WOULD AMEND THE ACCOUNTING IN

SFAS 141(R) FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION. THE PROPOSED FSP WOULD REQUIRE THAT PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES

BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE, IF FAIR VALUE CAN BE REASONABLY DETERMINED. IF FAIR

VALUE CANNOT BE REASONABLY DETERMINED, THE PROPOSED FSP REQUIRES MEASUREMENT

BASED ON THE BEST ESTIMATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES.

ALSO

ON DECEMBER 4, 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 160,

NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO.

51, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JANUARY 1, 2009. THIS STANDARD WILL

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AFTER ADOPTION,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ($8.9 BILLION AND $8.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY) WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY, A CHANGE FROM ITS

CURRENT CLASSIFICATION BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY. EARNINGS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO MINORITY INTERESTS ($0.6 BILLION IN 2008 AND $0.9 BILLION IN

BOTH 2007 AND 2006) WILL BE INCLUDED IN NET EARNINGS, ALTHOUGH SUCH EARNINGS

WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEDUCTED TO MEASURE EARNINGS PER SHARE. PURCHASES AND SALES

OF MINORITY INTERESTS WILL BE REPORTED IN EQUITY SIMILAR TO TREASURY STOCK

TRANSACTIONS. GAINS ON SALES OF MINORITY INTERESTS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

REPORTED IN NET EARNINGS UNDER SFAS 160 AMOUNTED TO $0.4 BILLION AND $0.9

BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

(58)

ON

DECEMBER 12, 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

07-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

. THE CONSENSUS PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON

PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING

PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE CONSENSUS REQUIRES US TO PRESENT THE RESULTS

OF THE COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF ISSUE 99-19,

REPORTING REVENUE GROSS AS A

PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT

, AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF APPLICABLE

AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE, TO ADOPT AN ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE

PARTICIPANTS THAT WILL BE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. THE CONSENSUS IS APPLIED

RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS EXISTING AS OF JANUARY

1, 2009,

AND COVERS ARRANGEMENTS IN SEVERAL OF OUR BUSINESSES. ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD

WILL NOT AFFECT OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS WITH A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF

UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS OF ESTABLISHED, ONGOING OPERATIONS BY

EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE, WHICH

ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING TRENDS, AND THE

OVERSHADOW TRENDS IN ONGOING REVENUES. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THE TERM

“ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH” MAY BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY BY OTHER COMPANIES AND

UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH THIS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON COMPARABILITY

OF ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE GROWTH FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY, WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

MEASURES ARE USEFUL IN ASSESSING TRENDS OF THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES OR

COMPANIES AND MAY THEREFORE BE A USEFUL TOOL IN ASSESSING PERIOD-TO-PERIOD

PERFORMANCE TRENDS.

OUR ROTC

CALCULATION EXCLUDES EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM THE

NUMERATOR BECAUSE U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO DISPLAY THOSE EARNINGS (LOSSES) IN

THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. WE EXCLUDE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF EARNINGS (LOSSES)

OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM THE DENOMINATOR IN OUR ROTC CALCULATION (1) FOR

EACH OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH RELATED DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE PRESENTED,

AND (2) FOR OUR AVERAGE NET INVESTMENT IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS SINCE JULY 1,

2005. HAD WE DISPOSED OF THESE OPERATIONS BEFORE JULY 1, 2005, WE WOULD HAVE

APPLIED THE PROCEEDS TO REDUCE PARENT-SUPPORTED DEBT AT GE CAPITAL. HOWEVER,

SINCE PARENT-SUPPORTED DEBT AT GE CAPITAL WAS RETIRED BY JUNE 30, 2005, WE HAVE

ASSUMED THAT WE WOULD HAVE DISTRIBUTED THE PROCEEDS AFTER THAT TIME TO

SHAREOWNERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES, THUS REDUCING AVERAGE TOTAL SHAREOWNERS’

EQUITY. OUR CALCULATION OF AVERAGE TOTAL SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY

COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE

THAT IT IS A CLEARER WAY TO MEASURE THE ONGOING TREND IN RETURN ON TOTAL CAPITAL

FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES GIVEN THE EXTENT THAT

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS HAVE AFFECTED OUR REPORTED RESULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

RESULTS IN A MORE RELEVANT MEASURE FOR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO EVALUATE

PERFORMANCE OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, AND TO EVALUATE

AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS WITH THE ONGOING

OPERATIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES.

THIS IS A USEFUL COMPARISON TO A GAAP-BASED RATIO OF DEBT TO EQUITY BECAUSE CASH

BALANCES MAY BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT AND BECAUSE THIS LONG-TERM DEBT HAS

EQUITY-LIKE CHARACTERISTICS. THE USEFULNESS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE MAY BE

LIMITED, HOWEVER, AS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AT ANY POINT IN

TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNT THAT COULD PRACTICALLY BE APPLIED TO

REDUCE OUTSTANDING DEBT, AND IT MAY NOT BE ADVANTAGEOUS OR PRACTICAL TO REPLACE

DEBT THAT DOES NOT MATURE FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS WITH EQUITY. ALSO, IN FEBRUARY

2009, THE GE BOARD AUTHORIZED A CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION OF UP TO $9.5 BILLION TO GE

CAPITAL, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE MADE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. THE EFFECT

OF THIS CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION ON GE CAPITAL EQUITY IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE RATIO

ABOVE. DESPITE THESE POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE,

CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE, PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY BE MORE COMPARABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESSES.

DELINQUENCY

RATES ON ON-BOOK AND OFF-BOOK EQUIPMENT FINANCING LOANS AND LEASES INCREASED

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007 TO DECEMBER 31, 2008, AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING WEAKNESS

IN THE ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, DELINQUENCY RATES ON

ON-BOOK EQUIPMENT FINANCING LOANS AND LEASES INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007 TO

DECEMBER 31, 2008, AS A RESULT OF THE INCLUSION OF THE CITICAPITAL ACQUISITION

AND SANYO ACQUISITION IN JAPAN, WHICH CONTRIBUTED AN ADDITIONAL 12 AND 9 BASIS

POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE

INCREASES IN OFF-BOOK AND ON-BOOK DELINQUENCIES FOR CONSUMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES IN THE U.S. FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007 TO DECEMBER 31, 2008, REFLECT THE

CONTINUED RISE IN DELINQUENCIES ACROSS THE U.S. CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

PLATFORMS. THE INCREASE IN ON-BOOK DELINQUENCIES FOR CONSUMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. REFLECTS THE EFFECTS OF THE DECLINING U.K.

HOUSING MARKET. THE INCREASE IN OFF-BOOK DELINQUENCIES FOR CONSUMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES IN THE U.S. FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006 TO DECEMBER 31, 2007, REFLECTED

BOTH A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF THE RECEIVABLES SECURITIZED DURING 2007 – FOR

EXAMPLE, OUR CARE CREDIT RECEIVABLES WHICH GENERALLY HAVE A HIGHER DELINQUENCY

RATE THAN OUR CORE PRIVATE LABEL CARD PORTFOLIO – AS WELL AS THE RISK IN THE

DELINQUENCIES ACROSS THE BROADER PORTFOLIO OF U.S. CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES.

WE

BELIEVE THAT DELINQUENCY RATES ON MANAGED FINANCING RECEIVABLES PROVIDE A USEFUL

PERSPECTIVE OF OUR PORTFOLIO QUALITY AND ARE KEY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. WE USE THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES

INFORMATION THAT ENABLES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF CERTAIN FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND

FACILITATES A COMPARISON WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPETITORS. THE SAME

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND ONGOING RISK MONITORING ARE USED FOR BOTH ON-BOOK AND

OFF-BOOK PORTFOLIOS AS THE CUSTOMER’S CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH LOANS

RETAINED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND SECURITIZED LOANS. WE

BELIEVE THAT MANAGED BASIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS,

ENABLING THEM TO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOANS

REPORTED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND OUR RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZED LOANS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT OR CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER PARTY (COUNTERPARTY) THAT IS

DESIGNED TO MEET ANY OF A VARIETY OF RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OR COMMODITY

CERTAIN BUSINESSES WE HAVE SOLD OR COMMITTED TO SELL WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR AND

THEREFORE WILL NO LONGER BE PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. THE NET EARNINGS,

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CASH FLOWS OF SUCH BUSINESSES ARE SEPARATELY

CLASSIFIED ON OUR STATEMENT OF EARNINGS, STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

PROVISION

A TECHNIQUE DESIGNED TO

ELIMINATE RISK. OFTEN REFERS TO THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO

OFFSET CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OR COMMODITY PRICES,

MATCH FUNDING

A RISK CONTROL

POLICY THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR A PARTICULAR FINANCIAL ASSET HAVING THE SAME

CURRENCY, MATURITY AND INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS AS THAT ASSET. MATCH

FUNDING IS EXECUTED DIRECTLY, BY ISSUING DEBT, OR SYNTHETICALLY, THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF DEBT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE

LEND AT A FIXED INTEREST RATE IN THE U.S., WE CAN BORROW THOSE U.S. DOLLARS

EITHER AT A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST OR AT A FLOATING RATE EXECUTED CONCURRENTLY

WITH A PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP. SEE “HEDGE.”

ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. WITH OUR PARTICIPATION, AN EVALUATION OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS CONDUCTED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK AND CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED ON

THIS EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

OUR

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT ON OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THEIR REPORT FOLLOWS.

REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

SHAREOWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY.

WE HAVE

AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF GENERAL ELECTRIC

COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (“GE”) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, AND

THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, CHANGES IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY AND CASH

FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008. WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED GE’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION (“COSO”). GE MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON GE’S

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN

AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS

WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE

A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

(67)

A

COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO

PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF

THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR

OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING ON PAGES 69, 71, 72,

74, 76-141 AND THE SUMMARY OF OPERATING SEGMENTS TABLE ON PAGE 29 PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GE AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2008 AND 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH

OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, IN CONFORMITY

WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, GE

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY COSO.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, GE, IN 2008,

CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND ADOPTED THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, IN

2007, CHANGED ITS METHODS OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES AND FOR

A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME

TAXES GENERATED BY LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS, AND, IN 2006, CHANGED ITS

METHODS OF ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND FOR

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

OUR

AUDITS OF GE’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF

FORMING AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION APPEARING ON PAGES 70, 73 AND 75 IS

PRESENTED FOR PURPOSES OF ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS RATHER THAN TO PRESENT THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND CASH FLOWS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES. THE CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION HAS

BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE AUDITING PROCEDURES APPLIED IN THE AUDITS OF THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND, IN OUR OPINION, IS FAIRLY STATED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS IN RELATION TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS

A WHOLE.

NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE

1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES

OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP).

CONSOLIDATION

OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR AFFILIATES – COMPANIES THAT WE

CONTROL AND IN WHICH WE HOLD A MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. ASSOCIATED COMPANIES

ARE COMPANIES THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL BUT OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, MOST OFTEN BECAUSE WE HOLD A SHAREHOLDER VOTING POSITION OF 20% TO

50%. RESULTS OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE BASIS.

INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO ASSOCIATED COMPANIES ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE

BASIS IN THE CAPTION “ALL OTHER ASSETS” IN OUR STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION,

NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES THAT REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES

INHERENT IN SUCH ASSETS.

FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION

WE HAVE

RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT-YEAR’S

PRESENTATION.

FINANCIAL

DATA AND RELATED MEASUREMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING

CATEGORIES.

·

GE

– THIS REPRESENTS THE

ADDING TOGETHER OF ALL AFFILIATES OTHER THAN GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL

SERVICES, INC. (GECS), WHOSE OPERATIONS ARE PRESENTED ON A ONE-LINE

BASIS.

·

GECS

– THIS AFFILIATE

OWNS ALL OF THE COMMON STOCK OF GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GE

CAPITAL). GE CAPITAL AND ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING GECS COLUMNS AND CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF ITS

BUSINESS.

·

CONSOLIDATED

– THIS

REPRESENTS THE ADDING TOGETHER OF GE AND GECS, GIVING EFFECT TO THE

ELIMINATION OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN GE AND

GECS.

·

OPERATING SEGMENTS

–

THESE COMPRISE OUR FIVE BUSINESSES, FOCUSED ON THE BROAD MARKETS THEY

SERVE: ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, NBC UNIVERSAL,

CAPITAL FINANCE AND CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL. PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION

HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT

ORGANIZATION.

UNLESS

OTHERWISE INDICATED, INFORMATION IN THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS RELATES TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN

PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED. SEE NOTE 2.

THE

EFFECTS OF TRANSLATING TO U.S. DOLLARS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S.

AFFILIATES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN

SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY. ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END

EXCHANGE RATES, WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR

THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS.

PREPARING

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES

BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CURRENT, AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES FUTURE, ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, UNEMPLOYMENT, MARKET LIQUIDITY, THE REAL ESTATE

MARKET, ETC.), WHICH AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES CONTEMPLATE CURRENT

CONDITIONS AND HOW WE EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, AS APPROPRIATE, IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IN 2009 ACTUAL CONDITIONS COULD BE WORSE THAN

ANTICIPATED IN THOSE ESTIMATES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. AMONG OTHER EFFECTS, SUCH CHANGES COULD

RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCREMENTAL LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES, ESTABLISHMENT OF

VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND INCREASED TAX

LIABILITIES.

SALES

OF GOODS AND SERVICES

WE

RECORD ALL SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES ONLY WHEN A FIRM SALES AGREEMENT IS IN

PLACE, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED AND COLLECTIBILITY

OF THE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE SALES PRICE IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

(76)

ARRANGEMENTS

FOR THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOMETIMES INCLUDE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS. MOST

OF OUR MULTIPLE COMPONENT ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN

THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS

USUALLY INVOLVE FUTURE SERVICE DELIVERABLES SUCH AS INSTALLATION, TRAINING OR

THE FUTURE DELIVERY OF ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT. IN SUCH AGREEMENTS, THE AMOUNT

ASSIGNED TO EACH COMPONENT IS BASED ON THE TOTAL PRICE AND THE UNDELIVERED

COMPONENT’S OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED FAIR VALUE, DETERMINED FROM SOURCES SUCH AS

THE SEPARATE SELLING PRICE FOR THAT OR A SIMILAR COMPONENT OR FROM COMPETITOR

PRICES FOR SIMILAR COMPONENTS. IF FAIR VALUE OF AN UNDELIVERED COMPONENT CANNOT

BE SATISFACTORILY DETERMINED, WE DEFER REVENUE UNTIL ALL MULTIPLE COMPONENTS ARE

DELIVERED.

EXCEPT

FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF GOODS UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN (SAB) 104,

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

. WE OFTEN SELL CONSUMER PRODUCTS, HOME VIDEOS AND COMPUTER

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN. WE USE OUR ACCUMULATED

EXPERIENCE TO ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR SUCH RETURNS WHEN WE RECORD THE SALE. IN

SITUATIONS WHERE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS BASED ON

SELLER OR CUSTOMER-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE CRITERIA, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OCCURS OR WE HAVE RELIABLY DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL SPECIFIED

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. IN ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE PROVIDE GOODS FOR

TRIAL AND EVALUATION PURPOSES, WE ONLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE AFTER CUSTOMER

ACCEPTANCE OCCURS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, WE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR ANTICIPATED

LOSSES BEFORE WE RECORD SALES.

CERTAIN

OF OUR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES INVOLVE INCONSEQUENTIAL OR PERFUNCTORY

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS CAN INCLUDE NON-ESSENTIAL

INSTALLATION OR TRAINING, AND IN SOME INSTANCES PROVISION OF PRODUCT MANUALS AND

LIMITED TECHNICAL PRODUCT SUPPORT. WHEN THE ONLY REMAINING UNDELIVERED

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION UNDER AN ARRANGEMENT IS INCONSEQUENTIAL OR PERFUNCTORY,

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE TOTAL CONTRACT AND PROVIDE FOR THE COST OF THE

UNPERFORMED OBLIGATION.

WE

RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON AGREEMENTS FOR SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES UNDER POWER

GENERATION UNIT AND UPRATE CONTRACTS; NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES; LARGER OIL

DRILLING EQUIPMENT PROJECTS; AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS; MILITARY DEVELOPMENT

CONTRACTS; AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION OF

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS IN OUR HEALTHCARE BUSINESS, UNDER AMERICAN

INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP)

81-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR

PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTION-TYPE AND CERTAIN PRODUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS.

UNDER SOP 81-1, WE ESTIMATE TOTAL CONTRACT REVENUE NET OF PRICE CONCESSIONS AS

WELL AS TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS. FOR GOODS SOLD UNDER POWER GENERATION UNIT AND

UPRATE CONTRACTS, NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIES, AERODERIVATIVE UNIT CONTRACTS AND

MILITARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES AS WE COMPLETE MAJOR

CONTRACT-SPECIFIED DELIVERABLES, MOST OFTEN WHEN CUSTOMERS RECEIVE TITLE TO THE

GOODS OR ACCEPT THE SERVICES AS PERFORMED. FOR LARGER OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT

PROJECTS AND LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, WE RECOGNIZE SALES BASED ON OUR

PROGRESS TOWARDS CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN

RELATION TO OUR ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE MEASURE SOP 81-1 REVENUES

BY APPLYING OUR CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE

ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND

REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. WE

PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS

IS PROBABLE.

WE

RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY FOR SALES OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES, MILITARY

PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND RELATED SPARE PARTS NOT SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM PRODUCT

SERVICES AGREEMENTS. DELIVERY OF COMMERCIAL ENGINES, NON-U.S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT

AND ALL RELATED SPARE PARTS OCCURS ON SHIPMENT; DELIVERY OF MILITARY PROPULSION

EQUIPMENT SOLD TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AGENCIES THEREOF OCCURS UPON RECEIPT OF

A MATERIAL INSPECTION AND RECEIVING REPORT, DD FORM 250 OR MEMORANDUM OF

SHIPMENT. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES ARE COMPLEX AEROSPACE EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURED TO CUSTOMER ORDER UNDER A VARIETY OF SOMETIMES-COMPLEX, LONG-TERM

AGREEMENTS. WE MEASURE SALES OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES BY APPLYING OUR

CONTRACT-SPECIFIC ESTIMATED MARGIN RATES TO INCURRED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE

OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINE AGREEMENTS IN

PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT

OPERATIONS. WE MEASURE REVENUE FOR MILITARY PROPULSION EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS

NOT SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC

CONTRACT ON A SPECIFICALLY-MEASURED OUTPUT BASIS. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT

WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON THESE AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE; CONSISTENT

WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, WE MAKE SUCH PROVISION

ONLY IF SUCH LOSSES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE HIGHLY PROBABLE SALES OF

SPARE PARTS FOR THOSE ENGINES.

(77)

WE SELL

PRODUCT SERVICES UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND

ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENTS, PRINCIPALLY IN AVIATION, ENERGY AND

TRANSPORTATION, WHERE COSTS OF PERFORMING SERVICES ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. WE ALSO SELL PRODUCT SERVICES IN HEALTHCARE, WHERE SUCH

COSTS GENERALLY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. THESE AGREEMENTS

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) TECHNICAL

BULLETIN (FTB) 90-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR SEPARATELY PRICED

EXTENDED WARRANTY AND PRODUCT MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS

. FOR THE AVIATION,

ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION FTB 90-1 AGREEMENTS, WE RECOGNIZE RELATED SALES BASED

ON THE EXTENT OF OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS

INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. WE ROUTINELY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES

OF FUTURE COSTS FOR AGREEMENTS IN PROCESS AND REPORT ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF

SUCH ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. FOR THE HEALTHCARE FTB 90-1 AGREEMENTS,

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS AND EXPENSE RELATED COSTS AS

INCURRED. WE PROVIDE FOR ANY LOSS THAT WE EXPECT TO INCUR ON ANY OF THESE

AGREEMENTS WHEN THAT LOSS IS PROBABLE.

NBC

UNIVERSAL RECORDS BROADCAST AND CABLE TELEVISION AND INTERNET ADVERTISING SALES

WHEN ADVERTISEMENTS ARE AIRED, NET OF PROVISION FOR ANY VIEWER SHORTFALLS (MAKE

GOODS). WE RECORD SALES FROM THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF FILMS AS THE FILMS ARE

EXHIBITED; SALES OF HOME VIDEOS, NET OF A RETURN PROVISION, WHEN THE VIDEOS ARE

DELIVERED TO AND AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS; FEES FROM CABLE/SATELLITE

OPERATORS WHEN SERVICES ARE PROVIDED; AND LICENSING OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING WHEN WE MAKE THE MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR AIRING.

GECS

REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME)

WE USE

THE INTEREST METHOD TO RECOGNIZE INCOME ON ALL LOANS. INTEREST ON LOANS INCLUDES

ORIGINATION, COMMITMENT AND OTHER NON-REFUNDABLE FEES RELATED TO FUNDING

(RECORDED IN EARNED INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD). WE STOP ACCRUING INTEREST AT

THE EARLIER OF THE TIME AT WHICH COLLECTION OF AN ACCOUNT BECOMES DOUBTFUL OR

THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 90 DAYS PAST DUE. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST INCOME ON NONEARNING

LOANS EITHER AS CASH IS COLLECTED OR ON A COST-RECOVERY BASIS AS CONDITIONS

WARRANT. WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONEARNING, NON-RESTRUCTURED COMMERCIAL

LOANS ONLY WHEN (A) PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT ACCORDING TO THE LOAN’S

ORIGINAL TERMS AND (B) FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED. WHEN WE AGREE TO

RESTRUCTURED TERMS WITH THE BORROWER, WE RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ONLY WHEN

REASONABLY ASSURED THAT WE WILL RECOVER FULL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS, AND SUCH

LOANS PASS UNDERWRITING REVIEWS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE APPLIED TO NEW LOANS. WE

RESUME ACCRUING INTEREST ON NONEARNING CONSUMER LOANS WHEN THE CUSTOMER’S

ACCOUNT IS LESS THAN 90 DAYS PAST DUE.

WE

RECOGNIZE FINANCING LEASE INCOME ON THE INTEREST METHOD TO PRODUCE A LEVEL YIELD

ON FUNDS NOT YET RECOVERED. ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES AT THE DATE

OF LEASE INCEPTION REPRESENT OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

LEASED ASSETS AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE LEASE AND ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON

INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, WHICH ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY. GUARANTEES OF RESIDUAL

VALUES BY UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES ARE CONSIDERED PART OF MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS.

SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN ESTIMATING RESIDUAL VALUES INCLUDE ESTIMATED

NET CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERM, ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF FUTURE

REMARKETING, AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COMPONENT PART AND SCRAP METAL PRICES,

DISCOUNTED AT AN APPROPRIATE RATE.

WE

RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF

UNDERLYING LEASES.

FEES

INCLUDE COMMITMENT FEES RELATED TO LOANS THAT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO FUND AND

LINE-OF-CREDIT FEES. WE RECORD THESE FEES IN EARNED INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER THE PERIOD TO WHICH THEY RELATE. WE RECORD SYNDICATION FEES IN EARNED

INCOME AT THE TIME RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED, UNLESS SIGNIFICANT

CONTINGENCIES EXIST.

DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION

THE COST

OF GE MANUFACTURING PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED

ECONOMIC LIFE. U.S. ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED USING AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED ON

A SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS FORMULA; NON-U.S. ASSETS ARE GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON

A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

THE COST

OF GECS EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS ON OPERATING LEASES IS DEPRECIATED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER THE LEASE TERM OR OVER THE

ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT.

THE COST

OF GECS ACQUIRED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

TO THE ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OVER THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OR THE ESTIMATED

PROCEEDS UPON SALE OF THE INVESTMENT AT THE END OF THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD

IF THAT APPROACH PRODUCES A HIGHER MEASURE OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

(78)

THE COST

OF INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS IS AMORTIZED IN PROPORTION TO

ESTIMATED TOTAL RELATED SALES; COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET’S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE. WE

REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SEE NOTES 14 AND 15.

NBC

UNIVERSAL FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

WE DEFER

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION COSTS, INCLUDING DIRECT COSTS, PRODUCTION

OVERHEAD, DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND INTEREST. WE DO NOT DEFER COSTS OF EXPLOITATION,

WHICH PRINCIPALLY COMPRISE COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PROGRAM MARKETING AND

DISTRIBUTION. WE AMORTIZE DEFERRED FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION COSTS, AS WELL

AS ASSOCIATED PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS, ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION

BASIS USING THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD’S GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED TOTAL

REMAINING GROSS REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES; WE STATE SUCH COSTS AT THE LOWER OF

AMORTIZED COST OR FAIR VALUE. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL REVENUES AND COSTS ARE BASED ON

ANTICIPATED RELEASE PATTERNS, PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AND HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR

SIMILAR PRODUCTS. WE DEFER THE COSTS OF ACQUIRED BROADCAST MATERIAL, INCLUDING

RIGHTS TO MATERIAL FOR USE ON NBC UNIVERSAL’S BROADCAST AND CABLE/SATELLITE

TELEVISION NETWORKS, AT THE EARLIER OF ACQUISITION OR WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD

BEGINS AND THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. WE AMORTIZE ACQUIRED BROADCAST

MATERIAL AND RIGHTS WHEN WE BROADCAST THE ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS; WE STATE SUCH

COSTS AT THE LOWER OF AMORTIZED COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

LOSSES

ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES

OUR

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF

PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. OUR METHOD OF CALCULATING ESTIMATED

LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE, TYPE AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED

RECEIVABLES. WRITE-OFFS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AND

SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES ARE ADDED. IMPAIRED FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE WRITTEN DOWN

TO THE EXTENT THAT WE JUDGE PRINCIPAL TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE.

OUR

PORTFOLIO CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF HOMOGENOUS CONSUMER LOANS AND OF COMMERCIAL LOANS

AND LEASES. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSESSMENTS WE USE TO

PROVIDE FOR LOSSES ARE CONTINUALLY UPDATED TO REFLECT OUR VIEW OF CURRENT

CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE AND

PROVISION FOR LOSSES. IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPERIENCE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE

DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES.

OUR

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF SMALLER BALANCE, HOMOGENOUS LOANS INCLUDING

CARD RECEIVABLES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES AND RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGES. WE COLLECTIVELY EVALUATE EACH PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON THESE RECEIVABLES IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH A PROCESS THAT

ESTIMATES THE PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BASED UPON STATISTICAL

ANALYSES OF PORTFOLIO DATA. THESE ANALYSES INCLUDE MIGRATION ANALYSIS, IN WHICH

HISTORICAL DELINQUENCY AND CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IS APPLIED TO THE CURRENT

AGING OF THE PORTFOLIO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER ANALYSES THAT REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS

AND CONDITIONS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OVERALL PORTFOLIO INDICATORS INCLUDING

NONEARNING LOANS, TRENDS IN LOAN VOLUME AND LENDING TERMS, CREDIT POLICIES AND

OTHER OBSERVABLE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.

WE WRITE

OFF UNSECURED CLOSED-END INSTALLMENT LOANS AT 120 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE

AND UNSECURED OPEN-ENDED REVOLVING LOANS AT 180 DAYS CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE. WE

WRITE DOWN CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY COLLATERAL OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE WHEN SUCH LOANS ARE 120 DAYS PAST DUE. CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE (BOTH REVOLVING AND CLOSED-END LOANS) ARE WRITTEN DOWN

TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, LESS COSTS TO SELL, NO LATER THAN WHEN THEY

BECOME 360 DAYS PAST DUE. DURING 2007, WE CONFORMED OUR RESERVING METHODOLOGY IN

OUR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS IN BANKRUPTCY

ARE WRITTEN OFF WITHIN 60 DAYS OF NOTIFICATION OF FILING BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

OR WITHIN CONTRACTUAL WRITE-OFF PERIODS, WHICHEVER OCCURS EARLIER.

(79)

OUR

COMMERCIAL LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF LOANS AND LEASES,

INCLUDING BOTH LARGER BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENOUS LOANS AND LEASES AND SMALLER

BALANCE HOMOGENOUS COMMERCIAL AND EQUIPMENT LOANS AND LEASES. LOSSES ON SUCH

LOANS AND LEASES ARE RECORDED WHEN PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE

OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO FOR POTENTIAL SPECIFIC CREDIT OR COLLECTION ISSUES THAT

MIGHT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT. FOR LARGER BALANCE, NON-HOMOGENOUS LOANS AND

LEASES, THIS SURVEY FIRST CONSIDERS THE FINANCIAL STATUS, PAYMENT HISTORY,

COLLATERAL VALUE, INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND GUARANTOR SUPPORT RELATED TO SPECIFIC

CUSTOMERS. ANY DELINQUENCIES OR BANKRUPTCIES ARE INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENT REQUIRING FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF COLLECTIBILITY. WE ROUTINELY RECEIVE

FINANCIAL AS WELL AS RATING AGENCY REPORTS ON OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE ELEVATE FOR

FURTHER ATTENTION THOSE CUSTOMERS WHOSE OPERATIONS WE JUDGE TO BE MARGINAL OR

DETERIORATING. WE ALSO ELEVATE CUSTOMERS FOR FURTHER ATTENTION WHEN WE OBSERVE A

DECLINE IN COLLATERAL VALUES FOR ASSET-BASED LOANS. WHILE COLLATERAL VALUES ARE

NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE, WHEN WE OBSERVE SUCH A DECLINE, WE EVALUATE RELEVANT

MARKETS TO ASSESS RECOVERY ALTERNATIVES – FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REAL ESTATE LOANS,

RELEVANT MARKETS ARE LOCAL; FOR AIRCRAFT LOANS, RELEVANT MARKETS ARE GLOBAL. WE

PROVIDE ALLOWANCES BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION,

INCLUDING EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL, NET OF DISPOSAL

COSTS, AND THE SECONDARY MARKET VALUE OF THE FINANCING RECEIVABLES. AFTER

PROVIDING FOR SPECIFIC INCURRED LOSSES, WE THEN DETERMINE AN ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED IN THE BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO BUT CANNOT YET BE

IDENTIFIED TO A SPECIFIC LOAN OR LEASE. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND

PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY, AND IT IS PREPARED BY EACH RESPECTIVE

LINE OF BUSINESS.

EXPERIENCE

IS NOT AVAILABLE WITH NEW PRODUCTS; THEREFORE, WHILE WE ARE DEVELOPING THAT

EXPERIENCE, WE SET LOSS ALLOWANCES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MOST CLOSELY

ANALOGOUS PRODUCTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO.

WHEN WE

REPOSSESS COLLATERAL IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN, WE WRITE DOWN THE RECEIVABLE

AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. REPOSSESSED COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN THE

CAPTION “ALL OTHER ASSETS” IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CARRIED AT

THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

THE

REMAINDER OF OUR COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LEASES ARE PORTFOLIOS OF SMALLER BALANCE

HOMOGENOUS COMMERCIAL AND EQUIPMENT POSITIONS THAT WE EVALUATE COLLECTIVELY BY

PORTFOLIO FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED UPON VARIOUS STATISTICAL ANALYSES CONSIDERING

HISTORICAL LOSSES AND AGING, AS WELL AS OUR VIEW ON CURRENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS.

PARTIAL

SALES OF BUSINESS INTERESTS

WE

RECORD GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF THEIR OWN SHARES BY AFFILIATES EXCEPT WHEN

REALIZATION OF GAINS IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, IN WHICH CASE WE RECORD THE

RESULTS IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY. WE RECORD GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF INTERESTS

IN COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY ENGINE AND AERODERIVATIVE EQUIPMENT

PROGRAMS.

CASH

AND EQUIVALENTS

DEBT

SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS ARE INCLUDED IN CASH EQUIVALENTS UNLESS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

AND CLASSIFIED AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

INVESTMENT

SECURITIES

WE

REPORT INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND EQUITY

SECURITIES IN OUR INSURANCE PORTFOLIO, AT FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 28 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY, NET OF APPLICABLE

TAXES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR

IMPAIRMENT USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. QUANTITATIVE

CRITERIA INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNT THAT EACH

SECURITY IS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AND, FOR SECURITIES WITH FIXED

MATURITIES, WHETHER THE ISSUER IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH TERMS AND COVENANTS OF THE

SECURITY. QUALITATIVE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND SPECIFIC

PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, AS WELL AS OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY

TO MATURITY OR UNTIL FORECASTED RECOVERY. UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT ARE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

INVESTMENT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS ARE

INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

ALL

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR REALIZABLE VALUES. COST FOR A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GE U.S. INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT

(LIFO) BASIS. COST OF OTHER GE INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS. LIFO WAS USED FOR 40% AND 41% OF GE INVENTORIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. GECS INVENTORIES CONSIST OF FINISHED

PRODUCTS HELD FOR SALE; COST IS DETERMINED ON A FIFO BASIS.

(80)

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS

WE DO

NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT TEST IT AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR

VALUE APPROACH AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. A REPORTING UNIT IS THE OPERATING

SEGMENT, OR A BUSINESS ONE LEVEL BELOW THAT OPERATING SEGMENT (THE COMPONENT

LEVEL) IF DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PREPARED AND REGULARLY REVIEWED BY

SEGMENT MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, COMPONENTS ARE AGGREGATED AS A SINGLE REPORTING

UNIT IF THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE

OF THAT GOODWILL. WE USE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES. WHEN

AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE, WE USE COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES TO CORROBORATE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW RESULTS. WHEN ALL OR A PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT IS

DISPOSED OF, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSITION BASED ON

THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESS DISPOSED OF AND THE PORTION OF THE

REPORTING UNIT THAT WILL BE RETAINED.

WE

AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES UNLESS

SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. THE COST OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ASSET’S ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE,

EXCEPT THAT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

AMORTIZED IN RELATION TO TOTAL RELATED SALES. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND, IF IMPAIRED, WRITTEN

DOWN TO FAIR VALUE BASED ON EITHER DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND

WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AS REQUIRED.

GECS

INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY

BENEFITS

CERTAIN

ENTITIES, WHICH WE CONSOLIDATE, PROVIDE GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS TO

STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES.

OUR

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDE PROVIDING INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE FOR LIFE

AND HEALTH RISKS AND PROVIDING CERTAIN ANNUITY PRODUCTS. THREE PRODUCT GROUPS

ARE PROVIDED: TRADITIONAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND

UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE CONTRACTS WITH

SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY AND/OR MORBIDITY RISKS, WHILE INVESTMENT CONTRACTS ARE

CONTRACTS WITHOUT SUCH RISKS. UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE A

PARTICULAR TYPE OF LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACT WHOSE TERMS ARE NOT FIXED

AND GUARANTEED.

FOR

SHORT-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE, WE

REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME OVER THE TERMS OF THE RELATED AGREEMENTS,

GENERALLY ON A PRO-RATA BASIS. FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS

INCLUDING TERM, WHOLE LIFE AND ANNUITIES PAYABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE ANNUITANT,

WE REPORT PREMIUMS AS EARNED INCOME WHEN DUE.

PREMIUMS

RECEIVED ON INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (INCLUDING ANNUITIES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

MORTALITY RISK) AND UNIVERSAL LIFE CONTRACTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUES BUT

RATHER AS DEPOSIT LIABILITIES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FOR CHARGES AND ASSESSMENTS

ON THESE CONTRACTS, MOSTLY FOR MORTALITY, CONTRACT INITIATION, ADMINISTRATION

AND SURRENDER. AMOUNTS CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNTS ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE.

LIABILITIES

FOR TRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE PRESENT VALUE OF

SUCH BENEFITS LESS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE NET PREMIUMS BASED ON MORTALITY,

MORBIDITY, INTEREST AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AT THE TIME THE POLICIES WERE ISSUED

OR ACQUIRED. LIABILITIES FOR INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES

EQUAL THE ACCOUNT VALUE, THAT IS, THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES TO THE BENEFIT OF THE

CONTRACT OR POLICYHOLDER INCLUDING CREDITED INTEREST AND ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE.

LIABILITIES

FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF

THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATIONS FOR REPORTED AND INCURRED-BUT-NOT-REPORTED CLAIMS AND

THE RELATED ESTIMATED CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPENSES. LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS

AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED THROUGH

CURRENT OPERATIONS.

ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED

CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A

LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION

. AMONG OTHER THINGS, FIN 48 REQUIRES

APPLICATION OF A “MORE LIKELY THAN NOT” THRESHOLD TO THE RECOGNITION AND

DERECOGNITION OF TAX POSITIONS. FSP FAS 13-2 REQUIRES RECALCULATION OF RETURNS

ON LEVERAGED LEASES WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OR PROJECTED TIMING OF

CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LEASES. THE JANUARY 1,

2007 TRANSITION REDUCED OUR RETAINED EARNINGS BY $126 MILLION, $49 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH FIN 48 AND $77 MILLION WITH FSP FAS 13-2. OF THIS TOTAL, $89

MILLION WAS A DECREASE IN GOODWILL AND $77 MILLION WAS A DECREASE IN FINANCING

RECEIVABLES – NET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $40 MILLION DECREASE IN INCOME TAX

LIABILITIES.

ON

JANUARY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED SFAS 155,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

. THIS STATEMENT AMENDED SFAS 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, AS AMENDED, TO INCLUDE WITHIN ITS

SCOPE PREPAYMENT FEATURES IN NEWLY CREATED OR ACQUIRED RETAINED INTERESTS

RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS. SFAS 155 CHANGED THE BASIS ON WHICH WE RECOGNIZE

EARNINGS ON THESE RETAINED INTERESTS FROM LEVEL YIELD TO FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTES 9

AND 30.

WE

ADOPTED SFAS 123 (REVISED 2004),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS

123R) AND RELATED FSPS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. AMONG OTHER THINGS, SFAS 123R

REQUIRES EXPENSING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS, A PREVIOUSLY OPTIONAL

ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WE ADOPTED VOLUNTARILY IN 2002, AND CLASSIFICATION OF

EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS AS CASH

FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. WE CHOSE

THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE NEW GUIDANCE

BE APPLIED TO THE UNVESTED PORTION OF ALL OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTION GRANTS AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2006, AND TO NEW GRANTS AFTER THAT DATE. WE FURTHER APPLIED THE

ALTERNATIVE TRANSITION METHOD PROVIDED IN FSP FAS 123(R)-3,

TRANSITION ELECTION RELATED TO

ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

. THE

TRANSITIONAL EFFECTS OF SFAS 123R AND RELATED FSPS CONSISTED OF A REDUCTION IN

NET EARNINGS OF $10 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, TO EXPENSE THE

UNVESTED PORTION OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2001; AND CLASSIFICATION OF $173 MILLION

RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS AS CASH

FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN OUR STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS BEGINNING IN 2006,

WHICH PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN CASH FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES.

SFAS

158,

EMPLOYERS’ ACCOUNTING FOR

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, BECAME EFFECTIVE

FOR US AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET OR

LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION REFLECTING THE FUNDED STATUS OF

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS SUCH AS RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE,

WITH CURRENT-YEAR CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS RECOGNIZED IN SHAREOWNERS’

EQUITY. SFAS 158 DID NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING CRITERIA FOR MEASUREMENT OF

PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS, PLAN ASSETS OR BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE INCREMENTAL

EFFECT OF THE INITIAL ADOPTION OF SFAS 158 REDUCED OUR SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, BY $3,819 MILLION.

ON

DECEMBER 12, 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP EITF 99-20-1,

AMENDMENTS TO THE IMPAIRMENT

GUIDANCE OF EITF ISSUE NO. 99-20

. THE PRIMARY CHANGE IN REPORTING THAT

RESULTS FROM THE FSP, WHICH WE ADOPTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, IS THE

REQUIREMENT TO ESTIMATE CASH FLOWS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S BEST ESTIMATE RATHER

THAN BASED ON MARKET PARTICIPANT ASSUMPTIONS.

NOTE

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS COMPRISED OUR JAPANESE PERSONAL LOAN BUSINESS (LAKE) AND OUR JAPANESE

MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP IN GE NISSEN

CREDIT CO., LTD. (GE MONEY JAPAN), OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS (WMC), PLASTICS,

ADVANCED MATERIALS, GE LIFE, GENWORTH FINANCIAL, INC. (GENWORTH) AND MOST OF GE

INSURANCE SOLUTIONS CORPORATION (GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS). ASSOCIATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS ARE SEPARATELY REPORTED FOR ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED.

(82)

GE

MONEY JAPAN

DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL LAKE UPON DETERMINING

THAT, DESPITE RESTRUCTURING, JAPANESE REGULATORY LIMITS FOR INTEREST CHARGES ON

UNSECURED PERSONAL LOANS DID NOT PERMIT US TO EARN AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN. AS A

RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $908 MILLION IN 2007. DURING 2008, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE MONEY JAPAN, WHICH INCLUDED LAKE, ALONG WITH OUR

JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP IN GE

NISSEN CREDIT CO., LTD. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, GE MONEY JAPAN

REDUCED THE PROCEEDS ON THE SALE FOR ESTIMATED INTEREST REFUND CLAIMS IN EXCESS

OF THE STATUTORY INTEREST RATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE MAY BE INCREASED OR

DECREASED BASED ON THE ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS

SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT, AND WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED UNLESS CLAIMS EXCEED

APPROXIMATELY $3,000 MILLION. ESTIMATED CLAIMS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO EXCEED THOSE

LEVELS AND ARE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AND THE ESTIMATED

FUTURE REQUESTS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE ABILITY AND LIKELIHOOD OF

CUSTOMERS TO MAKE CLAIMS AND OTHER INDUSTRY RISK FACTORS. HOWEVER, UNCERTAINTIES

AROUND THE STATUS OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND LACK OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL

ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE CLAIMS EXPOSURE. WE REVIEW OUR ESTIMATED EXPOSURE

QUARTERLY, AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS WHEN REQUIRED. TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO

ADJUSTMENTS TO SALE PROCEEDS FOR THIS MATTER. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SALE, AND

PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR JAPANESE MORTGAGE AND CARD BUSINESSES, WE RECORDED AN

INCREMENTAL $361 MILLION LOSS IN 2008. GE MONEY JAPAN REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS WERE $763 MILLION, $1,307 MILLION AND $1,715 MILLION IN 2008, 2007

AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. IN TOTAL, GE MONEY JAPAN LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE $651 MILLION AND $1,220 MILLION IN 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH EARNINGS OF $247 MILLION IN 2006.

WMC

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR U.S. MORTGAGE BUSINESS.

AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $62 MILLION IN 2007. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, WMC RETAINED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO

LOANS SOLD PRIOR TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WMC’S CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TO REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS AS TO WHICH THERE WAS AN EARLY

PAYMENT DEFAULT OR WITH RESPECT TO WHICH CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES WERE NOT MET. RESERVES RELATED TO THESE OBLIGATIONS WERE $244 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND $265 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE AMOUNT OF THESE

RESERVES IS BASED UPON PENDING AND ESTIMATED FUTURE LOAN REPURCHASE REQUESTS,

THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF LOANS VALIDLY TENDERED FOR REPURCHASE, AND OUR

ESTIMATED LOSSES ON LOANS REPURCHASED. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE

ESTIMATE THAT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL LOANS WE ORIGINATED AND SOLD WILL

BE TENDERED FOR REPURCHASE, AND OF THOSE TENDERED, ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT WILL

QUALIFY AS “VALIDLY TENDERED,” MEANING THE LOANS SOLD DID NOT SATISFY SPECIFIED

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THE AMOUNT OF OUR CURRENT RESERVE REPRESENTS OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF LOSSES WITH RESPECT TO OUR REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. HOWEVER, ACTUAL

LOSSES COULD EXCEED OUR RESERVE AMOUNT, IF ACTUAL CLAIM RATES, VALID TENDERS OR

LOSSES WE INCUR ON REPURCHASED LOANS, ARE HIGHER THAN HISTORICALLY OBSERVED. WMC

REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $(71) MILLION, $(1,424) MILLION AND

$536 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. IN TOTAL, WMC’S LOSSES FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE $41 MILLION AND $987 MILLION IN 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH EARNINGS OF $29 MILLION IN

2006.

PLASTICS

AND ADVANCED MATERIALS

DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR PLASTICS BUSINESS TO

SAUDI BASIC INDUSTRIES CORPORATION FOR $11,577 MILLION IN CASH. WE SOLD THIS

BUSINESS BECAUSE OF ITS CYCLICALITY, RISING COSTS OF NATURAL GAS AND RAW

MATERIALS, AND THE DECISION TO REDEPLOY CAPITAL RESOURCES INTO HIGHER-GROWTH

BUSINESSES. ALSO, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE SOLD OUR ADVANCED

MATERIALS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THESE SALES, WE RECOGNIZED AFTER-TAX GAINS OF

$21 MILLION, $1,578 MILLION AND $441 MILLION DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. PLASTICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS WERE $4,286 MILLION AND $8,795 MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. IN TOTAL, PLASTICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS EARNINGS FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE $40 MILLION, $1,867 MILLION AND $959

MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

GE

LIFE

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF GE LIFE, OUR U.K.-BASED

LIFE INSURANCE OPERATION, TO SWISS REINSURANCE COMPANY (SWISS RE) FOR $910

MILLION. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AFTER-TAX LOSSES OF $3 MILLION IN BOTH 2008

AND 2007, AND $267 MILLION IN 2006. GE LIFE REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS WERE $2,096 MILLION IN 2006. IN TOTAL, GE LIFE LOSSES FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WERE $3 MILLION IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007,

AND $178 MILLION IN 2006.

(83)

GE

INSURANCE SOLUTIONS

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES AND THE EUROPEAN LIFE AND HEALTH OPERATIONS

OF GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS TO SWISS RE FOR $9,297 MILLION, INCLUDING THE

ASSUMPTION OF $1,700 MILLION OF DEBT. WE RECEIVED $5,359 MILLION IN CASH AND

$2,238 MILLION OF NEWLY ISSUED SWISS RE COMMON STOCK, REPRESENTING A 9% INTEREST

IN SWISS RE. AS A RESULT OF THE EXIT, WE RECOGNIZED EARNINGS OF $1 MILLION AND

$16 MILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $134 MILLION IN 2006. GE

INSURANCE SOLUTIONS REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $2,815 MILLION IN

2006. IN TOTAL, GE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF

TAXES, WAS $15 MILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH EARNINGS OF $15 MILLION AND $148

MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

GENWORTH

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR REMAINING 18% INVESTMENT

IN GENWORTH THROUGH A SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERING OF 71 MILLION SHARES OF CLASS A

COMMON STOCK AND DIRECT SALE TO GENWORTH OF 15 MILLION SHARES OF GENWORTH CLASS

B COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT OF INITIAL AND SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERINGS, WE

RECOGNIZED AFTER-TAX GAINS OF $3 MILLION, $85 MILLION (PRIMARILY FROM A TAX

ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE 2004 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING) AND $220 MILLION IN

2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. GENWORTH REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS WERE $5 MILLION IN 2006. IN TOTAL, GENWORTH LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, WAS $9 MILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH EARNINGS OF $79

MILLION AND $193 MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

BENEFITS

WE

SPONSOR A NUMBER OF PENSION PLANS. PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS, TOGETHER WITH

AFFILIATE AND CERTAIN OTHER PENSION PLANS (OTHER PENSION PLANS) DETAILED IN THIS

NOTE, REPRESENT ABOUT 99% OF OUR TOTAL PENSION ASSETS. WE USE A DECEMBER 31

MEASUREMENT DATE FOR OUR PLANS.

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS

ARE

THE GE PENSION PLAN AND THE GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN.

THE GE

PENSION PLAN PROVIDES BENEFITS TO CERTAIN U.S. EMPLOYEES BASED ON THE GREATER OF

A FORMULA RECOGNIZING CAREER EARNINGS OR A FORMULA RECOGNIZING LENGTH OF SERVICE

AND FINAL AVERAGE EARNINGS. CERTAIN BENEFIT PROVISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE

BARGAINING.

THE GE

SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN IS AN UNFUNDED PLAN PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTARY

RETIREMENT BENEFITS PRIMARILY TO HIGHER-LEVEL, LONGER-SERVICE U.S.

EMPLOYEES.

OTHER PENSION PLANS

IN 2008

INCLUDED 31 U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS WITH PENSION ASSETS OR OBLIGATIONS

GREATER THAN $50 MILLION. THESE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS PROVIDE BENEFITS TO

EMPLOYEES BASED ON FORMULAS RECOGNIZING LENGTH OF SERVICE AND

EARNINGS.

TO

DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE

CONSIDER CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND

EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE PRINCIPAL PENSION

PLANS, WE APPLY OUR EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN TO A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS,

WHICH STABILIZES VARIABILITY IN THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH WE APPLY THAT EXPECTED

RETURN.

WE

AMORTIZE EXPERIENCE GAINS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PLAN PROVISIONS OVER A PERIOD NO LONGER THAN THE

AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES.

FUNDING POLICY

FOR THE GE

PENSION PLAN IS TO CONTRIBUTE AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET MINIMUM FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS AS SET FORTH IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND TAX LAWS PLUS SUCH ADDITIONAL

AMOUNTS AS WE MAY DETERMINE TO BE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE NOT MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THE GE PENSION PLAN SINCE 1987 AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2009.

IN 2009, WE EXPECT TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS UNDER

OUR GE SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF OUR PRINCIPAL

PENSION PLANS AND EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $690 MILLION TO OTHER

PENSION PLANS. IN 2008, COMPARATIVE AMOUNTS WERE $153 MILLION AND $627 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

ARE

DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES. ACCUMULATED AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

(ABO AND PBO) REPRESENT THE OBLIGATIONS OF A PENSION PLAN FOR PAST SERVICE AS OF

THE MEASUREMENT DATE. ABO IS THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS EARNED TO DATE WITH

OF GECS ON THE CONSOLIDATED LIABILITY IS SETTLED IN CASH AS GE TAX PAYMENTS ARE

DUE.

CONSOLIDATED

U.S. EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES WERE $2,259 MILLION

IN 2008, $8,449 MILLION IN 2007 AND $10,154 MILLION IN 2006. THE CORRESPONDING

AMOUNTS FOR NON-U.S.-BASED OPERATIONS WERE $16,882 MILLION IN 2008, $18,163

MILLION IN 2007 AND $13,134 MILLION IN 2006.

CONSOLIDATED

CURRENT TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES OF

A BENEFIT OF $723 MILLION IN 2008, AND EXPENSES OF $64 MILLION AND $530 MILLION

IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS

OF $3,060 MILLION, $3,042 MILLION AND $1,549 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. CONSOLIDATED DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

WERE A BENEFIT OF $827 MILLION IN 2008 AND EXPENSES OF $776 MILLION AND $1,529

MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

(94)

DEFERRED

INCOME TAX BALANCES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES, AS WELL AS FROM

NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, AND ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX

RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN TAXES ARE ACTUALLY PAID OR RECOVERED.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS REPRESENT AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES

PAYABLE ON TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF

THESE FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE

EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME FROM ALL SOURCES, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF TAXABLE

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, FORECASTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING

STRATEGIES. TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A

DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BE RECOVERED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED. SEE

NOTE 21.

OUR

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE

AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. CHANGES TO THESE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR TAX LIABILITY, RETURN ON INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS

OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GE’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS REDUCED BECAUSE ACTIVE

BUSINESS INCOME EARNED AND INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS

TAXED AT LESS THAN THE U.S. RATE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION

DEPENDS UPON A PROVISION OF U.S. TAX LAW THAT DEFERS THE IMPOSITION OF U.S. TAX

ON CERTAIN ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME UNTIL THAT INCOME IS REPATRIATED TO

THE UNITED STATES AS A DIVIDEND. THIS PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL

TAX NORMS AND PERMITS U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO COMPETE MORE

EFFECTIVELY WITH FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS PROVISION, CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF

2009, HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON FIVE PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, INCLUDING OCTOBER

OF 2008, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXTENDED. IN

THE EVENT THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED AFTER 2009, THE CURRENT U.S. TAX

IMPOSED ON ACTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WOULD INCREASE, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES

TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS. IF THIS PROVISION IS NOT EXTENDED, WE EXPECT OUR

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 2010.

WE HAVE

NOT PROVIDED U.S. DEFERRED TAXES ON CUMULATIVE EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES

AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS

RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WERE APPROXIMATELY $75

BILLION. MOST OF THESE EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN ACTIVE NON-U.S. BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO USE THESE EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

U.S. OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS

NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE

PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. DEFERRED TAXES ARE

PROVIDED FOR EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. AFFILIATES AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES WHEN WE

PLAN TO REMIT THOSE EARNINGS. DURING 2008, BECAUSE THE USE OF FOREIGN TAX

CREDITS NO LONGER REQUIRED THE REPATRIATION OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS, WE INCREASED

THE AMOUNT OF PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS THAT WERE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE

U.S. BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION, RESULTING IN A DECREASE TO THE INCOME TAX

PROVISION OF APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1, ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD,

FIN 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES,

RESULTING IN A $49 MILLION DECREASE IN

RETAINED EARNINGS, AN $89 MILLION DECREASE IN GOODWILL AND A $40 MILLION

DECREASE IN INCOME TAX LIABILITY.

ANNUALLY,

WE FILE OVER 7,500 INCOME TAX RETURNS IN OVER 250 GLOBAL TAXING JURISDICTIONS.

WE ARE UNDER EXAMINATION OR ENGAGED IN TAX LITIGATION IN MANY OF THESE

JURISDICTIONS. DURING 2007, THE IRS COMPLETED THE AUDIT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED U.S.

INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2000-2002. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY AUDITING OUR CONSOLIDATED

U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2003-2007. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER U.S. TAX

DEFICIENCY ISSUES AND REFUND CLAIMS FOR PREVIOUS YEARS REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE 2003-2005 U.S. AUDIT CYCLE WILL BE COMPLETED DURING

THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR BALANCE OF

“UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS” – THAT IS, THE AGGREGATE TAX EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN TAX RETURN POSITIONS AND THE BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE

OUTCOME OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES OR CLAIMS IS LIKELY TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

MADE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES.

(95)

THE

BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, THE AMOUNT OF RELATED INTEREST AND

PENALTIES WE HAVE PROVIDED AND WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE RANGE OF REASONABLY

POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WERE.

INVESTMENT

SECURITIES AMOUNTED TO $41,446 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED WITH

$45,276 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. MOST OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES RELATE

TO OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND OUR ISSUANCES OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT

CONTRACTS.

OF OUR

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD

APPROXIMATELY $1,310 MILLION OF EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT,

PRIMARILY SUPPORTING OUR GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, A MAJORITY OF WHICH

HAVE RECEIVED INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. OF

THE TOTAL RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT EXPOSURE, $1,093 MILLION WAS INSURED BY

MONOLINE INSURERS. OUR SUBPRIME INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE COLLATERALIZED

PRIMARILY BY POOLS OF INDIVIDUAL, DIRECT MORTGAGE LOANS, NOT OTHER STRUCTURED

PRODUCTS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, A MAJORITY OF

EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME CREDIT WAS INVESTMENT SECURITIES WITH

UNDERLYING LOANS ORIGINATED IN 2006 AND 2005. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD

APPROXIMATELY $2,853 MILLION OF EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL, REGIONAL AND FOREIGN

BANKS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, WITH ASSOCIATED

UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $373 MILLION.

WE

PRESENTLY INTEND TO HOLD OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES THAT ARE IN AN UNREALIZED

LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AT LEAST UNTIL WE CAN RECOVER THEIR

RESPECTIVE AMORTIZED COST. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD OUR DEBT SECURITIES UNTIL

THEIR MATURITIES. IN REACHING THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO RESEARCH BY OUR

INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGERS. WITH RESPECT TO CORPORATE BONDS, WE

PLACED GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE ISSUERS. WITH RESPECT TO

RMBS AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS), WE PLACED GREATER

EMPHASIS ON OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CASH FLOWS FROM THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL, AND WITH RESPECT TO RMBS, WE CONSIDERED THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS, PRINCIPALLY MONOLINE INSURANCE.

VALUE.

(B)

INCLUDED

LOANS AND FINANCING LEASES OF $13,078 MILLION AND $11,685 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

AT AVIATION FINANCIAL SERVICES.

(C)

INCLUDED

LOANS AND FINANCING LEASES OF $4,031 MILLION AND $5,106 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED,

LIQUIDATING SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES.

GECS

FINANCING RECEIVABLES INCLUDE BOTH LOANS AND FINANCING LEASES. LOANS REPRESENT

TRANSACTIONS IN A VARIETY OF FORMS, INCLUDING REVOLVING CHARGE AND CREDIT,

MORTGAGES, INSTALLMENT LOANS, INTERMEDIATE-TERM LOANS AND REVOLVING LOANS

SECURED BY BUSINESS ASSETS. THE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES LOANS CARRIED AT THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT ON WHICH FINANCE CHARGES ARE BILLED PERIODICALLY, AND LOANS

CARRIED AT GROSS BOOK VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES FINANCE CHARGES.

INVESTMENT

IN FINANCING LEASES CONSISTS OF DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES OF

AIRCRAFT, RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK, AUTOS, OTHER TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, DATA

PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND OTHER

MANUFACTURING, POWER GENERATION, AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT AND

FACILITIES.

FOR

FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THE LEVERAGED LEASES AND THE MAJORITY OF THE DIRECT

FINANCING LEASES ARE LEASES IN WHICH GECS DEPRECIATES THE LEASED ASSETS AND IS

TAXED UPON THE ACCRUAL OF RENTAL INCOME. CERTAIN DIRECT FINANCING LEASES ARE

LOANS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS, GECS IS TAXABLE

ONLY ON THE PORTION OF EACH PAYMENT THAT CONSTITUTES INTEREST, UNLESS THE

INTEREST IS TAX-EXEMPT (E.G., CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF STATE

GOVERNMENTS).

INVESTMENT

IN DIRECT FINANCING AND LEVERAGED LEASES REPRESENTS NET UNPAID RENTALS AND

ESTIMATED UNGUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED EQUIPMENT, LESS RELATED

DEFERRED INCOME. GECS HAS NO GENERAL OBLIGATION FOR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTING THIRD-PARTY PARTICIPATION RELATED TO

LEVERAGED LEASES; SUCH NOTES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN

LIABILITIES BUT HAVE BEEN OFFSET AGAINST THE RELATED RENTALS RECEIVABLE. THE

GECS SHARE OF RENTALS RECEIVABLE ON LEVERAGED LEASES IS SUBORDINATE TO THE SHARE

OF OTHER PARTICIPANTS WHO ALSO HAVE SECURITY INTERESTS IN THE LEASED

EQUIPMENT.

(102)

FOR

FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, GECS IS ENTITLED TO DEDUCT THE INTEREST EXPENSE

ACCRUING ON NONRECOURSE FINANCING RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES.

GOODWILL

BALANCES INCREASED $3,694 MILLION IN 2008 FROM NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OF HYDRIL PRESSURE CONTROL ($725

MILLION) AT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL ($643 MILLION) AT

CAPITAL FINANCE, VITAL SIGNS ($594 MILLION) AND  WHATMAN PLC. ($592

MILLION) AT TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, BANK BPH ($470 MILLION) AT CAPITAL

FINANCE, CDM RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, LTD. ($229 MILLION) AT CAPITAL FINANCE AND

CITICAPITAL ($166 MILLION) AT CAPITAL FINANCE. DURING 2008, THE GOODWILL BALANCE

INCREASED BY $599 MILLION RELATED TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR

PRIOR-YEAR ACQUISITIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS WERE

INCREASES OF $267 MILLION AND $171 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2007 ACQUISITIONS

OF OXYGEN MEDIA CORP. BY NBC UNIVERSAL AND SANYO ELECTRIC CREDIT CO., LTD. BY

CAPITAL FINANCE, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2008, GOODWILL BALANCES DECREASED $2,639

MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR.

GOODWILL

BALANCES INCREASED $9,028 MILLION IN 2007 FROM NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OF SMITHS AEROSPACE GROUP LTD.

($3,877 MILLION) BY TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE; VETCO GRAY ($1,379 MILLION) BY

ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE; DISKONT UND KREDIT AG AND DISKO LEASING GMBH (DISKO) AND

ASL AUTO SERVICE-LEASING GMBH (ASL), THE LEASING BUSINESSES OF KG ALLGEMEINE

LEASING GMBH & CO. ($694 MILLION) BY CAPITAL FINANCE; OXYGEN MEDIA ($604

MILLION) BY NBC UNIVERSAL; AND SANYO ELECTRIC CREDIT CO., LTD. ($548 MILLION) BY

CAPITAL FINANCE. DURING 2007, THE GOODWILL BALANCE DECLINED BY $269 MILLION

RELATED TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRIOR-YEAR

ACQUISITIONS.

UPON

CLOSING AN ACQUISITION, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ACQUIRED AND CONSOLIDATE THE ACQUISITION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. GIVEN THE TIME

IT TAKES TO OBTAIN PERTINENT INFORMATION TO FINALIZE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY’S

BALANCE SHEET, THEN TO ADJUST THE ACQUIRED COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES,

PROCEDURES, AND BOOKS AND RECORDS TO OUR STANDARDS, IT IS OFTEN SEVERAL QUARTERS

BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO FINALIZE THOSE INITIAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. ACCORDINGLY,

IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY

REVISED.

WE TEST

GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE

BUSINESS CLIMATE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OUR STATED STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR

CAPITAL FINANCE ENDING NET INVESTMENT, WE RE-TESTED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT

THE REPORTING UNITS WITHIN CAPITAL FINANCE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. IN

PERFORMING THIS ANALYSIS, WE REVISED OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND

DISCOUNT RATES, AS APPROPRIATE, TO REFLECT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. IN EACH CASE, NO IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED.

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN CAPITAL FINANCE ARE CLL, GE MONEY, REAL ESTATE, ENERGY

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GECAS, WHICH HAD GOODWILL BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

OF $12,784 MILLION, $9,081 MILLION, $1,183 MILLION, $2,162 MILLION AND $155

WHEN

INSURANCE AFFILIATES CEDE INSURANCE TO THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS REINSURERS, THEY

ARE NOT RELIEVED OF THEIR PRIMARY OBLIGATION TO POLICYHOLDERS. LOSSES ON CEDED

RISKS GIVE RISE TO CLAIMS FOR RECOVERY; WE ESTABLISH ALLOWANCES FOR PROBABLE

LOSSES ON SUCH RECEIVABLES FROM REINSURERS AS REQUIRED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION “OTHER GECS RECEIVABLES" ON OUR STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION, AND AMOUNTED TO $1,062 MILLION AND $381 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

WE

RECOGNIZE REINSURANCE RECOVERIES AS A REDUCTION OF THE STATEMENT OF EARNINGS

CAPTION “INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, INSURANCE LOSSES AND INSURANCE ANNUITY BENEFITS.”

REINSURANCE RECOVERIES WERE $221 MILLION, $104 MILLION AND $162 MILLION FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

(115)

NOTE

20. ALL OTHER LIABILITIES

THIS

CAPTION INCLUDES LIABILITIES FOR VARIOUS ITEMS INCLUDING NON-CURRENT

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, DEFERRED INCOME, INTEREST ON TAX LIABILITIES,

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, ACCRUED PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUALS, ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION, ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRODUCT

WARRANTIES AND A VARIETY OF SUNDRY ITEMS.

ACCRUALS

FOR NON-CURRENT COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AMOUNTED TO $22,543 MILLION AND

$22,322 MILLION FOR YEAR-END 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDE

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, PENSION ACCRUALS, AND OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT

ACCRUALS SUCH AS DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. THE INCREASE IN 2008 WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN PENSION ACCRUALS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE IN ACCRUED DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FROM NEW

HEALTHCARE SUPPLIER CONTRACTS.

WE ARE

INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS REMEDIATION ACTIONS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTES AS

REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS EXCLUDE

POSSIBLE INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND, WHEN DATES AND AMOUNTS OF SUCH COSTS ARE NOT

KNOWN, ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE COSTS

WITH EQUAL LIKELIHOOD, LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE LOW END OF SUCH RANGE.

UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE STATUS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION

RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SITES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE

OF THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

EXPOSURE.

WE

MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT AT THE DATE OF GRANT USING A

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE

OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $5.26, $9.28 AND $7.99,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN ARRIVING AT THE FAIR VALUE

OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY: RISK-FREE INTEREST

RATES OF 3.4%, 4.2% AND 4.8%; DIVIDEND YIELDS OF 4.4%, 2.9% AND 2.9%; EXPECTED

VOLATILITY OF 27%, 25% AND 24%; AND EXPECTED LIVES OF SIX YEARS AND NINE MONTHS,

SIX YEARS AND TEN MONTHS, AND SIX YEARS AND TWO MONTHS. RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES

REFLECT THE YIELD ON ZERO-COUPON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. EXPECTED DIVIDEND

YIELDS PRESUME A SET DIVIDEND RATE. FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008, WE USED A HISTORICAL FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE FOR THE DIVIDEND YIELD.

EXPECTED VOLATILITIES ARE BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITIES FROM TRADED OPTIONS AND

HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK. THE EXPECTED OPTION LIVES ARE BASED ON OUR

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF EMPLOYEE EXERCISE BEHAVIOR.

THE

TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006 AMOUNTED

TO $45 MILLION, $375 MILLION AND $587 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THERE WAS $251 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO

NONVESTED OPTIONS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE PERIOD OF TWO YEARS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $84 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO

BE RECOGNIZED IN 2009.

STOCK

OPTION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS AMOUNTED TO $69 MILLION IN BOTH 2008

AND 2007, AND $96 MILLION IN 2006. CASH RECEIVED FROM OPTION EXERCISES DURING

2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $353 MILLION, $747 MILLION AND $622 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2008,

2007 AND 2006 WAS $15 MILLION, $131 MILLION AND $203 MILLION,

INTRINSIC VALUE OF RSUS VESTED DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006 AMOUNTED TO $274

MILLION, $181 MILLION AND $132 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THERE WAS $687 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO

NONVESTED RSUS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE

PERIOD OF TWO YEARS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $205 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE

RECOGNIZED IN 2009. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, 1.1 MILLION PSUS WITH A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM OF TWO YEARS, AN AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF

$17 MILLION AND $10 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST WERE

OUTSTANDING.

OTHER

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS AMOUNTED TO $155

MILLION, $173 MILLION AND $130 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE

TOTAL INCOME TAX BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR ALL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS AMOUNTED TO $106 MILLION, $118 MILLION AND $117 MILLION IN 2008,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

WHEN

STOCK OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND RESTRICTED STOCK VESTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ASSUMED TAX BENEFIT AND THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE ACTUAL TAX BENEFIT IS LOWER

THAN THE ESTIMATED TAX BENEFIT, SFAS 123(R) REQUIRES THAT DIFFERENCE TO BE

RECORDED IN EQUITY, TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX

BENEFITS, AS DEFINED BY THE STANDARD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR ACCUMULATED

EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ANY FUTURE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED TAX BENEFITS FOR ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING OPTION AND

RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS.

NOTE

28. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2008, WE ADOPTED SFAS 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

, FOR

ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND NON-FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. SFAS 157 ESTABLISHES A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR

MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS RELATED DISCLOSURES. BROADLY, THE SFAS 157

FRAMEWORK REQUIRES FAIR VALUE TO BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE EXCHANGE PRICE THAT

WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY (AN EXIT PRICE)

IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. SFAS 157 ESTABLISHES A

THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY BASED UPON OBSERVABLE AND NON-OBSERVABLE

INPUTS.

FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO

SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A

MARKET PARTICIPANT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR

THE IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING

ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH DATA,

INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE

IN A HYPOTHETICAL TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

(127)

OBSERVABLE

INPUTS REFLECT MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES, WHILE UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS REFLECT OUR MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. PREFERENCE IS GIVEN TO OBSERVABLE INPUTS.

THESE TWO TYPES OF INPUTS CREATE THE FOLLOWING FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY.

LEVEL 1 –

QUOTED

PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE

MARKETS.

LEVEL 2 –

QUOTED

PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR

IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE; AND

MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS WHOSE INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR WHOSE SIGNIFICANT

VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE.

LEVEL 3 –

SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL ARE

UNOBSERVABLE.

WE

MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO VALUE INSTRUMENTS USING THE BEST AND MOST

RELEVANT DATA AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT REVIEW

VALUATION, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT PRICE VALIDATION FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS.

FURTHER, IN OTHER INSTANCES, WE RETAIN INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDORS TO ASSIST IN

VALUING CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS.

THE

FOLLOWING SECTION DESCRIBES THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WE USE TO MEASURE

DIFFERENT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE.

INVESTMENTS

IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN

AVAILABLE, WE USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1. LEVEL 1 SECURITIES PRIMARILY

INCLUDE PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES.

WHEN

QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNOBSERVABLE, WE USE QUOTES FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING

VENDORS BASED ON RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION

INCLUDING MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES, REFERENCED CREDIT SPREADS AND ESTIMATED

PREPAYMENT RATES WHERE APPLICABLE. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 AND

PRIMARILY COMPRISE OUR PORTFOLIO OF CORPORATE FIXED INCOME, AND GOVERNMENT,

MORTGAGE AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. IN INFREQUENT CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR PRICING

VENDORS MAY PROVIDE US WITH VALUATIONS THAT ARE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE CLASSIFY THE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES IN LEVEL 3.

AS PART

OF OUR ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW

OF OUR PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF AN ACCOUNTING FIRM, TO

VALIDATE THAT THE INPUTS USED IN THAT VENDOR’S PRICING PROCESS ARE DEEMED TO BE

MARKET OBSERVABLE AS DEFINED IN THE STANDARD. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE USED A

COMBINATION OF APPROACHES TO VALIDATE THAT THE PROCESS USED BY THE PRICING

VENDOR IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STANDARD AND THAT THE LEVELS

ASSIGNED TO THESE VALUATIONS ARE REASONABLE. WHILE WE WERE NOT PROVIDED ACCESS

TO PROPRIETARY MODELS OF THE VENDOR, OUR REVIEW INCLUDED ON-SITE WALK-THROUGHS

OF THE PRICING PROCESS, METHODOLOGIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR EACH ASSET

CLASS FOR WHICH PRICES ARE PROVIDED. OUR REVIEW ALSO INCLUDED AN EXAMINATION OF

THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR A SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES, A

PROCESS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO PERFORM FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD. BASED ON THIS

EXAMINATION, AND THE ONGOING REVIEW PERFORMED, WE BELIEVE THAT THE VALUATIONS

USED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE AND ARE APPROPRIATELY CLASSIFIED

IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE VALUATION PROVIDED BY

PRICING SERVICES WAS $26,654 MILLION AND WAS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2. THE

VALUATIONS PROVIDED BY PRICING SERVICES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

WAS INSIGNIFICANT, AND THOSE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL

3.

RETAINED

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT

CONSIDERS THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION AND ESTIMATED NET

CREDIT EXPOSURE, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DISCOUNT RATES AND EXPECTED LIFE.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PRICED USING NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AND RETAINED

INTERESTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. WE USE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES AS OUR

PRIMARY BASIS FOR VALUATION WHEN THERE IS LIMITED, OR NO, RELEVANT MARKET

ACTIVITY FOR A SPECIFIC INSTRUMENT OR FOR OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT SHARE SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. WE HAVE NOT ADJUSTED THE PRICES WE HAVE OBTAINED. LEVEL 3

INVESTMENT SECURITIES VALUED USING NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES TOTALED $2,074

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND WERE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 RETAINED INTERESTS TOTALED $6,356 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008.

(128)

WE

RECEIVE ONE QUOTE FOR LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 SECURITIES WHERE THIRD-PARTY QUOTES

ARE USED AS OUR BASIS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. AS IS THE CASE WITH OUR

PRIMARY PRICING VENDOR, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF QUOTES DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO

THEIR PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL CONDUCT INTERNAL REVIEWS OF PRICING FOR ALL SUCH

INVESTMENT SECURITIES AT LEAST QUARTERLY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS OF VALUATIONS

USED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE REVIEWS ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PRICES

THAT APPEAR STALE, THOSE THAT HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRIOR VALUATIONS,

AND OTHER ANOMALIES THAT MAY INDICATE THAT A PRICE MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. WE ALSO

FOLLOW ESTABLISHED ROUTINES FOR REVIEWING AND RECONFIRMING VALUATIONS WITH THE

PRICING PROVIDER, IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE PRICING VENDOR HAS AN

ESTABLISHED CHALLENGE PROCESS IN PLACE FOR ALL SECURITY VALUATIONS, WHICH

FACILITATES IDENTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF POTENTIALLY ERRONEOUS PRICES. BASED

ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUES PROVIDED BY THE

BROKERS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF SFAS 157.

PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS HELD IN INVESTMENT COMPANY AFFILIATES ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT

COST. VALUATIONS ARE REVIEWED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER UTILIZING AVAILABLE

MARKET DATA TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT ANY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE

NECESSARY. SUCH MARKET DATA INCLUDE ANY COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANY TRADING

MULTIPLES. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE COMPANY-SPECIFIC FUNDAMENTALS AND OTHER

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS IN THAT SECURITY. OUR VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IS APPLIED CONSISTENTLY, AND THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY

INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3.

DERIVATIVES

WE USE

CLOSING PRICES FOR DERIVATIVES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE TRADED EITHER ON

EXCHANGES OR LIQUID OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

THE

MAJORITY OF OUR DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO IS VALUED USING INTERNAL MODELS. THE

MODELS MAXIMIZE THE USE OF MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE

CURVES AND BOTH FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2 PRIMARILY REPRESENT

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 PRIMARILY REPRESENT INTEREST RATE

PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY OR PREPAYMENT FEATURES.

LOANS

WHEN

AVAILABLE, WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICING ON RECENT CLOSED

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, TO VALUE LOANS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2. WHEN THIS

DATA IS UNOBSERVABLE, WE USE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USING CURRENT MARKET

INTEREST RATE DATA ADJUSTED FOR INHERENT CREDIT RISK, AND SUCH LOANS ARE

INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3. WHEN APPROPRIATE, LOANS ARE VALUED USING COLLATERAL VALUES

AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2008, WE ADOPTED SFAS 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

. UPON ADOPTION, WE ELECTED TO REPORT

$172 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AT FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM ON

THE SAME ACCOUNTING BASIS (MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS) AS THE

DERIVATIVES ECONOMICALLY HEDGING THESE LOANS.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ARE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES OF $21,967 MILLION, PRIMARILY SUPPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO ANNUITANTS

AND POLICYHOLDERS IN OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE OPERATIONS, AND $8,190 MILLION

SUPPORTING OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. SUCH

SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY INVESTMENT GRADE. IN ADDITION, THE TABLE INCLUDES

$12,642 MILLION AND $5,236 MILLION OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

RESPECTIVELY, WITH HIGHLY RATED COUNTERPARTIES, PRIMARILY USED FOR RISK

MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. ALSO INCLUDED ARE RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

TOTALING $6,356 MILLION.

DERIVATIVES

AND HEDGING

WE

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN DIVERSE MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING

COUNTRIES WHERE OBTAINING LOCAL FUNDING IS SOMETIMES INEFFICIENT. THE NATURE OF

OUR ACTIVITIES EXPOSES US TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. WE MANAGE SUCH RISKS USING VARIOUS TECHNIQUES INCLUDING ISSUING DEBT

WHOSE TERMS CORRESPOND TO TERMS OF THE FUNDED ASSETS, AS WELL AS COMBINATIONS OF

DEBT AND DERIVATIVES THAT ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS

COMMODITY PRICE RISKS AND ADDRESS CERTAIN OF THESE RISKS WITH COMMODITY

CONTRACTS. BY POLICY, WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVES FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. WE

VALUE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT EXCHANGE-TRADED WITH INTERNAL MARKET-BASED

VALUATION MODELS. WHEN NECESSARY, WE ALSO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM OUR DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTIES TO VALIDATE OUR MODELS AND TO VALUE THE FEW PRODUCTS THAT OUR

INTERNAL MODELS DO NOT ADDRESS.

WE USE

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE

THE VARIABILITY OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABLE RATE

BORROWINGS AND COMMERCIAL PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING COMMODITIES.

WE USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS AND INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

FORWARDS TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE CHANGES ON LOCAL AND NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIXED-RATE

BORROWINGS AND CERTAIN TYPES OF FIXED-RATE ASSETS. WE USE CURRENCY SWAPS AND

FORWARDS TO PROTECT OUR NET INVESTMENTS IN GLOBAL OPERATIONS CONDUCTED IN

NON-U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCIES. WE INTEND ALL OF THESE POSITIONS TO QUALIFY AS

HEDGES AND TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES.

(132)

WE USE

SWAPS, FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS, INCLUDING CAPS, FLOORS AND COLLARS, AS

ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND EQUITY

PRICES ON CERTAIN TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE SOMETIMES USE CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE THE CREDIT RISK OF VARIOUS COUNTERPARTIES

WITH WHICH WE HAVE ENTERED INTO LOAN OR LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE OCCASIONALLY

OBTAIN EQUITY WARRANTS AS PART OF SOURCING OR FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. ALTHOUGH

THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE DERIVATIVES, THEIR ECONOMIC RISKS ARE SIMILAR TO, AND

MANAGED ON THE SAME BASIS AS, RISKS OF OTHER EQUITY INSTRUMENTS WE HOLD. THESE

INSTRUMENTS ARE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS.

PRIMARILY RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE INITIAL CREDIT SPREAD

IN 2008,

2007 AND 2006, WE RECOGNIZED INSIGNIFICANT GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO HEDGED

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT DID NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF

THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED PERIOD.

GUARANTEES

OF DERIVATIVES

WE DO

NOT SELL CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS; HOWEVER, AS A PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

SERVICES, WE PROVIDE PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES TO THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS RELATED TO PLAIN VANILLA INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN

CUSTOMERS RELATED TO VARIABLE RATE LOANS WE HAVE EXTENDED TO THEM. THE

UNDERWRITING RISK INHERENT IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS IS ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR TO THAT

OF A FIXED RATE LOAN. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE GUARANTEE IS SECURED,

USUALLY BY THE ASSET BEING PURCHASED OR FINANCED, OR BY OTHER ASSETS OF THE

GUARANTEED PARTY. IN ADDITION, THESE AGREEMENTS ARE UNDERWRITTEN TO PROVIDE FOR

COLLATERAL VALUE THAT EXCEEDS THE COMBINATION OF THE LOAN AMOUNT AND THE INITIAL

EXPECTED FUTURE EXPOSURE OF THE DERIVATIVE. THESE CREDIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS

MATURE ON THE SAME DATE AS THE RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS

AND ARE ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES. THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR GUARANTEE IS $28 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. BECAUSE WE ARE

GUARANTEEING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CUSTOMER UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR

EXPOSURE TO LOSS AT ANY POINT IN TIME IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

CUSTOMER’S DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE IN A LIABILITY POSITION. THE AGGREGATE

TERMINATION VALUE OF SUCH CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WAS $386 MILLION

BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF ANY OFFSETTING EFFECT OF COLLATERAL. AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, COLLATERAL VALUE WAS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE LOAN AMOUNT AND THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE CUSTOMER’S DERIVATIVE, IN THE EVENT WE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO

PERFORM UNDER THE GUARANTEE. IF WE ASSUMED THAT, ON JANUARY 1, 2009, INTEREST

RATES MOVED UNFAVORABLY BY 100 BASIS POINTS ACROSS THE YIELD CURVE (A “PARALLEL

SHIFT” IN THAT CURVE), THE EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH CONTRACTS, WITHOUT

CONSIDERING ANY POTENTIAL OFFSET OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WOULD HAVE BEEN

AN INCREASE OF $161 MILLION. GIVEN OUR STRICT UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, WE BELIEVE

THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE GUARANTEE IS

REMOTE.

ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REGARDING OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 18 AND NOTE

23.

COUNTERPARTY

CREDIT RISK

WE

MANAGE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL DEFAULT AND

NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO US ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS, ON AN

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS. THUS, WHEN A LEGAL RIGHT OF OFFSET EXISTS, WE NET

CERTAIN EXPOSURES BY COUNTERPARTY AND INCLUDE THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL TO

DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF ENSUING EXPOSURE. WHEN NET EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY,

BASED ON THE CURRENT MARKET VALUES OF AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL, EXCEEDS CREDIT

EXPOSURE LIMITS (SEE FOLLOWING TABLE), WE TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE EXPOSURE. SUCH

ACTIONS INCLUDE PROHIBITING ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY,

REQUIRING COLLATERAL FROM THE COUNTERPARTY (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND TERMINATING

OR RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS.

(133)

SWAPS

ARE REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED UNDER MASTER AGREEMENTS CONTAINING MUTUAL CREDIT

DOWNGRADE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE ASSIGNMENT OR

TERMINATION IN THE EVENT EITHER PARTY IS DOWNGRADED BELOW A3 OR A–. IN CERTAIN

CASES WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT PROVIDE US WITH THE

RIGHT TO HOLD COLLATERAL (CASH OR U.S. TREASURY OR OTHER HIGHLY-RATED

SECURITIES) WHEN THE CURRENT MARKET VALUE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS EXCEEDS A

SPECIFIED LIMIT. WE EVALUATE CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES AND COMPLIANCE WITH CREDIT

EXPOSURE LIMITS NET OF SUCH COLLATERAL.

FAIR

VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED

ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN OUR POSITIONS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF

NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND COLLATERAL, WAS ABOUT $1,800 MILLION.

NOTE

30. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE

SECURITIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ARRANGE OTHER FORMS OF ASSET-BACKED FINANCING IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO IMPROVE SHAREOWNER RETURNS. THE

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WE ENGAGE IN ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MANY

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BEYOND IMPROVING RETURNS, THESE SECURITIZATION

TRANSACTIONS SERVE AS FUNDING SOURCES FOR A VARIETY OF DIVERSIFIED LENDING AND

SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE USED BOTH GE-SUPPORTED AND

THIRD-PARTY VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) TO EXECUTE OFF-BALANCE SHEET

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS FUNDED IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND TERM

MARKETS.

INVESTORS

IN THESE ENTITIES ONLY HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE ENTITY AND NOT

TO OUR GENERAL CREDIT, UNLESS NOTED BELOW. WE DID NOT PROVIDE NON-CONTRACTUAL

SUPPORT TO CONSOLIDATED OR UNCONSOLIDATED VIES IN EITHER 2008 OR 2007. WE DO NOT

HAVE IMPLICIT SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY VIES.

(134)

VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES

WHEN

EVALUATING WHETHER WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE AND MUST THEREFORE

CONSOLIDATE THE ENTITY, WE PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE

DESIGN OF THE VIE, THE NATURE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT AND THE VARIABLE INTERESTS HELD

BY OTHER PARTIES. IF THAT EVALUATION IS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHICH PARTY ABSORBS A

MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY’S EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS, A QUANTITATIVE

ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHO IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE LARGEST

SINGLE CATEGORY OF VIES THAT WE ARE INVOLVED WITH ARE QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE

ENTITIES (QSPES), WHICH MEET SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS DEFINED IN U.S. GAAP THAT

EXCLUDE THEM FROM THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION STANDARDS.

CONSOLIDATED

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

UPON

ADOPTION OF FIN 46 AND FIN 46(R) ON JULY 1, 2003 AND JANUARY 1, 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, WE CONSOLIDATED CERTAIN VIES WITH $54.0 BILLION OF ASSETS AND

$52.6 BILLION OF LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE VIES, AND ADDITIONAL VIES CONSOLIDATED AS

A RESULT OF SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS OF FINANCIAL COMPANIES, TOTALED $26,626

MILLION AND $21,256 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES WERE $32,382 MILLION AND $24,342 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY).

THE VIES

INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.

·

SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES THAT HOLD FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS. SINCE

THEY WERE CONSOLIDATED IN 2003, THESE ASSETS HAVE CONTINUED TO RUN OFF;

TOTALED $4,000 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008; AND ARE INCLUDED IN

NOTE 12 ($5,013 MILLION IN 2007). THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND OUR

ON-BOOK RECEIVABLES ON A BLENDED BASIS. THE LIABILITIES OF THESE

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER,

TOTALED $3,868 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND ARE INCLUDED IN NOTE 18

($4,834 MILLION IN 2007). CONTRACTUALLY THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE

FINANCING RECEIVABLES MUST FIRST BE USED TO PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND INTEREST THEREON AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES OF THE

ENTITY. EXCESS CASH FLOWS ARE AVAILABLE TO GE. THE CREDITORS OF THESE

ENTITIES HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE OTHER ASSETS OF

GE.

IF THE

SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL OR THESE ENTITIES WERE REDUCED BELOW

A–1/P–1, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE LIQUIDITY FOR THOSE ENTITIES

OR PROVIDE FUNDS TO RETIRE THE OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE MAXIMUM NET

AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A DOWNGRADE IS

DETERMINED BY CONTRACT, AND TOTALED $3,753 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. AS THE

BORROWINGS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE ALREADY REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL POSITION, THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN OUR DEBT IF THIS WERE TO

OCCUR.

·

TRINITY,

A GROUP OF SPONSORED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, WHICH INVESTS IN A

PORTFOLIO OF MAINLY INVESTMENT-GRADE INVESTMENT SECURITIES USING PROCEEDS

RAISED FROM GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (GICS) IT ISSUES TO INVESTORS

(PRINCIPALLY MUNICIPALITIES). AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THESE ENTITIES HELD

$8,190 MILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, INCLUDED IN NOTE 9, AND $1,002

MILLION OF CASH AND OTHER ASSETS ($11,101 MILLION AND $517 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2007). THE ASSOCIATED GUARANTEED INVESTMENT

CONTRACT LIABILITIES, INCLUDED IN NOTE 19, WERE $10,828 MILLION AND

$11,705 MILLION AT THE END OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

IF THE

LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING OF GE CAPITAL WERE TO FALL BELOW AA-/AA3 OR ITS

SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW A-1+/P-1, GE CAPITAL WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY $3,493 MILLION OF CAPITAL TO SUCH ENTITIES AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, PURSUANT TO LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY GE CAPITAL. TO THE

EXTENT THAT THE ENTITIES’ LIABILITIES EXCEED THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF THE PROCEEDS

FROM THE SALE OF THEIR ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT DRAWN UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT,

GE CAPITAL COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUCH EXCESS AMOUNT. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE VALUE OF THESE ENTITIES’ LIABILITIES WAS $10,749 MILLION AND THE FAIR

VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS WAS $9,191 MILLION (WHICH INCLUDED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON

INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $2,055 MILLION). WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, WE INTEND TO HOLD THEM AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEIR INDIVIDUAL

FAIR VALUES EXCEED THEIR AMORTIZED COST AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD ALL SUCH

DEBT SECURITIES UNTIL MATURITY. AS THE BORROWINGS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE ALREADY

REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, THERE WOULD BE NO

CHANGE IN OUR DEBT IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR.

·

PENSKE TRUCK LEASING CO., L.P.

(PENSKE), A RENTAL TRUCK LEASING JOINT VENTURE. THE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF PENSKE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WERE $7,444 MILLION

AND $1,339 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ($8,075 MILLION AND $1,482 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, RESPECTIVELY). PENSKE’S MAIN CONSOLIDATED ASSET IS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS, INCLUDED IN NOTE 14, WHICH

TOTALED $5,499 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, ($6,100 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2007).

THERE ARE NO

RECOURSE ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN GE AND

PENSKE.

(135)

THE

REMAINING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF VIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ACQUIRED IN TRANSACTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO ADOPTION OF FIN

46(R) ON JANUARY 1, 2004. ASSETS OF THESE ENTITIES CONSIST OF AMORTIZING

SECURITIZATIONS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS ORIGINATED BY ACQUIREES IN AUSTRALIA AND

JAPAN, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN

GE AND THESE ENTITIES.

OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ENTITIES

THE VAST

MAJORITY OF OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED VIES RELATES TO OUR

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES AND IS DETAILED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

OUR

INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED VIES CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.

ASSISTING IN THE FORMATION AND FINANCING OF AN ENTITY, PROVIDING RECOURSE AND/OR

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT, SERVICING THE ASSETS AND RECEIVING VARIABLE FEES FOR SERVICES

PROVIDED. THE CLASSIFICATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OUR VARIABLE

INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY. AS DESCRIBED

BELOW, OUR RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION-RELATED VIES AND QSPES IS

REPORTED IN FINANCING RECEIVABLES OR INVESTMENT SECURITIES DEPENDING ON ITS

LEGAL FORM. VARIABLE INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS AND CORPORATE ENTITIES WOULD BE

CLASSIFIED AS EITHER EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD INVESTMENTS.

IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES IN WHICH WE

ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, BUT MAY HOLD A VARIABLE INTEREST SUCH AS

LIMITED PARTNER EQUITY INTERESTS OR MEZZANINE DEBT INVESTMENT. THESE INVESTMENTS

TOTALED $2,871 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2008 AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN TWO CAPTIONS IN

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, “ALL OTHER ASSETS” INCLUDED

INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR THE COST

METHOD, WHICH TOTALED $1,897 MILLION ($1,089 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007). IN

ADDITION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HELD FINANCING RECEIVABLES, INCLUDED IN NOTE

12, TOTALING $974 MILLION ($567 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007) REPRESENTING DEBT

FINANCING PROVIDED TO THESE VIES. OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS RELATED TO SUCH

ENTITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WAS $4,030 MILLION ($2,559 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2007), AND INCLUDES OUR INVESTMENT IN THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES AND OUR

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO FUND NEW INVESTMENTS BY THE ENTITIES. NONE OF THESE

INVESTMENTS IS INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

WE

TRANSFER ASSETS TO QSPES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS PART OF OUR

ONGOING SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. IN OUR SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, WE

TRANSFER ASSETS TO A QSPE IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH, WHICH IS FUNDED BY BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE QSPE TO THIRD PARTIES AND OUR RETAINED INTERESTS IN THE

ASSETS TRANSFERRED.

THE

FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN OUR QSPES HAVE SIMILAR RISKS AND CHARACTERISTICS TO OUR

ON-BOOK FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND WERE UNDERWRITTEN TO THE SAME STANDARD.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE ASSETS HAS BEEN SIMILAR TO OUR ON-BOOK

FINANCING RECEIVABLES; HOWEVER, THE BLENDED PERFORMANCE OF THE POOLS OF

RECEIVABLES IN OUR QSPES REFLECTS THE ELIGIBILITY SCREENING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE

APPLY TO DETERMINE WHICH RECEIVABLES ARE SELECTED FOR SALE. THEREFORE, THE

BLENDED PERFORMANCE CAN DIFFER FROM THE ON-BOOK PERFORMANCE.

WHEN WE

SECURITIZE FINANCING RECEIVABLES WE RETAIN INTERESTS IN THE TRANSFERRED

RECEIVABLES IN TWO FORMS: A SELLER’S INTEREST IN THE ASSETS OF THE QSPE, WHICH

WE CLASSIFY AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES, AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS

OF THE QSPE, WHICH WE CLASSIFY AS INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

OTHER

THAN THOSE ENTITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ALSO HOLD PASSIVE INVESTMENTS IN RMBS,

CMBS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY ENTITIES THAT MAY BE EITHER VIES OR

QSPES. SUCH INVESTMENTS WERE, BY DESIGN, INVESTMENT GRADE AT ISSUANCE AND HELD

BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF INVESTORS. AS WE HAVE NO FORMAL INVOLVEMENT IN SUCH

ENTITIES BEYOND OUR INVESTMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT WE

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THEM. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH

INVESTMENTS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 9.

NOTE 28. RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN EACH REPORTING PERIOD. THESE

ASSETS DECREASE AS CASH IS RECEIVED ON THE UNDERLYING FINANCING RECEIVABLES.

RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR THE

DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES

THE

QSPES USE DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK BETWEEN THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. AT INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, THE QSPE WILL ENTER INTO

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO RECEIVE A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST AND PAY A FIXED RATE

WITH TERMS THAT EFFECTIVELY MATCH THOSE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSETS HELD. IN SOME

CASES, WE ARE THE COUNTERPARTY TO SUCH DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, IN WHICH CASE A

SECOND DERIVATIVE IS EXECUTED WITH A THIRD PARTY TO SUBSTANTIALLY ELIMINATE THE

EXPOSURE CREATED BY THE FIRST DERIVATIVE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE

OF SUCH DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WAS $752 MILLION ($134 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2007). WE HAVE NO OTHER DERIVATIVES ARRANGEMENTS WITH QSPES OR OTHER

VIES.

SERVICING

ACTIVITIES

AS PART

OF A SECURITIZATION TRANSACTION, WE MAY PROVIDE SERVICING IN EXCHANGE FOR A

MARKET-BASED FEE THAT IS DETERMINED ON PRINCIPAL BALANCES. WHERE THE FEE DOES

NOT REPRESENT MARKET-BASED COMPENSATION FOR THESE SERVICES, A SERVICING ASSET OR

LIABILITY IS RECORDED, AS APPROPRIATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SERVICING ASSET OR

LIABILITY IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT, PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. SERVICING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS IN PROPORTION TO AND OVER THE

PERIOD OF SERVICING ACTIVITY. THE AMOUNT OF OUR SERVICING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007. WE RECEIVED SERVICING FEES

FROM QSPES OF $641 MILLION, $566 MILLION AND $381 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY.

WHEN WE

PROVIDE SERVICING AS AN “AAA” RATED PROVIDER WE ARE CONTRACTUALLY PERMITTED TO

COMMINGLE CASH COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES SOLD TO

INVESTORS WITH OUR OWN CASH PRIOR TO PAYMENT TO A QSPE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE BALANCE OWED TO QSPES FROM SUCH COLLECTIONS AND INCLUDED IN CASH AND

EQUIVALENTS WAS $4,446 MILLION ($5,121 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007). BALANCES

OWED BY QSPE TO GE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND INCLUDED IN OTHER GECS RECEIVABLES,

WERE $2,346 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY FOR RECEIVABLE PURCHASES ($3,507 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007).

NOTE

31. COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS,

INCLUDING GUARANTEES

IN OUR

AVIATION BUSINESS OF TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, WE HAD COMMITTED TO PROVIDE

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ON $1,291 MILLION OF FUTURE CUSTOMER ACQUISITIONS OF

AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED WITH OUR ENGINES, INCLUDING COMMITMENTS MADE TO AIRLINES IN

2008 FOR FUTURE SALES UNDER OUR GE90 AND GENX ENGINE CAMPAIGNS. THE GECAS

BUSINESS OF CAPITAL FINANCE HAD PLACED MULTIPLE-YEAR ORDERS FOR VARIOUS BOEING,

AIRBUS AND OTHER AIRCRAFT WITH LIST PRICES APPROXIMATING $17,248 MILLION AND

SECONDARY ORDERS WITH AIRLINES FOR USED AIRCRAFT OF APPROXIMATELY $1,653 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, NBC UNIVERSAL HAD $8,102 MILLION OF COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE

FILM AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING U.S. TELEVISION RIGHTS TO FUTURE

OLYMPIC GAMES AND NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE GAMES, CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS UNDER

VARIOUS CREATIVE TALENT ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIOUS OTHER ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRING

PAYMENTS THROUGH 2014.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE WERE COMMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS

BEYOND THOSE PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. SEE NOTE

30.

(139)

·

CREDIT SUPPORT.

WE HAVE

PROVIDED $9,151 MILLION OF CREDIT SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

OR ASSOCIATED COMPANIES, PREDOMINANTLY JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS,

USING ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE

GUARANTEES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ENABLE THESE CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATED

COMPANIES TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS OR OBTAIN DESIRED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

WITH THIRD PARTIES. SHOULD THE CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY FAIL TO

PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, WE

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THEIR BEHALF. UNDER MOST SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS, OUR GUARANTEE IS SECURED, USUALLY BY THE ASSET BEING

PURCHASED OR FINANCED, BUT POSSIBLY BY CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS OF THE

CUSTOMER OR ASSOCIATED COMPANY. THE LENGTH OF THESE CREDIT SUPPORT

ARRANGEMENTS PARALLELS THE LENGTH OF THE RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR

TRANSACTIONS. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CREDIT SUPPORT WAS $72 MILLION FOR

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

·

INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS.

THESE ARE AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO FUND UP TO $693

MILLION UNDER RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES ON A VARIETY OF LEASED EQUIPMENT.

UNDER MOST OF OUR RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES, OUR COMMITMENT IS SECURED BY

THE LEASED ASSET AT TERMINATION OF THE LEASE. THE LIABILITY FOR THESE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WAS $332 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. WE HAD

$1,742 MILLION OF OTHER INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS ARISING PRIMARILY FROM

SALES OF BUSINESSES OR ASSETS.

·

CONTINGENT

CONSIDERATION.

THESE ARE AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

CONSIDERATION IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO THE SELLER IF CONTRACTUALLY

SPECIFIED CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE ACQUIRED ENTITY ARE ACHIEVED. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD TOTAL MAXIMUM EXPOSURE FOR FUTURE ESTIMATED

PAYMENTS OF $118 MILLION, OF WHICH NONE WAS EARNED AND

PAYABLE.

OUR

GUARANTEES ARE PROVIDED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE UNDERWRITE THESE

GUARANTEES CONSIDERING ECONOMIC, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK OF THE COUNTERPARTY.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

LIQUIDITY. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR GUARANTEES AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE,

GENERALLY THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVED, OR IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE A PREMIUM,

THE AMOUNT BASED ON APPRAISAL, OBSERVED MARKET VALUES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

ANY ASSOCIATED EXPECTED RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER

RECEIVABLES, NOT NETTED AGAINST THE LIABILITIES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE CALLED UPON TO

PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IS REMOTE.

PRODUCT

WARRANTIES

WE

PROVIDE FOR ESTIMATED PRODUCT WARRANTY EXPENSES WHEN WE SELL THE RELATED

PRODUCTS. BECAUSE WARRANTY ESTIMATES ARE FORECASTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE BEST
