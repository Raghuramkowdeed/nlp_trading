<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE is one of the
largest and most diversified industrial corporations in the world. GE has
engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety of products
for the generation, transmission, distribution, control and utilization of
electricity since its incorporation in 1892. Over the years, GE has developed or
acquired new technologies and services that have broadened considerably the
scope of its activities.</font></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE's products
include major appliances; lighting products; industrial automation products;
medical diagnostic imaging equipment; motors; electrical distribution and

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE's services
include product services; electrical product supply houses; electrical apparatus
installation, engineering, repair and rebuilding services; and computer-related
information services. Through its affiliate, the National Broadcasting Company,
Inc., GE delivers network television services, operates television stations, and
provides cable, Internet and multimedia programming and distribution services.
Through another affiliate, General Electric Capital Services, Inc., GE offers a
broad array of financial and other services including consumer financing,
commercial and industrial financing, real estate financing, asset management and
leasing, mortgage services, consumer savings and insurance services, specialty
insurance and reinsurance, and satellite communications.</font></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In virtually all of
its global business activities, GE encounters aggressive and able competition.
In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing
technology that requires continuing research and development, as well as
customer, commitments. With respect to manufacturing operations, management
believes that, in general, GE is one of the leading firms in most of the major
industries in which it participates. The NBC Television Network is one of four
major U.S. commercial broadcast television networks. It also competes with two
relatively new commercial broadcast networks, syndicated broadcast television
programming and cable and satellite television programming activities. The
businesses in which GE Capital Services engages are subject to competition from
various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts,
investment banks, broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer
loan companies, independent finance companies, finance companies associated with
manufacturers, and insurance and reinsurance companies.</font></p>

significantly its non-U.S. activities through majority, minority or other joint
venture interests in companies engaged primarily in manufacturing and
distributing products and providing nonfinancial services similar to those sold
within the United States. GECS financial services operations outside the United

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131<i>, Disclosures About

businesses that are reported as segments under SFAS No. 131 include Aircraft
Engines, Appliances, GECS, Power Systems, Plastics and NBC. The remaining key
businesses do not meet the definition of a reportable segment and have been
aggregated into two operating segments based on common characteristics of their
activities (Industrial Products and Systems, and Technical Products and
Services). For the GECS segment, revenues and net earnings are presented and
analyzed on pages 45-48 of the 2000 Annual Report to Share Owners by the five
major operating activities in which it conducts its business (consumer services,
equipment management, mid-market financing, specialized financing and specialty
insurance). There is appropriate elimination of the net earnings of GECS and the
immaterial effect of transactions between GE and GECS segments to arrive at
total consolidated data. A summary description of each of the Company's
operating segments follows.</font></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Minor" -->
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b><font size="2">Aircraft Engines</font></b></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aircraft Engines
(8.3%, 9.6% and 10.2% of consolidated revenues in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively) produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turboshaft
engines, and related replacement parts for use in military and commercial
aircraft. GE's military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft that
includes fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft. The
CFM56, produced by CFMI, a company jointly owned by GE and Snecma of France, and
GE's CF6 engines power aircraft in all categories of large commercial
aircraft: short/medium, intermediate and long-range. Applications for the CFM56
engine include: Boeing's 737-300/-400/-500 series, the next generation
737-600X/-700/-800/-900 series, and the 737 business jet; Airbus Industrie's
A318, A319, A320, A321 and A340-300 series; and military aircraft such as the
KC-135R, E/KE-3 and E-6. The CF6 family of engines powers intermediate and
long-range aircraft such as Boeing's 747, 767, DC-10 and MD-11 series, as well
as Airbus Industrie's A300, A310 and A330 series. The GE90 engine is used to
power Boeing's 777 series twin-engine aircraft. The GP7000, being designed and
marketed in a joint venture with the Pratt &amp; Whitney division of UTX, is
offered on Airbus Industrie's A380 and the Boeing 747 growth version, although
no firm orders have yet been taken. The business also produces jet engines for
executive aircraft and regional commuter aircraft and aircraft engine
derivatives used for marine propulsion, mechanical drives and industrial power
generation sources. These aircraft engine derivatives are also reported as part
of the Power Systems segment. Maintenance, overhaul and component repair
services are provided for many models of engines, including engines manufactured
by competitors. The business further expanded its product services operations
through acquisitions of the overhaul operations of Varig Airlines in 1998.</font></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worldwide
competition in aircraft jet engines is intense. Both U.S. and export markets are
important. Product development cycles are long and product quality and
efficiency are critical to success. Research and development expenditures, both
customer-financed and internally funded, are also important in this segment.
Potential sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its
technological lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of
advance in the state of the art, by the small number of potential customers and
by the limited number of applicable airframe applications. Sales of product
services (replacement parts and services) are an important part of the business.
Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles,
although cycles for military and commercial engine procurement are different.
Procurements of military jet engines are affected by changes in global political
and economic factors.</font></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with
industry practice, airframe manufacturers support their sales of commercial jet
aircraft from time to time with long-term financing commitments to customers,
and engine manufacturers are often asked to participate in such financings. In
making such commitments, it is GE's general practice to require that it have or
be able to establish an ownership or secured position in the aircraft being
financed. Under such airline financing programs, GE had issued loans and
guarantees (principally guarantees) amounting to $1.2 billion at year-end 2000,
and had entered into commitments totaling $1.5 billion to provide financial
assistance on future aircraft engine sales. Estimated fair values of the
aircraft securing these receivables and associated guarantees exceeded the
related account balances and guaranteed amounts at December 31, 2000. See page
43 of the 2000 Annual Report to Share Owners for information about Aircraft
Engines orders and backlog.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b><font size="2">Appliances</font></b></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
</center>

<font SIZE="2">
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appliances (4.5%, 5.1% and 5.6% of
consolidated revenues in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively) manufactures and/or
markets a single class of product - major appliances - that includes
refrigerators, electric and gas ranges, microwave ovens, freezers, dishwashers,
clothes washers and dryers, water-softening and filtering products, and room air
conditioning equipment. These are sold under GE, Hotpoint, Monogram, and Profile
brands as well as under private brands for retailers and others. GE microwave
ovens, gas and electric ranges, room air conditioners, water softening and
filtering products, and freezers are sourced from suppliers while investment in
Company-owned facilities is focused on refrigerators, dishwashers, electric
ranges and home laundry equipment. A large portion of appliance sales is for
replacement of installed units. Such sales are effected through a variety of
retail outlets. The other principal channel consists of residential building
contractors who install appliances in new dwellings. GE has an extensive U.S.
product services network that provides repair services, expanded service plans,
warranty administration and risk management services.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demand for appliances is
influenced by economic trends such as increases or decreases in consumer
disposable income, availability of credit and housing construction. Competition
is very active in all products and comes from a number of principal
manufacturers and suppliers. An important factor is the degree of product
differentiation achieved through innovation and new product features. GE
Appliances continued to use its Six Sigma new product introduction process to
bring new and differentiated products to the consumer. The business recently
launched the Arctica&#0153; refrigerator, which includes a
number of innovative time-saving features, as well as Prodigy&#0153; and Wizard&#0153;, the industry's first full line of
electronically controlled washing machines. In 1999, the business introduced the
Advantium&#0153; speedcooking oven which cooks oven
quality food in about one-fourth the time of a conventional oven. Highlighting
this revolutionary advance in cooking technology were &quot;best new product of
the year&quot; awards from <i>Business Week</i> and <i>Popular Science</i>. Also
in 1999, the business launched the Triton&#0153; dishwasher, Spectra&#0153; electric range and CustomStyle&#0153;
refrigerator. Quality is also a key element to success in the appliance market.
The Six Sigma quality initiative continues to enable the business to improve the
quality of products to record levels, reduce waste and provide better product
services. Other significant factors include product cost, brand recognition,
customer responsiveness and appliance service capability.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE Appliances continued to grow
e-commerce revenues in 2000, selling approximately $2.9 billion of appliances
electronically and more than $0.7 billion using its state-of-the-art CustomerNet
website. The business has also used web-based technology to improve efficiency
in its procurement process, purchasing more than $1 billion through its
SupplierNet web-site.</p>

and Systems (9.1%, 10.4% and 11.2% of consolidated revenues in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively) encompasses the following businesses: Lighting,
Transportation Systems, Industrial Systems, and GE Supply. Products and services
provided by each of the businesses in this segment are sold primarily to
industrial customers, including original equipment manufacturers, industrial end
users, utilities, electrical contractors, as well as to distributors. These
businesses compete against a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and
service providers. Markets for industrial products and services are diverse,
global and highly price competitive. The aggregate level of economic activity in
markets for such products and services generally lag overall economic slowdowns
as well as subsequent recoveries. In the United States, industrial markets are
undergoing significant structural changes reflecting, among other factors,
increased international competition and pressures to modernize productive
capacity. A description of products and services provided by each of the
businesses in this segment follows.</font></p>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting includes a
wide variety of lamps -- incandescent, fluorescent, high intensity discharge,
halogen and specialty -- as well as outdoor lighting fixtures, wiring devices
and quartz products. Customers for lighting products are diverse, ranging from
household consumers to commercial and industrial end users and original
equipment manufacturers. Markets and customers are global. In 1999, the business
formed GELcore LLC, a joint venture with Emcore Corporation, focusing on the
technology and market development of &quot;white light&quot; LEDs

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GECS businesses are
generally affected by general business and economic conditions in countries in
which GECS conducts business. When overall economic conditions deteriorate in
those countries, there generally are adverse effects on GECS operations,
although those effects are dynamic and complex. For example, a downturn in
employment or economic growth in a particular national or regional economy will
generally increase the pressure on customers, which generally will result in
deterioration of repayment patterns and a reduction in the value of collateral.
However, in such a downturn, demand for loans and other products and services
offered by GECS may actually increase. Interest rates, another macro-economic
factor, are important to GECS businesses. In the lending and leasing businesses,
higher real interest rates increase GECS cost to borrow funds, but also provide
higher levels of return on new investments. For GECS operations that are less
directly linked to interest rates, such as the insurance operations, rate
changes generally affect returns on investment porfolios. Further information
about business and financial risks affecting GECS can be found in its Annual

reported, on March 12, 1993, a complaint was filed in United States District
Court for the District of Connecticut by ten employees of the Company's former
Aerospace business, purportedly on behalf of all GE Aerospace employees whose GE
employment status is or was affected by the then planned transfer of GE
Aerospace to a new company controlled by the stockholders of Martin Marietta
Corporation. The complaint sought to clarify and enforce the plaintiffs' claimed
rights to pension benefits in accordance with, and rights to assets then held
in, the GE Pension Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;). The complaint named the Company,
the trustees of the GE Pension Trust (&quot;Trust&quot;), and Martin Marietta
Corporation and one of its former plan administrators as defendants. The
complaint alleged primarily that the Company's planned transfer of certain
assets of the Trust to a Martin Marietta pension trust, in connection with the
transfer of the Aerospace business, violated the rights of the plaintiffs under
the Plan and applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. The complaint sought equitable and
declaratory relief, including an injunction against transfer of the Plan assets
except under circumstances and protections, if any, approved by the court, an
order that the Company disgorge all profits allegedly received by it as a result
of any such transfer and the making of restitution to the Trust for alleged
investment losses resulting from the Company's treatment of Plan assets in
connection with the transaction or alternatively the transfer of additional
assets from the Trust to a new Martin Marietta pension trust, and an order
requiring Martin Marietta to continue to offer transferred employees all accrued
pension-related benefits for which they were eligible under the Plan as of the
closing date of the transfer of the GE Aerospace business to Martin Marietta. On
March 23, 1993, the Company and Martin Marietta Corporation filed motions to
dismiss the complaint on the basis that the complaint does not state any claim
upon which relief can be granted as a matter of law. On April 2, 1993, the
transfer of the Aerospace business occurred, and on June 7, 1993, the court
issued an order denying plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief. On September
26, 1996, the District Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss those claims
which were based on allegations that the transfer of plan assets was unlawful,
and ordered discovery on the remaining claims. On September 28, 1998, the class
was certified as to the remaining claims. On March 29, 2000, the District Court
dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs filed an appeal from the District Court's
order. On March 2, 2001, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held in favor of GE
on all counts and affirmed the District Court's rulings.</font></p>

previously reported, the directors serving on the Board in 1991 and certain

Company as a shareholder derivative action by Leslie McNeil, Harold Sachs, Arun
Shingala and Paul and Harriet Luts (the McNeil action) in New York State Supreme
Court on November 19, 1991. The suit alleges the Company was negligent and
engaged in fraud in connection with the design and construction of containment
systems for nuclear power plants and contends that, as a result, GE has incurred
significant financial liabilities and is potentially exposed to additional
liabilities from claims brought by the Company's customers. The suit alleges
breach of fiduciary duty by the defendants and seeks unspecified compensatory
damages and other relief. On March 31, 1992, the defendants filed motions to
dismiss the suit. On September 28, 1992, the court denied the motions as
premature but ruled that they may be renewed after the completion of limited
discovery. Defendants moved for reconsideration of that order, and on April 3,
1993, the court granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and directed
that discovery be stayed pending the filing of an amended complaint. Plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint on March 18, 1994, alleging breach of fiduciary duty,
waste and indemnification claims. On June 5, 2000, the court dismissed the
amended complaint, and on July 11, 2000, the plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal. The Company and the defendants believe the plaintiffs' claims are

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

The financial data in this report, including the audited financial statements,
have been prepared by management using the best available information and
applying judgment. Accounting principles used in preparing the financial
statements are those that are generally accepted in the United States of
America.

     Management believes that a sound, dynamic system of internal financial
controls that balances benefits and costs provides a vital ingredient for the
Company's Six Sigma Quality initiative as well as the best safeguard for Company
assets. Professional financial managers are responsible for implementing and
overseeing the financial control system, reporting on management's stewardship
of the assets entrusted to it by share owners and maintaining accurate records.

     GE is dedicated to the highest standards of integrity, ethics and social
responsibility. This dedication is reflected in written policy statements
covering, among other subjects, environmental protection, potentially
conflicting outside interests of employees, compliance with antitrust laws,
proper business practices, and adherence to the highest standards of conduct and
practices in transactions with customers, including the U.S. government.
Management continually emphasizes to all employees that even the appearance of
impropriety can erode public confidence in the Company. Ongoing education and
communication programs and review activities, such as those conducted by the
Company's Policy Compliance Review Board, are designed to create a strong
compliance culture--one that encourages employees to raise their policy
questions and concerns and that prohibits retribution for doing so.

     KPMG LLP, independent auditors, provide an objective, independent review of
management's discharge of its obligations relating to the fairness of reporting
of operating results and financial condition. Their report for 2000 appears
below.

     The Audit Committee of the Board (consisting solely of Directors from
outside GE) maintains an ongoing appraisal--on behalf of share owners--of the
activities and independence of the Company's independent auditors, the
activities of its audit staff, financial reporting process, internal financial
controls and compliance with key Company policies.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


TO SHARE OWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY

We have audited the financial statements of General Electric Company and
consolidated affiliates as listed in Item 14 (a)1 on page 21. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of General Electric Company and
consolidated affiliates at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

General Electric Company's consolidated financial statements represent the
combination of the Company's manufacturing and nonfinancial services businesses
(&quot;GE&quot;) and the accounts of General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (&quot;GECS&quot;). See
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which explains how the various
financial data are presented.

   Management's Discussion of Operations is presented in three parts:
Consolidated Operations, Segment Operations and International Operations.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

General Electric Company achieved record revenues, earnings and cash generation
in 2000, demonstrating the benefits of its continuing emphasis on globalization,
growth in services, Six Sigma Quality and e-Business.

   Revenues rose 16% to a record $129.9 billion in 2000, compared with $111.6
billion in 1999, which was 11% higher than the $100.5 billion reported in 1998.
The improvements in revenues over the three-year period reflect continued growth
from global activities and services.

   Earnings increased to a record $12,735 million, a 19% increase from $10,717
million reported in 1999. Earnings per share increased to $1.27 during 2000, up
19% from the prior year's $1.07 (except as otherwise noted, earnings per share
are presented on a diluted basis). Earnings in 1999 rose 15% from $9,296 million
in 1998. In 1999, earnings per share increased 15% from $0.93 in 1998.

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (&quot;FASB&quot;) has issued, then subsequently
amended, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&quot;SFAS&quot;) No. 133,
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, effective for GE
on January 1, 2001. Upon adoption, all derivative instruments (including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) will be recognized in the
balance sheet at their fair values; changes in such fair values must be
recognized immediately in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met.
Effects of qualifying changes in fair value will be recorded in equity pending
recognition in earnings as offsets to the related earnings effects of the hedged
items. Management estimates that, at January 1, 2001, the effects on its
consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS No. 133, as amended, will be
a one-time reduction of net earnings of less than $0.5 billion, and a one-time
reduction of equity, excluding the net earnings effect, of less than $1.0
billion. The precise transition effect is uncertain because the accounting for
certain derivatives and hedging relationships in accordance with SFAS No. 133 is
subject to further interpretation by the FASB.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED in 2000 amounted to $5,647 million. Per-share dividends of
$0.57 were up 17% from 1999, following a 17% increase from the preceding year.
GE has rewarded its share owners with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth.
The chart above illustrates that GE's dividend growth for the past five years
has significantly outpaced dividend growth of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 stock index.

RETURN ON AVERAGE SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY was 27.5% in 2000, up from 26.8% and
25.7% in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

   Except as otherwise noted, the analysis in the remainder of this section
presents GE results with GECS reported on an equity basis.

GE TOTAL REVENUES were $69.5 billion in 2000, compared with $60.9 billion in
1999 and $56.0 billion in 1998.

*  GE sales of goods and services were $63.8 billion in 2000, an increase of 15%
   from 1999, which in turn was 8% higher than in 1998. Volume was about 16%
   higher in 2000, reflecting growth across most businesses during the year, led

   by strong double-digit increases at Power Systems and Medical Systems. While
   overall selling prices were down slightly in 2000, the effects of selling
   prices on sales in various businesses differed markedly. The net effect of
   exchange rates on sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar
   also negatively affected revenues. Volume in 1999 was about 10% higher than
   in 1998, with selling price and currency effects both slightly negative.

      For purposes of the financial statement display of sales and costs of
   sales on pages 34 and 35, &quot;goods&quot; is required to include sales of tangible
   products, and &quot;services&quot; must include all other sales, including broadcasting
   and information services activities. An increasingly important element of GE

   sales includes both spare parts (goods) as well as repair services. Such
   sales are referred to by management as &quot;product services.&quot; Sales of product
   services were $16.2 billion in 2000, a 9% increase over 1999 on a comparable
   basis. Increases in product services revenues in 2000 were widespread, led by
   Power Systems, Medical Systems and Transportation Systems. Operating margin
   from product services was approximately $3.9 billion, up 10% from 1999 on a
   comparable basis. The increase reflected improvements in most product
   services businesses and was led by Power Systems, Medical Systems and
   Transportation Systems.

*  GE other income, earned from a wide variety of sources, was $0.5 billion in
   2000, $0.9 billion in 1999 and $0.7 billion in 1998. Comparisons over the
   three-year period are affected by a pre-tax gain of $388 million in 1999
   resulting from the contribution of certain of NBC's media properties to NBC
   Internet (NBCi), a publicly-traded company, in exchange for a noncontrolling
   interest in NBCi.

*  Earnings of GECS were up 17% in 2000, following a 17% increase the year
   before. See page 45 for an analysis of these earnings.

PRINCIPAL COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR GE are those classified as costs of goods and
services sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Two GE
initiatives had significant effects on costs:

*  The Six Sigma Quality initiative has lowered GE's costs by dramatically
   reducing rework, simplifying processes and reducing direct material costs.
   Design for Six Sigma has been a key to the introduction of numerous
   high-quality new products with significantly enhanced features.

*  Costs have also been reduced by the e-Business initiative, a broad-based
   program under which GE is investing in internal infrastructure hardware and
   software that is enabling its businesses to conduct a growing portion of
   their business over the Internet. Benefits from the e-Business initiative
   include improved customer service, expanded product and service offerings and
   increased operating efficiency for both GE and its customers.

Principally because of the funding status of the GE Pension Plan (described in
note 6) and other retiree benefit plans (described in note 5), principal U.S.
postemployment benefit plans contributed pre-tax cost reductions of $1,266
million and $1,062 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, about 6.5% of net
earnings in both years. The present funding status provides assurance of
benefits for participating employees, but future effects on operating results
depend on economic conditions and investment performance.

   Costs and expenses in 1999 included $326 million of unusual charges, the
largest of which resulted from fourth-quarter developments affecting liabilities
associated with past activities at former manufacturing sites that are not part
of any current business segment. Other significant components of unusual charges
included amounts described on page 45 for NBC and costs for rationalizing
certain operations and facilities of GE's worldwide industrial businesses. Major
elements of the restructuring program included costs for employee severance,
lease termination, dismantlement and site restoration. The program was
essentially completed by the end of 2000.

OPERATING MARGIN is sales of goods and services less the costs of goods and
services sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses. GE's ongoing
operating margin reached a record 18.9% of sales in 2000, up from 17.8% in 1999
and 16.7% in 1998. Reported operating margin was 18.6% in 2000, including the
effects of a one-time retirement benefit provision associated with the new labor
agreement. Reported operating margin in 1999 was 17.3% of sales, including the
$326 million of unusual charges discussed in the preceding paragraph. The
improvement in ongoing operating margin in 2000 was broad-based, with
improvements in a majority of GE's businesses, led by Power Systems and Aircraft
Engines, reflecting the increasing benefits from GE's product services, Six
Sigma Quality and e-Business initiatives.

TOTAL COST PRODUCTIVITY (sales in relation to costs, both on a constant dollar
basis) has paralleled the significant improvement in GE's ongoing operating

margin. Total cost productivity in 2000 was 3.6%, reflecting benefits from
improvements in base cost productivity achieved through strong volume growth and
the Six Sigma Quality and e-Business initiatives. Most businesses achieved
improvements in base cost productivity in excess of 5%. Total cost productivity
was 4.2% in 1999, reflecting Six Sigma Quality benefits as well as higher
volume. The total contribution of productivity in the last two years offset not
only the negative effects of total cost inflation, but also the effects of
selling price decreases.

GE INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES in 2000 amounted to $811 million, about
the same as 1999 and slightly lower than the $883 million in 1998. During 2000,
higher average interest rates were more than offset by lower average borrowing
levels. The decrease in 1999 arose from a combination of lower average interest
rates and lower average levels of borrowing.

INCOME TAXES on a consolidated basis were 31.0% of pre-tax earnings in 2000,
compared with 31.2% in 1999 and 31.0% in 1998. A more detailed analysis of
differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate,
as well as other information about income tax provisions, is provided in note 7.

SEGMENT OPERATIONS

REVENUES AND SEGMENT PROFIT FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS are shown on page 44. For
additional information, including a description of the products and services
included in each segment, see note 28.

AIRCRAFT ENGINES reported a 17% increase in operating profit in 2000, on
revenues that were slightly higher than in 1999. The improvement in operating
profit reflected strong productivity. Revenues in 1999 increased 4%, principally
reflecting higher volume in product services. Operating profit increased 19% in
1999 as a result of productivity and growth in product services.

   In 2000, $1.6 billion of Aircraft Engines revenues were from sales to the
U.S. government, about the same as in 1999.

   Aircraft Engines received orders of $13.5 billion in 2000 compared with $12.0
billion in 1999. The $12.0 billion total backlog at year-end 2000 comprised
unfilled product orders of $9.5 billion (of which 57% was scheduled for delivery
in 2001) and product services orders of $2.5 billion to be delivered in 2001.
Comparable December 31, 1999 total backlog was $10.0 billion.

APPLIANCES revenues were 4% higher than a year ago, as volume increases more
than offset lower selling prices. Operating profit also increased 4%, largely as
a result of productivity and higher volume from new products. Revenues in 1999
were 1% higher than in 1998, as volume increases offset lower selling prices.
Operating profit decreased 13% in 1999, reflecting lower selling prices and
increased spending on programs for new products and e-Business.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS revenues increased 3% in 2000, largely as a
result of volume increases at Industrial Systems and growth in product services,
including acquisitions, which more than offset lower selling prices. Operating
profit increased 4%, primarily reflecting productivity and growth in product
services. Revenues rose 3% in 1999, primarily as a result of volume increases at
Transportation Systems, which more than offset lower selling prices. Operating
profit increased 11% in 1999 as strong productivity at Industrial Systems and
Lighting more than offset lower selling prices.

   Transportation Systems received orders of $2.1 billion in 2000, compared with
$1.4 billion in 1999. The $1.4 billion total backlog at year-end 2000 comprised
unfilled product orders of $1.0 billion (of which 78% was scheduled for delivery

Comparable December 31, 1999 total backlog was $1.4 billion.

NBC revenues increased 17% in 2000, reflecting its coverage of the Summer
Olympic Games as well as continued strong growth in cable operations,
particularly at CNBC. Operating profit increased 14% as growth in
owned-and-operated stations, cable operations and network operations was
somewhat reduced by higher license fees associated with renewal of certain
sports and prime-time programs. In 1999, revenues increased 10%, reflecting
higher revenues in NBC's owned-and-operated stations and growth in cable
operations. Operating profit was 17% higher, reflecting a strong advertising
marketplace and improved pricing at the network, excellent results in cable

The notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 56-76 are an integral
part of this statement. &quot;GE&quot; means the basis of consolidation as described in
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements; &quot;GECS&quot; means General Electric
Capital Services, Inc. and all of its affiliates and associated companies. The
segment profit measure for GE's industrial businesses is operating profit
(earnings before interest and other financial charges, and income taxes). The
segment profit measure for GECS is net earnings, reflecting the importance of
financing and tax considerations to its operating activities.

(a)   Includes revenues of $944 million and $789 million in 1997 and 1996,
      respectively, from an appliance distribution affiliate that was
      deconsolidated in 1998. Also includes $1,538 million in 1997 from an
      exchange of preferred stock in Lockheed Martin Corporation for the stock
      of a newly formed subsidiary.

(b)   Principally the elimination of GECS net earnings.

(c)   Includes income, principally from licensing activities, of $79 million,
      $62 million, $271 million, $310 million and $282 million in 2000, 1999,
      1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

(d)   1999 includes unusual charges amounting to $265 million. Of the total,
      amounts that relate to activities of GE operating segments were as
      follows: Aircraft Engines--$42 million, Appliances--$75 million,
      Industrial Products and Systems--$12 million, Plastics--$13 million and
      Technical Products and Services --$34 million. 1997 includes unusual
      charges of $2,322 million. Of the total, amounts that relate to activities
      of GE operating segments were as follows: Aircraft Engines--$342 million,
      Appliances--$330 million, Industrial Products and Systems--$352 million,
      NBC--$161 million, Plastics--$63 million, Power Systems--$437 million and
      Technical Products and Services--$157 million. Also included in 1997 is
      $1,538 million associated with the Lockheed Martin Corporation transaction
      described in (a) above.

operations and continued cost reductions, which more than offset higher license
fees for certain prime-time programs that were renewed. Operating profit in 1999
included $123 million of the gain from the NBCi transaction, described on page
42. That gain was entirely offset by $62 million of operating losses from NBCi
and predecessor operations (recorded as a reduction of &quot;other income&quot;), as well
as $61 million of unusual costs recorded as &quot;other costs and expenses&quot; for
entering into a loss programming contract and for closing certain CNBC
facilities.

PLASTICS operating profit increased 16% in 2000 on revenues that were 12% higher
than a year ago. The increases in both revenues and operating profit were
primarily attributable to higher volume and improved selling prices, which more
than offset the effects of higher raw material prices. Revenues in 1999
increased by 5%, as improved volume across all product lines more than offset
the effects of lower selling prices. Operating profit increased by 4% as
productivity and the increase in volume more than offset lower prices.

POWER SYSTEMS revenues increased 47% in 2000, primarily as a result of sharply
higher volume in gas turbines and continued growth in product services,
including acquisitions. Operating profit rose 60%, reflecting the increase in
volume, selling prices and productivity. Revenues in 1999 were 19% higher than
in 1998, primarily as a result of strong double-digit growth in gas turbine
volume and in product services. Operating profit rose 31%, reflecting
productivity, growth in product services and the increase in volume.

   Power Systems orders were $23.6 billion for 2000, a 68% increase over 1999,
reflecting very strong Americas market growth. The $25.1 billion total backlog
at year-end 2000 comprised unfilled product orders of $21.9 billion (of which
63% was scheduled for delivery in 2001) and product services orders of $3.2
billion to be delivered in 2001. Comparable December 31, 1999 total backlog was
$16.1 billion.

TECHNICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES revenues rose 15% in 2000, reflecting sharply
higher volume at Medical Systems, including acquired businesses. Operating
profit grew 26%, largely as a result of productivity and volume growth at
Medical Systems, which more than offset lower selling prices across the segment.
Revenues in 1999 were 29% higher than 1998 primarily attributable to growth at
Medical Systems, the result of higher equipment volume, including new products,
and continued growth in product services, partially offset by lower selling
prices across the segment. Operating profit increased 23% as productivity and
volume increases, particularly at Medical Systems, more than offset lower
selling prices.

   Orders received by Medical Systems in 2000 were $7.6 billion, a 19% increase
over 1999. The $3.6 billion total backlog at year-end 2000 comprised unfilled
product orders of $2.3 billion (of which 87% was scheduled for delivery in 2001)
and product services orders of $1.3 billion to be delivered in 2001. Comparable
December 31, 1999 total backlog was $3.1 billion.

GECS businesses are categorized for management purposes into five operating
activities: consumer services, equipment management, mid-market financing,
specialized financing and specialty insurance.

   GECS net earnings were $5,192 million in 2000, up 17% from $4,443 million in
1999, with strong double-digit earnings growth in four of the five operating
activities. Net earnings in 1999 increased 17% from 1998. The earnings
improvement throughout the three-year period resulted from asset growth,
principally from acquisitions of businesses and portfolios, and origination
volume.

   On December 28, 2000, Montgomery Ward, LLC (Wards), formerly a GECS
subsidiary, filed for bankruptcy protection and began liquidation proceedings.
Net earnings for the year 2000 included operating losses from Wards amounting to
$245 million as well as a charge, primarily to other costs and expenses, for
$815 million ($537 million, after tax) to recognize the additional losses
resulting from the bankruptcy of Wards.

*  GECS total revenues increased 19% to $66.2 billion in 2000, following a 14%
   increase to $55.7 billion in 1999. The increases in both years reflected the
   contributions of acquired businesses as well as growth in origination volume.
   Revenues in 2000 included a gain of $1,366 million ($848 million, after tax)
   from sale of GECS investment in common stock of Paine Webber Group, Inc.
   (PaineWebber).

*  GECS cost of goods sold amounted to $8.5 billion in 2000, compared with $8.0
   billion in 1999 and $6.8 billion in 1998, and relates to IT Solutions and
   Wards. The increase in 2000 and 1999 primarily reflects the consolidation of
   Wards from August 2, 1999, when GECS acquired control, through December 28,
   2000, when Wards commenced liquidation proceedings and was deconsolidated.

*  GECS interest on borrowings in 2000 was $11.1 billion, up from $9.4 billion
   in 1999 and $9.0 billion in 1998. The increase in both years reflected the
   effects of both interest rates and the average level of borrowings used to
   finance asset growth. GECS average composite interest rate was 5.89% in 2000,
   compared with 5.14% in 1999 and 5.92% in 1998. In 2000, average assets of
   $360.5 billion were 13% higher than in 1999, which in turn were 16% higher
   than in 1998. See page 52 for a discussion of interest rate risk management.


*  GECS insurance losses and policyholder and annuity benefits increased to
   $14.4 billion in 2000, compared with $11.0 billion in 1999 and $9.6 billion
   in 1998. This increase reflected effects of growth in premium volume and
   business acquisitions throughout the period, as well as a higher ratio of
   losses to premiums earned in the reinsurance business discussed on page 47.

*  GECS provision for losses on financing receivables was $2.0 billion in 2000,
   compared with $1.7 billion in 1999 and $1.6 billion in 1998. These provisions
   principally related to private-label credit cards, bank credit cards,
   personal loans and auto loans and leases in the consumer services operations,
   all of which are discussed on page 48 under financing receivables. The
   provisions throughout the three-year period reflected higher average
   receivable balances, changes in the mix of business, and the effects of lower
   average consumer delinquency rates.

*  GECS other costs and expenses were $22.8 billion in 2000, an increase from
   $19.4 billion in 1999 and $16.4 billion in 1998. The increase in 2000
   reflected increased costs associated with acquired businesses and portfolios,
   the charges discussed previously for Wards, and the decision to rationalize
   certain operations discussed in the analysis of All Other GECS operating
   activities. The 1999 increase reflected increased costs associated with
   acquired businesses and portfolios, higher investment levels and increases in
   insurance commissions.

Financing spreads (the excess of yields over interest rates on borrowings)
increased slightly during 2000, as the improvement in yields outpaced increases
in borrowing rates. Financing spreads in 1999 were relatively flat compared with
1998 as yields and borrowing rates decreased to a similar extent.

   Revenues and net earnings from operating activities within the GECS segment
for the past three years are summarized and discussed below.

   CONSUMER SERVICES revenues increased 28% in 2000 and 6% in 1999, and net
earnings increased 47% in 2000 and 35% in 1999. Growth in revenues and net
income in 2000 resulted from higher premium and investment income at GE
Financial Assurance (GEFA), the consumer savings and insurance business, which
experienced profitable growth from both acquisitions and volume. Revenues and
net earnings also increased as a result of acquisition and volume growth at Card
Services and Global Consumer Finance, partially offset by losses at Mortgage
Services, which stopped accepting new business during 2000. The growth in
revenues and net earnings during 1999 was led by Global Consumer Finance and
improved results at GEFA, partially offset by the effects of asset reductions in
Card Services. The portfolio at Auto Financial Services (AFS) began to run off
in 1999 and continued in 2000, resulting in a significant decline in revenues;
during 2000, AFS stopped accepting new business.

   EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT revenues declined 4% in 2000, following a 3% increase in
1999, as higher revenues from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), Transport
International Pool, GE Capital Modular Space and Americom, the satellite
services business, were more than offset by lower revenues at IT Solutions. The
increase in 1999 reflected acquisitions in the corporate auto fleet management
operations and higher revenues at GECAS, largely offset by decreases in sales

volume at the remaining equipment management businesses. Net earnings increased
22% in 2000, following a 15% decrease in 1999. The increase in 2000 reflected
volume growth at GECAS, Transport International Pool and GE Capital Modular
Space, favorable tax effects and a higher level of asset gains, partially offset
by lower results at IT Solutions. The decrease in net earnings in 1999 reflected
lower results at IT Solutions and the European equipment management businesses,
which more than offset growth at GECAS and Americom.

   MID-MARKET FINANCING revenues increased 18% in 2000, following a 26% increase
in 1999, while net earnings grew 22% and 27%, respectively. Favorable tax
effects and asset growth from originations were the most significant
contributing factors to results in 2000, while asset growth from both
acquisitions and originations was the most significant contributing factor in
1999.

   SPECIALIZED FINANCING revenues rose 23% and 37%, while net earnings increased
21% and 67% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenues and net earnings growth in
2000 was principally the result of origination growth across all businesses
within Specialized Financing. Revenues and net earnings growth in 1999 was
principally the result of gains on equity investments led by GE Equity,
Commercial Finance and Real Estate. GE Equity experienced a high level of gains
on sales of equity investments during 1999 and early 2000.

   SPECIALTY INSURANCE revenues increased 12% and 21% in 2000 and 1999,
respectively, primarily resulting from premium growth throughout the period and
higher premium income in 1999 from acquisitions. Net realized investment gains
amounted to $639 million, $811 million and $574 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Investment income increased slightly in 2000, as higher interest
income more than offset a decrease in net realized investment gains at GE Global
Insurance (the parent of Employers Reinsurance).

   Net income decreased 25% in 2000, following a 5% increase in 1999. The
decrease in 2000 was attributable to deterioration of underwriting results at GE
Global Insurance, reflecting higher property and casualty-related losses
(principally as a result of adverse development relating to prior-year loss
events, including large loss events) and the continued effects of low premiums
in the property and casualty insurance/reinsurance industry. Losses in 1999 were
significantly affected by a number of large loss events. Large loss events are
individual events that, after specific reinsurance recoveries and related
premium adjustments, affect GE Global Insurance operations by $2 million or
more, and include losses from earthquakes, aviation and railroad accidents, fire
damage, and weather-related damage from hurricanes, tornadoes, wind and ice.
Large loss events for GE Global Insurance occurring in 2000, 1999 and 1998
resulted in losses in those years of approximately $250 million, $510 million
and $150 million, respectively. A portion of the 2000 and 1999 losses were
recovered under aggregate risk coverage obtained in the ordinary course of the
reinsurance business. Overall insurance losses for Specialty Insurance were
partially mitigated by favorable experience in the Mortgage Insurance business,
particularly in 1999.

   ALL OTHER GECS operating activities included the results of Wards from August
2, 1999, through December 28, 2000. The increase in revenues in 2000 also
included a pre-tax gain of $1,366 million from sale of GECS investment in common
stock of PaineWebber. The net loss of $424 million for 2000 comprised the
PaineWebber after-tax gain of $848 million, after-tax charges of $537 million
related to Wards and after-tax strategic rationalization costs of $347 million,

primarily for asset write-downs, employee severance and lease termination. These
strategic rationalization costs consisted of $107 million related to Consumer
Services, $191 million related to Equipment Management and $49 million related
to Specialized Financing.

   FINANCING RECEIVABLES is the largest category of assets for GECS and
represents one of its primary sources of revenues. The portfolio of financing
receivables, before allowance for losses, increased to $147.3 billion at the end
of 2000 from $137.9 billion at the end of 1999, as discussed in the following
paragraphs. The related allowance for losses at the end of 2000 amounted to $4.0
billion ($3.7 billion at the end of 1999), representing management's best
estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio.

   In GECS financing receivables, &quot;nonearning&quot; receivables are those that are 90
days or more delinquent (or for which collection has otherwise become doubtful)
and &quot;reduced-earning&quot; receivables are commercial receivables whose terms have
been restructured to a below-market yield.

   Consumer financing receivables, primarily credit card and personal loans and
auto loans and leases, were $48.8 billion at year-end 2000, a decrease of $3.5
billion from year-end 1999. Credit card and personal receivables increased $0.2
billion, primarily from origination volume, partially offset by sales and
securitizations and the net effects of foreign currency translation. Auto
receivables decreased $3.7 billion, primarily as a result of the run-off of the
liquidating Auto Financial Services portfolio and the net effects of foreign
currency translation. Nonearning consumer receivables at year-end 2000 were $1.1
billion, about 2.3% of outstandings, compared with $0.9 billion, about 1.8% of
outstandings at year-end 1999. Write-offs of consumer receivables increased to
$1.3 billion from $1.2 billion for 1999, reflecting shifts in the mix of
products and global businesses. Consistent with industry trends, consumer
delinquency rates increased somewhat toward the end of 2000 from the unusually
low levels earlier in the year but were below year-end 1999 levels.

   Other financing receivables, which totaled $98.5 billion at December 31,
2000, consisted of a diverse commercial, industrial and equipment loan and lease
portfolio. This portfolio increased $12.9 billion during 2000, reflecting
increased originations and acquisition growth, partially offset by sales and
securitizations and the net effects of foreign currency translation. Related
nonearning and reduced-earning receivables were $0.9 billion, about 1.0% of
outstandings at year-end 2000, compared with $0.9 billion, about 1.1% of
outstandings at year-end 1999.

   GECS loans and leases to commercial airlines amounted to $15.3 billion at the
end of 2000, up from $11.8 billion at the end of 1999. GECS commercial aircraft
positions also included financial guarantees, funding commitments and aircraft
orders as discussed in note 18.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

Estimated results of international activities include the results of GE and GECS
operations located outside the United States plus all U.S. exports. Certain GECS
operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas
are classified as &quot;other international&quot; for this purpose.

   International revenues in 2000 were $53.0 billion (41% of consolidated
revenues), compared with $45.7 billion in 1999 and $42.5 billion in 1998. The
chart above left depicts the growth in international revenues over the past five
years.

================================================================================

   GE international revenues were $26.7 billion in 2000, an increase of $2.7
billion over 1999, which was $0.3 billion lower than in 1998. Over the
three-year period, international revenues were slightly less than half of total
revenues. The increase in such revenues during 2000 was attributable to sales
growth in operations based outside the United States, partially offset by a 5%
decrease in U.S. exports, primarily at Power Systems. Revenues from operations
based outside the United States grew 19% to $19.5 billion in 2000. European
revenues were 8% higher in 2000, led by increases at Power Systems and Plastics.
Pacific Basin revenues were 39% higher in 2000, reflecting double-digit growth
at Power Systems, Medical Systems and Plastics. Revenues from the Americas
(North and South America, except for the United States) increased 17%,
reflecting double-digit growth in both Canadian and Latin American operations.

   GECS international revenues were $26.3 billion in 2000, an increase of 21%
from $21.7 billion in 1999. Revenues in the Pacific Basin almost doubled in
2000, principally because of growth in Japan, the result of the purchase by GE
Financial Assurance of the insurance policies and related assets of Toho Mutual
Life Insurance Company (Toho). &quot;Other international&quot; revenues increased 27% in
2000, largely a result of higher revenues at GE Capital Aviation Services
(GECAS). Overall, these increases reflect the continued expansion of GECS as a
global provider of a wide range of financial services.

   Consolidated international operating profit was $6.8 billion in 2000, an
increase of 21% over 1999, which was 9% higher than in 1998. Additional
information about operating profit by region is provided in note 29.

   Total assets of international operations were $159.4 billion in 2000 (37% of
consolidated assets), an increase of 13% over 1999. The increase in 2000
reflected strong growth at GECS in the Pacific Basin, particularly in Japan,
resulting from the acquisition of Toho discussed previously. GECS also achieved
significant asset growth at GECAS, which is classified as &quot;other international.&quot;

   The international activities of GE and GECS span all global regions and
primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets, import and sale
of products produced in other regions, leasing of aircraft, sourcing for GE
plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services
within these regional economies. Thus, when countries or regions experience
currency and/or economic stress, GE may have increased exposure to certain risks
but also may have new profit opportunities. Potential increased risks include,
among other things, higher receivables delinquencies and bad debts, delays or
cancellation of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft
equipment, higher local currency financing costs and a slowdown in established
financial services activities. New profit opportunities include, among other
things, lower costs of goods sourced from countries with weakened currencies,
more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing, expansion of industrial and
financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at
reduced prices and lower U.S. debt financing costs.

   Financial results of GE's international activities reported in U.S. dollars
are affected by currency exchange. A number of techniques are used to manage the
effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies
and selective hedging of significant cross-currency transactions. Principal
currencies are the major European currencies, including the euro, as well as the
Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar. Certain of GE's operations in Europe will
need to be fully euro-capable as of January 1, 2002. GE is taking appropriate
actions to meet that requirement and no adverse consequences are expected.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

OVERVIEW

This discussion of financial resources and liquidity addresses the Statement of
Financial Position (page 36), Statement of Changes in Share Owners' Equity (page
34) and the Statement of Cash Flows (page 38).

   GECS is not a &quot;captive finance company&quot; or a vehicle for &quot;off-balance-sheet
financing&quot; for GE. Only a small portion of GECS business is directly related to
other GE operations. The fundamental differences between GE and GECS are
reflected in the measurements commonly used by investors, rating agencies and
financial analysts. These differences will become clearer in the discussion that
follows with respect to the more significant items in the financial statements.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

Because GE and GECS share certain significant elements of their Statements of
Financial Position--property, plant and equipment, and borrowings, for
example--the following discussion addresses significant captions in the
&quot;consolidated&quot; statement. Within the following discussions, however, distinction
is drawn between GE and GECS activities in order to permit meaningful analysis
of each individual statement.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES for each of the past two years comprised mainly
investment-grade debt securities held by GE Financial Assurance and the
specialty insurance businesses of GECS in support of obligations to annuitants
and policyholders. GE investment securities were $1.0 billion at year-end 2000,
a decrease of $0.3 billion from 1999, reflecting decreases in the fair value of
equity investment securities partially offset by additional investments. GECS
investment securities were $90.3 billion in 2000, compared with $80.5 billion in
1999. The increase of $9.8 billion resulted from the addition of securities from
acquired companies, investment of premiums received and increases in the fair
value of debt securities, partially offset by the disposition of GECS investment
in common stock of PaineWebber and a decrease in the fair value of certain
equity securities, consistent with market conditions. See note 10 for further
information.

CURRENT RECEIVABLES for GE were $9.7 billion at the end of 2000, an increase of
$1.0 billion from year-end 1999, and included $6.3 billion due from customers at
the end of 2000, which was $0.5 billion higher than the amount due at the end of
1999. Turnover of customer receivables from sales of goods and services was 10.0
in 2000, compared with 9.4 in 1999. Other current receivables are primarily
amounts that did not originate from sales of GE goods or services, such as
advances to suppliers in connection with large contracts.

INVENTORIES for GE were $7.1 billion at December 31, 2000, up $1.3 billion from
the end of 1999. GE inventory turnover was 8.5 in 2000, an increase from 8.3 in
1999. Acquisitions of inventories in business combinations and volume growth
more than offset the positive effects of inventory management programs
throughout the period. Last-in, first-out (LIFO) revaluations decreased $82
million in 2000, compared with decreases of $84 million in 1999 and $87 million
in 1998. Included in these changes were decreases of $6 million, $4 million and
$29 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, that resulted from lower LIFO
inventory levels. There were net cost decreases in each of the last three years.

   Inventories (at FIFO) and customer receivables from sales of goods or
services are two key components of GE's working capital turnover measurement.
Working capital turnover was 24.0 in 2000, compared with 11.5 in 1999,
principally reflecting effects of increased progress collections throughout the
period.

   GECS inventories were $666 million and $1,209 million at December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. The decrease in 2000 primarily relates to the
deconsolidation of Wards because of its bankruptcy filing.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES of GECS were $143.3 billion at year-end 2000, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts, up $9.1 billion over 1999. These receivables
are discussed on page 48 and in notes 13 and 14.

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES of GECS were $23.8 billion at year-end 2000, an increase
of $4.8 billion that was primarily attributable to acquisitions.

OTHER RECEIVABLES of GECS, which consist of trade receivables, accrued
investment income, operating lease receivables and a variety of sundry items,
were $13.3 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The decrease of $1.8 billion primarily resulted from the planned
run-off of assets from the 1999 acquisition of Japan Leasing Corporation.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (including equipment leased to others) was $40.0
billion at December 31, 2000, down $1.0 billion from 1999. GE property, plant
and equipment consists of investments for its own productive use, whereas the
largest element for GECS is in equipment provided to third parties on operating
leases. Details by category of investment are presented in note 16.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 51

   GE total expenditures for plant and equipment during 2000 totaled $2.5
billion, compared with $2.0 billion in 1999. Total expenditures for the past
five years were $11.3 billion, of which 39% was investment for growth through
new capacity and product development; 32% was investment in productivity through
new equipment and process improvements; and 29% was investment for such other
purposes as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and
environmental protection.

   GECS additions to property, plant and equipment (including equipment leased
to others), were $11.4 billion during 2000 ($13.5 billion during 1999),
primarily reflecting acquisitions of transportation equipment.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS were $27.4 billion at year-end 2000, up from $26.0 billion at
year-end 1999. GE intangibles increased to $12.4 billion from $11.3 billion at
the end of 1999, principally as a result of goodwill related to acquisitions,
the largest of which were Harmon Industries and OEC Medical Systems, partially
offset by amortization. GECS intangibles increased $0.3 billion to $15.0
billion, reflecting goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions,
the largest of which was the acquisition of the insurance policies and related
assets of Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company by GE Financial Assurance,
partially offset by amortization.

ALL OTHER ASSETS totaled $73.9 billion at year-end 2000, an increase of $8.9
billion from the end of 1999. GE other assets increased $3.2 billion,
principally reflecting an increase in the prepaid pension asset, higher costs
associated with increased volume of long-term service agreements and additions
to capitalized software. GECS other assets increased $5.7 billion as a result of
additional investments in real estate ventures and associated companies, and
increases in &quot;separate accounts&quot; (see note 18), partially offset by decreases in
assets acquired for resale, which reflected sales and securitizations in excess
of originations.

CONSOLIDATED BORROWINGS aggregated $201.3 billion at December 31, 2000, compared
with $201.8 billion at the end of 1999. The major debt-rating agencies evaluate
the financial condition of GE and of GE Capital (the major public borrowing
entity of GECS) differently because of their distinct business characteristics.
Using criteria appropriate to each and considering their combined strength,
those major rating agencies continue to give the highest ratings to debt of both
GE and GE Capital.

   GE has committed to contribute capital to GE Capital in the event of either a
decrease below a specified level in GE Capital's ratio of earnings to fixed
charges, or a failure to maintain a specified debt-to-equity ratio in the event
certain GE Capital preferred stock is redeemed. GE also has guaranteed
subordinated debt of GECS with a face amount of $1.0 billion at December 31,
2000 and 1999. Management believes the likelihood that GE will be required to
contribute capital under either the commitments or the guarantee is remote.

   GE total borrowings were $1.8 billion at year-end 2000 ($0.9 billion
short-term, $0.9 billion long-term), a decrease of $1.2 billion from year-end
1999. GE total debt at the end of 2000 equaled 3.3% of total capital, down from
6.4% at the end of 1999.

   GECS total borrowings were $205.4 billion at December 31, 2000, of which
$124.0 billion is due in 2001 and $81.4 billion is due in subsequent years.

Comparable amounts at the end of 1999 were $200.0 billion in total, $129.2
billion due within one year and $70.8 billion due thereafter. A large portion of
GECS borrowings ($94.5 billion and $96.6 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999,
respectively) was issued in active commercial paper markets that management
believes will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing. Most of
this commercial paper was issued by GE Capital. The average remaining terms and
interest rates of GE Capital commercial paper were 45 days and 6.43% at the end
of 2000, compared with 53 days and 5.82% at the end of 1999. The GE Capital
ratio of debt to equity was 7.53 to 1 at the end of 2000 and 8.44 to 1 at the
end of 1999.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 52

   INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT is important in the normal
operations of GE and GECS. More detailed information about these financial
instruments, as well as the strategies and policies for their use, is provided
in notes 1, 19 and 30.

   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires that registrants provide
information about potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency
exchange. Although the rules offer alternatives for presenting this information,
none of the alternatives is without limitations. The following discussion is
based on so-called &quot;shock tests,&quot; which model effects of interest rate and
currency shifts on the reporting company. Shock tests, while probably the most
meaningful analysis permitted, are constrained by several factors, including the
necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their
inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from
the market shifts modeled. While the following results of shock tests for
changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates may have some limited use
as benchmarks, they should not be viewed as forecasts.

*  One means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is a duration-based
   analysis that measures the potential loss in net earnings resulting from a
   hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across all
   maturities (sometimes referred to as a &quot;parallel shift in the yield curve&quot;).
   Under this model, it is estimated that, all else constant, such an increase,
   including repricing effects in the securities portfolio, would reduce the
   2001 net earnings of GECS based on year-end 2000 positions by approximately
   $124 million; the pro forma effect for GE was insignificant. Based on
   positions at year-end 1999, the pro forma effect on 2000 net earnings of such
   an increase in interest rates was estimated to be approximately $105 million
   for GECS and $13 million for GE.

*  As shown in the chart to the right, the geographic distribution of GE and
   GECS operations is diverse. One means of assessing exposure to changes in
   currency exchange rates is to model effects on reported earnings using a
   sensitivity analysis. Year-end 2000 consolidated currency exposures,
   including financial instruments designated and effective as hedges, were
   analyzed to identify GE and GECS assets and liabilities denominated in other
   than their relevant functional currency. Net unhedged exposures in each
   currency were then remeasured assuming a 10% decrease (substantially greater
   decreases for hyperinflationary currencies) in currency exchange rates
   compared with the U.S. dollar. Under this model, it is estimated that, all
   else constant, such a decrease would have an insignificant effect on the 2001
   net earnings of GE and GECS based on year-end 2000 positions. Based on
   conditions at year-end 1999, the effect on 2000 net earnings of such a
   decrease in exchange rates was estimated to be insignificant for GE and GECS.

INSURANCE LIABILITIES, RESERVES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS were $106.2 billion, $19.4
billion higher than in 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to the
addition of liabilities from acquisitions, increases in separate accounts, and
growth in guaranteed investment contracts. For additional information on these
liabilities, see note 20.

================================================================================


STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY

Share owners' equity increased $7,935 million to $50,492 million at year-end
2000. The increase was largely attributable to net earnings during the period of
$12,735 million, partially offset by dividends of $5,647 million.

   Currency translation adjustments reduced equity by $1,204 million in 2000.
Changes in the currency translation adjustment reflect the effects of changes in
currency exchange rates on GE's net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries that
have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The decrease during 2000
largely reflected continued weakening in the euro. Accumulated currency
translation adjustments affect net earnings only when all or a portion of an
affiliate is disposed of.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Because cash management activities of GE and GECS are separate and distinct, it
is more useful to review their cash flows separately.

GE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS aggregated $7.2 billion at the end of 2000, up from $2.0
billion at year-end 1999. During 2000, GE generated a record $15.4 billion in
cash from operating activities, a 31% increase over 1999. The increase reflected
improvements in earnings and working capital, the latter principally from
progress collections. The 2000 cash generation provided the necessary resources
to purchase $2.2 billion of GE common stock under the share repurchase program,
to pay $5.4 billion in dividends to share owners, to invest $2.5 billion in
plant and equipment and to make $1.2 billion in acquisitions.

   Operating activities are the principal source of GE's cash flows. Over the
past three years, operating activities have provided more than $37 billion of
cash. The principal application of this cash was distributions of approximately
$22 billion to share owners, both through payment of dividends ($13.9 billion)
and through the share repurchase program ($7.7 billion) described below. Other
applications included investment in plant and equipment ($6.6 billion) and
acquisitions ($4.2 billion).

   Under the share repurchase program initiated in December 1994, GE has
purchased more than $17 billion of GE stock--over 950 million shares through
2000. In December 1999, GE's Board of Directors increased the amount authorized
from $17 billion to $22 billion. Funds used for the share repurchase are
expected to be generated largely from operating cash flow.

   Based on past performance and current expectations, in combination with the
financial flexibility that comes with a strong balance sheet and the highest
credit ratings, management believes that GE is in a sound position to complete
the share repurchase program, to grow dividends in line with earnings, and to
continue making selective investments for long-term growth. Expenditures for
plant and equipment are expected to be about $2.9 billion in 2001, principally
for productivity and growth.

GECS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS aggregated $6.1 billion at the end of 2000, down from
$6.9 billion at year-end 1999 principally as a result of liquidation of
short-term investments, partially offset by $13.2 billion of cash acquired in
connection with the acquisition of the insurance policies and related assets of
the Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company. The cash acquired with Toho is shown as
cash from financing activities. Paydown of the acquired Toho insurance policies
($4.4 billion in 2000) appears as a usage under the caption &quot;Insurance
liabilities and reserves&quot; and was a primary cause of the decrease in GECS cash
from operating activities in 2000.

   One of the primary sources of cash for GECS is financing activities involving
the continued rollover of short-term borrowings and appropriate addition of
borrowings with a reasonable balance of maturities. Over the past three years,
GECS borrowings with maturities of 90 days or less have increased by $21.5
billion. New borrowings of $135.9 billion having maturities longer than 90 days
were added during those years, while $89.9 billion of such longer-term
borrowings were retired. GECS also generated $35.1 billion from operating
activities.

================================================================================

   The principal use of cash by GECS has been investing in assets to grow its
businesses. Of the $109.7 billion that GECS invested over the past three years,
$34.7 billion was used for additions to financing receivables; $31.8 billion was
used to invest in new equipment, principally for lease to others; and $28.4
billion was used for acquisitions of new businesses, the largest of which were
Japan Leasing and the credit card operations of JC Penney, both in 1999.

   With the financial flexibility that comes with excellent credit ratings,
management believes that GECS should be well positioned to meet the global needs
of its customers for capital and to continue providing GE share owners with good
returns.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA summarized on the following page are divided into three
sections: upper portion--consolidated data; middle portion--GE data that reflect
various conventional measurements for such enterprises; and lower portion--GECS
data that reflect key information pertinent to financial services businesses.

GE'S TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT expenditures were $2,193 million in 2000, up
9% over 1999 and 1998. In 2000, expenditures from GE's own funds were $1,867
million, an increase of 12% over 1999, reflecting continuing research and
development work related to new product, service and process technologies.
Product technology efforts in 2000 included continuing development work on the
next generation of gas turbines, further advances in state-of-the-art diagnostic
imaging technologies, and development of more fuel-efficient, cost-effective
aircraft engine designs. Services technologies include advances in diagnostic

applications, including remote diagnostic capabilities related to repair and
maintenance of medical equipment, aircraft engines, power generation equipment
and locomotives. Process technologies provided improved product quality and
performance and increased capacity for manufacturing engineered materials.
Expenditures funded by customers (mainly the U.S. government) were $326 million
in 2000, down $24 million from 1999.

GE'S TOTAL BACKLOG of firm unfilled orders at the end of 2000 was $44.2 billion,
an increase of 36% over 1999, reflecting strong double-digit growth at Power
Systems, Aircraft Engines and Medical Systems. Of the total, $36.7 billion
related to products, of which 71% was scheduled for delivery in 2001. Services
orders, included in this reported backlog for only the succeeding 12 months,
were $7.5 billion at the end of 2000. Orders constituting this backlog may be
canceled or deferred by customers, subject in certain cases to penalties. See
Segment Operations beginning on page 43 for further information.

REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, GE's operations, like operations of other
companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup
of substances regulated under environmental protection laws.

   In 2000, GE expended about $48 million for capital projects related to the
environment. The comparable amount in 1999 was $66 million. These amounts
exclude expenditures for remediation actions, which are principally expensed and
are discussed below. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have
included pollution control devices--such as wastewater treatment plants,
groundwater monitoring devices, air strippers or separators, and
incinerators--at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the
normal course of business. Consistent with policies stressing environmental

responsibility, average annual capital expenditures other than for remediation
projects are presently expected to be about $55 million over the next two years.
This level is in line with existing levels for new or expanded programs to build
facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce
emissions.

   GE also is involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up
hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes require
that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality
of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Expenditures for site
remediation actions amounted to approximately $128 million in 2000, compared
with $114 million in 1999. It is presently expected that such remediation
actions will require average annual expenditures in the range of $90 million to
$150 million over the next two years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



---------------------------------------------
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
---------------------------------------------

CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements represent the adding
together of all affiliates--companies that General Electric Company directly or
indirectly controls. Results of associated companies--generally companies that
are 20% to 50% owned and over which General Electric Company, directly or
indirectly, has significant influence--are included in the financial statements
on a &quot;one-line&quot; basis.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Financial data and related measurements are
presented in the following categories:

*  GE. This represents the adding together of all affiliates other than General
   Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS), whose operations are presented on a
   one-line basis.

*  GECS. This affiliate owns all of the common stock of General Electric Capital
   Corporation (GE Capital) and GE Global Insurance Holding Corporation (GE
   Global Insurance), the parent of Employers Reinsurance Corporation. GE
   Capital, GE Global Insurance and their respective affiliates are consolidated
   in the GECS columns and constitute its business.

*  CONSOLIDATED. This represents the adding together of GE and GECS.

The effects of transactions among related companies within and between each of
the above-mentioned groups are eliminated. Transactions between GE and GECS are
not material.

   Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2000
presentation.

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES. A sale is recorded when title passes to the
customer or when services are performed in accordance with contracts. Sales
under complex contracts are recorded based on the objectively determined fair
value of each component of the contract, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

GECS REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME). Income on all loans is recognized
on the interest method. Accrual of interest income is suspended at the earlier
of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account
becomes 90 days delinquent. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized
either as cash is collected or on a cost-recovery basis as conditions warrant.

   Financing lease income is recorded on the interest method so as to produce a
level yield on funds not yet recovered. Estimated unguaranteed residual values
of leased assets are based primarily on periodic independent appraisals of the
values of leased assets remaining at expiration of the lease terms.

   Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms
of underlying leases.

   Origination, commitment and other nonrefundable fees related to fundings are
deferred and recorded in earned income on the interest method. Commitment fees
related to loans not expected to be funded and line-of-credit fees are deferred
and recorded in earned income on a straight-line basis over the period to which
the fees relate. Syndication fees are recorded in earned income at the time
related services are performed unless significant contingencies exist.

   Income from investment and insurance activities is discussed on page 57.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. The cost of most of GE's manufacturing plant and
equipment is depreciated using an accelerated method based primarily on a
sum-of-the-years digits formula.

   The cost of GECS equipment leased to others on operating leases is amortized,
principally on a straight-line basis, to estimated residual value over the lease
term or over the estimated economic life of the equipment. Depreciation of
property and equipment used by GECS is recorded on either a sum-of-the-years
digits formula or a straight-line basis over the lives of the assets.

RECOGNITION OF LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES. The allowance for losses on
small-balance receivables reflects management's best estimate of probable losses
inherent in the portfolio determined principally on the basis of historical
experience. For other receivables, principally the larger loans and leases, the
allowance for losses is determined primarily on the basis of management's best
estimate of probable losses, including specific allowances for known troubled
accounts.

   All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible or to require an
excessive collection cost are written off to the allowance for losses.
Small-balance accounts generally are written off when 6 to 12 months delinquent,
although any such balance judged to be uncollectible, such as an account in
bankruptcy, is written down immediately to estimated realizable value.
Large-balance accounts are reviewed at least quarterly, and those accounts with
amounts that are judged to be uncollectible are written down to estimated
realizable value.

   When collateral is repossessed in satisfaction of a loan, the receivable is
written down against the allowance for losses to estimated fair value of the
asset less costs to sell, transferred to other assets and subsequently carried
at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. This accounting
method has been employed principally for specialized financing transactions.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 57

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS. Debt securities with original maturities of three months
or less are included in cash equivalents unless designated as available for sale
and classified as investment securities.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES. Investments in debt and marketable equity securities are
reported at fair value based primarily on quoted market prices or, if quoted
prices are not available, discounted expected cash flows using market rates
commensurate with credit quality and maturity of the investment. Substantially
all investment securities are designated as available for sale, with unrealized
gains and losses included in share owners' equity, net of applicable taxes and
other adjustments. Unrealized losses that are other than temporary are
recognized in earnings. Realized gains and losses are accounted for on the
specific identification method.

INVENTORIES. All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or realizable
values. Cost for virtually all of GE's U.S. inventories is determined on a
last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Cost of other GE inventories is primarily
determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

   GECS inventories consist primarily of finished products held for sale. Cost
is primarily determined on a FIFO basis.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Goodwill is amortized over its estimated period of benefit on
a straight-line basis; other intangible assets are amortized on appropriate
bases over their estimated lives. No amortization period exceeds 40 years. When
an intangible asset exceeds associated expected operating cash flows, it is
considered to be impaired and is written down to fair value, which is determined
based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT. Upon adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING
ACTIVITIES, on January 1, 2001, certain financial instruments and portions of
other financial instruments will be defined to be derivatives. After that date,
all derivatives will be carried at their fair values, and all changes in fair
values will affect net earnings or share owners' equity immediately.

   As a matter of policy, neither GE nor GECS engages in derivatives trading,
derivatives market-making or other speculative activities.

   GE and GECS use swaps primarily to optimize funding costs. To a lesser
degree, and in combination with options and limit contracts, GECS uses swaps to
stabilize cash flows from mortgage-related assets.

   Designated interest rate and currency swaps, forwards and limit contracts
that modify borrowings or certain assets, and forecasted transactions such as
forecasted commercial paper renewals, are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Both GE and GECS require all other swaps, as well as futures, options and
currency forwards, to be designated and accounted for as hedges of specific
assets, liabilities or firm commitments; resulting payments and receipts are
recognized contemporaneously with effects of hedged transactions. A payment or
receipt arising from early termination of an effective hedge is accounted for as
an adjustment to the basis of the hedged transaction.

   Instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated
with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the
inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in market values of hedge
instruments must be highly correlated with changes in market values of
underlying hedged items, both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the
hedge contract.

   As a matter of policy, any derivative that is either not designated as a
hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective, is marked to market and
recognized in earnings immediately.

GECS INSURANCE ACCOUNTING POLICIES. Accounting policies for GECS insurance
businesses follow.

PREMIUM INCOME. Insurance premiums are reported as earned income as follows:

*  For short-duration insurance contracts (including property and casualty,
   accident and health, and financial guaranty insurance), premiums are reported
   as earned income, generally on a pro-rata basis, over the terms of the
   related agreements. For retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts, premium
   adjustments are recorded based on estimated losses and loss expenses, taking
   into consideration both case and incurred-but-not-reported reserves.

*  For traditional long-duration insurance contracts (including term and whole
   life contracts and annuities payable for the life of the annuitant), premiums
   are reported as earned income when due.

*  For investment contracts and universal life contracts, premiums received are
   reported as liabilities, not as revenues. Universal life contracts are
   long-duration insurance contracts with terms that are not fixed and
   guaranteed; for these contracts, revenues are recognized for assessments
   against the policyholder's account, mostly for mortality, contract
   initiation, administration and surrender. Investment contracts are contracts
   that have neither significant mortality nor significant morbidity risk,
   including annuities payable for a determined period; for these contracts,
   revenues are recognized on the associated investments and amounts credited to
   policyholder accounts are charged to expense.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 58

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS. Costs that vary with and are primarily
related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and investment contracts
are deferred and amortized over the respective policy terms. For short-duration
insurance contracts, acquisition costs consist primarily of commissions,
brokerage expenses and premium taxes. For long-duration insurance contracts,
these costs consist primarily of first-year commissions in excess of recurring
renewal commissions, certain variable sales expenses and certain support costs
such as underwriting and policy issue expenses.

*  For short-duration insurance contracts, these costs are amortized pro rata
   over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned.

*  For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, these costs are amortized
   over the respective contract periods in proportion to either anticipated
   premium income or, in the case of limited-payment contracts, estimated
   benefit payments.

*  For investment contracts and universal life contracts, these costs are
   amortized on the basis of anticipated gross profits.

Periodically, deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed for recoverability;
anticipated investment income is considered in recoverability evaluations.

PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS. The actuarially determined present value of
anticipated net cash flows to be realized from insurance, annuity and investment
contracts in force at the date of acquisition of life insurance enterprises is
recorded as the present value of future profits and is amortized over the
respective policy terms in a manner similar to deferred policy acquisition
costs. Unamortized balances are adjusted to reflect experience and impairment,
if any.

5 RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE BENEFITS
---------------------------------------------

GE and its affiliates sponsor a number of retiree health and life insurance
benefit plans (&quot;retiree benefit plans&quot;). Principal retiree benefit plans are
discussed below; other such plans are not significant individually or in the
aggregate.

PRINCIPAL RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS generally provide health and life insurance
benefits to employees who retire under the GE Pension Plan (see note 6) with 10
or more years of service. Retirees share in the cost of health care benefits.
Benefit provisions are subject to collective bargaining. These plans cover
approximately 250,000 retirees and dependents.

   The effect on operations of principal retiree benefit plans is shown in the
following table.

   Increasing or decreasing the health care cost trend rates by one percentage
point would have had an insignificant effect on the December 31, 2000,
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual cost of retiree
health plans.

   Experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial
assumptions and plan provisions, are amortized over the average future service
period of employees.



---------------------------------------------
6 PENSION BENEFITS
---------------------------------------------

GE and its affiliates sponsor a number of pension plans. Principal pension plans
are discussed below; other pension plans are not significant individually or in
the aggregate.

PRINCIPAL PENSION PLANS are the GE Pension Plan and the GE Supplementary Pension
Plan.

   The GE Pension Plan provides benefits to certain U.S. employees based on the
greater of a formula recognizing career earnings or a formula recognizing length
of service and final average earnings. Benefit provisions are subject to
collective bargaining. The GE Pension Plan covers approximately 485,000
participants, including 134,000 employees, 156,000 former employees with vested
rights to future benefits, and 195,000 retirees and beneficiaries receiving
benefits.

   The GE Supplementary Pension Plan is a pay-as-you-go plan providing
supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher-level, longer-service U.S.
employees.

   Details of the effect on operations of principal pension plans, and the total
effect on cost of postemployment benefit plans, follow.

================================================================================

FUNDING POLICY for the GE Pension Plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to
meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws
plus such additional amounts as GE may determine to be appropriate. GE has not
made contributions to the GE Pension Plan since 1987 because the fully funded
status of the Plan precludes a current tax deduction and because any GE
contribution would require payment of excise taxes.

   Changes in the projected benefit obligation for principal pension plans
follow.

   GE includes GECS in filing a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The
GECS provision for current tax expense includes its effect on the consolidated
return.

   Consolidated current tax expense includes amounts applicable to U.S. federal
income taxes of $3,005 million, $1,632 million and $1,459 million in 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively, and amounts applicable to non-U.S. jurisdictions of
$1,246 million, $1,399 million and $1,335 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Consolidated deferred tax expense related to U.S. federal income
taxes was $1,095 million, $1,475 million and $971 million in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

   Deferred income tax balances reflect the impact of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually
paid or recovered. See note 22 for details.

   Except for certain earnings that GE intends to reinvest indefinitely,
provision has been made for the estimated U.S. federal income tax liabilities
applicable to undistributed earnings of affiliates and associated companies. It
is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability, if any,
that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.

   Consolidated U.S. income before taxes was $12.9 billion in 2000, $11.3
billion in 1999 and $9.7 billion in 1998. The corresponding amounts for
non-U.S.-based operations were $5.5 billion in 2000, $4.3 billion in 1999 and
$3.8 billion in 1998.

   A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the actual tax
rate is provided below.

9 PROPOSED ACQUISITION
---------------------------------------------

On October 22, 2000, the Board of Directors of General Electric Company approved
a definitive agreement by which GE will acquire Honeywell International Inc.
(Honeywell) through a tax-free merger of Honeywell with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of GE.

   Under the terms of the agreement, Honeywell share owners will receive 1.055
shares of GE common stock in exchange for each share of Honeywell. GE expects to
use approximately 850 million shares to effect the transaction.

   Completion of the merger is subject to certain remaining conditions, which
include review or approval of the transaction by various governmental
authorities. The merger is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Honeywell share owners approved the merger in January, and GE and
Honeywell are working with regulatory agencies to complete the required reviews
so that the transaction can close as early as possible in 2001.

   LIFO revaluations decreased $82 million in 2000, compared with decreases of
$84 million in 1999 and $87 million in 1998. Included in these changes were
decreases of $6 million, $4 million and $29 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, that resulted from lower LIFO inventory levels. There were net
cost decreases in each of the last three years. As of December 31, 2000, GE is
obligated to acquire certain raw materials at market prices through the year
2008 under various take-or-pay or similar arrangements. Annual minimum
commitments under these arrangements are insignificant.

================================================================================
   Time sales and loans represents transactions in a variety of forms, including
time sales, revolving charge and credit, mortgages, installment loans,
intermediate-term loans and revolving loans secured by business assets. The
portfolio includes time sales and loans carried at the principal amount on which
finance charges are billed periodically, and time sales and loans carried at
gross book value, which includes finance charges. At year-end 2000 and 1999,
commercial real estate loans and leases of $21,329 million and $15,782 million,
respectively, were included in either financing receivables or GECS insurance
receivables. Note 18 contains information on airline loans and leases.

   Investment in financing leases consists of direct financing and leveraged
leases of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, autos, other transportation
equipment, data processing equipment and medical equipment, as well as other
manufacturing, power generation, commercial real estate, and commercial
equipment and facilities.

   As the sole owner of assets under direct financing leases and as the equity
participant in leveraged leases, GECS is taxed on total lease payments received
and is entitled to tax deductions based on the cost of leased assets and tax
deductions for interest paid to third-party participants. GECS is generally
entitled to any residual value of leased assets.

   Investment in direct financing and leveraged leases represents net unpaid
rentals and estimated unguaranteed residual values of leased equipment, less
related deferred income. GECS has no general obligation for principal and
interest on notes and other instruments representing third-party participation
related to leveraged leases; such notes and other instruments have not been
included in liabilities but have been offset against the related rentals
receivable. The GECS share of rentals receivable on leveraged leases is
subordinate to the share of other participants who also have security interests
in the leased equipment.

(a) Experience has shown that a substantial portion of receivables will be paid
    prior to contractual maturity, and these amounts should not be regarded as
    forecasts of future cash flows.
================================================================================

   Nonearning consumer receivables were $1,139 million and $930 million at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, a substantial amount of which were
private-label credit card loans. Nonearning and reduced-earning receivables
other than consumer receivables were $949 million and $932 million at year-end
2000 and 1999, respectively.

   &quot;Impaired&quot; loans are defined by generally accepted accounting principles as
loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all
amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement. That
definition excludes, among other things, leases or large groups of
smaller-balance homogenous loans and therefore applies principally to commercial
loans held by GECS. An analysis of impaired loans follows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In line with industry practice, sales of commercial jet aircraft engines
often involve long-term customer financing commitments. In making such
commitments, it is GE's general practice to require that it have or be able to
establish a secured position in the aircraft being financed. Under such airline
financing programs, GE had issued loans and guarantees (principally guarantees)
amounting to $1,160 million at year-end 2000 and $1,453 million at year-end
1999; and it had entered into commitments totaling $1,476 million and $1,843
million at year-end 2000 and 1999, respectively, to provide financial assistance
on future aircraft engine sales. Estimated fair values of the aircraft securing
these receivables and associated guarantees exceeded the related account
balances and guaranteed amounts at December 31, 2000. GECS acts as a lender and
lessor to the commercial airline industry. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the
balance of such GECS loans, leases and equipment leased to others was $15.3
billion and $11.8 billion, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2000, GECS
had issued financial guarantees and funding commitments of $601 million ($59
million at year-end 1999) and had placed multi-year orders for various Boeing
and Airbus aircraft with list prices of approximately $22.9 billion ($9.9
billion at year-end 1999).

   At year-end 2000, the National Broadcasting Company had $7,631 million of
commitments to acquire broadcast material and the rights to broadcast television
programs, including U.S. television rights to future Olympic Games, and
commitments under long-term television station affiliation agreements that
require payments through the year 2010.

   In connection with numerous projects, primarily power generation bids and
contracts, GE had issued various bid and performance bonds and guarantees
totaling $4,599 million at year-end 2000 and $3,794 million at year-end 1999.

   Separate accounts represent investments controlled by policyholders and are
associated with identical amounts reported as insurance liabilities in note 20.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Borrowings of GE and GECS are addressed at right from two
perspectives--liquidity and interest rate risk management. Additional
information about borrowings and associated swaps can be found in note 30.

LIQUIDITY requirements of GE and GECS are principally met through the credit
markets. Maturities of long-term borrowings (including the current portion)
during the next five years follow.

   Committed credit lines of $4.2 billion had been extended to GE by 24 banks at
year-end 2000. Substantially all of GE's credit lines are available to GECS and
its affiliates in addition to their own credit lines.

   At year-end 2000, GECS and its affiliates held committed lines of credit
aggregating $28.1 billion, including $12.2 billion of revolving credit
agreements pursuant to which it has the right to borrow funds for periods
exceeding one year. Amounts drawn by GECS under these lines at December 31,
2000, were not significant. Both GE and GECS compensate certain banks for credit
facilities in the form of fees, which were insignificant in each of the past
three years.

INTEREST RATE RISK is managed by GECS in light of the anticipated behavior,
including prepayment behavior, of assets in which debt proceeds are invested. A
variety of instruments, including interest rate and currency swaps and currency
forwards, are employed to achieve management's interest rate objectives.
Effective interest rates are lower under these &quot;synthetic&quot; positions than could
have been achieved by issuing debt directly.

   The following table shows GECS borrowing positions considering the effects of
swaps.

(a)  Life insurance benefits are accounted for mainly by a net-level-premium
     method using estimated yields generally ranging from 2% to 9% in 2000 and
     from 5% to 9% in 1999.

(b)  Principally property and casualty reserves; includes amounts for both
     reported and incurred-but-not-reported claims, reduced by anticipated
     salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates of liabilities are reviewed
     and updated continually, with changes in estimated losses reflected in
     operations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   When GECS cedes insurance to third parties, it is not relieved of its primary
obligation to policyholders. Losses on ceded risks give rise to claims for
recovery; allowances are established for such receivables from reinsurers.

   The insurance liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses
related to policies that may cover environmental and asbestos exposures is based
on known facts and an assessment of applicable law and coverage litigation.
Liabilities are recognized for both known and unasserted claims (including the
cost of related litigation) when sufficient information has been developed to
indicate that a claim has been incurred and a range of potential losses can be
reasonably estimated. Developed case law and adequate claim history do not exist
for certain claims principally due to significant uncertainties as to both the
level of ultimate losses that will occur and what portion, if any, will be
deemed to be insured amounts.

   A summary of activity affecting unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses
follows.

21 GE ALL OTHER LIABILITIES
---------------------------------------------

This caption includes noncurrent compensation and benefit accruals at year-end
2000 and 1999 of $6,268 million and $5,839 million, respectively. Also included
are amounts for deferred incentive compensation, deferred income, product
warranties and a variety of sundry items.

   GE is involved in numerous remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes
as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs at each
site are based on management's best estimate of undiscounted future costs,
excluding possible insurance recoveries. When there appears to be a range of
possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the lower end of
such range. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and
information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop a
meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental
remediation exposure. However, even in the unlikely event that remediation costs
amounted to the high end of the range of costs for each site, the resulting
additional liability would not be material to GE's financial position, results
of operations or liquidity.

authorized shares of common stock from 4,400,000,000 shares each with a par
value of $0.16 to 13,200,000,000 shares each with a par value of $0.06 and (b)
the split of each unissued and issued common share, including shares held in

30 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL
   INSTRUMENTS
---------------------------------------------

This note contains estimated fair values of certain financial instruments to
which GE and GECS are parties. Apart from certain borrowings by GE and GECS and
certain marketable securities, relatively few of these instruments are actively
traded. Thus, fair values must often be determined by using one or more models
that indicate value based on estimates of quantifiable characteristics as of a
particular date. Because this undertaking is, by its nature, difficult and
highly judgmental, for a limited number of instruments, alternative valuation
techniques may have produced disclosed values different from those that could
have been realized at December 31, 2000 or 1999. Assets and liabilities that, as
a matter of accounting policy, are reflected in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value are not included in the following disclosures; such
items include cash and equivalents, investment securities and separate accounts.

   A description of how values are estimated follows.

BORROWINGS. Based on quoted market prices or market comparables. Fair values of
interest rate and currency swaps on borrowings are based on quoted market prices
and include the effects of counterparty creditworthiness.

TIME SALES AND LOANS. Based on quoted market prices, recent transactions and/or
discounted future cash flows, using rates at which similar loans would have been
made to similar borrowers.

INVESTMENT CONTRACT BENEFITS. Based on expected future cash flows, discounted at
currently offered discount rates for immediate annuity contracts or cash
surrender values for single premium deferred annuities.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND CREDIT LIFE. Based on future cash flows, considering
expected renewal premiums, claims, refunds and servicing costs, discounted at a
market rate.

ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS. Based on comparable transactions, market comparables,
discounted future cash flows, quoted market prices, and/or estimates of the cost
to terminate or otherwise settle obligations to counterparties.

   Additional information about certain financial instruments in the table above
follows.

CURRENCY FORWARDS, SWAPS AND OPTIONS are employed by GE and GECS to manage
exposures to changes in currency exchange rates associated with commercial
purchase and sale transactions and by GECS to optimize borrowing costs as
discussed in note 19. These financial instruments generally are used to fix the
cash flow variability of local currency costs or selling prices denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency. Currency exposures that result
from net investments in affiliates are managed principally by funding assets
denominated in local currency with debt denominated in those same currencies. In
certain circumstances, net investment exposures are managed using currency
forwards and currency swaps.

ANNUAL REPORT PAGE 76

OPTIONS AND INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING OPTION FEATURES that behave based on limits
(&quot;caps,&quot; &quot;floors&quot; or &quot;collars&quot;) on interest rate and equity movements are used
primarily to manage risks in certain investments as well as risks in certain
GECS business activities, such as mortgage servicing and annuities.

SWAPS OF INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCIES are used by GE and GECS to optimize
funding costs for a particular funding strategy (see note 19). A cancelable
interest rate swap was used by GE to hedge an investment position. Interest rate
swaps, along with purchased options and futures, are used by GECS to establish
specific hedges of mortgage-related assets. Credit risk of these positions is
evaluated by management under the credit criteria discussed below. As part of
its ongoing activities, GECS also enters into swaps that are integrated into
investments in or loans to particular customers. Such integrated swaps not
involving assumption of third-party credit risk are evaluated and monitored like
their associated investments or loans and are not therefore subject to the same
credit criteria that would apply to a stand-alone position.

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK--risk that counterparties will be financially unable to
make payments according to the terms of the agreements--is the principal risk
associated with swaps, purchased options and forwards. Gross market value of
probable future receipts is one way to measure this risk, but is meaningful only
in the context of net credit exposure to individual counterparties. At December
31, 2000 and 1999, this gross market risk amounted to $2.9 billion and $2.0
billion, respectively. Aggregate fair values that represent associated probable
future obligations, normally associated with a right of offset against probable
future receipts, amounted to $3.7 billion at year-end 2000 and $3.6 billion at
year-end 1999.

   Except as noted above for positions that are integrated into financings, all
swaps, purchased options and forwards are carried out within the following
credit policy constraints.

*  Once a counterparty exceeds credit exposure limits (see table below), no
   additional transactions are permitted until the exposure with that
   counterparty is reduced to an amount that is within the established limit.
   Open contracts remain in force.

================================================================================

*  All swaps are executed under master swap agreements containing mutual credit
   downgrade provisions that provide the ability to require assignment or
   termination in the event either party is downgraded below A3 or A-.

More credit latitude is permitted for transactions having original maturities
shorter than one year because of their lower risk.

   For GE, gross profit from sales is sales of goods and services less costs of
goods and services sold. For GECS, operating profit is &quot;Earnings before income
taxes.&quot;

   Earnings-per-share amounts for each quarter are required
to be computed independently. As a result, their sum does not equal the total
year earnings-per-share amounts for diluted earnings per share in 2000 and 1999,
and for basic earnings per share in 2000. Per-share amounts have been adjusted
for the 3-for-1 stock split effective on April 27, 2000.
