<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE is one of the
largest and most diversified industrial corporations in the world. GE has
engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety of products
for the generation, transmission, distribution, control and utilization of
electricity since its incorporation in 1892. Over the years, GE has developed or
acquired new technologies and services that have broadened considerably the
scope of its activities.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE's products
include major appliances; lighting products; industrial automation products;
medical diagnostic imaging equipment; motors; electrical distribution and
control equipment; locomotives; power generation and delivery products; nuclear
power support services and fuel assemblies; commercial and military aircraft jet
engines; and engineered materials, such as plastics, silicones and superabrasive
industrial diamonds; and chemicals for treatment of water and process systems.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE's services
include product services; electrical product supply houses; electrical apparatus
installation, engineering, repair and rebuilding services; and through the third
quarter of 2002, computer-related information services. Through its affiliate,
the National Broadcasting Company, Inc., GE delivers network television
services, operates television stations, and provides cable, Internet and
multimedia programming and distribution services. Through another affiliate,
General Electric Capital Services, Inc., GE offers a broad array of financial
and other services including consumer financing, commercial and industrial
financing, real estate financing, asset management and leasing, mortgage
services, consumer savings and insurance services, and specialty insurance and
reinsurance.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In virtually all of
its global business activities, GE encounters aggressive and able competition.
In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing
technology that requires continuing research and development, as well as
customer commitments. With respect to manufacturing operations, management
believes that, in general, GE is one of the leading firms in most of the major
industries in which it participates. The NBC Television Network is one of four
major U.S. commercial broadcast television networks. It also competes with
syndicated broadcast television programming and cable and satellite television
programming activities. The businesses in which GE Capital Services engages are
subject to competition from various types of financial institutions, including
commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks, broker-dealers, credit unions,
leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies,
finance companies associated with manufacturers, and insurance and reinsurance
companies.</FONT></P>

profit information about the Company's operating segments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, is presented on page 57 of
the 2002 Annual Report to Share Owners. Additional financial data and commentary
on recent financial results for operating segments are provided on pages 50-58
of that report and in note 27 (pages 101 and 102) to the consolidated financial
statements.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating
businesses that are reported as segments under SFAS No. 131 include Aircraft
Engines, Commercial Finance, Consumer Finance, Consumer Products, Equipment
Management, Insurance, NBC and Power Systems. The remaining key businesses do
not meet the definition of a reportable segment and have been aggregated into
three operating segments based on common characteristics of their activities
(Industrial Products and Systems, Materials, and Technical Products and
Services). There is appropriate elimination of the net earnings of GECS and the
immaterial effect of transactions between segments to arrive at total
consolidated data. A summary description of each of the Company's operating
segments follows.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aircraft Engines
(8.5%, 9.0% and 8.3% of consolidated revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively) produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turboshaft
engines, and related replacement parts for use in military and commercial
aircraft. GE's military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft that
includes fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft. The
CFM56&trade;, produced by CFMI, a company jointly owned by GE and Snecma of France,
and GE's CF6 and GE90&reg; engines power aircraft in all categories of large
commercial aircraft: short/medium, intermediate and long-range. Applications for
the CFM56&trade; engine include: Boeing's 737-300/-400/-500 series, the next
generation 737-600/-700/-800/-900 series, and the 737 business jet; Airbus
Industrie's A318, A319, A320, A321 and A340-200/-300 series; and military
aircraft such as the KC-135R, E/KE-3 and E-6. The CF6 family of engines powers
intermediate and long-range aircraft such as Boeing's 747, 767, DC-10 and MD-11
series, as well as Airbus Industrie's A300, A310 and A330 series. The GE90&reg;
engine is used to power Boeing's 777 series twin-engine aircraft. The GP7000,
being designed and marketed in a joint venture with the Pratt &amp; Whitney
division of United Technologies Corporation, is offered on Airbus Industrie's
A380. The business produces jet engines, such as the CF34&reg;, for executive
aircraft and regional commuter aircraft. The business also manufactures aircraft
engine derivatives used for marine propulsion, mechanical drives and industrial
power generation sources, the latter of which are reported as part of the Power
Systems segment. Maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO),
including sales of replacement parts, are provided for many models of engines,
including engines manufactured by competitors, and represent a significant
portion of this segment's profits. In the second quarter of 2002, Aircraft
Engines completed the acquisition of Unison Industries Inc., a global leader in
ignition systems for aerospace and industrial applications.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2">(4)</FONT></P>
<HR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worldwide
competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO (including parts sales) is intense.
Both U.S. and export markets are important. Product development cycles are long
and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and
development expenditures, both customer-financed and internally funded, are
important in this segment. Focused intellectual property strategies and
protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product
upgrade technologies are also important. Potential sales for any engine are
limited by, among other things, its technological lifetime, which may vary
considerably depending upon the rate of advance in the state of the art, by the
small number of potential customers and by the limited number of relevant
airframe applications. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and
airline procurement cycles, although cycles for military and commercial engine
procurement are different. Procurements of military jet engines are affected by
changes in global political and economic factors.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with
industry practice, airframe manufacturers support their sales of commercial jet
aircraft from time to time with long-term financing commitments to customers,
and engine manufacturers are often asked to participate in such financings. In
making such commitments, it is GE's policy to establish a secured position in
the aircraft being financed. Under such airline financing programs, GE had
issued guarantees amounting to $0.7 billion at year-end 2002, and had entered
into commitments totaling $1.6 billion to provide financial assistance on future
aircraft engine sales. At December 31, 2002, the total estimated fair value of
aircraft securing these guarantees exceeded the guaranteed amounts, net of the
associated allowance for losses. See page 50 of the 2002 Annual Report to Share
Owners for information about orders and backlog.</FONT></P>

Commercial Finance provides loans, financing and operating leases, and other

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial
Equipment Financing (CEF) offers large and small companies a broad line of
leases and loans. Customers include manufacturers, distributors, dealers,
end-users, and municipalities. Financial products include financing for
construction equipment, corporate aircraft, medical equipment, trucks and
trailers. CEF also furnishes customers with direct-source tax-exempt finance
programs, as well as lease and sale/leaseback offerings. Products are either
held for CEF's own account or brokered to third parties. Transactions range in
size from $50 thousand to $50 million, with financing terms from 36 to 180
months. CEF also maintains an asset management operation that redeploys
off-lease and repossessed equipment and other assets. During 2002, CEF purchased
certain assets and liabilities from Finova Corporation, Comdisco Corporation and
Australian Guarantee Corporation.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2">(5)</FONT></P>
<HR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global
commercial equipment financing industry continues to be highly fragmented and
intensely competitive. Competitors in the U.S. domestic and international
markets include independent financing companies, financing subsidiaries of
equipment manufacturers, and banks (national, regional, and local). Industry
participants compete not only on the basis of monthly payments, interest rates
and fees charged customers but also on deal structures and credit terms. The
profitability of CEF is affected not only by broad economic conditions that
impact customer credit quality and the availability and cost of capital, but
also by successful management of credit risk, operating risk and such market
risks as interest rate and currency exchange risk. Important factors to
continued success include maintaining strong risk management systems, diverse
portfolios, service and distribution channels, strong collateral and asset
management knowledge, deal structuring expertise and the reduction of costs
through enhanced use of technology.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Estate is one
of the world's leading providers of debt and equity capital to the global
commercial real estate market. Real Estate provides funds for the acquisition,
refinancing and renovation of real estate assets as well as making equity
investments in real estate throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe
and Asia. Lending is a major portion of Real Estate's business in the form of
intermediate-term senior and subordinated fixed and floating-rate loans secured
by existing income-producing commercial properties such as office buildings,
apartment buildings, retail centers, warehouses and hotels. Loans range from
single-property mortgages typically not less than $1 million to multi-property
portfolios of several hundred million dollars. Real Estate's business also
includes the origination and subsequent securitization of low leverage real
estate loans, which are intended to be held less than one year before sale.
Additionally, Real Estate purchases and provides restructuring financing for
portfolios of real estate, mortgage loans, limited partnerships, and tax-exempt
bonds.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Estate holds
equity positions in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets via direct
real estate ownership and joint venture interests. Property types include
apartment buildings, self-storage facilities, warehouses, parking facilities,
retail centers and office properties. Real Estate's equity holdings increased in
2002 with the acquisition of Security Capital Group Incorporated, an
international real estate operating company. This acquisition provided Real
Estate with ownership positions in self-storage facilities, parking facilities,
grocery-anchored neighborhood retail centers, warehouse facilities and
distribution services, senior assisted living facilities, office properties and
real estate investment advisory businesses. Also in 2002, Real Estate purchased
the commercial real estate and asset-based lending portfolios of DaimlerChrysler
Capital Services.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is
intense in each of Real Estate's areas and across all product lines. Competitors
include local, regional and, increasingly, multi-national lenders and investors.
Important competitive factors in Real Estate's lending activities include
financing rates, loan proceeds, loan structure, the ability to fund transactions
efficiently, and the outlook of local real estate markets. Where Real Estate
provides equity capital, principal competitive factors include the valuation of
underlying properties and investment structure as well as transaction cycle
time.</FONT></P>

based on interest rates, fees, credit terms, and transaction structures. In
addition to these factors, successful management of credit risks within the
existing customer loan portfolio also affects profitability. Important factors
to continued success include maintaining deal structuring expertise, strong risk
management systems, and collateral management knowledge.</FONT></P>

telecommunications and energy, are faced with extraordinary challenges fostered
by deregulation, globalization and technical innovation. Both of these
industries have been recently experiencing significant volatility in demand for
their products and services. For SFG to remain competitive, SFG must provide
capital to borrowers in innovative and unique ways based on industry knowledge

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the
events of September 11, 2001, many of our airline customers have experienced
financial difficulties. In face of declining traffic, they have responded by
curtailing flight schedules and deferring and canceling deliveries of commercial
aircraft. Deteriorating aircraft utilization and pricing affects Aviation
Services, which owned 1,161 commercial aircraft at December 31, 2002, when,
despite pressure on the industry, 1,149, or 99% were on lease. We believe,
however, that the financial difficulties of our airline customers will continue

variety of industries including information technology, office equipment,
healthcare, telecommunications, energy and industrial equipment. VFS establishes
sales financing in two ways -- by forming captive partnerships with
manufacturers that do not have them, and by outsourcing captive partnerships
from manufacturers that do (captive partnerships provide sales financing solely
for products of a given manufacturer). VFS offers industry-specific knowledge,
leading edge technology, leasing and equipment expertise, and global
capabilities. In addition, VFS provides an expanding array of related financial
services to customers, including trade payables services. In November 2002, VFS
acquired the stock of Deutsche Financial Services which became a VFS business
line, Commercial Distribution Finance (CDF). CDF is a leading global provider of
specialized distribution financing programs and services including inventory
financing, accounts receivable financing, formula based lending, private label
financing, rental finance, warranty and collateral management services.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further economic
slowdown could impact the equipment financing industry, intensifying a
competitive pricing environment, pressure delinquencies and residual

Financial Assurance (GEFA) provides a wide variety of insurance and protection
products to help consumers achieve financial security at every stage of life.
GEFA's strategy is to provide dependable products to address consumers' needs
for wealth accumulation, retirement income, personal protection, and wealth
transfer needs. These products are sold through a family of regulated insurance
and annuity affiliates. GEFA's principal product lines in North America and Asia
are annuities (deferred and immediate, fixed and variable), life insurance
(universal, term, ordinary and group), guaranteed investment contracts including
funding agreements, long-term care insurance, supplementary accident and health
insurance and consumer club memberships. GEFA's principal product lines and
services in Europe are payment protection insurance (designed to protect
customers' loan repayment obligations), personal investment products, and travel
and personal accident insurance. GEFA's product distribution in North America,
Europe and Asia is accomplished primarily through four channels: intermediaries
(brokerage general agencies, banks and securities brokerage and financial
planning firms), dedicated sales forces and financial advisors, worksite
distribution, and direct and affinity marketing.</FONT></P>

sale of insurance and investment products are product features, distribution
strength, commission structure, perceived stability of the insurer, claims
paying ability ratings, service, name recognition, price and cost efficiency,
and strong compliance practices. GEFA's ability to compete is affected by its
ability to provide competitive products and quality service to the consumer,
general agents, licensed insurance agents and brokers; to maintain operating
scale; and to continually reduce its expenses through the elimination of
duplicate functions and enhanced technology.</FONT></P>

insurance carrier for over 2.1 million residential homes, with total insurance
in force aggregating approximately $212.6 billion and total risk in force
aggregating approximately $101.5 billion. When a valid claim is received,

about the same time. Debt ratings for GE Global Insurance Holding affect $1.7
billion of outstanding debt. These ratings were adjusted negatively in 2002, but
remained investment grade. We do not believe these actions will materially
affect GE Global Insurance Holding liquidity or capital resources or the ability

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously
reported, in January 2002 the Company entered into discussions with the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation regarding noncompliance with the
state's Clean Water Act at its Waterford, NY facility. The state alleges spills
and discharges in excess of permitted limits as well as reporting violations.
The state informed the Company that it would seek a penalty of $1.5 million. It
has since reduced its demand to $1 million. The Company has already commenced
implementation of a multi-million dollar program to eliminate the source of the
spills. Negotiations to resolve the final penalty are underway.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously
reported, in April 2002, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency informed the
Company that it was seeking penalties of $4.3 million for violations of the
state's Clean Air Act at its Newark, OH facility. The state alleged that the
site constructed air emission sources without undergoing adequate New Source
Review. The matter involves conditions identified by the Company and voluntarily
disclosed to the state more than 5 years ago which the Company proactively
addressed with the concurrence of the state. The state has since reduced its
demand to $1.4 million, which the Company still believes is inappropriate and
unreasonable considering the history of the matter. Negotiations with the state
are underway.</FONT></P>

the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency informed the Company that it was

<P>ABOUT THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</P>
<P>At GE, all of our businesses share common values and objectives, each
striving to deliver excellent performance and generate increasing share owner
value. However, our businesses are also diverse. With this diversity comes
enormous opportunity, as well as significant challenges. One example of
this combination of opportunity and challenge is our need to share our financial
statements in the most meaningful way possible. To fulfill this objective we
continue to present our consolidated financial information as well as
information divided into two major categories &#8211; industrial (GE) and financial
services (GECS). By reviewing the two major categories, you can gain a
meaningful assessment of our performance in measures like leverage, asset
turnover and cash flow. While our financial report is longer than it has been
historically, that additional length arose from your requests for information.
Our discussion of segment results includes asset details for the major financial
services businesses, for example, since portfolio size is significant to
earnings of those businesses.</P>
<P>When we committed to increasing our transparency, we expected that this
report would be a primary vehicle that provides a reference source for your
questions about us. We started that process last year, and the 2002 report
continues the trend. You will see that our financial section, 69 pages long,
contains significantly more information than our 2000 report contained in its 44
pages. We sincerely believe that we have progressed towards our transparency
objective, and believe that you will find the important financial information
you need in the pages that follow.</P>
<P>We are available to answer your questions, and, when those questions would be
of interest to a broader audience, we will include that information in our
financial reports. Following are among the other important changes this year,
changes that we trust will assist you in using these financial statements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>We present our financial information electronically at <I>www.ge.com/investor</I>. This site is much more than an electronic reproduction
    of the following pages. It is interactive and informative, and we believe it
    gives a glimpse into the future of financial reporting. We invite you to
    help us accelerate this process by giving us feedback on the website.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>We changed the way that we manage certain financial services businesses,
    increasing the total number of reporting segments from eight to 12. We have
    recast all comparative financial data to provide an accurate basis for
    comparison.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>We describe our businesses on pages 108 and 109.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>We have included a glossary of key financial and business terms on pages

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>MANAGEMENT&#146;S
DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</B></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Level 1" FSL="Default" -->
<P>
One
of our most crucial management objectives is to ensure that our investors are well
informed. We take full responsibility for meeting this objective, adopting appropriate
accounting policies and devoting our full, unyielding commitment to ensuring that those
policies are applied properly and consistently. We make every effort to report in a manner
that is relevant, complete and clear, and we welcome and evaluate each suggestion from
those who use our reports.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Rigorous Management
Oversight</B></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>Members of our corporate leadership
team review each of our businesses constantly, on matters that range from overall strategy
and financial performance, to staffing and compliance. Our business leaders constantly
monitor real-time financial and operating systems, enabling us to identify potential
opportunities and concerns at an early stage, and positioning us to develop and execute
rapid responses. Our Board of Directors oversees management&#146;s business conduct, and
our Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, oversees our system
of internal financial controls and disclosure controls. We have taken a number of recent
governance actions intended to enhance investor trust and improve the board&#146;s overall
effectiveness. These actions include increasing to a majority the number of independent
directors, naming a Presiding Director who will conduct at least three meetings per year
with non-employee directors, requiring each non-employee director to visit two of
GE&#146;s businesses annually to meet directly with operating leadership and voluntarily
expensing our stock options.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Dedication to
Controllership</B></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>We maintain a dynamic system of
disclosure controls and procedures&#151;including internal controls over financial
reporting&#151;designed to ensure reliable financial record-keeping, transparent financial
reporting and disclosure, protection of physical and intellectual property, and efficient
use of resources. We recruit and retain a world-class financial team, including 450
internal auditors who conduct thousands of audits each year, in every geographic area, at
every GE business. Senior management and the Audit Committee oversee the scope and results
of these reviews. We also maintain a set of integrity policies&#151;our &#147;Spirit &amp;
Letter&#148;&#151;which require compliance with law and policy, and which pertain to such
vital issues as upholding financial integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest. We have
published these integrity policies in 27 languages, and we have provided them to every one
of GE&#146;s more than 300,000 global employees, holding each of these
individuals&#151;from our top management on down&#151;personally accountable for
compliance with them. Our integrity policies serve to reinforce key employee
responsibilities around the world, and we inquire extensively about compliance. Our strong
compliance culture reinforces these efforts by requiring employees to raise any compliance
concerns and by prohibiting retribution for doing so.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Visibility to Investors</B></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>We are keenly aware of the importance
of full and open presentation of our financial position and operating results. To
facilitate this, we maintain a Disclosure Committee, which includes senior executives who
possess exceptional knowledge of our businesses and our investors. We have asked this
committee to evaluate the fairness of our financial disclosures, and to report their
findings to us and to the Audit Committee. We further ensure strong disclosure by holding
more than 250 analyst and investor meetings every year, and by communicating all material
information covered in those meetings to the public. In testament to the effectiveness of
our stringent disclosure policies, investors surveyed annually by <I> Investor Relations</I>
magazine have awarded GE Best Overall Investor Relations Program by a mega-cap company for
six consecutive years, and 15 awards in other categories in the past seven years. We are
in regular contact with representatives of the major rating agencies, and our debt
continues to receive their highest ratings. We welcome the strong oversight of our
financial reporting activities by our independent audit firm, KPMG LLP, who are engaged by
and report directly to the Audit Committee. Their report for 2002 appears on page 45.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great
companies are built on the foundation of reliable financial information and compliance
with the law. For GE, the financial disclosures made in this report are a vital part of
that foundation. We present this information proudly, with the expectation that those who
use it will understand our company, recognize our commitment to performance with
integrity, and share our confidence in GE&#146;s future.</P>

AUDITORS&#146; REPORT</B></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>To Share Owners and Board of Directors of<BR>
General Electric Company:</B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position
of General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates (&quot;GE&quot;) as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related statements of earnings, changes in
share owners' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of GE management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements
appearing on pages F-30, F-32, F-34, F-15, and F-36 to F-67 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of General Electric Company and
consolidated affiliates at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
GE in 2002 changed its methods of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets and for stock-based compensation, and in 2001 changed its methods of
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and impairment of
certain beneficial interests in securitized assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements taken as whole. The accompanying
consolidating information appearing on pages F-31, F-33, and F-35 is presented
for purposes of additional analysis of the consolidated financial statements
rather than to present the financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the individual entities. The consolidating information has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the consolidated
financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material
respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Overview</B></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>General Electric Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements represent the combination of the industrial
manufacturing and product services businesses of General Electric Company (GE) and the
financial services businesses of General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS or
financial services).</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
present Management&#146;s Discussion of Operations in three parts: Consolidated
Operations, Segment Operations and International Operations.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Consolidated Operations</B></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>We achieved record earnings in 2002,
demonstrating the benefits of our diverse business portfolio and continuing emphasis on
globalization, technology, growth in services, digitization and the Six Sigma Quality
initiative.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
consolidated revenues were $131.7 billion in 2002, an increase of 5% over revenues of
$125.9 billion in 2001, reflecting a 7% increase in our industrial businesses and a slight
decrease in financial services. Our consolidated revenues of $125.9 billion in 2001
decreased 3% from $129.9 billion in 2000, reflecting a 6% increase in industrial business
revenues partially offsetting a 12% decrease in financial services&#151;the result of
significant strategic repositioning activities.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
earnings before accounting changes increased to a record $15.1 billion in 2002, a 7%
increase from $14.1 billion in 2001. Per-share earnings before accounting changes
increased to $1.51 during 2002, up 7% from the prior year&#146;s $1.41. (Except as
otherwise noted, when we refer to &#147;per-share earnings&#148; or &#147;earnings per
share,&#148; we mean earnings per share on a diluted basis.)</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions
from acquisitions affect earnings comparisons. Our consolidated net earnings in 2002, 2001
and 2000 include approximately $636 million, $225 million and $345 million, respectively,
from acquired businesses. We integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible and only
earnings during the first 12 months following the quarter in which we complete the
acquisition are considered to be related to acquired businesses.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>RETURN ON AVERAGE SHARE OWNERS&#146;
EQUITY (excluding the effect of accounting changes) was 25.8% in 2002, compared with 27.1%
in 2001, which was about the same as in 2000.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>WE DECLARED $7.3 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS
IN 2002. Per-share dividends of $0.73 were up 11% from 2001, following a 16% increase from
the preceding year. We have rewarded our share owners with 27 consecutive years of
dividend growth. Our dividend growth for the past five years has significantly outpaced
dividend growth of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s 500 stock index.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as otherwise noted, the analysis in the remainder of this section presents the results of
GE (with GECS included on a one-line basis) and GECS. See the Segment Operations section
on page 50 for a more detailed discussion of the businesses within GE and GECS.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>GE TOTAL REVENUES were $79.0 billion
in 2002, compared with $74.0 billion in 2001 and $69.5 billion in 2000.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE
sales of goods and services were $73.3 billion in 2002, an increase of 8% from 2001, which
in turn was 7% higher than in 2000. Volume was about 9% higher in 2002, reflecting
double-digit increases at Power Systems, NBC, Medical Systems, Specialty Materials and
Industrial Systems, partially offset by decreases at Aircraft Engines and Transportation
Systems. Selling prices were lower across most segments other than NBC and Power Systems.
The net effect in 2002 of exchange rates on sales denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar was slightly positive. Volume in 2001 was about 7% higher than in 2000, with
selling price and currency effects both slightly negative.</P>

purposes of the financial statement display of sales and costs of sales on pages 72 and

to include all sales of tangible products, and &#147;services&#148; must include all other
sales, including broadcasting and information services activities. We refer to sales of
both spare parts (goods) and repair services as sales of &#147;product services,&#148;
which is an important part of our operations. Sales of product services were $20.8 billion
in 2002, an 11% increase over 2001. Increases in product services in 2002 and 2001 were
widespread, led by continued strong growth at Power Systems, Medical Systems and
Transportation Systems. Operating margin from product services was approximately $5.2
billion, up 11% from 2001. The increase reflected improvements in most product services
businesses and was led by Power Systems and Medical Systems.</P>

<P>GE OTHER INCOME, earned from a wide
variety of sources, was $1.1 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Other income in 2002 included a $0.6 billion pre-tax gain resulting
from NBC&#146;s exchange of certain assets for the cable network Bravo and a $0.5 billion
pre-tax gain on the sale of 90% of Global eXchange Services.</P>

<P>GECS TOTAL REVENUES decreased
slightly to $58.2 billion in 2002, following a 12% decrease to $58.4 billion in 2001. The
largest single factor affecting 2002 revenues was growth from increases in acquisitions
and originations&#151;primarily at Commercial Finance. This growth was more than offset by
the absence of revenues from Americom after its sale in late 2001 ($1.7 billion),
increased estimates of prior-year loss events and lower investment gains at Insurance
($0.9 billion), lower securitization activity in all segments ($0.6 billion), and lower
market interest rates.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
three principal reasons for the decrease in revenues in 2001 compared with 2000 were: the
deconsolidation of Montgomery Ward LLC (Wards) and resulting absence of sales in 2001
($3.2 billion); the effects of rationalization of operations and market conditions at IT
Solutions ($2.9 billion); and reduced surrender fees ($1.2 billion) associated with the
planned run-off of restructured insurance policies of Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company
(Toho) at GE Financial Assurance. Additional information about other revenue items is
provided in the Segment Operations section on page 50.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite
good growth in underlying operations, GECS earnings before accounting changes of $4.6
billion in 2002 were down 17% from 2001. The Insurance segment more than accounted for the
decline, with $2.3 billion after tax of adverse development and adjustments to estimates
of prior-year loss events. Realized investment gains and gains on asset securitization
declined by $0.8 billion after tax. Partial offsets were goodwill amortization that ceased
at the beginning of 2002 ($0.6 billion in 2001) and lower taxes ($0.6 billion).</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GECS
earnings before accounting changes in 2001 increased 8% from 2000. Principal factors in
the 2001 increase were strong productivity ($0.7 billion) and lower taxes ($0.5 billion)
partially offset by reduced earnings at GE Global Insurance Holding Corporation (GE Global
Insurance Holding), the parent of Employers Reinsurance Corporation ($0.5 billion)
reflecting the events of September 11, 2001, losses and lower realized gains on financial
instruments. Excluding effects of Paine Webber Group, Inc. (PaineWebber) in 2000 and
Americom in 2001, such pre-tax gains were lower in 2001 by $0.5 billion ($0.3 billion
after tax). Pre-tax gains on sales of investment securities declined in 2001 by $0.5
billion, of which $0.4 billion related to GE Equity; other GE Equity gains were $0.8
billion lower; while gains on securitizations were up $0.8 billion from 2000.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>PRINCIPAL COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR GE
are those classified as costs of goods and services sold, and selling, general and
administrative expenses. Several of our ongoing initiatives had significant effects on
costs:</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Level 1" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>
The Six Sigma Quality initiative continues to reduce rework, simplify processes and reduce
direct material costs.&nbsp;<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI> Globalization continues to reduce costs through sourcing of
products and services in lower-cost countries.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI> Digitization has also enabled
us to simplify and streamline processes while investing in internal infrastructure
hardware and software. We conduct a growing portion of our business over the Internet.
Benefits from this initiative include improved customer service, expanded product and
service offerings and increased operating efficiency for us and our customers.&nbsp;</LI>
</UL>
<P> Our
principal U.S. postretirement benefit plans (plans) contributed $806 million to pre-tax
earnings in 2002, or 3.5% of earnings before accounting changes, compared with $1,480
million (6.8%) and $1,266 million (6.5%) in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Considering
current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on
various categories of assets in which our plans are invested, we assumed that long-term
returns on our pension plan assets would be 8.5% in 2002 and 9.5% in 2001 and 2000.
Reducing the assumed return by 100 basis points in 2002 increased annual pension costs by
about $480 million pretax. Of course, actual annual investment returns can be extremely
volatile. Because this short-term market volatility occurs in context of the long-term
nature of pension plans, U.S. accounting principles provide that differences between
assumed and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees.</P>

<HR WIDTH="200" NOSHADE SIZE="1" ALIGN="left">

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two
other significant factors affecting postretirement benefit costs are the discount rate
used to measure the present value of plan obligations and changes in postretirement
healthcare costs. We reduced our discount rate from 7&frac12;% to 7&frac14;% for 2002, a reduction
that increased our costs by about $90 million pretax. Postretirement healthcare costs also
increased substantially in 2002. See notes 5 and 6 for additional information about
funding status, components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions of the plans. See
pages 70-71 for discussion of pension assumptions.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
postretirement benefit costs will likely increase in 2003 for a number of reasons,
including a reduction in the discount rate from 7&frac14;% to 6&frac34;%, amortization of investment
losses and sustained increases in healthcare costs. We continue to expect that our plan
assets will earn 8&frac12;%, on average, over the long term. Our labor agreements with various
unions expire in June 2003, and results of union negotiations, which are uncertain, could
affect postretirement benefit costs in 2003 and beyond.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
will not make any contributions to the GE Pension Plan in 2003. To the best of our ability
to forecast the next five years, we do not anticipate making contributions to that Plan so
long as expected investment returns are achieved. The present funding status provides
assurance of benefits for our participants, but future effects on operating results and
funding depend on economic conditions and investment performance.</P>

<P>OPERATING MARGIN is sales of goods
and services less the costs of goods and services sold, as well as selling, general and
administrative expenses. GE operating margin was 19.1% of sales in 2002, down from 19.6%
in 2001 and about the same as the comparable 18.9% in 2000. The decline in 2002 was
attributable to the Materials segment and the Lighting business in Consumer Products and
also reflected restructuring and other charges of $0.6 billion, partially offset by
improvements in operating margins at Power Systems and NBC. Restructuring and other
charges included $0.4 billion for rationalizing certain operations and facilities of
GE&#146;s worldwide industrial businesses. The improvement in operating margin in 2001 was
led by Power Systems and Aircraft Engines, reflecting increasing benefits from the
digitization, product services and Six Sigma Quality initiatives. Reported operating
margin was 18.6% in 2000, including the costs of a one-time retirement benefit provision
associated with the labor agreement concluded in that year.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>TOTAL COST PRODUCTIVITY (sales in
relation to costs, both on a constant dollar basis) for GE in 2002 and 2001 was about 2%.
Variable cost productivity improvements (led by Industrial Systems and Plastics) and base
cost productivity improvements at Plastics were more than offset by lower base cost
productivity primarily at Power Systems, Industrial Systems and Specialty Materials. In
2001, total cost productivity was 2.2% as productivity in Power Systems and Medical
Systems was partially offset by negative productivity across several businesses,
particularly Plastics, reflecting volume declines.</P>

<P>GE INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL
CHARGES in 2002 amounted to $569 million, down 30% from $817 million in 2001, which was
about the same as 2000. The decrease in 2002 was primarily the result of lower interest on
tax liabilities (see page 49). During 2001, the benefits of lower average interest rates
and lower average borrowing levels were partially offset by increased provisions for
interest on tax liabilities.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>GECS INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS
in 2002 was $9.9 billion, compared with $10.6 billion in 2001 and $11.1 billion in 2000.
Changes in both years reflected the effects of lower interest rates, partially offset by
the effects of higher average borrowings used to finance acquisitions and asset growth.
The average composite effective interest rate was 4.07% in 2002, compared with 5.11% in
2001 and 5.89% in 2000. In 2002, average assets of $455.2 billion were 18% higher than in
2001, which in turn were 7% higher than in 2000. See page 62 for a discussion of interest
rate risk management.</P>

<P>FINANCING SPREADS. Over the last
three years, market interest rates have been more volatile than GECS average composite
effective interest rates, principally because of the mix of effectively fixed-rate
borrowings in the GECS financing structure. Yields on our portfolio of fixed and
floating-rate financial products have behaved similarly; consequently, financing spreads
have remained relatively flat over the three-year period.</P>

<P>INCOME TAXES on consolidated earnings
before accounting changes were 19.9%, compared with 28.3% in 2001 and 31.0% in 2000. A

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
effective tax rate of GE decreased to 20.2% in 2002 from 22.9% in 2001 and 23.0% in 2000.
During 2002, GE entered into settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
concerning certain export tax benefits. The result of those settlements, included in the
line &#147;Tax on international activities including exports&#148; in note 7, was a
decrease in the GE effective tax rate of approximately two percentage points. Also during
2002, GE entered into a tax advantaged transaction to exchange certain assets for the
cable network Bravo. The effect of this transaction on the GE effective tax rate is
included in the line &#147;All other&#151;net&#148; in note 7.</P>

effective tax rate decreased to negative 1.7% in 2002 from 19.8% in 2001 and 26.9% in
2000. The 2002 effective tax rate reflects effects of pre-tax losses at GE Global
Insurance Holding (ERC) and GE Equity, the effects of lower taxed earnings from
international operations and favorable tax settlements with the IRS discussed below.
Pre-tax losses of $2.9 billion at ERC and $0.6 billion at GE Equity reduced the effective
tax rate of GECS by approximately 17 percentage points.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2002, as a result of revised IRS regulations, GECS reached a settlement with the IRS
allowing the deduction of previously realized losses associated with the prior disposition
of Kidder Peabody. Also during 2002, a settlement was reached with the IRS regarding the
treatment of certain reserves for obligations to policyholders on life insurance contracts
in the GE Financial Assurance business. The benefits of these settlements, which reduced
the GECS rate approximately four percentage points (excluding the ERC and GE Equity
losses), are included in the line &#147;All other&#151;net&#148; in note 7.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
2001 effective tax rate of GECS reflected the effects of lower taxed earnings from
international operations and certain other transactions (see note 7). That rate also
included effects of a $0.6 billion pre-tax charge related to the events of September 11,
2001, principally at ERC, which reduced the GECS effective tax rate by one percentage
point.</P>

<P>NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) 142, <I> Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>, generally became effective for
us on January 1, 2002. Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested for
impairment using a fair value methodology. We stopped amortizing goodwill effective
January 1, 2002.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
result of our applying the new rules as of January 1, 2002, was a non-cash charge of $1.2
billion ($1.0 billion after tax, or $0.10 per share), which we reported in the caption
&#147;Cumulative effect of accounting changes.&#148; Substantially all of the charge
relates to the GECS IT Solutions business and the GECS GE Auto and Home business. Factors
contributing to the impairment charge were the difficult economic environment in the
information technology sector and heightened price competition in the auto insurance
industry. After the required accounting changes, our 2002 earnings and earnings per share
were $14.1 billion and $1.41, respectively, compared with $13.7 billion and $1.37,
respectively, in 2001.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2002, we adopted the stock option expense provisions of SFAS 123, <I> Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation</I>. This accounting change did not result in a cumulative effect
charge, but increased 2002 costs by $45 million and reduced net earnings by $27 million.
See note 1 on page 81 for additional information.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2001 related to the adoption, as of January 1,
2001, of SFAS 133, <I> Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities</I>, as
amended, and the consensus of the FASB&#146;s Emerging Issues Task Force on Issue 99-20,
<I>
Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial
Interests in Securitized Financial Assets</I>. Adoption of these standards resulted in a
one-time, non-cash charge that reduced our 2001 earnings by $444 million ($0.04 per
share). After these required accounting changes, our 2001 earnings and earnings per share
were $13.7 billion and $1.37, respectively, compared with $12.7 billion and $1.27,
respectively, in 2000.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>MAJOR PROVISIONS OF NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS that will affect us follow.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS
143, <I> Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</I>, requires recognition of the fair value
of obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets when there is a legal
obligation to incur such costs. This amount is accounted for like an additional element of
cost, and, like other cost elements, is depreciated over the corresponding asset&#146;s
useful life. SFAS 143 primarily affects our accounting for costs associated with the
future retirement of facilities used for storage and production of nuclear fuel. On
January 1, 2003, we recorded a liability for the expected present value of future
retirement costs of $363 million, increased net property, plant and equipment by $24
million and recognized a one-time, cumulative effect charge of $215 million (net of tax).
This accounting change will not involve cash and will have only a modest effect on future
earnings.</P>

November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, <I> Guarantor&#146;s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others</I>. Among other things, the Interpretation requires guarantors to recognize, at
fair value, their obligations to stand ready to perform under certain guarantees. FIN 45

an inconsequential effect on our financial position and future results of operations.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, <I> Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities</I>, which
we intend to adopt on July 1, 2003. FIN 46's consolidation criteria are based on
analysis of risks and rewards, not control, and represent a significant and complex
modification of previous accounting principles. FIN 46 represents an accounting change,
not a change in the underlying economics of asset sales. Under its provisions, certain
assets previously sold to our special purpose entities (SPEs) could be consolidated on our
books, and, if consolidated, any assets and liabilities now on our books related to those
SPEs would be removed. In the event we consolidated these assets, we would not reacquire
their legal ownership, nor would our legal rights and obligations change. Any consolidated
assets would earn returns substantially like the returns we would have earned had we never
sold them. Even assuming the legal provisions controlling these SPEs are not changed
between now and the July 1 effective date of FIN 46, the very complexity of the new
consolidation rules and their evolving clarification make forecasting that July 1 effect
impracticable. It is also clear that many alternative structures for sales of financial
assets would continue to be reported as sales under FIN 46 with the assets qualifying for
sale not consolidated. We are evaluating whether characteristics of those structures can
cost-beneficially be applied to our arrangements before the July 1 effective date. Further
information about entities that potentially fall within the scope of FIN 46 is provided in
note 29.</P>

rationalization or other similar expenses; and litigation settlements or other losses,
responsibility for which precedes the current business management team. Segment profit
excludes any goodwill amortization, the effects of pensions and other retiree benefit
plans and accounting changes. Segment profit excludes or includes interest and other
financial charges and segment income taxes according to how segment management is
measured&#151;excluded in determining operating profit for Aircraft Engines, Consumer

Consumer Finance, Equipment Management, Insurance and All Other GECS.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>AIRCRAFT ENGINES reported a 2%
decrease in revenues in 2002 as commercial engine pricing pressures and reduced commercial
product services revenues combined with lower industrial units were substantially offset
by increased military sales. Operating profit was 4% lower, primarily as a result of lower
pricing for commercial engines, lower product services volume from reduced flight hours
and higher labor costs, partially offset by lower material costs and productivity.
Revenues and operating profit increased 6% and 7%, respectively, in 2001, reflecting
higher volume in product services and higher volume of commercial engines and
aero-derivative products. The improvement in operating profit was also attributable to
productivity.</P>

<P>Commercial Finance revenues increased
16% in both 2002 and 2001. The 2002 increase principally reflected acquisitions and
increased originations across substantially all businesses, partially offset by reduced
market interest rates and lower securitization activity at CF and Commercial Equipment
Financing. The 2001 increase resulted from acquisition and volume growth at Commercial
Equipment Financing, Vendor Financial Services, Aviation Services and CF, including the
acquisition of Heller Financial, Inc. in October, volume growth at Structured Finance
Group and increased securitization activity. Net earnings increased 17% in 2002 and 19% in
2001. The 2002 increase in net earnings resulted from acquisitions and origination growth,
productivity across all businesses and growth in lower taxed earnings from international
operations, partially offset by increased credit losses and lower securitization activity
at CF and Commercial Equipment Financing. The 2001 increase reflected securitization
gains, asset growth from acquisitions at Commercial Equipment Financing, CF and Vendor
Financial Services, origination growth at Structured Finance Group, and higher asset gains
and productivity at Real Estate. Other Commercial Finance principally includes 2002
revenues of $246 million and net earnings of $62 million of the Healthcare Financial
Services business that we acquired in October 2001, offset by certain costs related to our

<P>Consumer Finance revenues increased
8% following a 2% increase in 2001. Revenues increased in 2002 primarily as a result of
acquisitions and increased international originations, partially offset by lower
securitization activity at Card Services. The revenue performance in 2001 reflected the
post-acquisition revenues from acquired businesses and volume growth. Net earnings
increased 13% following a 24% increase in 2001, as a result of origination growth,
acquisitions, growth in lower taxed earnings from international operations and
productivity benefits, partially offset by lower securitization activity at Card Services.
The 2001 increase reflected productivity at Global Consumer Finance and volume growth at

<P>Consumer Products revenues were flat in 2002 as 5% higher Appliances
revenues, reflecting success of new products, were offset by a 9% decline in
Lighting revenues. Consumer Products pricing was down during the year. Operating
profit decreased 24%, reflecting adverse results in Lighting, particularly from
lower prices, higher base costs and higher charges resulting from customer
credit issues. Consumer Products revenues in 2001 were 3% lower than in 2000 as
price erosion at Appliances and Lighting offset modest market share gains at
Appliances. Operating profit decreased by 26% in 2001, largely as a result of
lower selling prices at Appliances and Lighting and increased program spending
on new products at Appliances.<BR>

<P>Industrial Products and Systems reported a 7% increase in revenues and 3% lower operating profit as volume increased and selling
prices declined across the segment. Industrial Systems revenues rose 12% compared with 2001, but operating profit declined 7%,
reflecting the negative effects of lower selling prices, partially offset by the positive effects of acquisitions and productivity.
Transportation Systems revenues were 2% lower and operating profit was about the same as in 2001, as product services revenues,
strong variable cost productivity and lower materials costs offset the effects of lower volume and pricing pressures. Industrial
Products and Systems revenues in 2001 were 2% higher than in 2000, as higher product services revenues at Transportation Systems,
including acquisitions, more than offset selling price decreases across the segment and lower volume at Industrial Systems. Operating
profit decreased 8% in 2001 primarily as a result of the decline in selling prices and cost inflation.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation Systems received orders of $2.8 billion in 2002, compared with $2.6 billion in 2001. The $2.1 billion total

Charges of $306 million in 2001 were not allocated to this segment because we
did not include these costs in measuring the performance of businesses in this

provisions for disposition of nonstrategic investments.

</PRE>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>Insurance revenues decreased 2% in
2002, because of the ongoing planned run-off of acquired policies at Toho and lower
realized investment gains. Segment revenues declined 4% in 2001 on reduced net premiums
earned at ERC, reflecting the events of September 11, 2001, decreased investment income,
and the planned run-off of restructured insurance policies at Toho. These factors were
partially offset by increased premium income associated with origination volume at ERC and
by post-acquisition revenues from acquired businesses and volume growth at GE Financial
Assurance.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
pre-tax realized investment gains in the equity and debt securities portfolios amounted to
$413 million, $972 million and $818 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
earnings decreased $1.8 billion in 2002, following a $0.3 billion decrease in 2001. The
2002 decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of adverse development related
to prior-year loss events at ERC, discussed below. With retrocession coverages previously
purchased by ERC, the recording of this adverse development both increased policyholder
losses and, to a lesser extent, decreased premium revenues (principally because of higher
levels of contingent ceded premiums following these reserve adjustments). Also
contributing to the reduction in 2002 net earnings were lower investment gains across all
businesses, including a $110 million after-tax impairment on WorldCom, Inc. bonds at GE
Financial Assurance. These decreases were partially offset by core premium growth,
including higher premium pricing at ERC and the $152 million benefit from recognition of a
favorable tax settlement with the IRS related to the treatment of certain reserves for
obligations to policyholders on life insurance contracts at GE Financial Assurance.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
level of reported claims activity at ERC related to prior-year loss events, particularly
for liability-related exposures underwritten in 1997 through 2001, accelerated at a rate
higher than we had anticipated. In 2002, considering the continued acceleration in
reported claims activity, we concluded that our best estimate of ultimate losses was
higher in the range of reasonably possible loss scenarios than previously estimated.
Accordingly, we recognized a fourth quarter pre-tax charge of $2.5 billion to increase
recorded reserves to reflect the revised indications of remaining liability. The more
significant adverse development was in hospital medical malpractice ($300 million),
product liability ($300 million), professional liability ($250 million), umbrella
liability ($200 million), workers compensation ($200 million), individual liability ($150
million) and asbestos ($150 million). With amounts recognized in previous quarters of
2002, our overall 2002 pre-tax charge for adverse development amounted to $3.5 billion.
Insurance loss provisions are based on the best available estimates at a given time. As
described on page 70 under the caption &#147;Insurance Liabilities and Reserves,&#148;
these estimates will be adjusted in the future as required.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have continued our rigorous commitment to improved underwriting initiatives at ERC aimed
at ensuring that consistent and diligent underwriting standards are applied to all risks.
Throughout 2002, we have been disciplined in rejecting risks that either fail to meet the
established standards of price or terms and conditions, or that involve areas for which
sufficient historical data do not exist to evaluate the risk adequately. For risks that
pass our criteria, we have sought to retain or even judiciously expand our business. On
the other hand, we have curtailed or exited business in particular property and casualty
business channels when expected returns do not appear to justify the risks.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
earnings decreased $0.3 billion in 2001, reflecting underwriting results at ERC, which
were partially offset by productivity benefits at GE Financial Assurance. Net earnings in
2001 at ERC were adversely affected by approximately $575 million ($386 million after tax)
related to the insurance losses arising from the events of September 11, 2001. This amount
primarily resulted from contingent premium payment provisions contained in certain
retrocession agreements. After these particular losses, total losses exceeded retrocession
policy limits in place at ERC. Substantially all of the September 11, 2001, losses are
recoverable under reinsurance policies that require additional premiums to those
retrocessionaires. Therefore, the 2001 Statement of Earnings reflects a $698 million
reduction in net</P>

<P>F-12</P>
<P>Annual Report Page 54</P>
<HR WIDTH="200" NOSHADE SIZE="1" ALIGN="left">
<P>premiums earned and $78 million of increased losses, partially offset by
$201 million in lower insurance acquisition costs. Historical experience related to large
catastrophic events has shown that a broad range of total insurance industry loss
estimates often exists following such an event, and it is not unusual for there to be
significant subsequent revisions to such estimates. Our best estimate of the existing
liability, net of estimated recoveries under retrocession arrangements, has not changed
significantly from our initial estimate.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding
events of September 11, 2001, net earnings in 2001 and 2000 were also adversely affected
by the continued general deterioration of underwriting results at ERC, reflecting higher
property and casualty-related losses (principally as a result of adverse development
relating to prior-year loss events) and the continued effects of low premiums in the
property and casualty insurance/reinsurance industry. ERC underwriting results in 2001
tracked performance in the global property and casualty industry.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
majority of the adverse development at ERC in 2001, and to a lesser extent in 2000,
related to higher projected ultimate losses for liability coverages, especially in the
hospital liability, nonstandard automobile (automobile insurance extended to higher-risk
drivers) and commercial and public entity general liability lines of business. Results in
2000 also reflected an increase in industry-wide loss estimates related to certain large
property loss events, with the largest effect resulting from the European windstorms
occurring in late 1999.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
Mortgage Insurance business had favorable loss experience throughout the three years ended

<P>Materials revenues increased 8% in
2002 and operating profit declined 21%. Plastics revenues were relatively unchanged from
2001 levels, as continued weakness in pricing offset increased volume. Operating profit at
Plastics declined 28% as productivity and increased volume were not sufficient to offset
substantially lower selling prices and increased raw material costs. Specialty Materials
revenues increased 32%, reflecting the contributions of recent acquisitions, partially
offset by lower selling prices. Operating profit at Specialty Materials rose 6%,
reflecting higher acquisition volume and lower material costs, partially offset by lower
pricing and higher base costs. In 2001, Materials revenues were 12% lower than the prior
year, reflecting increased pricing pressures and lower volume at both Plastics and
Specialty Materials. Plastics experienced continued softness in the automotive, optical
media, telecommunications and business equipment markets, while Specialty Materials was
adversely affected by lower sales in the semiconductor market. Operating profit in 2001
was 23% lower than in 2000, primarily as a result of lower pricing and volume, which more
than offset base cost reductions at both Plastics and Specialty Materials.</P>

$0.6 billion total gain from the exchange of certain assets for the cable network Bravo
and $0.2 billion of other charges for various asset impairments. Revenues declined 15% in
2001, mostly from an industry-wide decline in advertising volume and pricing, as well as
lost revenue related to covering the events of September 11, 2001. Operating profit
decreased 12% in 2001, reflecting adverse advertising market conditions, the events of
September 11, 2001, and charges resulting from dissolving the XFL, which more than offset

<P>Technical Products and Services
revenues increased 3% in 2002, primarily as a result of 6% revenue growth at Medical
Systems, which reported higher equipment and product services volume, partially offset by
weak market conditions in Latin America and Japan. Operating profit for the segment
declined 4% with sharply lower earnings from Global eXchange Services, 90% of which was
sold in September 2002. Productivity and increased volume were partially offset by lower
pricing at Medical Systems. Technical Products and Services revenues rose 14% in 2001,
primarily as a result of sharply higher volume at Medical Systems. Operating profit grew
13% in 2001, largely as a result of productivity and volume growth.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders
received by Medical Systems in 2002 were $9.6 billion, an 8% increase over 2001. The $4.0
billion total backlog at year-end 2002 comprised unfilled product orders of $2.6 billion
(of which 95% was scheduled for delivery in 2003) and product services orders of $1.4
billion scheduled for 2003 delivery. Comparable December 31, 2001, total backlog was $4.1

Other GECS includes GECS activities and businesses that we do not measure within one of
the other financial services segments.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to comments on All Other GECS elsewhere
in this report, the following comments relate to the table above:
<BR>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Level 1" FSL="Default" -->
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
IT Solutions (ITS)&#151;Revenues and net earnings in 2002 decreased primarily as a result
of market conditions and 2001 product line and geographic market exits. During 2001 and
2000, in response to intense competition and transition of the computer equipment market
to a direct distribution model, ITS exited its underperforming operations in the United
Kingdom, France, Brazil and Mexico and significantly reduced its reseller role in the
United States. Costs for involuntary termination benefits, asset impairments, facilities
exit costs and losses on sales of portions of the business amounted to $45 million ($43
million after tax) and $246 million ($191 million after tax) in 2001 and 2000,
respectively, and are included in restructuring in the table above. The number of
employees was reduced from a 2000 peak of 11,000 to 6,600 at the end of 2002.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI> GE Equity&#151;GE Equity
manages equity investments in early-stage, early growth, pre-IPO companies. GE Equity
revenues include income, gains and losses on such investments. Revenues and net earnings
during 2002 reflected increased losses on investments, including losses in the
telecommunications and software industries, and lower gains. Effective in the fourth
quarter of 2002, GE Equity will no longer make new investments in private companies. GE
Equity will continue to give financial support to companies within its existing portfolio.
The existing portfolio will be managed for maximum value over time, eventually winding
down. During 2001, losses on GE Equity&#146;s investments exceeded gains and other
investment income, resulting in negative revenues and a $270 million net loss, which
increased over the prior year principally from reduced asset gains.</LI>

<UL>
  <LI>Americom&#151;On November 9,
2001, GECS exchanged its satellite operations, comprising the stock of Americom and other
related assets and liabilities, for a combination of cash and 31% of the publicly-traded
stock of SES Global, a leading satellite company, in order to create the world&#146;s
largest satellite services provider. The transaction resulted in a gain of $1,158 million
($642 million after tax), representing the difference between the carrying value of the
69% investment in Americom and the amount of cash plus the market value of SES Global
shares received at the closing date. No gain was recorded on the 31% interest in Americom
that was indirectly retained by GECS. GECS investment in SES Global is accounted for on
the equity method in Commercial Finance.</LI>
</UL>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Level 1" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>2001 Asset impairments and product line exits&#151;Operations included $656 million of
after-tax charges related to disposing of and providing for disposition of several
nonstrategic investments and other assets, to certain unprofitable insurance and financing
product lines that were exited, and to restructuring various global operations. These
costs, not allocated to the related businesses as we did not include these costs in
measuring the performance of those businesses for internal purposes, included $478 million
($310 million after tax) for other-than-temporary impairments of investments, the largest
of which were held by GE Financial Assurance, GE Equity and ERC. These losses, $383
million of which were charged to revenues, included $130 million ($84 million after tax)
of losses on Enron bonds; such bonds were written down to a cost basis of $32 million at
December 31, 2001. Such losses also included investment impairment charges of $199 million
($130 million after tax) on non-U.S. mutual funds and the technology sector.<BR>
    &nbsp;<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
response to escalating losses, GECS in 2001 decided to cease further underwriting and exit
certain insurance and financing product lines. Charges associated with such loss events
and the resulting exits totaled $180 million after tax, of which $149 million related to
the loss events in ERC product lines, primarily nonstandard automobile and higher limit
industrial property insurance coverages.<BR>
    &nbsp;<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring
of several GECS global businesses included consolidation of several European Equipment
Management businesses and rationalization of European Equipment Finance businesses. Costs
related to the exit of these activities amounted to $144 million after tax and consisted
of involuntary termination benefits, facilities exit costs, and asset impairments.</LI>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Level 1" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>
Other&#151;All Other GECS includes GECS corporate function expenses, liquidating
businesses and other non-segment aligned operations, the most significant of which were
Auto Financial Services (AFS) and GE Auto and Home. The decrease in revenues in 2002 and
2001 resulted from AFS, which stopped accepting new business in 2000. Net earnings
increased in 2002 primarily because of a favorable tax settlement with the IRS allowing
the deduction of previously realized losses associated with the prior disposition of
Kidder Peabody and tax benefits from growth in lower taxed earnings from international
operations.</LI>

<P>JANUARY 1, 2003, RECLASSIFICATION OF
FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT PROFIT. GE Capital historically has issued about $8 of debt for
each $1 of equity&#151;a &#147;leverage ratio&#148; of 8:1. For purposes of measuring
segment profit, each of our financial services businesses was also assigned debt and
interest costs on the basis of that consolidated 8:1 leverage ratio. In evaluating
expected returns on potential investments, however, we also used business-specific,
market-based leverage ratios. As of January 1, 2003, we extended the business-specific,
market-based leverage to the performance measurement of each of our financial services
businesses, and consequently to the definition of segment profit. As a result, at January
1, 2003, debt of $12.5 billion previously allocated to the segments was allocated to the
All Other GECS segment. At the same time, we revised our historical techniques for
allocating shared costs and unusual items to financial services businesses. In this
report, the results of our financial services segments are presented on the historic 8:1
leverage ratio basis. Beginning in 2003, the new leverage ratios and recast comparative
historical results will be as follows:</P>

billion, $28.3 billion and $26.7 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. GE
international revenues of $29.0 billion in 2002 were $0.7 billion higher than in 2001.
Revenues in 2001 of $28.3 billion increased $1.6 billion over 2000. The increase in 2002
related to both an increase in operations outside the U.S. and higher U.S. exports.
Revenue increases in Europe were led by Medical Systems and Industrial Systems. Growth in
Specialty Materials revenues across all geographic areas was partially offset by lower
sales in all areas by Aircraft Engines. Increases in U.S. export sales in 2002 were
primarily in Plastics and Power Systems, partially offset by lower exports by Medical
Systems and Transportation Systems.</P>

of aircraft, sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of
financial services within these regional economies. Thus, when countries or regions
experience currency and/or economic stress, we may have increased exposure to certain
risks, but also may have new profit opportunities. Potential increased risks include,
among other things, higher receivables delinquencies and bad debts, delays or cancellation
of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft equipment, higher local
currency financing costs and a slowdown in established financial services activities. New
profit opportunities include, among other things, lower costs of goods sourced from
countries with weakened currencies, more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing,
expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies
or assets at reduced prices and lower U.S. debt financing costs.</P>

results of our international activities reported in U.S. dollars are affected by currency

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2002, we expended about $43 million for capital projects related to the environment. The
comparable amount in 2001 was $52 million. These amounts exclude expenditures for
remediation actions, which are principally expensed and are discussed below. Capital
expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices&#151;such
as wastewater treatment plants, groundwater monitoring devices, air strippers or
separators, and incinerators&#151;at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded
in the normal course of business. Consistent with policies stressing environmental
responsibility, average annual capital expenditures other than for remediation projects
are presently expected to be about $65 million over each of the next two years for new or
expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste
and reduce emissions. This is about the same level as recent experience.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are also involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes
as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes require that responsible parties fund
remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a
disposal site. Expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately $113
million in 2002, compared with $119 million in 2001. We presently expect that such
remediation actions will require average annual expenditures in the range of $120 million
to $170 million over the next two years.</P>

of the upper Hudson River in New York State. We have submitted what is known as a
&#147;Good Faith Offer&#148; under the Superfund law and have begun negotiations with EPA
to undertake the design and engineering of the remedy. Our Statement of Financial Position

<P>INVESTMENT SECURITIES for each of the
past two years comprised mainly investment-grade debt securities held by Insurance in
support of obligations to annuitants and policyholders. Investment securities were $116.9
billion in 2002, compared with $101.0 billion in 2001. The increase of $15.9 billion
resulted from investment of premiums received, reinvestment of investment income, the
addition of investment securities from acquired companies and increases in fair value,
primarily debt securities, partially offset by sales and maturities as well as impairments
and losses related to certain debt and equity securities.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->

31, 2002 (gross unrealized gains and losses of $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion,
respectively, as of December 31, 2001). Market value for these purposes is defined by
relevant accounting standards and should not be viewed as a forecast of future gains or
losses. We estimate that available gains, net of hedging positions and estimated
impairment of insurance intangible assets, could be as much as $1.4 billion.</P>

<P>We expect Power Systems progress
collections to decline about $3 billion in 2003, and that working capital turnover
otherwise will show improvement as a result of our Six Sigma and digitization initiatives.
We discuss current receivables and inventories, two important elements of working capital,
in the following paragraphs.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>CURRENT RECEIVABLES for GE were $11.0
billion at the end of 2002, an increase of $1.2 billion from year-end 2001, and included
$6.3 billion due from customers at the end of 2002, compared with $5.9 billion at the end
of 2001. Turnover of customer receivables from sales of goods and services was 10.9 in
2002, compared with 10.1 in 2001. Other current receivables are primarily amounts that did
not originate from sales of GE goods or services, such as advances to suppliers in
connection with large contracts.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>INVENTORIES for GE were $9.0 billion
at December 31, 2002, up $0.7 billion from the end of 2001. GE inventory turnover was 7.7
in 2002, a decrease from 7.9 in 2001, as a result of higher inventories at Power Systems,
Plastics and Medical Systems.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GECS
inventories were $208 million and $270 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decrease in 2002 primarily reflected reduced sales volume and improved
inventory management at IT Solutions.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>FINANCING RECEIVABLES is the largest
category of assets for GECS and represents one of its primary sources of revenues. The
portfolio of financing receivables, before allowance for losses, increased to $205.4
billion at December 31, 2002, from $178.9 billion at the end of 2001, as discussed in the
following paragraphs. The related allowance for losses at the end of 2002 amounted to $5.5
billion ($4.8 billion at the end of 2001), representing our best estimate of probable
losses inherent in the portfolio.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio
follows. &#147;Nonearning&#148; receivables are those that are 90 days or more delinquent
(or for which collection has otherwise become doubtful) and &#147;reduced-earning&#148;
receivables are commercial receivables whose terms have been restructured to a
below-market yield.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial
Finance financing receivables before allowance for losses totaled $130.9 billion at
December 31, 2002, ($120.1 billion at December 31, 2001) and consisted of loans and leases
to the equipment, commercial and industrial, real estate and commercial aircraft
industries. This portfolio of receivables increased primarily from increased acquisitions
and originations growth, partially offset by sales and securitizations. Related nonearning
and reduced-earning receivables were $2.2 billion at December 31, 2002, about 1.7% of
outstandings, compared with $2.0 billion, about 1.7% of outstandings at year-end 2001.
Commercial Finance receivables are generally backed by assets and there is a broad spread
of geographic and credit risk in the portfolio.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumer
Finance financing receivables before allowance for losses, primarily installment loans,
auto loans and leases, and residential mortgages, were $66.0 billion at December 31, 2002,
an increase of $16.0 billion from year-end 2001. This portfolio of receivables increased
primarily from increased originations, acquisition growth and the net effects of foreign
currency translation, partially offset by sales and securitizations. Nonearning consumer
receivables at December 31, 2002, were $1.6 billion, about 2.4% of outstandings, compared
with $1.3 billion, about 2.7% of outstandings at year-end 2001.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Other,
principally Equipment Management&#148; financing receivables before allowance for losses
amounted to $8.5 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $0.3 billion from year-end
2001, primarily as a result of the run-off of the liquidating Auto Financial Services
portfolio. Nonearning receivables at December 31, 2002, were $0.1 billion, about 1.0% of
outstandings, compared with $0.2 billion, about 1.8% of outstandings at year-end 2001.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delinquency
rates on consumer financing receivables at December 31, 2002, were 5.34%; at year-end 2001
were 5.21%; and at year-end 2000 were 4.53% on a managed basis. Increased 2002 and 2001
delinquencies reflected our secured financing business acquired in 2001 and volume growth
in that business in 2002. When delinquent, these loans have relatively lower losses than
the rest of our consumer portfolio. Delinquencies on Commercial Finance equipment loans
and leases were 1.72%, 2.16% and 1.68% at year-end 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, on a
managed basis. The decline at December 31, 2002, primarily reflected a higher
concentration of Vendor Financial Services receivables coupled with improved collection
results at Commercial Equipment Finance. The increase at December 31, 2001, reflected the
acquisition of Heller Financial, Inc. Future provisions for losses will depend primarily
on the size of the portfolio, which is expected to continue to grow, and on associated
business and economic conditions.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>INSURANCE RECEIVABLES of GECS were
$31.6 billion at year-end 2002, an increase of $3.3 billion that was primarily
attributable to acquisitions and core growth at GE Financial Assurance, increased
recoveries under existing retrocession agreements at ERC and an increase in mortgages held
for investment at Mortgage Insurance.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>OTHER RECEIVABLES of GECS totaled
$13.0 billion at December 31, 2002, and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2001, and consist
primarily of nonfinancing customer receivables, accrued investment income, amounts due
from GE (generally related to certain trade payable programs), amounts due under operating
leases, receivables due on sales of securities and various sundry items.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
(including equipment leased to others) was $47.2 billion at December 31, 2002, up $5.1
billion from 2001, primarily reflecting acquisitions of commercial aircraft at Commercial
Finance. GE property, plant and equipment consists of investments for its own productive
use, whereas the largest element for GECS is equipment provided to third parties on
operating leases. Details by category of investment are presented in note 15.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE
expenditures for plant and equipment during 2002 totaled $2.4 billion, compared with $2.9
billion in 2001. Total expenditures for the past five years were $12.4 billion, of which
38% was investment for growth through new capacity and product development; 35% was
investment in productivity through new equipment and process improvements; and 27% was
investment for other purposes such as improvement of research and development facilities
and safety and environmental protection.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GECS
additions to property, plant and equipment (including equipment leased to others) were

acquisitions of commercial aircraft at Commercial Finance.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>INTANGIBLE ASSETS were $46.2 billion
at year-end 2002, up from $35.1 billion at year-end 2001. GE intangibles increased to
$23.1 billion from $14.4 billion at the end of 2001, principally as a result of goodwill
and other intangibles related to acquisitions by NBC, Specialty Materials and Industrial
Systems. GECS intangibles increased $2.4 billion to $23.1 billion, reflecting goodwill and
other intangibles associated with acquisitions and purchase accounting adjustments
primarily related to the 2001 acquisition of Heller Financial, Inc., partially offset by
the impairment of goodwill from adopting SFAS 142 (see notes 1 and 16).</P>

<P>ALL OTHER ASSETS totaled $93.2
billion at year-end 2002, an increase of $16.6 billion from the end of 2001. GE other
assets increased $5.0 billion, principally reflecting increases in the prepaid pension
asset and acquisitions. GECS other assets increased $12.1 billion, principally the result
of acquisitions affecting real estate and separate accounts (investments controlled by
policyholders); the transfer of Home Depot private label credit card receivables (assets
held for sale) in preparation for their sale when that contract is terminated in 2003; and
increasing deferred acquisition costs in connection with ongoing insurance operations,
partially offset by a reduction in our investment in associated companies reflecting the
consolidation of the Banc One joint venture (see note 17).</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>CONSOLIDATED BORROWINGS aggregated
$279.4 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with $232.9 billion at the end of 2001. The
major debt-rating agencies evaluate the financial condition of GE and of GE Capital
Corporation (GE Capital), the major public borrowing entity of GECS, differently because
of their distinct business characteristics. Using criteria appropriate to each and
considering their combined strength, those major rating agencies continue to give the
highest ratings to debt of both GE and GE Capital.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GE
total borrowings were $9.8 billion at year-end 2002 ($8.8 billion short term, $1.0 billion
long term), an increase of $7.3 billion from year-end 2001. GE total debt at the end of
2002 equaled 13.1% of total capital, up from 4.3% at the end of 2001.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GECS
total borrowings were $270.9 billion at December 31, 2002, of which $130.1 billion is due
in 2003 and $140.8 billion is due in subsequent years. Comparable amounts at the end of
2001 were $239.9 billion in total, $160.8 billion due within one year and $79.1 billion
due thereafter. A large portion of GECS borrowings ($84.2 billion and $117.5 billion at
the end of 2002 and 2001, respectively) was issued in active commercial paper markets that
we believe will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing. Most of this
commercial paper was issued by GE Capital. The average remaining terms and interest rates
of GE Capital commercial paper were 47 days and 1.95% at the end of 2002, compared with 46
days and 2.37% at the end of 2001. The GE Capital ratio of debt to equity was 6.58 to 1 at
the end of 2002 and 7.31 to 1 at the end of 2001.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>INSURANCE LIABILITIES, RESERVES AND
ANNUITY BENEFITS of $135.9 billion at December 31, 2002, were $21.6 billion higher than in
2001. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions, growth in deferred
annuities and guaranteed investment contracts at GE Financial Assurance and adverse
development at ERC. For additional information on these liabilities, see note 19.</P>

<P>INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK
MANAGEMENT is important in our normal business activities. We use derivative financial
instruments to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks, including those
related to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. As a matter of
policy, we
do not engage in derivatives trading, derivatives market-making or other speculative
activities.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires that registrants provide information
about potential effects of changes in interest and currency exchange rates. The following
discussion is based on so-called &#147;shock tests,&#148; which model effects of interest
rate and currency shifts on the reporting company. While the following results of shock
tests for changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates may have some limited use
as benchmarks, they should not be viewed as forecasts.&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
  <LI>One means of assessing
exposure to interest rate changes is a duration-based analysis that measures the potential
loss in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis
points across all maturities (sometimes referred to as a &#147;parallel shift in the yield
curve&#148;). Under this model, with all else held constant, we estimate that such an
increase, including repricing in the securities portfolio, would reduce the 2003 net
earnings of GECS based on year-end 2002 positions by approximately $184 million; the
pro-forma effect for GE was $61 million. Based on positions at year-end 2001, the
pro-forma effect on 2002 net earnings of such an increase in interest rates was estimated
to be a decrease of approximately $189 million for GECS and was insignificant for GE.</LI>
</UL>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Level 1" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>
Our geographic distribution of operations is diverse. One means of assessing exposure to
changes in currency exchange rates is to model effects on reported earnings using a
sensitivity analysis. We analyzed year-end 2002 consolidated currency exposures, including
financial instruments designated and effective as hedges, to identify assets and
liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currencies. Net unhedged
exposures in each currency were then remeasured, generally assuming a 10% decrease
(substantially greater decreases for hyperinflationary currencies) in currency exchange
rates compared with the U.S. dollar. Under this model, we estimated at year-end 2002 that
such a decrease would have an insignificant effect on 2003 earnings.</LI>

<P>Share owners&#146; equity increased
$8.9 billion, $4.3 billion and $7.9 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
increases were largely attributable to net earnings of $14.1 billion, $13.7 billion and
$12.7 billion, partially offset by dividends declared of $7.3 billion, $6.6 billion and
$5.6 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>

translation adjustments increased equity by $1.0 billion in 2002, compared with reductions
of $0.6 billion and $1.2 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Changes in the currency
translation adjustment reflect the effects of changes in currency exchange rates on our
net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the
U.S. dollar. In 2002, strengthening in the euro and, to a lesser extent, Asian currencies
versus the U.S. dollar reversed trends in those exchange relationships over the prior two
years. The euro strengthened significantly versus the U.S. dollar in 2002, and was
relatively unchanged in 2001 after weakening in 2000. Asian currencies also strengthened
against the dollar in 2002, and had weakened in 2001 and 2000. Accumulated currency
translation adjustments affect net earnings only when all or a portion of an affiliate is
disposed of or substantially liquidated.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>GE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS aggregated
$1.1 billion at the end of 2002, down from $9.8 billion at year-end 2001. GE periodically

equivalents in the GE Statement of Financial Position. No such investments were made as of
December 31, 2002, compared with $8.7 billion at December 31, 2001.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2002, GE generated $10.1 billion in cash from operating activities, a $7.1 billion
decrease from 2001 as orders for new Power Systems equipment and the associated progress
collections declined sharply. Excluding effects of progress collections, cash from
operating activities increased 10% in 2002 and 13% in 2001, including effects of
receivables monetization programs in both years. In addition to the $10.1 billion of cash
from operating activities, GE began 2002 with $9.8 billion of cash and increased net cash
from borrowings by $6.8 billion, for a total of $26.7 billion. We used the cash to invest
in strategic acquisitions ($9.0 billion) and property, plant and equipment ($2.4 billion);
to reward our share owners with increased dividends (totaling $7.2 billion) and to buy
shares under our share repurchase program ($2.0 billion); and to contribute capital to our

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>COMMERCIAL AIRLINES. Following the
events of September 11, 2001, many of our airline customers have experienced financial
difficulties. In the face of declining traffic, they have responded by curtailing flight
schedules and deferring and canceling deliveries of commercial aircraft. Deteriorating
aircraft utilization and pricing affects Commercial Finance, which owned 1,161 commercial
aircraft at December 31, 2002, when, despite pressure on the industry, 1,149, or 99% were
on lease. We believe, however, that the financial difficulties of our airline customers
will continue to weigh on the airline industry in 2003.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aircraft
Engines sales of new equipment often include long-term customer financing commitments.
Under these commitments, it is our policy to establish a secured position in the aircraft
being financed. At year-end 2002, guarantees of $0.7 billion were in place. Further, we
had committed $1.6 billion to provide financial assistance on future aircraft sales (see
note 30). Our guarantees and commitments are secured by individual aircraft or pools of
aircraft engines related to the specific financing arrangement. At December 31, 2002, the
total estimated fair value of aircraft securing these guarantees exceeded the guaranteed
amounts, net of the associated allowance for losses.</P>

the airline industry. In addition, Commercial Finance had funding commitments of $0.5
billion and had placed multi-year orders for various Boeing, Airbus and other aircraft
with list prices approximating $15.4 billion at year-end 2002. Commercial Finance held
placement agreements with commercial airlines for 40 of the 42 aircraft scheduled for

difficulties and both filed for reorganization in bankruptcy in 2002. At December 31,
2002, our exposure related to these airlines amounted to $3.7 billion, including loans,
leases, investment securities, guarantees and commitments as discussed above. Various
Boeing and Airbus aircraft secure these financial exposures. We have provided for our best
estimate of probable losses under these particular arrangements in light of estimated
amounts recoverable under recourse provisions.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
December 2002, Commercial Finance and US Airways Group Inc. agreed on a global

The plan will provide the airline with up to $120 million debtor-in-possession financing,
which will be subsequently refinanced as part of a $360 million facility being provided by
us upon US Airways Group Inc.'s exiting from Chapter 11, and $350 million of future
lease financing for regional jet aircraft. Upon US Airways Group Inc.'s emergence
from bankruptcy we would receive warrants to buy five percent of the Class A shares of the

     <P>TELECOMMUNICATIONS. Financial services investments in and contractual commitments to customers in
          the telecommunications and cable industries amounted to $9.2 billion and $2.9
          billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2002, and primarily comprised
          financing receivables and investment securities. Included in the
          telecommunications amount is Commercial Finance&#146;s equity method investment
          in SES Global of $1.7 billion. Like all financial services positions, these
          receivables and investments have been entered into subject to strict risk and
          underwriting criteria, are diversified, and financing receivables are generally
          secured. During recent declines in the values of these portfolios, the positions
          have been routinely reviewed for credit and impairment losses, and actions have
          been taken to mitigate exposures. We have made provision for probable losses.
          Future losses, if any, will depend upon business and economic developments as
          well as the success of risk mitigation actions.</P>

<P>The major debt-rating agencies
evaluate the financial condition of GE and of GE Capital Corporation (GE Capital), the
major public borrowing entity of GECS, differently because of their distinct business
characteristics. Factors that are important to the ratings of both include the following:
cash generating ability&#151;including cash generated from operating activities; earnings
quality&#151;including revenue growth and the breadth and diversity of sources of income;
leverage ratios&#151;such as debt to total capital and interest coverage; and asset
utilization, including return on assets and asset turnover ratios. Considering those
factors, those major rating agencies continue to give the highest ratings to debt of both
GE and GE Capital (long-term credit rating AAA/Aaa; short-term credit rating A-1+/P-1).</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
of our strategic objectives is to maintain these ratings on debt issued by GE and GE
Capital. Our Triple-A rating lowers our cost of borrowings and facilitates access to a
variety of lenders. We manage our businesses in a manner consistent with maintaining these
Triple-A ratings.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
support the GE Capital rating, at the end of 2002, GE was contractually committed to
maintain the ratios of earnings to fixed charges at GE Capital at a specified level. To
build equity, the GECS Board of Directors intends to reduce GECS dividend payments to GE
to 10% of operating earnings. GE contributed $6.3 billion of cash in 2002, of which $1.8
billion funded certain loss development at ERC. See also &#147;January 1, 2003,
Reclassification of Financial Services Segment Profit&#148; on page 58. Our plans are to
reduce the level of debt and increase equity in financial services; targeting 2005 for
elimination of the $12.5 billion of debt allocated to All Other GECS as of January 1,
2003. Proceeds from any strategic dispositions will be evaluated when and if they are
received, but we anticipate using at least some of those proceeds to reduce financial
services debt.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2002, certain external credit rating agencies announced the lowering of financial strength
ratings with respect to GE Global Insurance Holding and subsidiaries. Those rating
agencies made similar announcements with regard to other property and casualty insurance
and reinsurance entities at about the same time. Debt ratings for GE Global Insurance
Holding affect $1.7 billion of outstanding debt. These ratings were adjusted negatively in
2002, but remained investment grade. We do not believe these actions will materially
affect GE Global Insurance Holding liquidity or capital resources or the ability to write
future business.</P>

<P>During 2002, GE Capital issued
approximately $88 billion of long-term debt in U.S. and international markets. These funds
were used primarily to reduce the amount of commercial paper outstanding by $33 billion
and to fund acquisitions and new asset growth. We target a ratio for commercial paper of
25% to 35% of outstanding debt based on the anticipated composition of our assets. GE
Capital anticipates issuing approximately $60 billion of long-term debt using both U.S.
and international markets during 2003. The proceeds from such issuances will be used to
fund maturing long-term debt, additional acquisitions and asset growth. The ultimate
amount of debt issuances will depend on the growth in assets, acquisition activity,
availability of markets and movements in interest rates.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that alternative sources of liquidity are sufficient to permit an orderly
transition from commercial paper in the unlikely event of impaired access to those
markets. Funding sources on which we would rely would depend on the nature of such a
hypothetical event, but include $54 billion of contractually committed lending agreements
with highly-rated global banks and investment banks, an increase of $21 billion since
December 31, 2001, as well as other sources of liquidity, including medium and long-term
funding, monetization, asset securitization, cash receipts from lending and leasing
activities, short-term secured funding on global assets, and potential asset sales.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS are
used in the ordinary course of business to achieve improved share owner returns. One of
the most common forms of off balance sheet arrangements is asset securitization. The
securitization transactions we engage in are similar to those used by many financial
institutions and are part of a $700 billion annual market for asset-backed commercial
paper. We use sponsored and third-party entities to execute securitization transactions
funded in the commercial paper and term markets. As part of this program, we consider the
relative risks and returns of each alternative and predominantly use sponsored entities.
We believe that these transactions could be readily executed through non-sponsored
entities or term securitization at modest incremental cost. Beyond improved returns, these
securitization transactions serve as funding sources for a variety of diversified lending
and securities transactions, transfer selected credit risk and improve cash flows while
enhancing the ability to provide a full range of competitive products for customers.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply
stated, in a typical securitization transaction, we sell high-quality financial assets to
entities that have financed those purchases using low-cost, highly-rated commercial paper.
In the following paragraphs, we describe in more detail how these transactions with such
entities typically work.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
first step in the securitization process uses entities that meet the accounting criteria
for Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (qualifying entities). Among other criteria, a
qualifying entity&#146;s activities must be restricted to passive investment in financial
assets and issuance of retained interests in those assets. Under generally accepted
accounting principles, entities meeting these criteria are not consolidated in the
sponsor&#146;s financial statements. We sell selected financial assets to qualifying
entities. Examples include financing and credit card receivables and trade receivables. On
the whole, the credit quality of such assets is equal to or higher than the credit quality
of similar assets we own.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifying
entities raise cash by issuing retained interests&#151;rights to cash flows from the
assets&#151;to other SPEs we sponsor that issue highly-rated commercial paper to
third-party institutional investors. These SPEs use commercial paper proceeds to obtain
retained interests in the financial assets of qualifying entities, as well as financial
assets originated by multiple third parties. We provide credit support for certain of
these assets, as well as liquidity support for the commercial paper. In accordance with
our contractual commitments to the qualifying entities, we rigorously underwrite and
service the associated assets, both those we originate and those originated by other
participants. All of the qualifying entities&#146; assets serve as collateral for the
commercial paper. Support activities include credit reviews at acquisition and ongoing
review, billing and collection activities&#151;the same support activities that GECS
employs for its own financing receivables. These entities are not consolidated in the
accompanying financial statements.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
sponsored SPEs are routinely evaluated by the major credit rating agencies, including
monthly reviews of key performance indicators and annual reviews of asset quality.
Commercial paper issued by these entities has always received the highest available
ratings from the major credit rating agencies and at year-end 2002 was rated A-1+/P-1.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets
held by SPEs include: receivables secured by equipment, commercial real estate and other
assets; credit card receivables; and trade receivables. In addition to being of high
credit quality, these assets are diversified to avoid concentrations of risk. Examples of
these assets include loans and leases on manufacturing and transportation equipment, loans
on commercial property, commercial loans, and balances of high credit quality accounts
from sales of a broad range of products and services to a diversified customer base. Such
assets totaled $42.2 billion and $43.0 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
of securitized assets to SPEs result in a gain or loss amounting to the net of sales
proceeds, the carrying amount of net assets sold, the fair value of retained interests and
servicing rights and an allowance for losses. Total securitization sales resulted in gains
of $0.8 billion and $1.3 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are included in
revenues net of any effects of replenishing securitized credit card balances.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the securitization activities discussed previously, Financial Guaranty
Insurance Company (FGIC), an affiliate that is a leader in the municipal bond insurance
market, uses SPEs that offer municipalities guaranteed investment contracts with interests
in high-quality, fixed maturity, investment grade assets. FGIC actively manages these
assets under strict investment criteria and GE Capital also provides certain performance
guarantees. Total assets in sponsored FGIC entities amounted to $13.7 billion and $13.4
billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
provide financial support related to assets held by certain SPEs through liquidity
agreements, credit support, performance guarantees and guarantee and reimbursement
contracts. Net credit and liquidity support amounted to $27.2 billion after consideration
of participated liquidity and arrangements that defer liquidity draws beyond 2003, a
reduction of $15.9 billion from 2001. This amount includes credit support, in which we
provide recourse for a maximum of $16.9 billion of credit losses in SPEs. Potential credit
losses are provided for in our financial statements. Based on management&#146;s best
estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, we provided an allowance of $233
million for recourse obligations at year-end 2002. Performance guarantees relate to
letters of credit and liquidity support for guaranteed investment contracts and are
subject to a maximum of $3.8 billion at December 31, 2002.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>
If the short-term credit rating of GE Capital or certain SPEs discussed further in note 29
were to fall below A-1/P-1, GE Capital would be required to provide substitute liquidity
for those entities or provide funds to retire the outstanding commercial paper. The
maximum amount (net of participated liquidity and arrangements that defer liquidity to
2004) that GE Capital would be required to provide in the event of such a downgrade is
determined by contract, and amounted to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2002.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>
If the long-term credit rating of GE Capital were to fall below AA/Aa2, GE Capital would
be required to provide substitute credit support or liquidate the SPEs. The maximum amount
that GE Capital would be required to substitute in the event of such a downgrade is
determined by contract, and amounted to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2002.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>
If the long-term credit rating of GE Capital were to fall below AA-/Aa3 or its short-term
credit rating were to fall below A-1+/P-1, GE Capital could be required to provide up to
$1.1 billion to the FGIC SPEs and could be required to repay an amount of FGIC&#146;s
guaranteed investment contracts as specified by contract; at December 31, 2002, that
maximum repayment was $3.6 billion.&nbsp;<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>If the long-term credit rating of either GE or
GECS under certain swap, forward and option contracts falls below A-/A3, certain remedies
are required as discussed in note 28.<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI> If GE Capital&#146;s ratio of
earnings to fixed charges, which was 1.65:1 at the end of 2002, were to deteriorate to
1.10:1 or, upon redemption of certain preferred stock, its ratio of debt to equity, which
was 6.58:1 at the end of 2002, were to exceed 8:1, GE has committed to contribute capital
to GE Capital. GE also has guaranteed subordinated debt of GECS with a face amount of $1.0
billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001.</LI>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA, summarized
on the following page, are divided into three sections: upper portion&#151;consolidated
data; middle portion&#151;GE data that reflect various conventional measurements for such
enterprises; and lower portion&#151;GECS data that reflect key information pertinent to
financial services businesses.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>GE&#146;S TOTAL RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT expenditures were $2.6 billion in 2002, compared with $2.3 billion and $2.2
billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, expenditures from GE&#146;s own funds
were $2.2 billion, an increase of 12% from 2001, reflecting continuing research and
development work related to new product, service, information and process technologies.
Product technology efforts in 2002 included continuing development work on the next
generation of gas turbines, further advances in state-of-the-art diagnostic imaging
technologies, developing reduced emissions and more fuel-efficient locomotives, improving
the performance and efficiency of wind energy turbines and continuing development of more
fuel-efficient, cost-effective aircraft engine designs. Services technologies include
further advances in diagnostic applications, including remote diagnostic capabilities
related to repair and maintenance of medical equipment, aircraft engines, power generation
equipment and locomotives. Information technology advances in the healthcare field are
helping our customers integrate their various devices and critical systems. Process
technologies provided improved product quality and performance and increased capacity for
manufacturing engineered materials. Expenditures funded by customers (mainly the U.S.
government) were $416 million in 2002, compared with $369 million in 2001.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>GE&#146;S TOTAL BACKLOG of firm
unfilled orders at the end of 2002 was $36.1 billion, a decrease of 24% from year-end
2001, reflecting softening demand for new equipment in the power generation business at
Power Systems, partially offset by higher backlog at Transportation Systems and Aircraft
Engines. Of the total backlog, $28.6 billion related to products, of which 65% was
scheduled for delivery in 2003. Product services orders, included in this reported backlog
for only the succeeding 12 months, were $7.5 billion at the end of 2002. Orders
constituting this backlog may be canceled or deferred by customers, subject in certain
cases to penalties. See Segment Operations beginning on page 50 for further information.</P>

<B>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF THE APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
</B>
<P>Accounting policies discussed in this
section are those that we consider to be critical to an understanding of our financial
statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to
judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results. For all of
these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the
best estimates routinely require adjustment.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES are
recognized when they are incurred. Measurement of such losses requires consideration of
historical loss experience, including the need to adjust for current conditions, and
judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present
economic conditions such as delinquency rates, financial health of specific customers and
market sectors, collateral values, and the present and expected future levels of interest
rates. Exposure to losses on financing receivables at year-end 2002 was $222.3 billion,
including credit support for special purpose entities, against which an allowance for
losses of $5.8 billion was provided. Further information is provided on pages 60 and 61,
and in notes 1, 12, 13 and, for special purpose entities, in note 29. While losses depend
to a large degree on future economic conditions, we do not anticipate significant adverse
credit development in 2003.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES
results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is other than
temporary. We regularly review each investment security for impairment based on criteria
that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value, the duration of that market
decline and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer. GECS investment
securities amounted to $116.5 billion at year-end 2002. Gross unrealized gains and losses
included in that carrying amount related to debt securities were $4.2 billion and $1.9
billion, respectively. Gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities were $0.2
billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. Of securities with unrealized losses at year-end
2002, and based on application of our accounting policy for impairment, approximately $800
million of portfolio value, including approximately $200 million from the
telecommunications and cable industries, is at risk of being charged to earnings in 2003.
GECS actively performs comprehensive market research, monitors market conditions and
segments its investments by credit risk in order to minimize impairment risks. Further
information is provided in notes 1 and 9 and on page 60, which discusses the investment
securities portfolio.</P>

<P>REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS to provide product
services (product services agreements) requires estimates of profits over the multi-year
terms of such agreements, considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future
monitoring, maintenance and overhaul events; cost of personnel; spare parts and other
resources required to perform the services; and future cost changes. We routinely review
estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for
changes in outlook. Revisions that affect a product services agreement&#146;s total
estimated profitability will also result in an immediate adjustment of earnings. We also
regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of contract costs
and estimated earnings and provide for losses when they are incurred. Carrying amounts for
product services agreements in progress at December 31, 2002 and 2001, were $2.9 billion
and $2.3 billion, respectively, and are included in &#147;contract costs and estimated
earnings&#148; in note 17. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates
on product services agreements have been insignificant for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2002.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND RESERVES
differ for short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts such as
property and casualty policies are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of losses
inherent in that period&#146;s claims, including losses for which claims have not yet been
reported. Short-duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of
ultimate loss experience for similar historical events. Measurement of long-duration
insurance liabilities (such as term and whole life insurance policies) is also based on
approved actuarial techniques that include assumptions about mortality, lapse rates and
future yield on related investments. Historical insurance industry experience indicates
that a greater degree of inherent variability exists in assessing the ultimate amount of
losses under short-duration property and casualty contracts than exists for long-duration
mortality exposures. This inherent variability is particularly significant for
liability-related exposures, including latent claims issues (such as asbestos and
environmental related coverage disputes), because of the extended period of
time&#151;often many years&#151;that transpires between when a given claim event occurs
and the ultimate full settlement of such claim. This situation is then further exacerbated
for reinsurance entities (as opposed to primary insurers) due to coverage often being
provided on an &#147;excess-of-loss&#148; basis and the resulting lags in receiving
current claims data. GECS insurance liabilities, reserves and annuity benefits within the
Insurance segment totaled $135.9 billion at year-end 2002. Of that total, $30.6 billion
($20.9 billion net of reinsurance recoverables) related to unpaid claims and claims
adjustment expenses under short-duration insurance contracts of which ERC&#146;s share
approximated $26.6 billion ($17.4 billion net of reinsurance recoverables).</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
continually evaluate the potential for changes in loss estimates with the support of
qualified reserving actuaries and use the results of these evaluations both to adjust
recorded reserves and to proactively modify underwriting criteria and product offerings.
For actuarial analysis purposes, reported and paid claims activity is segregated into
several hundred reserving segments, each having differing historical settlement trends. A
variety of actuarial methodologies are then applied to the underlying data for each of
these reserving segments in arriving at an estimated range of &#147;reasonably
possible&#148; loss scenarios. Factors such as line of business, length of historical
settlement pattern, recent changes in underwriting standards and unusual trends in
reported claims activity will generally affect which actuarial methodologies are given
more weight for purposes of determining the &#147;best estimate&#148; of ultimate losses
in a particular reserving segment. As discussed on pages 53-54, in recent periods and
continuing throughout 2002, the level of reported claims activity related to prior year
loss events, particularly for liability-related exposures underwritten in 1997 through
2001 at ERC, has been significantly higher than anticipated. Full consideration of these
trends was incorporated into a comprehensive reserve study completed in the fourth quarter
of 2002.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>PENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Pension benefit
obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models.
Two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important
elements of plan expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate these critical
assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as
retirement, mortality and turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and are
updated to reflect our experience. Of course, actual results in any given year will often
differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the
measurement date. We have little latitude in selecting this rate, as it is required to
represent the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments. A lower discount rate
increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. For our
principal plans, a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension
expense by approximately $180 million. We reduced our discount rate from 7 1/4% to
6 3/4% for
2003 to reflect market interest rate conditions.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider the
current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on
various categories of plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on
assets of principal plans would increase pension expense on our principal plans by
approximately $240 million per year. We assumed that long-term returns on our pension
plans were 8 1/2% in 2002 and 9 1/2% in 2001 and 2000. Further information on our principal
pension plans is provided on pages 47-48 of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis
under the caption Principal Costs and Expenses for GE. Note 6 to the consolidated
financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions.&nbsp;</P>

<P> OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES
are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a
reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision.
Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable
losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about
potential actions by third parties such as regulators.&nbsp;</P>

<P> OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed
above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
Policies related to revenue recognition, financial instruments and business combinations
require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources
of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under
re-examination by accounting standard setters and regulators. Although no specific
conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in
our accounting policies, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also see note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which discusses accounting policies that we
have selected from acceptable alternatives.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial data and related
measurements are presented in the following categories:</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>GE This represents the adding together of all affiliates other than
    General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS), whose operations are
    presented on a one-line basis.&nbsp;<BR>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>The effects of transactions among related companies within and between each
of the above-mentioned groups are eliminated. Transactions between GE and GECS
are immaterial and consist primarily of GECS services for material procurement
and trade payables and receivables management, aircraft engines and medical
equipment manufactured by GE that are leased to others, buildings and equipment
leased by GE from GECS, and GE investments of cash in GECS commercial paper.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related
disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Sales of goods and services&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>We record sales of goods when a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery
has occurred and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is
reasonably assured. If customer acceptance of products is not assured, sales are
recorded only upon formal customer acceptance.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of goods in the
Appliances, Industrial Systems, IT Solutions, Lighting, Plastics, Specialty
Materials and GE Supply businesses typically do not include multiple product
and/or service elements, as compared with sales in certain of the businesses
referred to below. Consumer lighting products and computer hardware and software
are often sold with a right of return. Accumulated experience is used to
estimate and provide for such returns.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of goods in the
Aircraft Engines, Medical Systems, Power Systems, Transportation Systems and
certain Industrial Systems businesses sometimes include multiple components and
sometimes include services such as installation. In such contracts, amounts
assigned to each component are based on that component's objectively
determined fair value, such as the sales price for the component when it is sold
separately or competitor prices for similar components. In general, sales are
recognized individually for delivered components only when undelivered
components are not essential to their functionality. However, when undelivered
components are inconsequential or perfunctory, such as certain training
commitments, sales are recognized on the total contract with provision made for
the cost of the incomplete elements.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We record sales of product
services and certain power generation equipment in accordance with contracts.
For long-term product services agreements, we use estimated contract profit
rates to record sales as work is performed. For certain power generation
equipment, we use estimated contract profit rates to record sales as major
components are completed and delivered to customers. Estimates are subject to
change; revisions that affect an agreement's total estimated profitability
result in an immediate adjustment of earnings. Losses, if any, are provided for
when probable.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales by NBC are recorded
when advertisements are broadcast, with provision made for any shortfalls from
viewer commitments ("make goods") based on specific contracts and
independent viewer census information.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><B>GECS revenues from services (earned income)&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>We use the interest method to recognize income on all loans. We stop accruing
interest income at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account
becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days delinquent. We recognize
interest income on impaired loans either as cash is collected or on a
cost-recovery basis as conditions warrant.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We record financing lease
income on the interest method to produce a level yield on funds not yet
recovered. Estimated unguaranteed residual values of leased assets are based
primarily on periodic independent appraisals of the values of leased assets
remaining at expiration of the lease terms. Significant assumptions we use in
estimating residual values include estimated net cash flows over the remaining
lease term, results of future remarketing and future component part and scrap
metal prices, discounted at an appropriate rate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We defer origination,

that we do not expect to fund and on line-of-credit fees and record them in
earned income on a straight-line basis over the period to which the fees relate.
We record syndication fees in earned income at the time related services are

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See below and page 80 for our
discussion of income from investment and insurance activities.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Depreciation and amortization</B></P>
<P>The cost of most of GE's manufacturing plant and equipment is depreciated
over its estimated economic life using an accelerated method based primarily on
a sum-of-the-years digits formula.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of GECS equipment
leased to others on operating leases is amortized, principally on a
straight-line basis, to estimated residual value over the lease term or over the
estimated economic life of the equipment. Depreciation of property and equipment
used by GECS is recorded on either a sum-of-the-years digits formula or a
straight-line basis over the lives of the assets.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Losses on financing receivables</B>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The allowance for losses on small-balance receivables reflects our best
estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio determined principally on
the basis of historical experience. For other receivables, principally the
larger loans and leases, the allowance for losses is determined primarily on the
basis of our best estimate of probable losses, including specific allowances for
known troubled accounts. Small balance receivables consist of consumer loans,
primarily credit card receivables, and certain homogeneous leases and secured
loans. Large balance receivables comprise all other commercial loans and leases.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Losses on financing
receivables are recognized when they are incurred. Measurement of such losses
requires consideration of historical loss experience, including the need to
adjust for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of
relevant observable data, including present economic conditions such as
delinquency rates, financial health of specific customers and market sectors,
collateral value, and the present and expected levels of interest rates. For
large balance, non-homogeneous loans, the following sources of value are used to
determine recoverability, as appropriate under the circumstances: present value
of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest
rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All accounts or portions
thereof that are deemed to be uncollectible or to require an excessive
collection cost are written off to the allowance for losses. Small-balance
accounts generally are written off when six to 12 months delinquent, although
any such balance judged to be uncollectible, such as an account in bankruptcy,
is written down immediately to estimated realizable value. Large-balance
accounts are reviewed at least quarterly, and those accounts with amounts that
are judged to be uncollectible are written down to estimated realizable value.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When collateral is
repossessed in satisfaction of a loan, the receivable is written down against
the allowance for losses to estimated fair value of the asset less costs to
sell, transferred to other assets and subsequently carried at the lower of cost
or estimated fair value less costs to sell. This accounting method has been
employed principally for commercial lending transactions.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Cash and equivalents</B>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are included
in cash equivalents unless designated as available for sale and classified as
investment securities.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME="A005"></A>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Investment securities</B></P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>We report investments in debt and marketable equity securities, and equity
securities at our insurance affiliates, at fair value based primarily on quoted
market prices or, if quoted prices are not available, discounted expected cash
flows using market rates commensurate with credit quality and maturity of the
investment. Substantially all investment securities are designated as available
for sale, with unrealized gains and losses included in share owners' equity,
net of applicable taxes and other adjustments. We regularly review investment
securities for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which
cost exceeds market value, the duration of the market decline, and the financial
health of and specific prospects for the issuer. Unrealized losses that are
other than temporary are recognized in earnings. Realized gains and losses are
accounted for on the specific identification method.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Inventories&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or realizable values. Cost
for substantially all of GE's U.S. inventories is determined on a last-in,
first-out (LIFO) basis. Cost of other GE inventories is primarily determined on
a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. GECS inventories consist primarily of
finished products held for sale. Cost is primarily determined on a FIFO
basis.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Intangible assets&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>As of January 1, 2002, we completed adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, <I> Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>. Under
SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested for impairment using a
fair value approach, at the "reporting unit" level. A reporting unit is the
operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (the "component"
level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by
management at</P>

<P>&lt;PAGE&gt;</P>

<P>F-38</P>
<P>Annual Report Page 80</P>
<HR ALIGN="left" WIDTH="200" NOSHADE SIZE="1">
<P>the component level. We recognize an impairment charge for any amount
by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair
value. We use discounted cash flows to establish fair values. When available and
as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted
cash flow results. When a business within a reporting unit is disposed of,
goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition using the relative fair
value methodology.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We amortize the cost of other
intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed
indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on
undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on
either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with
indefinite lives are tested for impairment and written down to fair value as
required.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before January 1, 2002, we
amortized goodwill over its estimated period of benefit on a straight-line
basis; we amortized other intangible assets on appropriate bases over their
estimated lives. No amortization period exceeded 40 years. When an intangible
asset's carrying value exceeded associated expected operating cash flows, we
considered it to be impaired and wrote it down to fair value, which we
determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><B>GECS insurance accounting policies&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>Accounting policies for GECS insurance businesses follow.&nbsp;</P>
<P> PREMIUM INCOME. We
report insurance premiums as earned income as follows:</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>For short-duration insurance contracts (including property and casualty,
    accident and health, and financial guaranty insurance), we report premiums
    as earned income, generally on a pro-rata basis, over the terms of the
    related agreements. For retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts, we
    record premium adjustments based on estimated losses and loss expenses,
    taking into consideration both case and incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR)
    reserves.</LI>
</UL>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>For traditional long-duration insurance contracts (including term and
    whole life contracts and annuities payable for the life of the annuitant),
    we report premiums as earned income when due.&nbsp;<BR>
    &nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>For investment contracts and universal life contracts, we report premiums
    received as liabilities, not as revenues. Universal life contracts are
    long-duration insurance contracts with terms that are neither fixed nor
    guaranteed; for these contracts, we recognize revenues for assessments
    against the policyholder's account, mostly for mortality, contract
    initiation, administration and surrender. Investment contracts are contracts
    that have neither significant mortality nor significant morbidity risk,
    including annuities payable for a determined period; for these contracts, we
    recognize revenues on the associated investments and amounts credited to
    policyholder accounts are charged to expense.</LI>
</UL>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES represent our
best estimate of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those IBNR
and the related estimated claim settlement expenses for all claims incurred
through December 31 of each year. Specific reserves &#8211; also referred to as case
reserves &#8211; are established for reported claims using case-basis evaluations of the
underlying claim data and are updated as further information becomes known. IBNR
reserves are determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques
that take into account historical loss experience data and, as appropriate,
certain qualitative factors. IBNR reserves are adjusted to take into account
certain additional factors that can be expected to affect the liability for
claims over time, such as changes in the volume and mix of business written,
revisions to contract terms and conditions, changes in legal precedence or
developed case law, trends in healthcare and medical costs, and general
inflation levels. Settlement of complex claims routinely involves threatened or
pending litigation to resolve disputes as to coverage, interpretation of
contract terms and conditions or fair compensation for damages suffered. These
disputes are settled through negotiation, arbitration or actual litigation.
Recorded reserves incorporate our best estimate of the effect that ultimate
resolution of such disputes have on both claims payments and related settlement
expenses. Liabilities for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses are
continually reviewed and adjusted; such adjustments are included in current
operations and accounted for as changes in estimates.&nbsp;</P>
<P>DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS. Costs that vary with and are primarily
related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and investment contracts
are deferred and amortized over the respective policy terms. For short-duration

brokerage expenses and premium taxes. For long-duration insurance contracts,
these costs consist primarily of first-year commissions in excess of recurring

<P>Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested for impairment
using a fair value methodology. We stopped amortizing goodwill effective January
1, 2002.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under SFAS 142, we were
required to test all existing goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2002, on
a reporting unit basis, and recorded a non-cash charge of $1.204 billion ($1.015
billion after tax, or $0.10 per share), which we reported in the caption "Cumulative
effect of accounting changes." Substantially all of the charge relates to the
GECS IT Solutions business and the GECS GE Auto and Home business. Factors
contributing to the impairment charge were the difficult economic environment in
the information technology sector and heightened price competition in the auto
insurance industry. No impairment charge had been required under our previous
goodwill impairment policy, which was based on undiscounted cash flows.</P>

option expense provisions of SFAS 123, <I> Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation</I>,
resulting in a $27 million charge to net earnings. We first measure the total
cost of each option grant at the grant date, using market-based option trading
models. We then recognize each grant's total cost over the period that the
options vest. Under this approach, our 2002 option grants had a total value of
approximately $200 million, after tax; we charged $27 million to net earnings in
2002, and after-tax expense from this grant for the next three years will be
about $80 million, $50 million and $30 million. A comparison of reported and
pro-forma net earnings, including effects of expensing stock options, follows.</P>

<P>The cumulative effect on earnings of adopting SFAS 133 comprised two
significant elements. One element represented the fair value of equity options
embedded in loans that provided both us and the borrower the right, but not the
obligation, to convert the loans into shares of the borrower's stock. The
second element of the transition effect was a portion of the effect of marking
to market options and currency contracts used for hedging. The cumulative effect
on share owners' equity was primarily attributable to marking to market
forward and swap contracts used to hedge variable-rate borrowings. Decreases in
the fair values of these instruments were attributable to declines in interest
rates since inception of the hedging arrangements. As a matter of policy, we
ensure that, including the effect of derivatives, lending and financing asset
positions are substantially matched in character (e.g., fixed vs. floating) and
duration. As a result, declines in the fair values of these effective
derivatives are offset by unrecognized gains on the related financing assets and
hedged items, and future earnings will not be subject to volatility from
interest rate changes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2000, the
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB reached a consensus on accounting
for impairment of retained beneficial interests (EITF 99-20). Under this
consensus, impairment of certain retained interests in securitized assets must
be recognized when (1) the asset's fair value is below its carrying value, and
(2) it is probable that there has been an adverse change in estimated cash
flows. The cumulative effect of adopting EITF 99-20 at January 1, 2001, was a
one-time reduction of net earnings of $120 million ($0.01 per share).</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->

did not involve cash, and we expect that they will have no more than a modest
effect on future results.</P>

million and $1,246 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Consolidated

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred income tax balances
reflect the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates
expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. See note 21
for details.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not provided U.S.
deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated
companies that have been reinvested indefinitely. Such amount relates to ongoing
operations and, at December 31, 2002, was approximately $15 billion. Because of
the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine
the U.S. federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings
were not reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for earnings of
non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies when we plan to remit those
earnings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated U.S. income
before taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes was $12.0 billion

amounts for non-U.S.-based operations were $6.9 billion in 2002, $5.8 billion in
2001 and $5.5 billion in 2000.</P>

<P>Receivables balances at December 31, 2002 and 2001, before allowance for
losses, included $6,269 million and $5,893 million, respectively, from sales of
goods and services to customers, and $304 million and $447 million,
respectively, from transactions with associated companies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current receivables of $344 million at year-end 2002 and $270 million at
year-end 2001 arose from sales, principally of aircraft engine goods and
services, on open account to various agencies of the U.S. government, which is
our largest single customer. About 4%, 4% and 3% of our sales of goods and
services were to the U.S. government in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>

decreases of $21 million, $8 million and $6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, that resulted from lower LIFO inventory levels. There were net
cost decreases in each of the last three years. As of December 31, 2002, we are

<P>GECS financing receivables include both time sales and loans and financing
leases. Time sales and loans represents transactions in a variety of forms,
including time sales, revolving charge and credit, mortgages, installment loans,
intermediate-term loans and revolving loans secured by business assets. The
portfolio includes time sales and loans carried at the principal amount on which
finance charges are billed periodically, and time sales and loans carried at
gross book value, which includes finance charges.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment in financing leases consists of
direct financing and leveraged leases of aircraft, railroad rolling stock,
autos, other transportation equipment, data processing equipment and medical
equipment, as well as other manufacturing, power generation, commercial real
estate, and commercial equipment and facilities.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sole owner of assets under direct
financing leases and as the equity participant in leveraged leases, GECS is
taxed on total lease payments received and is entitled to tax deductions based
on the cost of leased assets and tax deductions for interest paid to third-party
participants. GECS is generally entitled to any residual value of leased assets.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment in direct financing and leveraged
leases represents net unpaid rentals and estimated unguaranteed residual values
of leased equipment, less related deferred income. GECS has no general
obligation for principal and interest on notes and other instruments
representing third-party participation related to leveraged&nbsp;</P>

<P>leases; such notes and other instruments have not been included in
liabilities but have been offset against the related rentals receivable. The
GECS share of rentals receivable on leveraged leases is subordinate to the share
of other participants who also have security interests in the leased equipment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-party debt financing provided in
leveraged lease transactions takes the form of various lending arrangements that
are nonrecourse to GECS and are secured by both the assets underlying the leases
and the amounts of future lease payments receivable. Since this third-party debt
is nonrecourse to GECS, the related principal and interest is deducted from the
lease receivables in determining GECS net investment in leveraged leases.</P>

(a)  Life insurance benefits are accounted for mainly by a net-level-premium
     method using estimated yields generally ranging from 1.5% to 8.5% in 2002
     and 2% to 9% in 2001.

(b)  Principally property and casualty reserves amounting to $26.1 billion and
     $23.4 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Includes amounts
     for both reported and incurred-but-not-reported claims, reduced by
     anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates of liabilities
     are reviewed and updated continually, with changes in estimated losses
     reflected in operations.

</PRE>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>When insurance affiliates cede insurance to third parties, they are not
relieved of their primary obligation to policyholders. Losses on ceded risks

such receivables from reinsurers as required.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize reinsurance
recoveries as a reduction of insurance losses and policyholder and annuity
benefits. Insurance recoveries were $2,234 million, $5,863 million and $3,232
million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insurance liability for
unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses related to policies that may cover
environmental and asbestos exposures is based on known facts and an assessment
of applicable law and coverage litigation. Liabilities are recognized for both
known and unasserted claims (including the cost of related litigation) when
sufficient information has been developed to indicate that a claim has been
incurred and a range of potential losses can be reasonably estimated. Developed
case law and adequate claim history do not exist for certain claims principally
due to significant uncertainties as to both the level of ultimate losses that
will occur and what portion, if any, will be deemed to be insured amounts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Claims and expenses incurred-prior years" represents additional losses
(adverse development) recognized in any year for loss events that occurred
before the beginning of that year. Adverse development, which amounted to 18%,
4% and 4% of beginning of year net loss reserves in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, was primarily encountered at GE Global Insurance Holding (ERC),
where we experienced a shift from property to liability insurance losses. In
2000, ERC experienced its share of an increase in industry-wide loss estimates
related to certain large property loss events, the largest of which resulted
from the European windstorms of December 1999. In 2001, we began to identify an
acceleration of reported claims activity in certain liability-related coverages &#8211;
specifically, hospital liability, non-standard auto (automobile
insurance extended to higher-risk drivers) and commercial and public entity
general liability lines of business &#8211; and recognized the increase in projected
ultimate losses. During 2002, reported claims activity accelerated dramatically,
affecting much of our liability-related insurance written in 1997 through 2001.
In connection with our normal actuarial updates, we adjusted our best estimate
of ultimate losses to reflect our experience, increasing recorded reserves by
$2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002, for a total of $3.5 billion adverse
development in ERC for the year. Our Mortgage Insurance business experienced
favorable development during this period, reflecting continued strength in
certain real estate markets and the success of our loss containment initiatives.</P>

<P>Certain insurance affiliates offer insurance guaranteeing the timely payment
of scheduled principal and interest on municipal bonds and certain asset-backed
securities. These insurance affiliates also provide insurance to protect
residential mortgage lenders from severe financial loss caused by the
non-payment of loans and issue credit life insurance designed to pay the balance
due on a loan if the borrower dies before the loan is repaid. As part of their
overall risk management process, insurance affiliates cede to third parties a
portion of their risk associated with these guarantees. In doing so, they are
not relieved of their primary obligation to policyholders.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are involved in numerous
remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and
state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs at each site are based on our best
estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries.
When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood,
liabilities are based on the lower end of such range. Uncertainties about the
status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual
sites make it difficult to develop a meaningful estimate of the reasonably
possible aggregate environmental remediation exposure. However, even in the
unlikely event that remediation costs amounted to the high end of the range of
costs for each site, the resulting additional liability would not be material to
our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.</P>

<P>We grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock
units (RSUs) to employees under the 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan as described
in our current Proxy Statement. In addition, we grant options and RSUs in
limited circumstances to consultants, advisors and independent contractors
(primarily non-employee talent at NBC) under a plan approved by our Board of
Directors in 1997 (the consultants' plan). Through the end of 2002, we also
granted options to non-employee directors under two separate option plans. With
certain restrictions, requirements for stock option shares may be met from
either unissued or treasury shares. RSUs give the recipients the right to
receive shares of our stock upon the lapse of their related restrictions. In the
past, restrictions on most RSUs lapsed for 25% of the total shares awarded after
three years, 25% after seven years, and 50% at retirement. We changed the
vesting schedule for RSUs granted in 2002 so that 25% of the restrictions lapse
after three, five and ten years, with the final 25% lapsing at retirement.
Although the plan permits us to issue RSUs settleable in cash, we have only
issued RSUs settleable in shares of our stock.</P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>Our global business activities routinely deal with fluctuations in interest
rates, currency exchange rates and commodity and other asset prices. We apply
strict policies to managing each of these risks, including prohibitions on
derivatives trading, derivatives market-making or other speculative activities.
These policies require the use of derivative instruments in concert with other
techniques to reduce or eliminate these risks.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME="A068"></A>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Cash flow hedges</B></P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>Under SFAS 133, cash flow hedges are hedges that use simple derivatives to
offset the variability of expected future cash flows. Variability can appear in
floating rate assets, floating rate liabilities or from certain types of
forecasted transactions, and can arise from changes in interest rates or
currency exchange rates. For example, GECS often borrows at a variable rate of
interest to fund our financial services businesses. If Commercial Finance needs
the funds to make a floating rate loan, there is no exposure to interest rate
changes, and no hedge is necessary. However, if a fixed rate loan is made, we
will contractually commit to pay a fixed rate of interest to a counterparty who
will pay us a variable rate of interest (an "interest rate swap"). This swap
will then be designated as a cash flow hedge of the associated variable rate
borrowing. If, as would be expected, the derivative is perfectly effective in
offsetting variable interest in the borrowing, changes in its fair value are
recorded in a separate component in equity and released to earnings
contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the hedged item. Further
information about hedge effectiveness is provided on page 103.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use currency forwards and
options to manage exposures to changes in currency exchange rates associated
with commercial purchase and sale transactions. These instruments permit us to
eliminate the cash flow variability, in local currency, of costs or selling
prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In
addition, we use these instruments, along with interest rate and currency swaps,
to optimize borrowing costs and investment returns. For example, currency swaps
and non-functional currency borrowings together provide lower funding costs than
could be achieved by issuing debt directly in a given currency.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2002, amounts
related to derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges amounted to a reduction of
equity of $2,112 million, of which $519 million was expected to be transferred
to earnings in 2003 along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted
transactions. In 2002, there were no forecasted transactions that failed to
occur. At December 31, 2002, the maximum term of derivative instruments that
hedge forecasted transactions was 24 months.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Fair value hedges</B></P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>Under SFAS 133, fair value hedges are hedges that eliminate the risk of
changes in the fair values of assets, liabilities and certain types of firm
commitments. For example, we will use an interest rate swap in which we receive
a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest to change the cash
flow profile of a fixed rate borrowing to match the variable rate financial
asset that it is funding. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated and
effective as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings and are offset by
corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged item.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use interest rate swaps,
currency swaps and interest rate and currency forwards to hedge the effect of
interest rate and currency exchange rate changes on local and nonfunctional
currency denominated fixed rate borrowings and certain types of fixed rate
assets. Equity options are used to hedge price changes in investment securities
and equity-indexed annuity liabilities at Insurance.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Net investment hedges</B>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The net investment hedge designation under SFAS 133 refers to the use of
derivative contracts or cash instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure
of a net investment in a foreign operation. We manage currency exposures that
result from net investments in affiliates principally by funding assets
denominated in local currency with debt denominated in that same currency. In
certain circumstances, we manage such exposures with currency forwards and
currency swaps.</P>

<P><B>Derivatives not designated as hedges&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>SFAS 133 specifies criteria that must be met in order to apply any of the
three forms of hedge accounting. For example, hedge accounting is not permitted
for hedged items that are marked to market through earnings. We use derivatives
to hedge exposures when it makes economic sense to do so, including
circumstances in which the hedging relationship does not qualify for hedge
accounting as described below. We also will occasionally receive derivatives,
such as equity warrants, in the ordinary course of business. Under SFAS 133,
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market
through earnings.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use option contracts,
including caps, floors and collars, as an economic hedge of changes in interest
rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices on certain types of assets and
liabilities. For example, Insurance uses equity options to hedge the risk of
changes in equity prices embedded in liabilities associated with annuity
contracts it writes. We also use interest rate swaps, purchased options and
futures as an economic hedge of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. We
occasionally obtain equity warrants as part of sourcing or financing
transactions. Although these instruments are considered to be derivatives under
SFAS 133, their economic risk is similar to, and managed on the same basis as,
other equity instruments we hold.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><B>Earnings effects of derivatives</B>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The table that follows provides additional information about the earnings
effects of derivatives. In the context of hedging relationships, "effectiveness"
refers to the degree to which fair value changes in the hedging instrument
offset the corresponding expected earnings effects of the hedged item. Certain
elements of hedge positions cannot qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133
whether effective or not, and must therefore be marked to market through
earnings. Time value of purchased options is the most common example of such
elements in instruments we use. Pre-tax earnings effects of such items are shown
in the following table as "amounts excluded from the measure of effectiveness."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Counterparty credit risk</B></P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>The risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will be financially
unable to make payments to us according to the terms of the agreements is
counterparty credit risk. We manage counterparty credit risk on an individual
counterparty basis, which means that we net gains and losses for each
counterparty to determine the amount at risk. When a counterparty exceeds credit
exposure limits in terms of amounts they owe us (see table below), typically as
a result of changes in market conditions, no additional transactions are
permitted to be executed until the exposure with that counterparty is reduced to
an amount that is within the established limit. All swaps are required to be
executed under master swap agreements containing mutual credit downgrade
provisions that provide the ability to require assignment or termination in the
event either party is downgraded below A3 or A-. If the downgrade provisions had
been triggered at December 31, 2002, we could have been required to disburse up
to $4.0 billion and could have claimed $1.9 billion from counterparties--the net
fair value losses and gains. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, gross fair value
gains amounted to $5.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. At December 31,
2002 and 2001, gross fair value losses amounted to $7.1 billion and $5.4
billion, respectively.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its ongoing
activities, our financial services businesses enter into swaps that are
integrated into investments in or loans to particular customers. Such integrated
swaps not involving assumption of third-party credit risk are evaluated and
monitored like their associated investments or loans and are therefore not
subject to the same credit criteria that would apply to a stand-alone position.
Except for such positions, all other swaps, purchased options and forwards with
contractual maturities longer than one year are conducted within the credit
policy constraints provided in the table below. Foreign exchange forwards with
contractual maturities shorter than one year must be executed with
counterparties having an A-1/ P-1 credit rating and the credit limit for
exposures on these transactions is $150 million.</P>

certain of these assets as well as liquidity support for the commercial paper.</P>

(c)  Available support conditioned on an increase of qualified assets in SPEs.

</PRE>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>Credit and liquidity support agreements. We have agreed to lend to these
    entities on a secured basis if (a) certain market conditions render the
    entities unable to issue new debt instruments, or (b) the credit ratings of
    debt issued by such entities were reduced below specified levels. Timing of
    such liquidity support depends on the associated maturities of supported
    debt. We reduce our exposure to liquidity support agreements by obtaining
    offsetting support from third-party banks. Such offsetting support amounted
    to $11.7 billion at December 31, 2002. We also provide credit support for
    credit losses on certain assets: full recourse for $9.7 billion and the
    remaining $7.2 billion based on loss-sharing formulae at December 31, 2002.
    This support is available for the life of the assets but generally amortizes
    in proportion to the assets outstanding. Assets with credit support are
    primarily funded by commercial paper that is subject to the liquidity
    support.</LI>
</UL>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>Performance guarantees. We provide both letters of credit and lines of
    credit for guaranteed investment contracts. The letters of credit may be
    drawn upon occurrence of a credit event or a program event of default, which
    includes a downgrade of the SPE or failure to pay the SPE's secured
    obligations. The lines of credit enable the SPEs to pay all amounts owed
    under investment agreements, hedge contracts and distributions on preferred
    securities.</LI>
</UL>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>Guarantee and reimbursement contracts. We provide protection to certain
    counterparties of interest rate swaps entered into by SPEs related to
    changes in the relationship between commercial paper interest rates and the
    timing and amount of the payment streams. These arrangements provide
    protection for the life of the assets held by the SPE but generally amortize
    in proportion to the assets outstanding. The fair value of the related
    liability is $26 million at year-end 2002.&nbsp;</LI>
</UL>
<P> We evaluate the economic,
    liquidity and credit risk related to the above SPEs and support arrangements
    and believe that the likelihood is remote that any such arrangements could
    have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or liquidity. We record liabilities, as disclosed above, for such
    guarantees based on our best estimate of probable losses.</P>

  <LI>Retained interests. When we securitize receivables, we are required to
    recognize our retained interests, which represent our rights to expected net
    future cash flows, at their fair value. Retained interests generally
    approximate the gain recognized, and are sometimes subject to credit,
    prepayment and interest rate risks.</LI>

  <LI>Servicing assets. Following a securitization transaction, we retain the

    receive an ongoing fee based on the outstanding principal balances of the
    receivables. Servicing assets are primarily associated with residential
    mortgage loans. Their value is subject to credit, prepayment and interest
    rate risk.&nbsp;<BR>

  <LI>Recourse liability. As described previously, under credit support

companies for which we provide varying degrees of financial support and are
entitled to a share in the results of the entities' activities. While all of
these entities are substantive operating companies, some may need to be
evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN 46. The types of support we
typically provide to these entities consist of credit enhancement, such as debt
guarantees, take-or-pay contracts that provide for minimum purchase commitments,
and other contractual arrangements.</P>

assistance on future sales of aircraft equipped with our engines, totaling $1.6
billion at year-end 2002. In addition, our Commercial Finance business had
placed multi-year orders for various Boeing, Airbus and other aircraft with list
prices approximating $15.4 billion at year-end 2002.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At year-end 2002, we were
committed under the following guarantee arrangements beyond those provided on
behalf of SPEs (see note 29):&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Liquidity support. Liquidity support provided
to holders of certain variable rate bonds issued by municipalities amounted to
$4.8 billion at December 31, 2002. If holders elect to sell supported bonds that
cannot be remarketed, we are obligated to repurchase them at par. If called
upon, our position would be secured by the repurchased bonds. While we hold any
such bonds, we would receive interest payments from the municipalities at a rate
that is in excess of the stated rate on the bond. To date, we have not been
required to perform under such arrangements.</LI>
</UL>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>Credit support. We have provided $4.2 billion of credit support on behalf
    of certain customers or associated companies, predominantly joint ventures
    and partnerships, using arrangements such as standby letters of credit and
    performance guarantees. These arrangements enable our customers and
    associated companies to execute transactions or obtain desired financing
    arrangements with third parties. Should the customer or associated company
    fail to perform under the terms of the transaction or financing arrangement,
    we would be required to perform on their behalf. Under most such
    arrangements, our guarantee is secured, usually by the asset being purchased
    or financed but possibly by total assets of the customer or associated
    company. The length of these credit support arrangements parallels the
    length of the related financing arrangements or transactions. The liability
    for such credit support was $51 million at December 31, 2002.</LI>
</UL>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>Indemnification agreements. These are agreements that require us to fund
    up to $1.3 billion under residual value guarantees on a variety of leased
    equipment and $0.2 billion of other indemnification commitments arising from
    sales of businesses or assets. Under most of our residual value guarantees,
    our commitment is secured by the leased asset at termination of the lease.
    The liability for indemnification agreements was $64 million at December 31,
    2002.</LI>
</UL>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<UL>
  <LI>Contingent consideration. These are agreements to provide additional
    consideration in a business combination to the seller if contractually
    specified conditions related to the acquired entity are achieved. At
    December 31, 2002, we had recognized liabilities for estimated payments
    amounting to $72 million of our exposure of $0.3 billion.&nbsp;</LI>
</UL>
<P>Our guarantees are provided in the ordinary course of business. We underwrite
these guarantees considering economic, liquidity and credit risk of the
counterparty. We believe that the likelihood is remote that any such
arrangements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity. We record liabilities, as disclosed above,
for such guarantees based on our best estimate of probable losses, which
considers amounts recoverable under recourse provisions. For example, at
year-end 2002, the total fair value of aircraft securing our airline industry
guarantees exceeded the guaranteed amounts, net of the associated allowance for
losses.</P>

<P>BORROWING Financial liability (short or long-term) that obliges us to repay
cash or another financial asset to another entity.&nbsp;</P>
<P>CASH EQUIVALENTS Highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of less than
three months, such as commercial paper. Typically included with cash for
reporting purposes, unless designated as available for sale and included with
investment securities.&nbsp;</P>
<P>CASH FLOW HEDGES Qualifying derivative instruments that we use to protect
ourselves against exposure to volatility in future cash flows. The exposure may
be associated with an existing asset or liability, or with a forecasted
transaction. See "Hedge."</P>
<P>COMMERCIAL PAPER Unsecured, unregistered promise to repay borrowed funds in a
specified period ranging from overnight to 270 days.&nbsp;</P>
<P>CUSTOMER SERVICE AGREEMENTS (also referred to as "product services
agreements") Contractual commitments to provide specified services for

power plant.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT A financial instrument or contract with another party ("counterparty")
that is structured to meet any of a variety of financial objectives, including
those related to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. Options, forwards and swaps are the most common derivative
instruments we employ. See "Hedge."&nbsp;</P>
<P>DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS Amounts charged to insureds in exchange for coverages
provided in accordance with the terms of an insurance/reinsurance contract.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>EARNED PREMIUMS Portion of the premium pertaining to the segment of the

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>EQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS (ELTO) Rental equipment we own that is available
to rent and is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.&nbsp;</P>
<P>FAIR VALUE HEDGE Qualifying derivative instruments that we use to protect
ourselves against exposure to volatility in values of hedged assets, liabilities
or certain types of firm commitments. Changes in the fair values of derivative
instruments that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are recorded
in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the
hedged items. See "Hedge."</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>FINANCIAL LEVERAGE The relationship of debt to equity. Expressed for
financial services businesses as borrowings divided by equity. Expressed for
industrial businesses as borrowings divided by total capital.&nbsp;</P>
<P>FINANCING RECEIVABLES Investment in contractual loans and leases due from
customers (not investment securities).&nbsp;</P>
<P>FORWARD CONTRACT Fixed price contract for purchase or sale of a specified
quantity of a commodity, security, currency or other financial instrument with
delivery and settlement at a specified future date. Commonly used as a hedging
tool. See "Hedge."&nbsp;</P>
<P>GOODWILL The premium paid for acquisition of a business. Calculated as the
purchase price less the fair value of net assets acquired (net assets are
identified tangible and intangible assets, less liabilities assumed).</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (GICS) (including funding agreements)
Deposit-type products that provide a stated interest rate on funds deposited
with the insurer for a stated period. These products are generally purchased by
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) qualified defined
contribution plans and institutional accredited investors.&nbsp;</P>
<P>HEDGE A technique designed to reduce or eliminate risk. Often refers to the
use of derivative financial instruments to offset changes in interest rates,
currency exchange rates or commodity prices, although many business positions
are "naturally hedged&quot; &#8211; for example, funding a U.S. fixed rate investment
with U.S. fixed rate borrowings is a natural interest rate hedge.&nbsp;</P>
<P>INSURANCE RECEIVABLES Receivables of our insurance businesses associated with
(1) reinsurance agreements in which those businesses legally transferred (ceded)
insurance losses (and related premiums) to reinsurers and are entitled to
recovery of those insurance losses; (2) premiums on insurance and reinsurance
contracts; (3) policy loans to policyholders of certain life insurance
contracts; and (4) premium funds on deposit with reinsurance customers as
collateral for our obligations as a reinsurer.&nbsp;</P>
<P>INTANGIBLE ASSET A non-financial asset lacking physical substance, such as
goodwill, patents, trademarks and licenses. Also includes present value of
future profits, which are anticipated net discounted cash flows to be realized
from certain in-force insurance, annuity and investment contracts at the date we
acquire a life insurance business.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>INTEREST RATE SWAP Agreement under which two counterparties agree to exchange
one type of interest rate cash flows for another type of cash flows on specified
dates in the future. In a typical arrangement, one party periodically will pay a
fixed amount of interest, in exchange for which that party will receive variable
payments computed using a published index. See "Hedge."&nbsp;</P>

<P>INVESTMENT SECURITIES Generally, an instrument that provides an ownership
position in a corporation (a stock), a creditor relationship with a corporation
or governmental body (a bond), or rights to ownership such as those represented
by options, subscription rights and subscription warrants.</P>
<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P>MONETIZATION Sale of financial assets to a third party for cash. For example,
we sell certain loans, credit card receivables and trade receivables to
third-party financial buyers, typically providing at least some credit
protection and often agreeing to provide collection and processing services for
a fee. Monetization of interest-bearing assets such as loans normally results in
gains; monetization of non-interest bearing assets such as trade receivables
normally results in losses.&nbsp;</P>
<P>NET REVENUES For our lending and leasing businesses, revenues from services
less interest and other financial charges.&nbsp;</P>
<P>OPERATING MARGIN Sales of goods and services less the sum of cost of goods
and services sold plus selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating
margin is often expressed as a percentage of sales &#8211; the operating margin
rate.&nbsp;</P>
<P>OPERATING PROFIT Earnings before interest and other financial charges, income
taxes and effects of accounting changes.&nbsp;</P>
<P>OPTION The right, not the obligation, to execute a transaction at a
designated price, generally involving equity interests, interest rates,
currencies or commodities. See "Hedge."&nbsp;</P>
<P>PREMIUM Rate that is charged under insurance/reinsurance contracts.&nbsp;</P>
<P>PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PROFITS See "Intangible Asset."&nbsp;</P>
<P>PRODUCT SERVICES AGREEMENTS See "Customer Service Agreements."&nbsp;</P>
<P>PRODUCTIVITY The rate of increased output for a given level of input, with
both output and input measured in constant currency. A decline in output for a
given level of input is "negative" productivity.&nbsp;</P>
<P>PROGRESS COLLECTIONS Payments received from customers as deposits before the
associated work is performed or product is delivered.&nbsp;</P>
<P>REINSURANCE A form of insurance that insurance companies buy for their own
protection.&nbsp;</P>
<P>RETROCESSION AGREEMENT Contract to acquire third-party insurance protection
for reinsurance policies written. Retrocession is a risk mitigation
technique.&nbsp;</P>
<P>RETURN ON AVERAGE SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY Earnings before accounting changes
divided by average total equity (on an annual basis, calculated using a
five-point average).&nbsp;</P>
<P>RETURN ON AVERAGE TOTAL CAPITAL INVESTED Earnings before accounting changes
plus the sum of after-tax interest and other financial charges and minority
interest, divided by the sum of total equity, borrowings and minority interest
(on an annual basis, calculated using a five-point average).&nbsp;</P>
<P>SECURITIZATION A process whereby loans or other receivables are packaged,
underwritten and sold to investors. In some instances, the assets sold are first
transferred to an unconsolidated SPE. These entities are structured to be
bankruptcy remote in order to isolate the credit risk of the assets from the
overall credit risk of the selling entity. Outside investors, usually
institutions, typically purchase a debt instrument issued by the SPE. Whether or
not credit risk associated with the securitized assets is retained by the seller
depends on the structure of the securitization. See "Monetization."&nbsp;</P>
<P>SEPARATE ACCOUNT Investments controlled by policyholders and associated with
identical amounts reported as insurance liabilities.&nbsp;</P>
<P>TURNOVER Broadly based on the number of times that working capital is
replaced during a year. Accounts receivable turnover is total sales divided by
the five-point average balance of customer receivables from sales of goods and
services (trade receivables). Inventory turnover is total sales divided by a
five-point average balance of inventories. See "Working Capital."&nbsp;</P>
<P>UNEARNED PREMIUMS Portion of the premium received that relates to future
coverage periods.&nbsp;</P>
<P>UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES Claims reserves for events that
have occurred, including both reported and incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR)
reserves, and the expenses of settling such claims.&nbsp;</P>
<P>VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY Entity defined by Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 46, and that must be consolidated by its primary
beneficiary. A variable interest entity has one or both of the following
characteristics: (1) its equity at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity
to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from
other parties, or (2) as a group, the equity investors lack one or more of the
following characteristics: (a) direct/indirect ability to make decisions, (b)
obligation to absorb expected losses, or (c) right to receive expected residual
returns.&nbsp;</P>
<P>WORKING CAPITAL Sum of receivables from the sales of goods and services, plus
inventories, less trade accounts payable and progress collections.</P>
