Aircraft Engines, Commercial Finance, Consumer Finance, Consumer Products,
Equipment Management, Industrial Products and Systems, Insurance, Medical

consolidated data. A summary description of each of our operating segments
follows.</P>
<B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Aircraft Engines</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aircraft Engines (8.0%, 8.4% and 9.0% of consolidated
revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively) produces, sells and services jet
engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines, and related replacement parts for
use in military and commercial aircraft. Our military engines are used in a wide
variety of aircraft that includes fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and
surveillance aircraft. The CFM56&trade;, produced by CFM International, a company
jointly owned by GE and Snecma Moteurs of France, and GE's CF6 and GE90&reg; engines
power aircraft in all categories of large commercial aircraft: short/medium,
intermediate and long-range. Applications for the CFM56&trade; engine include:
Boeing's 737-300/-400/-500 series, the next generation 737-600/-700/-800/-900
series, and the 737 business jet; Airbus' A318, A319, A320, A321 and
A340-200/-300 series; and military aircraft such as the KC-135R, E/KE-3 and E-6.
The CF6 family of engines powers intermediate and long-range aircraft such as
Boeing's 747, 767, DC-10 and MD-11 series, as well as Airbus' A300, A310 and
A330 series. The GE90&reg; engine is used to power Boeing's 777 series twin-engine
aircraft. The GP7000, designed and marketed in a joint venture with the Pratt &amp;
Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation, is offered on Airbus' A380.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We produce jet engines, such as the CF34&reg;, for executive
aircraft and regional commuter aircraft, including Bombardier's Challenger 604
and CRJ200/700/900 series of aircraft and Embraer's 170 and 190 series of
aircraft. A new version of the CF34&reg;, the CF34-10A, is currently being developed
to power China's future ARJ21 regional aircraft. We also manufacture aircraft
engine derivatives used for marine propulsion and industrial power generation
sources, the latter of which is also reported as part of the Power Systems
segment. Maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO), including
sales of replacement parts, are provided for many models </P>

represent a significant portion of this segment's profits. In December 2003, we
completed the acquisition of the non-destructive testing (NDT) business of
Agfa-Gevaert. This business has been combined with Aircraft Engines NDT business
to offer radiographic, ultrasonic, eddy current and other inspection solutions
that test the structure and tolerance of materials without damaging them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO
(including parts sales) is intense. Both U.S. and export markets are important.
Product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are
critical to success. Research and development expenditures, both
customer-financed and internally funded, are important in this segment. Focused
intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design,
manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies are also important. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential sales for any engine are limited by, among other
things, its technological lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon
the rate of advance in the state of the art, by the small number of potential
customers and by the limited number of relevant airframe applications. Aircraft
engine orders tend to follow military and commercial airline procurement cycles,
although cycles for military and commercial engine procurement are different.
Procurements of military jet engines are affected by changes in global political
and economic factors.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with industry practice, airframe manufacturers
support their sales of commercial jet aircraft from time to time with long-term
financing commitments to customers, and engine manufacturers are often asked to
participate in such financings. In making such commitments, it is our policy to
establish a secured position in the aircraft being financed. Under such airline
financing programs, we had issued guarantees amounting to $0.4 billion at
year-end 2003, and had entered into commitments totaling $1.2 billion to provide
financial assistance on future sales of aircraft equipped with our engines. Our
guarantees and commitments are secured by individual aircraft or pools of
aircraft engines related to the specific financing arrangement. When particular
guarantees exceed the value of the associated security, we consider credit risk
of the customer and provide for estimated losses. At December 31, 2003, the
total estimated fair value of aircraft securing these guarantees exceeded the
guaranteed amounts, net of the associated allowance for losses. See page 49 of
the 2003 Annual Report to Shareowners for information about orders and backlog.</P>

services worldwide. With particular expertise in the mid-market segment, we
offer loans, leases, and other financial services to customers, including
manufacturers, distributors and end-users for a variety of equipment and major
capital assets including industrial facilities and equipment, energy-related
facilities, commercial and residential real estate, vehicles, aircraft, and
equipment used in construction, manufacturing, data processing and office
applications, electronics and telecommunications, and healthcare. We acquired
the commercial inventory financing business of Deutsche Financial Services and
the structured finance business of ABB in 2002 and most of the commercial
lending business of Transamerica Finance Corporation in January 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate in a highly competitive environment and are

<P ALIGN="LEFT">manufacturers, and independent finance companies. Industry
participants compete on the basis of interest rates and fees as well as deal
structures and credit terms. Profitability is affected not only by broad
economic conditions that impact customer credit quality and the availability and
cost of capital, but also by successful management of credit risk, operating
risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency exchange risk.
Important factors to continued success include maintaining strong risk
management systems, customer and industry specific knowledge, diverse
portfolios, service and distribution channels, strong collateral and asset
management knowledge, deal structuring expertise and the reduction of costs
through technology and productivity.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial Finance headquarters are in Stamford,

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Estate funds the direct acquisition, refinancing and
renovation of real estate assets, and purchases equity investments in real

subordinated fixed and floating-rate and are secured by existing
income-producing commercial properties. Our business also includes the
origination and term securitization within one year of low loan to value loans.
We invest in and provide restructuring financing for portfolios of real estate,
mortgage loans, limited partnerships and tax-exempt bonds. Additionally, we
invest in equity positions in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets via
direct real estate ownership and joint venture interests. Property types include
multi-family housing, self-storage facilities, warehouses, parking facilities,

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aviation Services is a global commercial aviation financial
services business that offers a broad range of financial products to airlines,
aircraft operators, owners, lenders and investors. Financial products include
leases, aircraft purchasing and trading, loans, engine/spare parts financing,
pilot training, fleet planning and financial advisory services.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial aviation is an industry in which we have a
significant ongoing interest. As has been widely reported, this industry has
been under pressure, but has undertaken steps to reduce unused capacity and
align costs. Consequently, during 2003, major United States and European
airlines achieved moderate improvements in operations including traffic,
revenues and load factors. Aviation Services, which owned 1,239 commercial
aircraft at December 31, 2003, had 1,236 on lease despite pressure on the
industry. Regional jets, with capacity for 50-90 passengers, have had a
significant effect on the commercial aviation industry in recent years. These
jets have enabled airlines to replace less efficient equipment, both turboprop
and older, narrow-bodied jets. At December 31, 2003, our fleet included 278
regional jets, diversifying total aircraft holdings. We believe that we continue
to offer a suitable range of equipment that is attractive to the industry. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2003, General Electric Mortgage Insurance
Corporation (GEMICO), requested that its financial strength ratings be lowered

affiliates &#8211; Employers Reinsurance Corporation, GE Reinsurance Corporation, the

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reinsurance operations include the reinsurance of
property and casualty risks written by more than 1,000 insurers around the
world. Direct insurance operations are focused on niche lines of business,
principally medical malpractice coverage for physicians and dentists, medical
professional liability for hospitals, errors and omissions coverage for
insurance agents and brokers, professional liability insurance for attorneys,
excess indemnity for self-insurers of medical benefits and excess workers'
compensation for self-insurers. The life reinsurance affiliates are engaged in
the reinsurance of life insurance products, including term, whole and universal
life, annuities, certain health-related coverages and the provision of financial
reinsurance to life insurers. During 2003, we announced our intent to scale back
on life reinsurance operations to improve overall returns, we ceased writing new
life reinsurance business in the United States and sold our United States life
reinsurance business&#8211;ERC Life Reinsurance Corporation.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, we compete in the reinsurance marketplace
principally on the basis of our expertise, relationships, financial strength,
price and creativity in developing customized solutions to customer needs.
Within the direct insurance marketplace, we believe we compete principally on
the basis of our product offerings, established relationships with customers and
key distribution partners, price and ease of doing business.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers Reinsurance Corporation is one of the largest
competitors in its marketplace. Our property and casualty reinsurance operations
are ranked fifth in the world in terms of net premiums written and we compete
with the world's largest reinsurers as well as dozens of smaller niche
competitors. Our life reinsurance operations are ranked in the top four life
reinsurers in the world. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining strong financial strength ratings is an
important factor in remaining competitive in both the reinsurance and direct
insurance markets in which we compete. During 2003, certain external credit
rating agencies announced the lowering of financial strength ratings with
respect to GE Global Insurance Holding and subsidiaries, citing poor recent
operating performance as the principal factor. Rating agencies took similar
actions to lower the ratings of many insurers and reinsurers in recent years.
Debt ratings for GE Global Insurance Holding affect $1.7 billion of outstanding
debt. While these ratings were lowered in 2003, they remain investment grade. We
do not believe these actions will materially affect GE Global Insurance Holding
liquidity or capital resources or the ability to write future business.</P>

television services to affiliated television stations within the United States;
the production of live and recorded television programs; the operation, under
licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), of television
broadcasting stations; the ownership of four cable/satellite networks around the
world, and investment and programming activities in multimedia, the Internet and
cable television. The NBC Television Network is one of four major U.S.
commercial broadcast television networks and serves more than 230 affiliated
stations within the United States. At December 31, 2003, we owned and/or
operated 29 VHF and UHF television stations including those located in
Birmingham, AL; Los Angeles, CA; San Diego, CA; Hartford, CT; Miami, FL;
Chicago, IL; New York, NY; Raleigh-Durham, NC; Columbus, OH; Philadelphia, PA;
Providence, RI; Dallas, TX; and Washington, DC. Broadcasting operations,

to FCC regulation. Our operations include investment and programming activities
in cable television, principally through CNBC, MSNBC, CNBC Europe, and CNBC
Asia; equity investments in Arts and Entertainment, The History Channel,
ValueVision, Inc., and a non-voting interest in Paxson Communications
Corporation. In 2002 we acquired the cable network Bravo. Our strategic alliance
with Dow Jones merged the European and Asian business news services of Dow Jones
with those of CNBC to form CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia and, in addition, permits
us to use Dow Jones editorial resources in the United States. In 2002, we
acquired Spanish language broadcaster, Telemundo. We have entered into long-term
arrangements with Triple Crown Productions that gives us exclusive American
broadcast rights to the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plastics business environment is characterized by
technological innovation and heavy capital investment. Being competitive
requires emphasis on efficient manufacturing process implementation and
significant resources devoted to market and application development. Competitors
include large, technology-driven suppliers of the same, as well as other
functionally equivalent, materials. The business is highly cyclical and is
extremely sensitive to variations in price and in the availability of raw
materials, such as cumene, benzene and methanol. Availability of manufacturing
capacity from the business or its competitors and anticipation of new product or
material performance requirements are key factors affecting competition.
Application development and associated technology assistance create incremental
market demand. In addition, product and manufacturing process patents establish
barriers to entry in many product lines.</P>

production, distribution and management. In 2003, we made several acquisitions,
including Jenbacher A.G. of Austria. These acquisitions continue to improve our
ability to serve our global customers and further add to the portfolio of
complete solutions for the energy industry. The acquisition of Jenbacher A.G.
added reciprocating gas engines to the portfolio. We offer wind turbines as part
of our renewable energy portfolio, which also includes hydropower and geothermal
technology. The business also packages aircraft engine derivatives for use as
industrial power sources. This activity is also reported in the Aircraft Engines
segment. Gas turbines and generators are used principally in power plants for
generation of electricity and for industrial cogeneration and mechanical drive
applications. Our Oil and Gas business offers advanced technology turbomachinery
products and services for production, LNG, transportation, storage, refineries,
petrochemical and distribution systems. With the acquisition of PII, the
business acquired leading technology in total pipeline integrity solutions
including analysis and pipeline asset management. Steam turbines and generators
are sold to the electric utility industry and to private industrial customers
for cogeneration applications. Nuclear reactors, fuel and support services for
both new and installed boiling water reactors are also a part of this segment. A
complete portfolio of aftermarket services, including equipment upgrades,
contractual services agreements, repairs, equipment installation, monitoring and
diagnostics, asset management and performance optimization tools, remote
performance testing and DLN tuning provides customers total solutions to meet
their needs. We continue to invest in advanced technology development that will
provide more value to our customers and more efficient solutions that comply
with today's strict environmental regulations.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide competition for power generation products and
services is intense. Demand for most power generation products and services is
global and, as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environment
of each country in which the business participates, and to regional load growth
requirements and demand side management. In addition, internationally, the
influence of available fuels and related prices has a large impact on demand.
