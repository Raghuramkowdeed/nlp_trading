PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS

THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME,

IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER 90 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN

C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: THE COMPANY CREATES VALUE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS THAT LEVERAGE: DATA,

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, DEEP EXPERTISE IN INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND A BROAD ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS AND ALLIANCES. IBM SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY CREATE VALUE BY ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES FOR

CLIENTS THAT TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES AND HELP THEM ENGAGE WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES IN NEW WAYS. THESE SOLUTIONS DRAW FROM AN INDUSTRY-LEADING PORTFOLIO OF CONSULTING AND IT IMPLEMENTATION

SERVICES, CLOUD AND COGNITIVE OFFERINGS, AND ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE; ALL BOLSTERED BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS.

STRATEGY

IN A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, IBM'S STRATEGY REMAINS ONE OF INNOVATION AND A CONSTANT DRIVE TO DELIVER HIGHER VALUE

FOR OUR CLIENTS.

KEY

TENETS OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY INCLUDE.

1.

OUR STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES.

DATA, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY

TRANSFORMING THE IT INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY AND OUR CLIENTS' BUSINESSES. THE TREMENDOUS GROWTH OF DATA IS REDEFINING TODAY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WITH DATA AS THE WORLD'S NEW "NATURAL RESOURCE," IT IS

FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS. YET AS WITH ALL NATURAL RESOURCES, ONLY BY REFINING DATA INTO ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS THROUGH ANALYTICS DOES IT BECOME VALUABLE TO THE CUSTOMER'S

BUSINESS. CLOUD COMPUTINGTHE DELIVERY OF IT AND BUSINESS PROCESSES AS DIGITAL SERVICESOFFERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENTERPRISES TO REINVENT NOT JUST THEIR OPERATIONS, BUT THEIR

ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL AND APPROACHES TO INNOVATION. ENGAGEMENT, INCLUDING MOBILE AND SOCIAL TECHNOLOGIES, IS PROFOUNDLY CHANGING HOW PEOPLE INTERACT AND THE WAY WORK GETS DONE. FINALLY, THESE

TRANSFORMATIONS ARE ALL SUPPORTED AND PROTECTED BY HIGH LEVELS OF SECURITY TO ENSURE PRIVACY AND INTEGRITY OF ACTION. THESE THREE IMPERATIVESDATA, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENTARE THE

FOUNDATION OF IBM'S STRATEGY TODAY AND ITS VISION FOR THE FUTURE.

2.

OUR UNIQUE STRENGTH.

OUR ABILITY TO CONNECT NEW TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE

SYSTEMS CURRENTLY RUNNING TODAY'S ENTERPRISES IS A KEY VALUE-ADDED SERVICE AND MARKET DIFFERENTIATOR FOR IBM. CLIENTS TODAY WANT MORE THAN JUST ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIESTHEY WANT IBM TO

FUSE NEW SOLUTIONS WITH THEIR EXISTING SYSTEMS. THIS "BRINGING TOGETHER" IS WHAT THE COMPANY CALLS HYBRID CLOUD, AND IBM IS UNIQUELY ABLE TO BRING THIS VALUE TO ITS CLIENTS.

3.

OUR MIGRATION TO HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS VALUE.

CLIENTS LOOK TO IBM TO

SOLVE THEIR BUSINESS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES RATHER THAN JUST PROVIDING TECHNOLOGY. OUR EVOLUTION OVER DECADESFROM HARDWARE TO SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, AND INCREASINGLY TO FULL-FLEDGED

BUSINESS SOLUTIONSREFLECTS THIS CRITICAL SHIFT IN MEETING CLIENT NEEDS. IBM BRINGS TOGETHER THE FULL BREADTH OF ITS INTEGRATED OFFERINGS AND INDUSTRY EXPERTISE TO BE ESSENTIAL TO ITS

CLIENTS AND DELIVER HIGHER VALUE.

1.     OUR STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES

DATA: TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS

FUELED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF MOBILE DEVICES, SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INFUSION OF TECHNOLOGY INTO VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS, DATA

IS THE WORLD'S NEW NATURAL RESOURCE. WITHOUT POWERFUL ANALYTICS, HOWEVER, IT IS JUST DATA.

1

ACROSS

ALL INDUSTRIES, ENTERPRISES ARE WORKING HARD TO HARVEST NEW INSIGHTS FROM THE EXPLOSION OF AVAILABLE DATATHE NEW BASIS FOR TODAY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE

ADVANTAGE FOR ENTERPRISES INCREASES AS THEY APPLY MORE SOPHISTICATED APPROACHES TO REFINING THEIR DATA, TURNING THEM INTO INSIGHTS THAT ARE ACTIONABLE AND ADD VALUE. THE ADVENT OF COGNITIVE COMPUTING,

WHICH MIRRORS THE SAME COGNITIVE PROCESS THAT PEOPLE USE EVERY DAY TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AROUND THEM, IS PROFOUNDLY REDEFINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMANS AND INFORMATION. COGNITIVE SYSTEMS

LEARN, NAVIGATE THE LANGUAGE AND PROTOCOLS OF EXPERT COMMUNITIES, AND COMMUNICATE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE.

IBM

HAS INVESTED MORE THAN $26 BILLION, INCLUDING OVER $17 BILLION ON MORE THAN 30 ACQUISITIONS, TO BUILD ITS CAPABILITIES IN BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS. ONE THIRD OF IBM

RESEARCH'S SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON DATA, ANALYTICS AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING.

IN

2014, IBM REPORTED NEARLY $17 BILLION IN BUSINESS ANALYTICS REVENUE, AND THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED THE WATSON GROUP TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE COGNITIVE COMPUTING INNOVATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED A $1 BILLION INVESTMENT TO WATSON, INCLUDING $100 MILLION DEDICATED TO VENTURE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT START-UPS BUILDING COGNITIVE APPS THROUGH THE WATSON

DEVELOPER ZONE ON BLUEMIX. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MAKING WATSON MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WATSON ECOSYSTEM, WHICH HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN 160 PARTNERS WITH NEARLY 4,000 FUTURE PARTNERS SEEKING TO

BUILD A NEW GENERATION OF COGNITIVE APPS. IBM ALSO LAUNCHED WATSON ANALYTICS, A BREAKTHROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE-BASED COGNITIVE SERVICE THAT PROVIDES INSTANT ACCESS TO POWERFUL PREDICTIVE AND VISUAL

ANALYTIC TOOLS FOR BUSINESSES. THROUGH WATSON ANALYTICS, IBM IS EXTENDING ANALYTICS TO THE END USER, NOT JUST THE DATA SCIENTIST. IBM'S GOAL IS TO GIVE EVERY BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL ACCESS TO ADVANCED

COGNITIVE-POWERED PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS, COUPLED WITH NEW FORMS OF DATA.

IN

ADDITION IN 2014, THE COMPANY MADE BOLD MOVES BY ESTABLISHING KEY ALLIANCES. IN THE DATA SPACE, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A GROUND-BREAKING PARTNERSHIP WITH TWITTER TO INCORPORATE

TWITTER'S MASSIVE DATA STREAMS INTO IBM'S CLOUD-BASED ANALYTICS, CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT PLATFORMS AND CONSULTING SERVICES. ENTERPRISES WILL NOW BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER SENTIMENT MORE DEEPLY AND

ANTICIPATE SUDDEN

SHIFTS IN MOODS AND MARKETS BY TAPPING INTO THE TWITTER DATA IN POWERFUL NEW WAYS. THIS CAPABILITY WILL ALSO ALLOW CLIENTS TO INTEGRATE TWITTER DATA INTO THEIR OWN CLOUD SERVICES AND MOBILE APPS.

CLOUD: REINVENTING IT

CLOUD IS AT THE HEART OF THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION. NO ENTERPRISE IS UNTOUCHED BY THIS REVOLUTION AND THE SHIFTS ARE OCCURRING RAPIDLY.

ENTERPRISES

ARE BENEFITTING FROM CLOUD BY USING IT TO TRANSFORM THEIR IT AND BUSINESS PROCESSES INTO DIGITAL SERVICES. MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HOW CLOUD ENABLES THE SHARING OF

INFRASTRUCTURETHIS IS TRUE. HOWEVER THE REAL PROMISE OF CLOUD IS MUCH MORE PROFOUND. BY FORCING GREATER LEVELS OF STANDARDS UP AND DOWN THE TECHNOLOGY VALUE CHAIN, NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, AND EVEN ENTIRE BUSINESS MODELS, ARE ABLE TO BE CREATED IN WEEKS RATHER THAN MONTHS OR YEARS.

CLOUD

IS A CATALYST FOR INNOVATION. IBM HAS INVESTED MORE THAN $8 BILLION TO ACQUIRE 18 COMPANIES RELATED TO CLOUD, AND IS INVESTING MORE THAN $1 BILLION TO EXPAND ITS

GLOBAL FOOTPRINT TO 40 DATACENTERS WORLDWIDE. IBM NOW HAS MORE THAN 120 SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) OFFERINGS, AND IBM CLOUD SUPPORTS 24 OF THE TOP 25 FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES, DRIVING $7 BILLION

OF REVENUE FOR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS IN 2014.



SOFTLAYER IS THE FOUNDATION FOR IBM'S EXPANSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE PORTFOLIO. IT OFFERS BARE METAL, PRIVATE

CLOUD AND VIRTUAL SERVER INSTANCES, WHICH MEANS IT CAN COVER MANY DIFFERENT WORKLOADS WITH UNPRECEDENTED PERFORMANCE. SOFTLAYER OFFERS A BUILT-IN PRIVATE NETWORK WHICH CAN HANDLE HUGE CAPACITY AND

GIVES USERS THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE PUBLIC/PRIVATE NETWORKS WITH CONTROLS FOR ACCESS AND LOCATION OF DATA.

2



BLUEMIX IS IBM'S PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE, BUILT ON THE OPEN STANDARDS FOUNDATION OF CLOUD FOUNDRY AND POWERED BY

SOFTLAYER'S CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE. SOFTLAYER OFFERS CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, APIS AND LEADING THIRD-PARTY SERVICES TO DEVELOPERS IN AN INTEGRATED PLATFORM. BLUEMIX ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO MIX AND MATCH

DIFFERENT TOOLS TO BUILD APPS IN THE CLOUD FOR MOBILE, WEB, BIG DATA AND ANALYTICSTO NAME JUST A FEW.



IBM CLOUD MARKETPLACE BRINGS TOGETHER THE COMPANY'S VAST PORTFOLIO OF CLOUD CAPABILITIES, DELIVERING A SELF-SERVICE,

DIGITAL EXPERIENCE FOR DEVELOPERS, IT AND BUSINESS LEADERS. VISITORS HAVE ACCESS TO A GROWING PORTFOLIO OF CLOUD CAPABILITIES FROM IBM AND QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS. OPEN INTEGRATION INCLUDING

PRE-BUILT APIS AND HYBRID OPTIONS ENABLE ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION AND COMPOSABLE BUSINESS MODELS.

THE

IBM CLOUD IS THE MOST POWERFUL CHOICE FOR ENTERPRISE-GRADE ENVIRONMENTSBRINGING UNPARALLELED LEVELS OF SECURITY, PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY. AS A RESULT, IN 2014, IBM

FORMED A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH SAP TO RUN ITS BUSINESS APPLICATIONS ON IBM'S CLOUD.

ENGAGEMENT: RE-IMAGINING WORK

SOCIAL, MOBILE AND UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO DATA ARE CHANGING HOW INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS WORK TOGETHER. A NEW CLASS OF CUSTOMER

HAS EMERGED: ONE WHO IS EMPOWERED WITH KNOWLEDGE, ENRICHED BY NETWORKS AND EXPECTS VALUE IN RETURN FOR SHARING INFORMATION. ENTERPRISES MUST CREATE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO ENGAGE THESE NEWLY

EMPOWERED CUSTOMERS THROUGH MORE PERSONALIZED INTERACTIONS. IBM CALLS THESE NEW FORMS OF INTERACTIONS "ENGAGEMENT"AND INCLUDES SOCIAL COLLABORATION AND MOBILEBOTH UNDERPINNED

BY HIGH LEVELS OF SECURITY.

IN

2014, THE MOBILE, SOCIAL AND SECURITY PORTFOLIO GENERATED DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH WITH MOBILE REVENUE MORE THAN TRIPLING VERSUS 2013, SECURITY REVENUE UP 19 PERCENT AND SOCIAL

BUSINESS GROWING 3 PERCENT. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ACQUIRED 23 COMPANIES RELATED TO MOBILE, SOCIAL AND SECURITY.

ON

THE MOBILE FRONT, IBM AND APPLE FORMED AN HISTORIC PARTNERSHIP TO TRANSFORM ENTERPRISE MOBILITY AS WE KNOW IT TODAY. TOGETHER, IBM AND APPLE ARE JOINING FORCES TO BRING THE

EASE-OF-USE OF PERSONAL APPS TO THE ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT. TOGETHER, THE TWO COMPANIES ARE BRINGING THE FIRST WAVE OF INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC APPS TO THE MARKETTARGETING THE NEEDS OF

INDIVIDUAL WORKERS AND HELPING TO SOLVE LONG-STANDING INDUSTRY CHALLENGES.

IN

ADDITION, MOBILEFIRST REMAINS IBM'S UNIFIED APPROACH TO HELP CLIENTS AND PARTNERS DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MOBILE SOLUTIONS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MORE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDE A

SUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

ON

THE SOCIAL COLLABORATION FRONT, IN 2014, IDC NAMED IBM THE WORLDWIDE MARKET SHARE LEADER IN ENTERPRISE SOCIAL SOFTWARE FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR.

(1)

IN ADDITION,

IBM VERSE, POWERED BY IBM ANALYTICS AND ADVANCED SEARCH, IS A NEW CLOUD-BASED MESSAGING AND SOCIAL COLLABORATION SOLUTION TO MANAGE THE WORKDAY. IT PROVIDES A SEAMLESS USER EXPERIENCE ACROSS SOCIAL

NETWORKING, MEETINGS, CHAT, DOCUMENTS, MAIL, AND AN ARRAY OF INTELLIGENT, SECURITY-RICH AND ENGAGING SOCIAL APPS ON MOBILE DEVICES OR THE WEB.

SECURITY

IS A BOARDROOM-LEVEL ISSUE. IT IS ALSO A KEY ENABLER FOR THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF DATA, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENT. ENTERPRISESAND THEIR CLIENTSDEMAND THAT

THESE ACTIVITIES BE SECURE AS A REQUIREMENT FOR PARTICIPATION.

THE

MAGNITUDE, SOPHISTICATION AND COMPLEXITY OF TODAY'S SECURITY THREATS ARE GROWING. WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF DATA ON MOBILE DEVICES, IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND IN THE CLOUD, BREACHES ARE

MORE VISIBLE AND

3

OCCUR

ON A HEIGHTENED SCALE. IBM SECURITY SOLUTIONS USE SOPHISTICATED ANALYTICS TO IDENTIFY AND THWART ATTACKS IN REALTIMEPROTECTING OUR CLIENTS' INFORMATION, PROCESSES AND PEOPLE.

IBM

SECURITY BRINGS TO OUR CLIENTS HIGH-END CONSULTING, ADVANCED FRAUD AND THREAT PROTECTION, IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT, APPLICATION AND DATA SECURITY, MOBILE AND CLOUD SECURITY,

NETWORK AND END-POINT PROTECTION WITH SERVICES FOR CLOUD.

2.     OUR UNIQUE STRENGTH

DATA, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENT ARE POWERFUL FORCES CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE OF TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, ENTERPRISE CLIENTS NEED MORE. ENTERPRISES NEED TO

BRING THIS NEW WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER WITH THE EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT CURRENTLY RUN THEIR BUSINESSES IF THEY ARE TO CAPTURE THEIR FULL VALUE. THIS COMBINATION IS WHAT WE REFER TO AS HYBRID CLOUD.

WITHOUT

BRINGING THESE WORLDS TOGETHER, THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BECOME "ISLANDS" WITHIN THE ENTERPRISE. FOR EXAMPLE, A BUSINESS THAT INVESTS IN A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM ENGAGES WITH AND

CAPTURES THE SENTIMENT OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS. THESE CAN BE VALUABLE INTERACTIONS. HOWEVER, MUCH DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE NEEDS AND WANTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER COMES WHEN COMBINING THE SOCIAL

MEDIA INTERACTIONS WITH THE HISTORICAL PURCHASE AND ENGAGEMENT RECORDS OF THAT CUSTOMERAS STORED IN EXISTING SYSTEMS. BY COMBINING THESE INSIGHTS, THE ENTERPRISE PERSONALIZES INTERACTIONS

IN WAYS THAT ARE RELEVANT AND MEANINGFUL TO THAT CUSTOMER.

IBM

IS UNIQUE IN BRINGING THIS HYBRID WORLD TO ITS CLIENTS WITH OUR UNPARALLELED STRENGTH IN BOTH THE EXISTING AND THE NEW WORLDS OF IT.

IBM

SUPPORTS ITS CLIENTS' MISSION CRITICAL PROCESSES, AND REMAINS THE "GO-TO" PLATFORM FOR THE ENTERPRISE. FOR EXAMPLE, MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF THE TOP 100 BANKS AND THE TOP 25

U.S. RETAILERS RUN ON IBM SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, NEARLY HALF OF THE FORTUNE 100 COMPANIES OUTSOURCE IT OPERATIONS TO IBM. THE COMPANY'S LEADERSHIP IN ENTERPRISE COMPUTING PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AS LEADING COMPANIES WANT TO WORK WITH IBM, AS EVIDENCED BY THE APPLE, SAP, TWITTER AND TENCENT PARTNERSHIPS ANNOUNCED IN 2014.

COMBINE

THIS WITH THE COMPANY'S STRENGTH IN THE NEW WORLDS OF DATA, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENTAND IBM BRINGS A UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT CAPABILITY TO THE MARKET.

3.     OUR MIGRATION TO HIGHER VALUE

TECHNOLOGY BY ITSELF DOES NOT CREATE VALUE FOR A BUSINESS. TECHNOLOGY ENABLES A BUSINESS TO ACHIEVE ITS ASPIRATIONS BY FACILITATING RICHER INTERACTIONS WITH

CLIENTS AND ECOSYSTEMS, BY UNLOCKING DEEPER INSIGHT AND BY ENABLING FASTER ACTIONS.

IBM

HAS CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVED ITS MISSION TO DELIVER INCREASINGLY HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS VALUE TO ITS CLIENTS. STARTING PRIMARILY AS A HARDWARE COMPANY, IBM HAS ADDED A RICH PORTFOLIO

OF SOFTWARE AND SERVICES TO ADD HIGHER VALUE.

THIS

NEXT PHASE OF IBM'S TRANSFORMATION WILL REALIZE THE FULL BREADTH OF THE PORTFOLIO BY BRINGING HIGHER-VALUE ADDED SOLUTIONS TO OUR CLIENTS. EXAMPLES

INCLUDE.



USING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS TO REDUCE CUSTOMER ATTRITION RATES THROUGH THE IBM CUSTOMER DATA SOLUTION.



DETECTING FRAUDULENT CLAIMS BEFORE PAYMENTS ARE MADE THROUGH THE IBM COUNTER FRAUD SOLUTION.



PREVENTING COSTLY AND UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME OF EQUIPMENT THROUGH EARLY DETECTION OF ANOMALIES WITH THE IBM PREDICTIVE

ASSET OPTIMIZATION SOLUTION.

4

THE

FOCUS ON INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS WILL MAKE IBM A STRONGER PARTNER WITH ITS CLIENTS AS THE COMPANY TAKES ANOTHER STEP IN ITS CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION TO HIGHER LEVELS OF VALUE.

SUMMARY

ONE CONSTANT THROUGHOUT IBM'S OVER 100-YEAR HISTORY HAS BEEN THE NEED TO CONTINUALLY TRANSFORM THE COMPANY IN AN EVER-CHANGING

INDUSTRY. OUR INDUSTRY, OUR CLIENTSAND IBM ITSELFIS IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION.

THIS

IS A TRANSFORMATION OF UNPARALLELED GROWTH AND PROMISE.



THE PROMISE OF TECHNOLOGY TO BRING EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF INSIGHT TO HUMAN ENDEAVORS THROUGH ADVANCES IN ANALYTICS AND

COGNITIVE COMPUTING.



THE PROMISE OF THE CLOUD AS A CATALYST FOR INNOVATION, FREEING ENTERPRISES TO FOCUS MORE ON THE USES OF TECHNOLOGY RATHER

THAN JUST THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF.



THE PROMISE OF ENTERPRISES ENGAGING WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR BUSINESS PARTNERS THROUGH RICHER,

MORE PERSONALIZED MEANS.



ALL UNDERSCORED BY SECURITY TO HELP PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF EVERY INTERACTION.

WE

ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND VALUE FOR OUR CLIENTSAND FOR IBMAND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING OUR CLIENTS TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES FOR THE

FUTURE.

BUSINESS MODEL

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS MODEL IS BUILT TO SUPPORT TWO PRINCIPAL GOALS: HELPING ENTERPRISE CLIENTS TO BECOME MORE INNOVATIVE, EFFICIENT

AND COMPETITIVE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND IT SOLUTIONS; AND PROVIDING LONG-TERM VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME THROUGH STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS IN CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE SUPERIOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY PROSPECTS BASED ON THE VALUE THEY DELIVER TO CLIENTS.

THE

COMPANY'S GLOBAL CAPABILITIES INCLUDE SERVICES, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH AND RELATED FINANCING. THE BROAD MIX OF BUSINESSES AND CAPABILITIES ARE COMBINED TO PROVIDE

INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS.

THE

BUSINESS MODEL IS DYNAMIC, ADAPTING TO THE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING MARKET AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DIVEST CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION

THROUGH STRATEGIC ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN HIGHER-VALUE AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE WHICH HAS IMPROVED OVERALL

PRODUCTIVITY AND IS DRIVING INVESTMENT AND EXPANDING PARTICIPATION IN MARKETS WITH SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITY.

THIS

BUSINESS MODEL, SUPPORTED BY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL MODEL, HAS ENABLED THE COMPANY TO DELIVER STRONG EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE LONG TERM.

GLOBAL FINANCING

FACILITATES IBM CLIENTS' ACQUISITION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES BY PROVIDING FINANCING

SOLUTIONS IN THE AREAS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS THE EXPERTISE. THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE END USERS' BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THESE

FINANCING CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT EVALUATION AND ARE SECURED BY LEGAL CONTRACTS. AS A CAPTIVE FINANCIER, GLOBAL FINANCING HAS THE BENEFIT OF BOTH DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF ITS

CLIENT BASE AND A CLEAR INSIGHT INTO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FINANCED. THESE FACTORS ALLOW THE BUSINESS TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE TWO OF THE MAJOR RISKS, CREDIT AND RESIDUAL VALUE, ASSOCIATED WITH

FINANCING WHILE GENERATING STRONG RETURNS ON EQUITY. GLOBAL FINANCING ALSO MAINTAINS A LONG TERM PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMPANIES' CLIENTS THROUGH VARIOUS STAGES OF IT ASSET LIFE CYCLEFROM

INITIAL PURCHASE AND TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES TO ASSET DISPOSITION DECISIONS.

GLOBAL

FINANCING CAPABILITIES

CLIENT FINANCING.

LEASE AND LOAN FINANCING TO END USERS AND INTERNAL CLIENTS FOR TERMS UP TO SEVEN YEARS.

ASSETS FINANCED ARE PRIMARILY IT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHERE THE COMPANY HAS EXPERTISE. INTERNAL FINANCING IS PREDOMINANTLY IN SUPPORT OF GLOBAL SERVICES' LONG-TERM CLIENT SERVICE CONTRACTS. GLOBAL

FINANCING ALSO FACTORS A SELECTED PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRIMARILY FOR CASH MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. ALL INTERNAL FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AT ARM'S-LENGTH RATES AND ARE BASED UPON

MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMMERCIAL FINANCING.

SHORT-TERM INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING TO DEALERS AND REMARKETERS OF IBM AND OEM PRODUCTS.

REMANUFACTURING AND REMARKETING.

USED EQUIPMENT IS RETURNED FROM LEASE TRANSACTIONS, OR MAY BE SURPLUS EQUIPMENT INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY

PURCHASED. THESE ASSETS MAY BE REFURBISHED OR UPGRADED AND SOLD OR LEASED TO NEW OR EXISTING CLIENTS BOTH EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY. EXTERNALLY REMARKETED EQUIPMENT REVENUE REPRESENTS SALES OR LEASES

TO CLIENTS AND RESELLERS. INTERNALLY REMARKETED EQUIPMENT REVENUE PRIMARILY REPRESENTS USED EQUIPMENT THAT IS SOLD INTERNALLY TO SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBAL SERVICES. SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY MAY

ALSO SELL THE EQUIPMENT THAT IT PURCHASES FROM GLOBAL FINANCING TO EXTERNAL CLIENTS.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS

THE FOLLOWING WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS PLAY KEY ROLES IN IBM'S DELIVERY OF VALUE TO ITS

CLIENTS.

COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST TO CAPTURE THE LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITY IN KEY GROWTH MARKETS AROUND THE WORLDCHINA, INDIA AND COUNTRIES WITHIN SOUTHEAST ASIA, EASTERN EUROPE,

THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA. THE COMPANY'S MAJOR MARKETS INCLUDE THE G7 COUNTRIES OF CANADA, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES (U.S.) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK)

PLUS AUSTRIA, THE BAHAMAS, BELGIUM, THE CARIBBEAN REGION, CYPRUS, DENMARK, FINLAND, GREECE, ICELAND, IRELAND, ISRAEL, MALTA, THE NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SPAIN, SWEDEN AND SWITZERLAND.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) OPERATIONS DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPANY FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IBM ANNUALLY INVESTS APPROXIMATELY 6

PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR R&D, FOCUSING ON HIGH-GROWTH, HIGH-VALUE OPPORTUNITIES. IBM RESEARCH WORKS WITH CLIENTS AND THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH GLOBAL LABS ON NEAR-TERM AND MID-TERM

INNOVATIONS. IT CONTRIBUTES MANY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO IBM'S PORTFOLIO EVERY YEAR AND HELPS CLIENTS ADDRESS THEIR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. IBM RESEARCH ALSO EXPLORES THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENCE AND

TECHNOLOGYFROM NANOTECHNOLOGY TO FUTURE SYSTEMS, BIG DATA ANALYTICS, SECURE CLOUDS AND TO IBM WATSON, A "COGNITIVE" LEARNING SYSTEM.

IBM

RESEARCH ALSO FOCUSES ON DIFFERENTIATING IBM'S SERVICES BUSINESSES, PROVIDING NEW CAPABILITIES AND SOLUTIONS. IT HAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT OF ANY PUBLIC COMPANY,

ENABLING IBM TO CREATE UNIQUE ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS AND ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH CLIENTS ON THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGES.

IN

FEBRUARY 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW IBM RESEARCH LAB TO BE LOCATED IN SOUTH AFRICA. THIS WILL BE IBM RESEARCH'S 13TH GLOBAL LAB.

IN

2014, IBM WAS AWARDED MORE U.S. PATENTS THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THE 22ND CONSECUTIVE YEAR. IBM'S 7,534 PATENTS AWARDED IN 2014 REPRESENT A DIVERSE RANGE OF INVENTIONS POISED

TO ENABLE SIGNIFICANT INNOVATIONS THAT WILL POSITION THE COMPANY TO COMPETE AND LEAD IN THE EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES REPRESENTED BY CLOUD, BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS, SECURITY, SOCIAL AND MOBILE. THESE

INVENTIONS ALSO WILL ADVANCE THE NEW ERA OF COGNITIVE SYSTEMS WHERE MACHINES WILL LEARN, REASON AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE IN MORE NATURAL WAYS. IT WAS THE MOST U.S. PATENTS EVER AWARDED TO ONE COMPANY

IN A SINGLE YEAR.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY SEEK INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) PROTECTION FOR ITS INNOVATIONS, WHILE INCREASING EMPHASIS ON OTHER INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE ITS IP LEADERSHIP.

SOME OF IBM'S TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE LICENSED AND MAY BE USED IN IBM PRODUCTS AND/OR THE PRODUCTS OF THE LICENSEE. WHILE THE COMPANY'S

VARIOUS PROPRIETARY IP RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR

LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

IBM HAS AN EXTENSIVE INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES GLOBALLY. IN 2014, THE COMPANY ALSO MANAGED

APPROXIMATELY $21.8 BILLION IN PROCUREMENT SPENDING FOR ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THE GLOBAL PROCESS SERVICES ORGANIZATION. THE SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED IN ONE

OPERATING UNIT THAT HAS OPTIMIZED INVENTORIES OVER TIME. SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES HAS IMPROVED SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. SUPPLY

CHAIN RESILIENCY ENABLES IBM TO REDUCE ITS RISK DURING MARKETPLACE CHANGES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO DERIVE BUSINESS VALUE FROM ITS OWN GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN PROVIDING A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY TO CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS. IBM LEVERAGES

ITS SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERTISE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING SERVICE TO OPTIMIZE AND HELP OPERATE CLIENTS' END-TO-END SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES, FROM PROCUREMENT TO

LOGISTICS.

10

UTILIZING

ANALYTICS, MOBILE, CLOUD AND SOCIALWITH NUMEROUS PROJECTS, HAS ALLOWED THE INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN TO DRIVE POSITIVE BUSINESS OUTCOMES FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS CLIENTS.

SERVICES; CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; THE ABILITY TO DELIVER BUSINESS VALUE TO CLIENTS; AND, SERVICE AND SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP, A CORPORATION MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST, INNOVATE AND

INTEGRATE. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXECUTING A STRATEGY TO TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING SHIFTING TO HIGHER VALUE MARKET SEGMENTS AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASING ITS CAPABILITIES THROUGH ORGANIC

INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. AS THE COMPANY EXECUTES ITS STRATEGY, IT ENTERS NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS CLOUD, BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND "AS-A-SERVICE" SOLUTIONS, WHICH EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO NEW

COMPETITORS. OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS THE LEADER OR AMONG THE LEADERS IN EACH OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

A

SUMMARY OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS INCLUDED BELOW.

BY-LAWS. EACH

13

EXECUTIVE

OFFICER NAMED ABOVE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KENNETH M. KEVERIAN, HAS BEEN AN EXECUTIVE OF IBM OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

MR.

KEVERIAN WAS A SENIOR PARTNER AT THE BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP, A GLOBAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTING FIRM, UNTIL JOINING IBM IN 2014. HE WAS WITH BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP FOR 26 YEARS AND HE

FOCUSED ON SERVING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR IBM'S PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CLIENT BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER AGILITY, PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS

PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES AND OFFERINGS IN BOTH EMERGING AND MORE ESTABLISHED MARKETS. THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES MAY NOT YIELD THEIR INTENDED

GAINS IN SPEED, QUALITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVENESS AND ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE

IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT OR IS UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE SUCH INNOVATIONS, EXPAND AND SCALE THEM WITH SUFFICIENT SPEED, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET

SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE

COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS, ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN ITS

STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. CLIENT ADOPTION RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE LESS CERTAIN IN THE HIGH-VALUE, HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND RAPIDLY-GROWING

SEGMENTS, AND NEW DELIVERY MODELS MAY UNFAVORABLY IMPACT DEMAND AND PROFITABILITY FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, IT

NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL, AND DEVELOP ECOSYSTEMS AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS. IN EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE

PRESENTS POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS FROM EVOLVING GOVERNMENTAL POLICY, INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION AND

CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY

14

COULD

ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS, LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE OWNERSHIP AND PROTECTION OF PATENTS.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS MAY AFFECT

CRITICAL THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR INVOLVE THE STORAGE, PROCESSING AND

TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, INCLUDING VALUABLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. IN THE CURRENT

ENVIRONMENT THERE ARE NUMEROUS AND EVOLVING RISKS TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY, INCLUDING CRIMINAL HACKERS, HACKTIVISTS, STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS, INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE, EMPLOYEE MALFEASANCE, AND

HUMAN OR TECHNOLOGICAL ERROR. COMPUTER HACKERS AND OTHERS ROUTINELY ATTEMPT TO BREACH THE SECURITY OF TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS, AND THOSE OF CUSTOMERS, THIRD-PARTIES CONTRACTORS AND

VENDORS. SUCCESSFUL BREACHES COULD RESULT IN, FOR EXAMPLE, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, DISCLOSURE, MODIFICATION, MISUSE, LOSS, OR DESTRUCTION OF COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY DATA OR SYSTEMS,

THEFT OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS, AND DENIAL OF SERVICE. IN THE EVENT OF SUCH BREACHES, THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS

OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES COULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY, LITIGATION, AND REGULATORY ACTION, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION, AND OTHER

FINANCIAL LOSS. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF RESPONDING TO BREACHES AND IMPLEMENTING REMEDIATION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES AND RESPONDS TO

CYBERSECURITY THREATS, ALTHOUGH NONE HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY TO DATE. AS THESE THREATS DEVELOP AND GROW, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO FIND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT FURTHER

INVESTMENTS TO PROTECT DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AS A GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY EXISTING AND PROPOSED LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES

RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY, PRIVACY, DATA LOCALIZATION AND DATA PROTECTION. ADDITIONALLY, CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS RESULTING IN DISRUPTIONS TO OR FAILURES IN POWER, INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COULD RESULT IN INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS TO COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR SERVICES, FINANCIAL LOSS, POTENTIAL

LIABILITY, AND DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. MOREOVER, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES INVOLVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW

CUSTOMERS, AND NEW MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE NATURE OF ITS CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES; FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

REVIEW BY REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS HAD

LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE

FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER.

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 175 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY'S

OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS,

INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. FURTHER, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE SCOPE OF ITS OFFERINGS, BOTH WITHIN THE U.S. AND

GLOBALLY, IT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR OTHER RISKS. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS,

15

PANDEMIC

OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE OR UNCERTAIN POLITICAL CLIMATES, INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR ANY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES

AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS.

ADVERSE

EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PREMIUMS FOR MANDATORY PENSION INSOLVENCY INSURANCE COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PREMIUM INCREASES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE LEVEL OF INSOLVENCIES OF

UNRELATED COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY AT ISSUE. CURRENTLY, CANADA, GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE UNITED KINGDOM REQUIRE THAT THESE PREMIUMS BE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND NOT OUT OF PLAN ASSETS, WHICH

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. IBM'S 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

PENSION MATTERS.

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

16

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS AND FUTURE EVENTS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY'S MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE M,

"CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE AREAS WHERE THE COMPANY

COMPETES ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED WORKERS LEAVE

THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, AS GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY DEMAND SHIFTS, REALIGNMENT, TRAINING AND SCALING OF SKILLED RESOURCES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY RAPID. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL

RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S

EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, AND

AFTER GLOBALFOUNDRIES COMPLETES THE ACQUISITION OF IBM'S GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SEMICONDUCTOR BUSINESS, IT WILL BECOME IBM'S EXCLUSIVE SERVER PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER FOR CERTAIN SEMICONDUCTORS.

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE FAILURE OF THE

COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES, IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES OR MATERIALS,

OR INADEQUATE SERVICES RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FUNDING APPROVAL.

FUNDING REDUCTIONS OR DELAYS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT PUBLIC SECTOR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, SOME AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE

AND PROVIDING FOR HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COULD BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED AS A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACTOR AND COULD INCUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND

PENALTIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A

SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES AND COSTS FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES

AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS,

INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH INVOLVE THE RISK OF

17

NON-PERFORMANCE

BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS

ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF

THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND

AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS THE COMPANY MOVES INTO NEW AREAS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY

MAY BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND ENABLE APPROPRIATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM WORKING WITH THEM AND COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS

RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY OR THAT STRATEGIC ACQUISITION

OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND

COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY DISPOSES OR ATTEMPTS TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NO LONGER CENTRAL TO ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ANY SUCH DISPOSITION OR ATTEMPTED DISPOSITION IS SUBJECT TO

RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO THE TERMS AND TIMING OF SUCH DISPOSITION, RISKS RELATED TO OBTAINING NECESSARY GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY APPROVALS AND RISKS RELATED TO RETAINED LIABILITIES NOT

SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S CONTROL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RISKS.

AS A COMPANY WITH A SUBSTANTIAL EMPLOYEE POPULATION AND WITH CLIENTS IN MORE THAN 175

COUNTRIES, IBM IS INVOLVED, EITHER AS PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT, IN A VARIETY OF ONGOING CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS, INVESTIGATIONS, TAX MATTERS AND PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT

18

CURRENCIES.

THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE

AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS,

GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS

DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL

BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF

17 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 12 MILLION WAS OWNED

AND 5 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 2 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES. ON OCTOBER 20, 2014, IBM AND

GLOBALFOUNDRIES ANNOUNCED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT IN WHICH GLOBALFOUNDRIES WILL ACQUIRE THE COMPANY'S MICROELECTRONICS BUSINESS, INCLUDING SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN EAST FISHKILL, NEW

YORK AND ESSEX JUNCTION, VERMONT. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN 2015. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 14 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 7 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 3 MILLION WAS OWNED AND

4 MILLION WAS LEASED.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING

OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

THE

MATERIAL FEATURES OF EACH EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN UNDER WHICH EQUITY SECURITIES ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE THAT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PIAN

THE 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "2001 PLAN") HAS BEEN USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE

COMPANY. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED FROM THE STOCKHOLDER-APPROVED 1999 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "1999 PLAN"); THE 1999 PLAN IS ALSO

USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR

23

EXECUTIVES,

OTHERWISE, THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN ARE IDENTICAL TO THE 1999 PLAN, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN (STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNIT AWARDS

AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE AWARDS)

THE

2001 PLAN IS ADMINISTERED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE "COMMITTEE"), AND THAT COMMITTEE MAY DELEGATE TO OFFICERS OF

THE COMPANY CERTAIN OF ITS DUTIES, POWERS AND AUTHORITY. PAYMENT OF AWARDS MAY BE MADE IN THE FORM OF CASH, STOCK OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF AND MAY BE DEFERRED WITH COMMITTEE APPROVAL. AWARDS ARE NOT

TRANSFERABLE OR ASSIGNABLE EXCEPT (I) BY LAW, WILL OR THE LAWS OF DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION,(II) AS A RESULT OF THE DISABILITY OF THE RECIPIENT, OR (III) WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE

COMMITTEE.

IF

THE EMPLOYMENT OF A PARTICIPANT TERMINATES, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF A PARTICIPANT, ALL UNEXERCISED, DEFERRED AND UNPAID AWARDS SHALL BE CANCELED

IMMEDIATELY, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT PROVIDES OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT OR IN THE EVENT A PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE DISABLED AND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE IBM LONG-TERM DISABILITY PLAN (OR ANY SUCCESSOR PLAN OR SIMILAR PLAN OF ANOTHER EMPLOYER), THE PARTICIPANT'S ESTATE, BENEFICIARIES OR REPRESENTATIVE, AS THE CASE MAY BE, SHALL

HAVE THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTICIPANT UNDER THE APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT SPECIFIES OTHERWISE, THE COMMITTEE MAY CANCEL, RESCIND, SUSPEND, WITHHOLD OR

OTHERWISE LIMIT OR RESTRICT ANY UNEXPIRED, UNPAID, OR DEFERRED AWARDS AT ANY TIME IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE AWARDS AGREEMENT AND THE 2001 PLAN. IN

ADDITION, AWARDS MAY BE CANCELLED IF THE PARTICIPANT ENGAGES IN ANY CONDUCT OR ACT DETERMINED TO BE INJURIOUS, DETRIMENTAL OR PREJUDICIAL TO ANY INTEREST OF THE COMPANY.

PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

THE IBM PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "PWCC PLAN") WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS CONSULTING ("PWCC") FROM PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 1, 2002. THE PWCC PLAN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED

SOLELY TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OF PWCC WHO HAVE BECOME EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE FUNDED FROM THE PWCC PLAN.

THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PWCC PLAN ARE SUBSTANTIVELY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN, DESCRIBED ABOVE.

IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN

THE IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN (THE "DCEAP") WAS ADOPTED IN 1993 AND AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2014. UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED DCEAP, NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS RECEIVE PROMISED FEE SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH DEFERRED ANNUAL RETAINER PAYMENTS. EACH PROMISED FEE SHARE IS

EQUAL IN VALUE TO ONE SHARE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. UPON A DIRECTOR'S RETIREMENT OR OTHER COMPLETION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR, AMOUNTS DEFERRED INTO PROMISED FEE SHARES ARE PAYABLE IN EITHER

CASH AND/OR SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK EITHER AS LUMP SUM OR INSTALLMENTS PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTOR'S DISTRIBUTION ELECTION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DCEAP, SEE "2014 DIRECTOR

COMPENSATION NARRATIVE" IN IBM'S DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND DELIVERED TO STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
