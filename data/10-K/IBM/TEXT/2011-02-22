PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS

THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF

NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME, IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER

85 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: THE COMPANY CREATES BUSINESS VALUE FOR CLIENTS AND SOLVES BUSINESS PROBLEMS

THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS THAT LEVERAGE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. IBM SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY CREATE VALUE BY REDUCING A CLIENT'S OPERATIONAL COSTS OR BY ENABLING

NEW CAPABILITIES THAT GENERATE REVENUE. THESE SOLUTIONS DRAW FROM AN INDUSTRY LEADING PORTFOLIO OF CONSULTING, DELIVERY AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES, ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS AND FINANCING.

STRATEGY

DESPITE THE VOLATILITY OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) INDUSTRY OVER THE PAST DECADE, IBM HAS CONSISTENTLY DELIVERED SUPERIOR

PERFORMANCE, WITH A STEADY TRACK RECORD OF SUSTAINED EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH. THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED ITS BUSINESS MIX, EXITING COMMODITIZED SEGMENTS WHILE INCREASING ITS PRESENCE IN HIGHER-VALUE

AREAS SUCH AS SERVICES, SOFTWARE AND INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. AS PART OF THIS SHIFT, THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED OVER 100 COMPANIES THIS PAST DECADE, COMPLEMENTING AND SCALING ITS PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND

OFFERINGS.

IBM'S

CLEAR STRATEGY HAS ENABLED STEADY RESULTS IN CORE BUSINESS AREAS, WHILE EXPANDING ITS OFFERINGS AND ADDRESSABLE MARKETS. THE KEY TENETS OF THIS STRATEGY

ARE.



DELIVER VALUE TO ENTERPRISE CLIENTS THROUGH INTEGRATED BUSINESS AND IT INNOVATION;



SHIFT THE BUSINESS MIX TO HIGHER-VALUE AREAS; AND



BECOME THE PREMIER GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE

THESE

PRIORITIES REFLECT A BROAD SHIFT IN CLIENT SPENDING AWAY FROM "POINT PRODUCTS" AND TOWARD INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS, AS COMPANIES SEEK HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS VALUE FROM THEIR IT

INVESTMENTS. IBM HAS BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER THIS ENHANCED CLIENT VALUE THANKS TO ITS INDUSTRY EXPERTISE, UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENTS' BUSINESSES AND THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THE COMPANY'S CAPABILITIES.

CONSISTENT

WITH THIS STRATEGY IBM IS LEVERAGING ITS CAPABILITIES TO BUILD AND EXPAND STRONG POSITIONS IN TARGETED GROWTH AREAS. IBM'S GROWTH INITIATIVES INCLUDE SMARTER PLANET, GROWTH

MARKETS, BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND OPTIMIZATION, AND CLOUD COMPUTING. EACH INITIATIVE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITY WITH ATTRACTIVE PROFIT MARGINS FOR IBM.

SMARTER PLANET

SMARTER PLANET IS AN OVERARCHING STRATEGY THAT HIGHLIGHTS IBM'S DIFFERENTIATED CAPABILITIES AND GENERATES BROAD-BASED DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SMARTER PLANET ENCAPSULATES IBM'S VIEW OF ENTERPRISE IT'S NEXT MAJOR REVOLUTION: THE INSTRUMENTATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE WORLD'S PROCESSES AND

INFRASTRUCTURESFROM ENERGY GRIDS AND PIPELINES TO SUPPLY CHAINS AND TRAFFIC SYSTEMS. THE AMOUNT OF DATA THESE SYSTEMS CAN GENERATE CAN NOW BE CAPTURED AND ANALYZED. THIS INFUSION OF

INTELLIGENCE ENABLES MORE EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY AND RESPONSIVENESS.

CLIENTS

SEEKING THESE "SMART" SOLUTIONS VALUE IBM'S DEEP INDUSTRY AND PROCESS EXPERTISE, POWERFUL BACK-END SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS, COMPLEX SYSTEMS INTEGRATION CAPABILITY

AND UNIQUE RESEARCH CAPACITY. IBM HAS BUILT A SERIES OF HORIZONTAL SOLUTIONS THROUGH ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING SMARTER COMMERCE AND SMARTER PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

IBM'S INDUSTRY FRAMEWORKS PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING, ACQUIRING AND DEPLOYING THESE SMART INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS. EACH FRAMEWORK SUPPORTS MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS, ENABLING FAST,

EFFICIENT AND TAILORED

1

CAPABILITIES

IN SUPPORT OF CLIENTS' BUSINESS NEEDS. THESE FRAMEWORKS REPRESENT A PROVEN TECHNIQUE FOR THE COMPANY TO ENGAGE WITH ITS CLIENTS, DRIVING SUSTAINED GROWTH AND HIGH BUSINESS VALUE IN

SUPPORT OF OUR SMARTER PLANET STRATEGY.

GROWTH MARKETS

THE COMPANY HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN GROWTH MARKETS. THE FOCUS NOW IS ON GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION

OF IBM'S PRESENCE; ON SPECIFIC INDUSTRY VERTICALS OF THE HIGHEST IMPACT AND OPPORTUNITY; ON COUNTRIES' BUILD-OUT OF INFRASTRUCTURE ALIGNED WITH THEIR NATIONAL AGENDAS; AND ON CREATING

MARKETS AND NEW BUSINESS MODELS TO SERVE THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAT EXIST IN THESE EMERGING COUNTRIES.

IN

ORDER TO SUPPORT THIS GROWTH, IBM IS CONTINUING TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE MARKETS TO EXPAND CAPACITY AND DEVELOP TALENT. AT THE SAME TIME, IBM IS EXPANDING AND BENEFITING FROM

LARGE TEAMS OF TALENT WITH GLOBAL MISSIONS OF DELIVERY. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEEPEN ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) TEAMS TO DESIGN FOR THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND RAPID GROWTH FACING THESE

MARKETS.

BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND OPTIMIZATION

BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF ANALYTICS ACROSS THE BUSINESS HAS EMERGED AS ANOTHER MAJOR CATEGORY OF BUSINESS VALUE.

IT SUCCEEDS EARLIER GENERATIONS OF BACK-OFFICE AUTOMATION, BASIC ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING AND TRADITIONAL BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE. BUSINESS ANALYTICS ALLOWS CLIENTS TO SEE PATTERNS IN

DATA THEY COULD NOT SEE BEFORE, UNDERSTAND THEIR EXPOSURE TO RISK, AND PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF BUSINESS DECISIONS WITH GREATER CERTAINTY.

IBM'S

APPROACH IS END-TO-END, PROVIDING CROSS-ENTERPRISE AS WELL AS INDUSTRY-BASED ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS. IBM HAS ESTABLISHED THE BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND

OPTIMIZATION PRACTICE, LEVERAGING IBM CONSULTING CAPABILITIES AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH SYSTEMS AND RESEARCH ASSETS. IBM'S BREADTH OF EXPERTISE UNIQUELY POSITIONS THE COMPANY FOR REVENUE AND

PROFIT GROWTH.

CLOUD COMPUTING

CLOUD IS A NEW MODEL FOR CONSUMING AND DELIVERING IT AND BUSINESS SERVICES. IT CAN DELIVER SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE, HIGHER

QUALITIES OF SERVICE AND A NEW PLATFORM FOR BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION. THE POWER OF THE MODEL COMES FROM HARNESSING VAST STORES OF UNDER-UTILIZED TECHNOLOGY WITH HIGHLY EFFICIENT VIRTUALIZATION AND

MANAGEMENT, CONSUMER-STYLE USER INTERFACES AND THE UBIQUITOUS BROADBAND.

IBM

HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS ADOPT ASPECTS OF CLOUD COMPUTING. IBM IS HELPING THEM BUILD THEIR OWN CLOUD-BASED INFRASTRUCTURES, PROVIDE SECURITY AND INTEGRATION SERVICES OR

OFFERING INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUSINESS SERVICES FROM THE IBM CLOUD, INCLUDING ADVANCED ANALYTICS, COLLABORATION, AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING VIRTUAL SERVERS AND STORAGE OR ACCESS TO TOOLS FOR

TESTING SOFTWARE. IBM BRINGS EXPERT CONSULTING, BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGIES, AND A PORTFOLIO OF CLOUD SERVICES SQUARELY FOCUSED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE. IBM HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED THE CLOUD

MODEL WITHIN IBM IN AREAS AS DIVERSE AS SALES ANALYTICS AND RESEARCH COLLABORATION.

BUSINESS MODEL

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS MODEL IS BUILT TO SUPPORT TWO PRINCIPAL GOALS: HELPING CLIENTS SUCCEED IN DELIVERING BUSINESS VALUE BY BECOMING

MORE INNOVATIVE, EFFICIENT AND COMPETITIVE THROUGH THE USE OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND IT SOLUTIONS; AND PROVIDING

LONG-TERM VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME THROUGH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE THE BEST LONG-TERM

GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY PROSPECTS BASED ON THE VALUE THEY DELIVER TO CLIENTS.

THE

COMPANY'S GLOBAL CAPABILITIES INCLUDE SERVICES, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH AND RELATED FINANCING. THE BROAD MIX OF BUSINESSES AND CAPABILITIES ARE COMBINED TO PROVIDE

BUSINESS INSIGHT AND SOLUTIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS.

2

THE

BUSINESS MODEL IS RESILIENT, ADAPTING TO THE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING MARKET AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DIVEST COMMODITIZING BUSINESSES AND STRENGTHEN ITS

POSITION THROUGH STRATEGIC ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN HIGHER-VALUE SEGMENTS LIKE BUSINESS ANALYTICS, SMARTER PLANET AND CLOUD COMPUTING. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS TRANSFORMED ITSELF

INTO A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE WHICH HAS IMPROVED OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY AND IS DRIVING INVESTMENT AND EXPANDING PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING MARKETS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS

A HIGHER PERFORMING ENTERPRISE TODAY THAN IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

THIS

BUSINESS MODEL, SUPPORTED BY THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL MODEL, HAS ENABLED THE COMPANY TO DELIVER CONSISTENTLY STRONG EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND RETURNS TO

SHAREHOLDERS IN CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS.

AND LOCAL BUSINESS PARTNER RESOURCES.

THROUGH

ITS GROWTH MARKETS ORGANIZATION, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS FOCUS ON THE EMERGING MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE MARKET GROWTH RATES GREATER THAN THE GLOBAL

AVERAGECOUNTRIES WITHIN SOUTHEAST ASIA, EASTERN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND LATIN AMERICA. THE COMPANY'S MAJOR MARKETS INCLUDE THE UNITED STATES (U.S.), CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.),

FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, JAPAN, DENMARK, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, FINLAND, GREECE, ICELAND, IRELAND, MALTA, THE NETHERLANDS, PORTUGAL, CYPRUS, NORWAY, ISRAEL, SPAIN, THE BAHAMAS AND THE

CARIBBEAN REGION.

THE

MAJORITY OF IBM'S REVENUE, EXCLUDING THE COMPANY'S ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS, OCCURS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE BROADLY GROUPED INTO SIX

SECTORS.



FINANCIAL SERVICES: BANKING, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE



PUBLIC: EDUCATION, GOVERNMENT, HEALTHCARE, LIFE SCIENCES



INDUSTRIAL: AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE, AUTOMOTIVE, CHEMICAL AND PETROLEUM, ELECTRONICS



DISTRIBUTION: CONSUMER PRODUCTS, RETAIL, TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION



COMMUNICATIONS: TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT, ENERGY AND UTILITIES



GENERAL BUSINESS: MAINLY COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN 1,000 EMPLOYEES

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM'S R&D OPERATIONS DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPANY FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IBM ANNUALLY INVESTS APPROXIMATELY $6 BILLION FOR R&D,

FOCUSING ON HIGH-GROWTH, HIGH-VALUE OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY HAS REBALANCED ITS INTERNAL R&D. TODAY, IBM'S PORTFOLIO IS BUILT AROUND NETWORKED, MODULARIZED AND EMBEDDED

TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS. IN 2010, THE COMPANY WAS ONCE

6

AGAIN

AWARDED MORE U.S. PATENTS THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY, THE 18TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR IBM HAS BEEN THE PATENT LEADER. IBM'S 5,896 PATENTS IN 2010 WERE THE MOST U.S. PATENTS EVER AWARDED TO ONE

COMPANY IN

A SINGLE YEAR. OVER 70 PERCENT OF THE PATENTS ISSUED IN 2010 WERE FOR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. THE COMPANY'S R&D EFFORTS CONTINUE TO PUSH THE FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYFROM

ANALYTICS, TO CLOUD, TO A COMPUTER NAMED WATSON THAT APPLIED ADVANCED ANALYTICS TO DEFEAT THE ALL-TIME CHAMPIONS ON THE TELEVISION QUIZ SHOW, JEOPARDY.

IN

ADDITION TO PRODUCING WORLD-CLASS SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, IBM INNOVATIONS ARE ALSO A MAJOR DIFFERENTIATOR IN PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS THROUGH

ITS SERVICES BUSINESSES. AS AN EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH UNIT HAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT OF ANY PUBLIC COMPANY. THIS UNIT IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH MOST OF THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS ANALYTICS CLIENT ENGAGEMENTS.

THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY SEEK INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR ITS INNOVATIONS, WHILE INCREASING EMPHASIS ON OTHER INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LEADERSHIP. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN R&D ALSO RESULT IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION ANNUALLY. SOME OF IBM'S TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED

EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE LICENSED AND MAY BE USED IN EITHER/BOTH IBM PRODUCTS AND/OR THE PRODUCTS OF THE LICENSEE. WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR

IS LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS. LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED BY IBM HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING GRANTED TO OTHERS UNDER REASONABLE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS.

ENTERPRISE TRANSFORMATION

A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON BECOMING THE PREMIER GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE. IN THE EARLY PART OF

THE DECADE, THE COMPANY DROVE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CONSISTENT SET OF PROCESSES AND STANDARDS WORLDWIDE TO REDUCE INEFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE COLLABORATION. WITH ITS PROCESSES FULLY INTEGRATED, THE

COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW OPERATING MODEL WITH WORK SHARED IN GLOBAL RESOURCE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE LOCATED WHERE IT MADE THE MOST BUSINESS SENSE. SINCE 2005, GLOBAL INTEGRATION HAS ENABLED THE

COMPANY TO REDUCE SPENDING BY OVER $5 BILLION AND IMPROVE SERVICE QUALITY, SPEED AND RISK MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED RESOURCES TOWARD BUILDING CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND EMPLOYEES

SKILLS, WHILE POSITIONING THE COMPANY FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. DURING THIS PERIOD, IBM HAS PIONEERED THIS NEW OPERATING MODEL, CHANGING FROM A CLASSIC "MULTINATIONAL", WITH SMALLER VERSIONS OF

THE PARENT COMPANY REPLICATED IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, TO A GLOBAL MODEL WITH ONE SET OF PROCESSES, SHARED SERVICES AND BROADLY DISTRIBUTED DECISION MAKING.

THE

COMPANY IS NOW EMBARKING ON THE NEXT GENERATION OF ITS TRANSFORMATION IN WHICH NEW CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES LIKE BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND CLOUD COMPUTING WILL DRIVE PERFORMANCE.

THE PROVEN PRINCIPLES OF THE GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL OF THE COMPANY'S SPENDING TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTIVITY BENEFITS IN SHARED SERVICES, INTEGRATED

OPERATIONS AND END-TO-END PROCESS TRANSFORMATION.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S WORK WITH CLIENTS TO TRANSFORM THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO GLOBAL

MARKET CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DERIVE BUSINESS VALUE FROM ITS OWN GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, THEREBY PROVIDING A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY TO CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS.

IBM LEVERAGES ITS SUPPLY-CHAIN EXPERTISE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SUPPLY-CHAIN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING SERVICE TO OPTIMIZE AND HELP OPERATE CLIENTS' END-TO-END

SUPPLY-CHAIN PROCESSES, FROM PROCUREMENT TO LOGISTICS.

7

IBM SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $35 BILLION ANNUALLY THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES GLOBALLY. THE SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS AND CUSTOMER FULFILLMENT

OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED IN ONE OPERATING UNIT THAT HAS OPTIMIZED INVENTORIES OVER TIME, IMPROVED RESPONSE TO MARKETPLACE OPPORTUNITIES AND EXTERNAL RISKS AND CONVERTED FIXED COSTS TO VARIABLE COSTS.

SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES HAS IMPROVED OPERATIONS, SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROCESSES.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY-INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, DOING BUSINESS IN MORE THAN 170 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, WHERE ITS COMPETITORS VARY BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT, AND RANGE FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES TO SMALLER, MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED ENTITIES. OVERALL, ACROSS ITS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES HUNDREDS OF COMPETITORS WORLDWIDE.

THE

MARKETS FOR EACH OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION AMONG ALL TYPES OF COMPETITORS. ACROSS ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL METHODS OF

COMPETITION ARE: TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; PRICE; QUALITY; BRAND; ITS BROAD RANGE OF CAPABILITIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; THE ABILITY TO DELIVER BUSINESS VALUE TO

CLIENTS; AND, SERVICE AND SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP, A CORPORATION MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST, INNOVATE AND INTEGRATE. OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXECUTING A STRATEGY TO

TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING SHIFTING TO HIGHER VALUE MARKET SEGMENTS AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASING ITS CAPABILITIES THROUGH ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. AS THE COMPANY EXECUTES

ITS STRATEGY, IT ENTERS NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS SMARTER PLANET AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS, WHICH EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO NEW COMPETITORS. OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS THE LEADER OR AMONG THE LEADERS IN EACH OF ITS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

A

SUMMARY OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS INCLUDED BELOW.

GLOBAL SERVICES.

THE SERVICES SEGMENTS, GTS AND GBS, OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CONTINUALLY EVOLVING GLOBAL MARKET. GTS COMPETES IN STRATEGIC

OUTSOURCING, BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING, CLOUD SERVICES, AND A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNICAL AND IT SUPPORT SERVICES. GBS COMPETES IN CONSULTING, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND APPLICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS INCLUDE: TECHNICAL SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES, INNOVATIVE SERVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE, VALUE AND SPEED,

PRICE, CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, QUALITY OF SALES AND DELIVERY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE SERVICES BUSINESS INCLUDE ITS GLOBAL

REACH AND SCALE, GLOBAL DELIVERY MODEL, BEST-OF-BREED PROCESS AND INDUSTRY SKILLS, EXTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY EXPERTISE, SERVICES ASSETS, AN ABILITY TO DELIVER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS

THAT CAN ADDRESS CLIENTS' NEEDS IN ANY ENVIRONMENT AND A STRONG SET OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS AND STRATEGIC BUSINESS PARTNERS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BROAD BASED COMPETITORS

INCLUDING: ACCENTURE, COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION, FUJITSU AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (HP); INDIA-BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDING HCL, INFOSYS, TATA CONSULTING SERVICES, COGNIZANT AND WIPRO

TECHNOLOGIES; THE CONSULTING PRACTICES OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS INCLUDING DELOITTE CONSULTING; AND MANY COMPANIES THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON LOCAL MARKETS OR NICHE SERVICE AREAS.

SOFTWARE.

THE ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE.

FUNCTIONALITY, EASE OF USE, SCALABILITY, COMPLIANCE WITH OPEN STANDARDS AND TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. THE COMPANY'S LEADERSHIP IN THESE AREAS PROVIDES IT WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. THE COMPANY'S

SOFTWARE BUSINESS INCLUDES MIDDLEWARE, OPERATING SYSTEMS AND RELATED SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO ALL INDUSTRY SEGMENTS WORLDWIDE. THE MIDDLEWARE PORTFOLIO IS THE BROADEST IN THE INDUSTRY AND IT ALSO COVERS

BOTH MAINFRAME AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, COUPLED WITH ITS GLOBAL SALES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE DIFFERENTIATE THE

COMPANY'S SOFTWARE BUSINESS FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH

8

AND

DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PATENT PORTFOLIO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SEGMENT'S LEADERSHIP. THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS IN THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE CA, INC., MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND ORACLE CORPORATION (ORACLE). IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH SMALLER, NICHE COMPETITORS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC OR PRODUCT MARKETS WORLDWIDE.

SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY.

THE ENTERPRISE SERVER AND STORAGE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY ONGOING TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, WITH COMPETITION

FOCUSED ON VALUE, FUNCTION AND RELIABILITY, AND NEW ENTRANTS LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO COMPETE AGAINST TRADITIONAL OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE DELL, INC. (DELL), EMC

CORPORATION, HP AND ORACLE. THE COMPANY'S LEADERSHIP IN VIRTUALIZATION, POWER MANAGEMENT, SECURITY, MULTI-OPERATING SYSTEM CAPABILITIES AND THE ABILITY OF ITS SYSTEMS PLATFORMS TO LEVERAGE THE ENTIRE

SYSTEM, FROM THE COMPANY'S CUSTOM SEMICONDUCTORS THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STACK TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND LOWER COST, PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THIS SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PATENT PORTFOLIO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THIS SEGMENT'S LEADERSHIP.

GLOBAL FINANCING.

THE GLOBAL FINANCING BUSINESS PROVIDES CLIENT FINANCING, COMMERCIAL FINANCING AND PARTICIPATES IN THE REMARKETING OF USED EQUIPMENT. IN

2008 AND 2009, THE ECONOMIC CRISIS DROVE AN INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS WHICH STABILIZED IN 2010. HOWEVER, GOING FORWARD THE SUPPLY OF CREDIT MAY TIGHTEN AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY CONTINUE TO FACE

INCREASES IN LOAN LOSSES, HIGHER BORROWING COSTS AND LIQUIDITY CHALLENGES. GLOBAL FINANCING'S ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE INCREASED EXPOSURES PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR THE

COMPANY. THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE PRICE, IT PRODUCT EXPERTISE, CLIENT SERVICE, CONTRACT FLEXIBILITY, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS AND RESIDUAL VALUES. IN CLIENT AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING, GLOBAL

FINANCING COMPETES WITH THREE TYPES OF COMPANIES IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES TO IT CUSTOMERS: OTHER CAPTIVE FINANCING ENTITIES OF COMPANIES SUCH AS HP AND CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.,

NON-CAPTIVE FINANCING ENTITIES OF COMPANIES SUCH AS GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND BANKS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN REMARKETING, THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL BROKERS PLUS

ORIGINAL MANUFACTURERS IN THE FRAGMENTED WORLDWIDE USED IT EQUIPMENT MARKET.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE IT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS,

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CORPORATE BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND

FUNCTIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES AND OFFERINGS IN BOTH EMERGING AND MORE ESTABLISHED MARKETS. THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES MAY NOT YIELD THEIR INTENDED GAINS IN QUALITY,

PRODUCTIVITY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVENESS AND ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM

COMMODITIZED CATEGORIES OF THE IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS

CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION,

IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED

FOR ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING HIGHER-VALUE SEGMENTS OF ENTERPRISE COMPUTING AND DOZENS OF EMERGING COUNTRIES TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. CLIENT ADOPTION RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS

ARE UNCERTAIN IN THE HIGH-VALUE AND RAPIDLY-GROWING SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, IT NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX

OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED

PERSONNEL. IN EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE PRESENTS POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS FROM INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS

PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION AND CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE.

BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS MAY AFFECT CRITICAL THIRD

PARTY OPERATIONS OR INVOLVE THE STORAGE, PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS.

BREACHES IN SECURITY COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS TO RISKS OF LOSS, INCLUDING THE MISUSE OF INFORMATION OR SYSTEMS, RESULTING IN LITIGATION AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE

COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY'S BRAND AND REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPLEMENTING FURTHER DATA

PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

11

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE NATURE OF ITS CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES; FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

REVIEW BY REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS HAD

LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE

FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER.

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 170 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING

RECESSIONS, INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS, PANDEMIC OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL

HEALTH ISSUE, OR ANY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE

COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES

FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION

PLANS.

ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE

ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY

COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND

12

FINANCIAL

RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PREMIUMS FOR MANDATORY PENSION INSOLVENCY INSURANCE COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE U.S. PREMIUM INCREASES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE LEVEL OF INSOLVENCIES OF

UNRELATED COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY AT ISSUE. CURRENTLY, CANADA, GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE UNITED KINGDOM REQUIRE THAT THESE PREMIUMS BE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND NOT OUT OF PLAN ASSETS,

WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. IBM'S 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING PENSION MATTERS.

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS AND FUTURE EVENTS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY'S MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE O,

"CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE

IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED WORKERS LEAVE THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, AS GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY DEMAND SHIFTS, REALIGNMENT, TRAINING AND SCALING OF SKILLED RESOURCES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY RAPID. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A

TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY

AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. CHANGES

IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO

DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES

OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES, RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FUNDING APPROVAL.

ALSO, SOME AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE AND PROVIDING FOR HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. IN

13

ADDITION,

THE COMPANY COULD BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED AS A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACTOR AND COULD INCUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A

SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES AND COSTS FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S.

CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE

THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; DERIVATIVES INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS

ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF

THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS

ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS THE COMPANY MOVES INTO NEW AREAS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE

UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND ENABLE APPROPRIATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH OBJECTIVES.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS

RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY

FAILING TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

RELATED TO LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF

INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A.

14

ENTITLED

"RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF

19 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 16 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 3 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 3 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS

BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 7 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 5 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 2 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 3 MILLION WAS

LEASED.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING

OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

ON

THE

MATERIAL FEATURES OF EACH EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN UNDER WHICH EQUITY SECURITIES ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE THAT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

THE 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "2001 PLAN") HAS BEEN USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR

EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY

19

HAVE

BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED FROM THE STOCKHOLDER-APPROVED 1999 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "1999 PLAN"); THE 1999 PLAN IS ALSO USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN

SENIOR EXECUTIVES. OTHERWISE, THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN ARE IDENTICAL TO THE 1999 PLAN, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN (STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNIT

AWARDS AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE AWARDS).

THE

2001 PLAN IS ADMINISTERED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THAT COMMITTEE MAY DELEGATE TO OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY

CERTAIN OF ITS DUTIES, POWERS AND AUTHORITY. PAYMENT OF AWARDS MAY BE MADE IN THE FORM OF CASH, STOCK OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF AND MAY BE DEFERRED WITH COMMITTEE APPROVAL. AWARDS ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE

OR ASSIGNABLE EXCEPT (I) BY LAW, WILL OR THE LAWS OF DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION, (II) AS A RESULT OF THE DISABILITY OF THE RECIPIENT, OR (III) WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE COMMITTEE.

IF

THE EMPLOYMENT OF A PARTICIPANT TERMINATES, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF A PARTICIPANT, ALL UNEXERCISED, DEFERRED AND UNPAID AWARDS SHALL BE CANCELED

IMMEDIATELY, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT PROVIDES OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT OR IN THE EVENT A PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE DISABLED AND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE IBM LONG-TERM DISABILITY PLAN (OR ANY SUCCESSOR PLAN OR SIMILAR PLAN OF ANOTHER EMPLOYER), THE PARTICIPANT'S ESTATE, BENEFICIARIES OR REPRESENTATIVE, AS THE CASE MAY

BE, SHALL HAVE THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTICIPANT UNDER THE APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT SPECIFIES OTHERWISE, THE COMMITTEE MAY CANCEL, RESCIND, SUSPEND,

WITHHOLD OR OTHERWISE LIMIT OR RESTRICT ANY UNEXPIRED, UNPAID, OR DEFERRED AWARDS AT ANY TIME IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE AWARD AGREEMENT AND THE

PLAN. IN ADDITION, AWARDS MAY BE CANCELLED IF THE PARTICIPANT ENGAGES IN ANY CONDUCT OR ACT DETERMINED TO BE INJURIOUS, DETRIMENTAL OR PREJUDICIAL TO ANY INTEREST OF THE COMPANY.

PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

THE IBM PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "PWCC PLAN") WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION

WITH THE COMPANY'S

ACQUISITION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS CONSULTING ("PWCC") FROM PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 1, 2002. THE PWCC PLAN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED SOLELY TO

FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OF PWCC WHO HAVE COME OVER TO THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE FUNDED FROM THE PWCC PLAN. THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS OF THE PWCC PLAN ARE SUBSTANTIVELY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN, DESCRIBED ABOVE.

IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN

THE IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN (THE "DCEAP") WAS ADOPTED IN 1993. UNDER THE DCEAP, NON-MANAGEMENT

DIRECTORS RECEIVE PROMISED FEE SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH DEFERRED ANNUAL RETAINER PAYMENTS. EACH PROMISED FEE SHARE IS EQUAL IN VALUE TO ONE SHARE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. UPON A DIRECTOR'S

RETIREMENT OR OTHER COMPLETION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR, ALL AMOUNTS DEFERRED INTO PROMISED FEE SHARES ARE PAYABLE IN EITHER CASH AND/OR SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT THE DIRECTOR'S ELECTION. (FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DCEAP, SEE "GENERAL INFORMATION2010 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION NARRATIVE" IN IBM'S DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
