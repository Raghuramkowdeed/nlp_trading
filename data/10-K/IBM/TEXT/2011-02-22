part i
item 1. business:
international business machines corporation (ibm or the company) was incorporated in the state of new york on june16, 1911, as
the computing-tabulating-recording co. (c-t-r), a consolidation of the computing scale co. of america, the tabulating machine co. and the international time recording co. of
new york. since that time, ibm has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. this was signaled over
85 years ago, in 1924, when c-t-r changed its name to international business machines corporation. and it continues today: the company creates business value for clients and solves business problems
through integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. ibm solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling
new capabilities that generate revenue. these solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing.
strategy
despite the volatility of the information technology (it) industry over the past decade, ibm has consistently delivered superior
performance, with a steady track record of sustained earnings per share growth. the company has shifted its business mix, exiting commoditized segments while increasing its presence in higher-value
areas such as services, software and integrated solutions. as part of this shift, the company has acquired over 100 companies this past decade, complementing and scaling its portfolio of products and
offerings.
ibm's
clear strategy has enabled steady results in core business areas, while expanding its offerings and addressable markets. the key tenets of this strategy
are:
deliver value to enterprise clients through integrated business and it innovation;
shift the business mix to higher-value areas; and
become the premier globally integrated enterprise
these
priorities reflect a broad shift in client spending away from "point products" and toward integrated solutions, as companies seek higher levels of business value from their it
investments. ibm has been able to deliver this enhanced client value thanks to its industry expertise, understanding of clients' businesses and the breadth and depth of the company's capabilities.
consistent
with this strategy ibm is leveraging its capabilities to build and expand strong positions in targeted growth areas. ibm's growth initiatives include smarter planet, growth
markets, business analytics and optimization, and cloud computing. each initiative represents a significant growth opportunity with attractive profit margins for ibm.
smarter planet
smarter planet is an overarching strategy that highlights ibm's differentiated capabilities and generates broad-based demand for the
company's products and services. smarter planet encapsulates ibm's view of enterprise it's next major revolution: the instrumentation and integration of the world's processes and
infrastructuresfrom energy grids and pipelines to supply chains and traffic systems. the amount of data these systems can generate can now be captured and analyzed. this infusion of
intelligence enables more efficiency, productivity and responsiveness.
clients
seeking these "smart" solutions value ibm's deep industry and process expertise, powerful back-end systems and data analytics, complex systems integration capability
and unique research capacity. ibm has built a series of horizontal solutions through organic development and strategic acquisitions including smarter commerce and smarter physical infrastructure.
ibm's industry frameworks provide a flexible software foundation for developing, acquiring and deploying these smart industry solutions. each framework supports multiple solutions, enabling fast,
efficient and tailored
capabilities
in support of clients' business needs. these frameworks represent a proven technique for the company to engage with its clients, driving sustained growth and high business value in
support of our smarter planet strategy.
growth markets
the company has benefited from its investments over the past several years in growth markets. the focus now is on geographic expansion
of ibm's presence; on specific industry verticals of the highest impact and opportunity; on countries' build-out of infrastructure aligned with their national agendas; and on creating
markets and new business models to serve the different requirements that exist in these emerging countries.
in
order to support this growth, ibm is continuing to invest significantly in these markets to expand capacity and develop talent. at the same time, ibm is expanding and benefiting from
large teams of talent with global missions of delivery. the company continues to deepen its research and development (r&d) teams to design for the unique challenges and rapid growth facing these
markets.
business analytics and optimization
business optimization through the application of analytics across the business has emerged as another major category of business value.
it succeeds earlier generations of back-office automation, basic enterprise resource planning and traditional business intelligence. business analytics allows clients to see patterns in
data they could not see before, understand their exposure to risk, and predict the outcomes of business decisions with greater certainty.
ibm's
approach is end-to-end, providing cross-enterprise as well as industry-based analytics solutions. ibm has established the business analytics and
optimization practice, leveraging ibm consulting capabilities and software products, along with systems and research assets. ibm's breadth of expertise uniquely positions the company for revenue and
profit growth.
cloud computing
cloud is a new model for consuming and delivering it and business services. it can deliver significant economies of scale, higher
qualities of service and a new platform for business model innovation. the power of the model comes from harnessing vast stores of under-utilized technology with highly efficient virtualization and
management, consumer-style user interfaces and the ubiquitous broadband.
ibm
has helped thousands of clients adopt aspects of cloud computing. ibm is helping them build their own cloud-based infrastructures, provide security and integration services or
offering infrastructure and business services from the ibm cloud, including advanced analytics, collaboration, and it infrastructure including virtual servers and storage or access to tools for
testing software. ibm brings expert consulting, breakthrough technologies, and a portfolio of cloud services squarely focused on the requirements of the enterprise. ibm has also implemented the cloud
model within ibm in areas as diverse as sales analytics and research collaboration.
business model
the company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients succeed in delivering business value by becoming
more innovative, efficient and competitive through the use of business insight and it solutions; and providing
long-term value to shareholders. the business model has been developed over time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have the best long-term
growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients.
the
company's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. the broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide
business insight and solutions for the company's clients.
the
business model is resilient, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. the company continues to divest commoditizing businesses and strengthen its
position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value segments like business analytics, smarter planet and cloud computing. in addition, the company has transformed itself
into a globally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and expanding participation in the world's fastest growing markets. as a result, the company is
a higher performing enterprise today than it was several years ago.
this
business model, supported by the company's long-term financial model, has enabled the company to deliver consistently strong earnings, cash flows and returns to
shareholders in changing economic environments.
business segments and capabilities
the company's major operations consists of five business segments: global technology services, global business services, software,
systems and technology and global financing.
global services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing it infrastructure and business insight and solutions to
clients. while solutions often include industry-leading ibm software and systems, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. approximately 60percent of external
global services segment revenue is annuity-based, coming primarily from outsourcing, maintenance and custom application management services arrangements. the global services backlog provides a solid
revenue base entering each year. within global services, there are two reportable segments: global technology services and global business services.
global technology services (gts) primarily provides it infrastructure services and business process services, delivering business value
through the company's global scale, standardization and automation.
gts
capabilities
strategic outsourcing services. comprehensive it outsourcing services dedicated to transforming clients'
existing infrastructures to ensure better quality, flexibility, risk management and financial value. ibm integrates long-standing experience in service management, technology and industry
applications with new technologies, such as cloud computing and virtualization, to help clients maximize the application of technology to achieve their business objectives.
global process services. a range of offerings from standardized processing platforms and business process outsourcing through
transformational offerings that deliver improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications and infrastructure
(previously known as business transformation outsourcing).
integrated technology services. project-based portfolio of services that enable clients to optimize their it environments by driving
efficiency, flexibility and productivity, while reducing costs. the standardized portfolio is built around key assets and patented software, and incorporates best practices and proven methodologies
that ensure predictive quality of delivery, security and compliance.
maintenance. a complete line of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain and improve the
availability of clients' it infrastructures.
gts services delivery. responsible for the worldwide delivery of ibm's technology- and process-based services. in support of
technology-based services, gts services delivery manages the world's largest privately owned it infrastructure with employees in over 40 countries, supporting approximately 430 data centers. operating
in a globally integrated delivery model enables regional client-facing teams to utilize a global network of competencies and centers. each competency provides industry-leading, standardized,
integrated tools and processes. by leveraging insights and experience drawn from ibm's global scale, skills and technology, with applied innovation from ibm research, clients gain access to
leading-edge, high-quality services with improved productivity, flexibility and cost.
gts
services delivery also provides efficient, world-class delivery capabilities in support of ibm's process-based services, which include business transformation outsourcing, business
process outsourcing and business process services. these delivery capabilities are available to clients through highly skilled employees and delivery centers in over 40 countries worldwide.
global business services (gbs) primarily provides professional services and application management services, delivering business value and
innovation to clients through solutions which leverage industry and business-process expertise while integrating the industry-leading portfolio of ibm and strategic partners, to define the upper end
of client-valued services.
gbs
capabilities
consulting and systems integration. delivery of value to clients through consulting services for strategy and
transformation; application innovation services; enterprise applications (sap and oracle) and business analytics and optimization.
application management services. application development, management, maintenance and support services for packaged software, as well as
custom and legacy applications. value is delivered through advanced capabilities in areas such as applications testing and modernization, cloud application security, the company's highly
differentiated globally integrated capability model, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application development.
software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,
processes and applications across a standard software platform. ibm middleware is designed on open standards, making it easier to integrate disparate business applications, developed by different
methods and implemented at different times. operating systems are the software engines that run computers. approximately two-thirds of external software segment revenue is annuity-based,
coming from recurring license charges and ongoing subscription and support. the remaining one-third relates to one-time charge (otc) arrangements in which clients pay one,
up-front payment for a perpetual license. typically, the sale of otc software includes one year of subscription and support. clients can also purchase ongoing subscription and support
after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support.
software
capabilities
websphere software. delivers capabilities that enable clients to integrate and manage business processes across
their organizations with the flexibility and agility they need to respond to changing conditions quickly. with a services-oriented architecture (soa), businesses can more easily link together their
fragmented data and business processes to extract value from their existing technology.
information management software. enables clients to integrate, manage and use their information to gain business value and improve their
outcomes. solutions include advanced database management, enterprise content management, information integration, data warehousing, business analytics and intelligence, performance management and
predictive analytics.
tivoli software. helps clients manage their technology and business assets by providing visibility, control and automation across their
organizations. with solutions for identity management, data security, storage management and the ability to provide automation and provisioning of the datacenter, tivoli helps build the infrastructure
needed to make the world's systemsfrom transportation to water, energy and telecommunicationsrun smarter.
lotus software. enables businesses to connect people and processes for more effective communication and increased productivity through
collaboration, messaging and social networking software. by remaining at the forefront of collaboration tools, lotus helps organizations reap the benefits of social networking and other web 2.0
modalities.
rational software. supports software development for both it and embedded system solutions with a suite of application lifecycle
management products. jazz, rational's technology platform, transforms
the
way people work together to build software, making software delivery more collaborative, productive and transparent.
business analytics. enables clients to better analyze their data and predict outcomes in order to make better business decisions.
solutions include cognos' business intelligence software, which provides comprehensive tools that range from querying to forecasting; as well as spss predictive analytics software that helps clients
predict outcomes and act on that insight.
operating systems. software that manages the fundamental processes that make computers run.
systems and technology provides clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities. approximately
half of systems and technology's server and storage sales transactions are through the company's business partners; with the balance direct to end-user clients. in addition, systems and
technology provides leading semiconductor technology, products and packaging solutions to clients and for ibm's own advanced technology needs.
systems
and technology capabilities
systems. a range of general purpose and integrated systems designed and optimized for specific business, public
and scientific computing needs. these systemssystem z, power systems and systemxare typically the core technology in data centers that provide required infrastructure
for business and institutions. also, these systems form the foundation for ibm's integrated offerings, such as ibm smart business storage cloud, ibm smart analytics cloud, ibm smart analytics system
and ibm cloudburst. ibm servers use both ibm and non-ibm microprocessor technology and operating systems. all ibm servers run linux, a key open- source operating system.
storage. ibm provides data storage products and solutions that allow clients to retain and manage rapidly growing, complex volumes of
digital information. these solutions address critical client requirements for information retention and archiving, data deduplication, availability and virtualization, and security and compliance. the
portfolio consists of a broad range of disk and tape storage systems and software, including the ultra-scalable disk storage system xiv.
retail store solutions. point-of-sale retail systems (network connected cash registers) as well as solutions which
connect them to other store systems.
microelectronics. semiconductor design and manufacturing primarily for use in ibm systems and storage products as well as delivering
semiconductors and related services to external clients.
global financing facilitates clients' acquisition of ibm systems, software and services. global financing invests in financing assets,
leverages with debt and manages the associated risks with the objective of generating consistently strong returns on equity. the primary focus on the company's offerings and clients mitigates many of
the risks normally associated with a financing company. global financing has the benefit of both a deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services that are being
financed. this combination allows global financing to effectively manage two of the major risks (credit and residual value) that are normally associated with financing.
global
financing capabilities
client financing. lease and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms generally between two
and seven years. internal financing is predominantly in support of global services' long-term client service contracts. global financing also factors a selected portion of the company's
accounts receivable, primarily for cash management purposes. all internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions.
commercial financing. short-term inventory and accounts receivable financing to dealers and remarketers of it products.
remanufacturing and remarketing. as equipment is returned at the conclusion of a lease transaction, these assets are refurbished and sold
or leased to new or existing clients both externally and internally. externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and
resellers.
internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold or leased internally to the systems and technology and global services segments. the systems and
technology segment may also sell the equipment that it purchases from global financing to external clients.
ibm worldwide organizations
the following worldwide organizations play key roles in ibm's delivery of value to its clients:
sales and distribution
research, development and intellectual property
enterprise transformation
integrated supply chain
sales and distribution
ibm has a significant global presence, operating in more than 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution
of revenue. the company's sales and distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country-based operating units focused on delivering client value. within these units,
client relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance. these teams deliver value by
understanding the clients' businesses and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across ibm and an extensive network of business partners to develop and implement solutions.
by
combining global expertise with local experience, ibm's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and
timely investments in emerging opportunities. the geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. ibm extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by
leveraging industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local business partner resources.
through
its growth markets organization, the company continues to increase its focus on the emerging markets around the world that have market growth rates greater than the global
averagecountries within southeast asia, eastern europe, the middle east and latin america. the company's major markets include the united states (u.s.), canada, the united kingdom (u.k.),
france, germany, italy, japan, denmark, sweden, switzerland, austria, belgium, finland, greece, iceland, ireland, malta, the netherlands, portugal, cyprus, norway, israel, spain, the bahamas and the
caribbean region.
the
majority of ibm's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (oem) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six
sectors:
financial services: banking, financial markets, insurance
public: education, government, healthcare, life sciences
industrial: aerospace and defense, automotive, chemical and petroleum, electronics
distribution: consumer products, retail, travel and transportation
communications: telecommunications, media and entertainment, energy and utilities
general business: mainly companies with fewer than 1,000 employees
research, development and intellectual property
ibm's r&d operations differentiate the company from its competitors. ibm annually invests approximately $6billion for r&d,
focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. the company has rebalanced its internal r&d. today, ibm's portfolio is built around networked, modularized and embedded
technologies, as well as business intelligence and analytics. in 2010, the company was once
again
awarded more u.s. patents than any other company, the 18thconsecutive year ibm has been the patent leader. ibm's 5,896 patents in 2010 were the most u.s. patents ever awarded to one
company in
a single year. over 70percent of the patents issued in 2010 were for software and services. the company's r&d efforts continue to push the frontiers of science and technologyfrom
analytics, to cloud, to a computer named watson that applied advanced analytics to defeat the all-time champions on the television quiz show, jeopardy.
in
addition to producing world-class systems, software and technology products, ibm innovations are also a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through
its services businesses. as an example, the company's research unit has the world's largest mathematics department of any public company. this unit is actively involved with most of the company's
business analytics client engagements.
the
company will continue to actively seek intellectual property protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual
property leadership. the company's investments in r&d also result in intellectual property (ip) income of approximately $1billion annually. some of ibm's technological breakthroughs are used
exclusively in ibm products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both ibm products and/or the products of the licensee. while the company's various proprietary intellectual property
rights are important to its success, ibm believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. ibm owns or
is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. licenses under patents owned by ibm have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and
conditions.
enterprise transformation
a key element of the company's strategy has been focused on becoming the premier globally integrated enterprise. in the early part of
the decade, the company drove implementation of a consistent set of processes and standards worldwide to reduce inefficiencies and improve collaboration. with its processes fully integrated, the
company implemented a new operating model with work shared in global resource centers of excellence located where it made the most business sense. since 2005, global integration has enabled the
company to reduce spending by over $5billion and improve service quality, speed and risk management. the company has shifted resources toward building client relationships and employees
skills, while positioning the company for new market opportunities. during this period, ibm has pioneered this new operating model, changing from a classic "multinational", with smaller versions of
the parent company replicated in countries around the world, to a global model with one set of processes, shared services and broadly distributed decision making.
the
company is now embarking on the next generation of its transformation in which new capabilities and technologies like business analytics and cloud computing will drive performance.
the proven principles of the globally integrated enterprise will be applied to all of the company's spending to continue to drive additional productivity benefits in shared services, integrated
operations and end-to-end process transformation.
integrated supply chain
consistent with the company's work with clients to transform their supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global
market conditions, the company continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, thereby providing a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients.
ibm leverages its supply-chain expertise for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end
supply-chain processes, from procurement to logistics.
ibm spends approximately $35billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. the supply, manufacturing and logistics and customer fulfillment
operations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed costs to variable costs.
simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes.
competition
the company is a globally-integrated enterprise, doing business in more than 170 countries. the company participates in a highly
competitive environment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. overall, across its business
segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide.
the
markets for each of the company's business segments is characterized by aggressive competition among all types of competitors. across its business, the company's principal methods of
competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and services; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to
clients; and, service and support. in order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. over the past decade, the company has been executing a strategy to
transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. as the company executes
its strategy, it enters new markets, such as smarter planet and business analytics, which exposes the company to new competitors. overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its
business segments.
a
summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:
global services:
the services segments, gts and gbs, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. gts competes in strategic
outsourcing, business process outsourcing, cloud services, and a wide range of technical and it support services. gbs competes in consulting, system integration and application management services.
the principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry knowledge and experience, value and speed,
price, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. the company's competitive advantages in the services business include its global
reach and scale, global delivery model, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise, services assets, an ability to deliver integrated solutions
that can address clients' needs in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. the company competes with broad based competitors
including: accenture, computer sciences corporation, fujitsu and hewlett-packard company (hp); india-based service providers including hcl, infosys, tata consulting services, cognizant and wipro
technologies; the consulting practices of public accounting firms including deloitte consulting; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.
software:
the enterprise management software market is highly competitive, and the key competitive factors in this segment include:
functionality, ease of use, scalability, compliance with open standards and total cost of ownership. the company's leadership in these areas provides it with competitive advantages. the company's
software business includes middleware, operating systems and related software provided to all industry segments worldwide. the middleware portfolio is the broadest in the industry and it also covers
both mainframe and distributed computing environments. the depth and breadth of the company's software offerings, coupled with its global sales and technical support infrastructure differentiate the
company's software business from its competitors. in addition, the company's research
and
development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute to this segment's leadership. the company's principal competitors in this segment include ca,inc., microsoft
corporation and oracle corporation (oracle). in addition, the company competes with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets worldwide.
systems and technology:
the enterprise server and storage market is highly competitive and is characterized by ongoing technology innovation, with competition
focused on value, function and reliability, and new entrants leveraging technology to compete against traditional offerings. the company's principal competitors include dell,inc. (dell), emc
corporation, hp and oracle. the company's leadership in virtualization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its systems platforms to leverage the entire
system, from the company's custom semiconductors through the software stack to increase efficiency and lower cost, provide the company with competitive advantages in this segment. in addition, the
company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's leadership.
global financing:
the global financing business provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. in
2008 and 2009, the economic crisis drove an increase in credit spreads which stabilized in 2010. however, going forward the supply of credit may tighten and financial institutions may continue to face
increases in loan losses, higher borrowing costs and liquidity challenges. global financing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive advantage for the
company. the key competitive factors include price, it product expertise, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business and residual values. in client and commercial financing, global
financing competes with three types of companies in providing financial services to it customers: other captive financing entities of companies such as hp and cisco systems,inc.,
non-captive financing entities of companies such as general electric company and banks or financial institutions. in remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus
original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used it equipment market.

all
executive officers are elected by the board of directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the
by-laws. each executive officer named above has been an executive of ibm or its subsidiaries during the past five years.
item1a. risk factors:
downturn in economic environment and corporate it spending budgets could impact the company's business: if overall demand for systems,
software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted.
the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration
initiatives: on an ongoing basis, ibm seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and
functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality,
productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.
failure of innovation initiatives could impact the long-term success of the company: ibm has been moving away from
commoditized categories of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in r&d. if ibm is unable to continue its
cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive environment, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. in addition,
ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized
for its industry-leading technology and solutions. if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted.
risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company's business: the company continues to invest significantly in growth
opportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries to drive revenue growth and market share gains. client adoption rates and viable economic models
are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. in addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix
of trained, skilled and experienced
personnel. in emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business
partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world.
ibm's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses: the
company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any
assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter
misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. in addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including
non-practicing entities. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future.
breaches of data security could impact the company's business: the company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third
party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others.
breaches in security could expose the company, its customers or others to risks of loss, including the misuse of information or systems, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the
company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data
protection measures could be significant.
the company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict: ibm's revenues are affected by such factors as the
introduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. the company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products
and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic
review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. as a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. historically, the company has had
lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. in addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the
fourth quarter, may affect ibm's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter.
due to the company's global presence, its business and operations could be impacted by local legal, economic, political and health
conditions: the company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside
the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the
company's overall results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including
recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. in addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global
health issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.
the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters: the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign
laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the u.s. superfund law. the company could incur substantial
costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental
laws and regulations. compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive
position.
tax matters could impact the company's results of operations and financial condition: the company is subject to income taxes in both the
united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. ibm's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,
income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and
financial condition in future periods. in addition, ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the
company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes
from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.
the company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its u.s. and non-u.s. pension
plans: adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future
estimated pension liabilities. as a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. in addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company
could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. further, the company's results of
operations and
financial
results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the u.s. premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of
unrelated companies in the country at issue. currently, canada, germany, luxembourg and the united kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets,
which could negatively impact the company's earnings. ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions
regarding pension matters.
ineffective internal controls could impact the company's business and operating results: the company's internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. even effective
internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could
be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.
the company's use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company's financial results: the application of generally
accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. the company's most
critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders, under "critical accounting estimates." in addition, as discussed in noteo,
"contingencies and commitments," in ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. these estimates and
assumptions involve the use of judgment. as a result, actual financial results may differ.
the company depends on skilled personnel and could be impacted by the loss of critical skills: much of the future success of the company
depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are
in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company.
in addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. further, many of ibm's key personnel receive a
total compensation package that includes equity awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity
awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation.
the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers: ibm's business employs a wide variety of
components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. changes
in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. further, the failure of the company's suppliers to
deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, any defective components, supplies
or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation.
the company could be impacted by its business with government clients: the company's customers include numerous governmental entities
within and outside the u.s., including the u.s. federal government and state and local entities. some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval.
also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. in
addition,
the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of
operations and financial results.
the company is exposed to currency and customer financing risks that could impact its revenue and business: the company derives a
significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s.
currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency
fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional it assets. the company employs a number of strategies to manage
these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in addition, there can be no assurance that the
company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful.
the company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on
receivables: the company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. the company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its
access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. ibm's 2010 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. the
company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue
coming from global clients across many sectors. most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. if
the company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the
company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.
the company's reliance on third party distribution channels could impact its business: the company offers its products directly and
through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its
ability to bring its products to market. as the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be
unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives.
risks to the company from acquisitions and alliances include integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, and the assumption of
liabilities: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances. acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks
relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. the related risks include the company
failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities
related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business.
risk factors related to ibm securities: the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time
to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. the value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating
principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of
interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. the company's ability to
pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this item1a.
entitled
"risk factors." there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
the
company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. the market price of
ibm common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this item1a. entitled "risk factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,
trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. since the market price of
ibm's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.
in
addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. the
company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.
item 1b. unresolved staff comments:
not applicable.
item 2. properties:
at december31, 2010, ibm's manufacturing and development facilities in the united states had aggregate floor space of
19million square feet, of which 16million was owned and 3million was leased. of these amounts, 3million square feet was vacant and 1million square feet was
being leased to non-ibm businesses. similar facilities in 7other countries totaled 5million square feet, of which 2million was owned and 3million was
leased.
although
improved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading
of facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

and exchange commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders to be held april26, 2011.
the
material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below:
2001 long-term performance plan
the 2001 long-term performance plan (the "2001 plan") has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior
executives of the company. awards for senior executives of the company
have
been and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 long-term performance plan (the "1999 plan"); the 1999 plan is also used to fund awards for employees other than
senior executives. otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 plan are identical to the 1999 plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit
awards and long-term performance incentive awards).
the
2001 plan is administered by the executive compensation and management resources committee of the board of directors, and that committee may delegate to officers of the company
certain of its duties, powers and authority. payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with committee approval. awards are not transferable
or assignable except (i)by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)with the approval of the committee.
if
the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled
immediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. in the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits
under the terms of the ibm long-term disability plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may
be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. in addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the committee may cancel, rescind, suspend,
withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred awards at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the award agreement and the
plan. in addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company.
pwcc acquisition long-term performance plan
the ibm pwcc acquisition long-term performance plan (the "pwcc plan") was adopted by the board of directors in connection
with the company's
acquisition of pricewaterhousecoopers consulting ("pwcc") from pricewaterhousecoopersllp, as announced on october1, 2002. the pwcc plan has been and will continue to be used solely to
fund awards for employees of pwcc who have come over to the company as a result of the acquisition. awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the pwcc plan. the terms and
conditions of the pwcc plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 plan, described above.
ibm deferred compensation and equity award plan
the ibm deferred compensation and equity award plan (the "dceap") was adopted in 1993. under the dceap, non-management
directors receive promised fee shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. each promised fee share is equal in value to one share of the company's common stock. upon a director's
retirement or other completion of service as a director, all amounts deferred into promised fee shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company's stock at the director's election. (for
additional information about the dceap, see "general information2010 director compensation narrative" in ibm's definitive proxy statement to be filed with the securities and exchange
commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders to be held april26, 2011).
