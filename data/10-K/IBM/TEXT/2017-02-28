PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS THE

COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME, IBM

HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER 90 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN

C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAYTHE COMPANY CREATES VALUE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS THAT LEVERAGE

DATA, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, DEEP EXPERTISE IN INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND A BROAD ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS AND ALLIANCES. IBM SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY CREATE VALUE BY ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES

FOR CLIENTS THAT TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES AND HELP THEM ENGAGE WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES IN NEW WAYS. THESE SOLUTIONS DRAW FROM AN INDUSTRY-LEADING PORTFOLIO OF CONSULTING AND IT

IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES, CLOUD AND COGNITIVE OFFERINGS, AND ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE; ALL BOLSTERED BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS.

STRATEGY

IBM HAS A HISTORY OF CONTINUOUS RE-INVENTION, TRANSFORMING ITSELF THROUGHOUT ITS 100-PLUS YEAR HISTORY. IN THE PAST FIVE DECADES ALONE, IBM HAS

USHERED IN THE ERAS OF THE MAINFRAME, THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, IT SERVICES AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE. IN ITS CURRENT TRANSFORMATION, IBM IS ONCE AGAIN LEADING THE REORDERING OF THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY.

A

NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, THE COMPANY DECLARED ITS FOCUS ON THE STRATEGIC FORCES BEHIND THE "DIGITAL" REVOLUTION; DATA, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENT, DRIVEN BY MOBILE AND SOCIAL, AND UNDERPINNED BY

SECURITY. SINCE 2010, IBM HAS INVESTED APPROXIMATELY $40 BILLION IN THESE AREAS, BUILT OUT THE IBM CLOUD ON A GLOBAL SCALE AND EXTENDED COGNITIVE SYSTEMS TO NUMEROUS ENTERPRISES AND INDUSTRIES.

THE COMPANY MADE 55 ACQUISITIONS AND HAS FORMED PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LEADING PLAYERS IN KEY INDUSTRIES.

BECAUSE

OF THIS TRANSFORMATION, IBM TODAY IS MUCH MORE THAN A HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES COMPANY; IBM IS A COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS AND CLOUD PLATFORM COMPANY, WITH A FOCUS ON INDUSTRY

CAPABILITIES AND EXPERTISE.

COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS.

WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE THAT EXISTS IN TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, THESE SOLUTIONS TACKLE CHALLENGES

RANGING FROM

ANSWERING CLIENT INQUIRIES TO HELPING PHYSICIANS FIGHT CANCER.

CLOUD PLATFORM.

IBM CLOUD IS THE LEADING CLOUD PLATFORM FOR THE ENTERPRISE, PROVIDING WHAT ENTERPRISES NEED FOR SPEED, AGILITY AND,

COMBINED WITH

WATSON, FOR COGNITIVE CAPABILITY.

INDUSTRY FOCUS.

AS IBM BRINGS HIGHER LEVELS OF VALUE TO ITS CLIENTS, AS ITS OFFERINGS ARE BEING BUILT FOR THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL

INDUSTRIES.

HEALTHCARE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF THE COMPANY'S INITIAL COGNITIVE FOCUS.

COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS

SINCE IBM'S WATSON WAS INTRODUCED IN 2011, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A NEW GENERATION OF COGNITIVE SYSTEMS THAT CAN SEE AND ANALYZE THE

MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN INVISIBLE TO COMPUTERS AND ENTERPRISES. IBM'S COGNITIVE SYSTEMS HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO INJECT A KIND OF THINKING ABILITY INTO EVERY DIGITIZED OBJECT,

PROCESS AND SERVICE, AND LEARN FROM INTERACTIONS. IBM IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF DEPLOYING THESE SYSTEMS AND HELPING CLIENTS TO EMBRACE THE COGNITIVE ERA.

1

COGNITIVE

SYSTEMS ARE NOT PROGRAMMED; LIKE HUMANS, THEY LEARN FROM EXPERTS AND FROM EVERY INTERACTION, AND THEY ARE UNIQUELY ABLE TO FIND PATTERNS IN BIG DATA. THEY LEARN BY USING

ADVANCED ALGORITHMS TO SENSE, PREDICT AND INFER. DOING SO, THEY AUGMENT HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE FASTER AND MORE INFORMED DECISIONS.

SINCE

WATSON'S DEBUT, MANY TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET UNDER THE BANNER OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. HOWEVER, IBM'S APPROACH TO COGNITIVE SYSTEMS IS QUITE

UNIQUE.



HIGHLY ADAPTABLE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS: WATSON HAS BROAD APPLICABILITY AND CAN HELP CLIENTS TACKLE CHALLENGES RANGING FROM ONCOLOGY TO CUSTOMER

SUPPORT.



PROTECT AND RESPECT CLIENT DATA: WATSON LEARNS THROUGH DATA, BOTH PUBLIC DATA AS WELL AS CLIENTS' PRIVATE DATA. CLIENTS CHOOSE WHETHER THEIR

DATA OR INSIGHTS ARE SHARED. IBM RESPECTS THE CLIENTS' OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THEIR OWN DATA.



EASY ENTRY POINTS: WATSON'S OPEN APIS OFFER EASY ON-RAMPS TO EXPERIMENT WITH SPEECH, VISION AND OTHER DATA.



TRAINED IN DOMAIN DEPTH: WATSON IS TRAINED TO BE AN EXPERT IN INDUSTRIES AND FUNCTIONAL SPECIALTIES. IT AUGMENTS THE KNOWLEDGE OF

PROFESSIONALS, GIVING THEM ACCESS TO THE INSIGHTS OF THEIR BEST COLLEAGUES AND THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS.



TRANSFORMATIONAL SERVICES: IBM'S COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS AND WATSON INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) PRACTICES HELP CLIENTS BUILD THEIR COGNITIVE

STRATEGIES. GBS PROVIDES OUTCOME-FOCUSED METHODOLOGIES, DOMAIN SKILLS AND DEEP INDUSTRY EXPERTISE.

CLOUD PLATFORM

CLOUD REPRESENTS MORE THAN A NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR DELIVERING INFRASTRUCTURE AND APPLICATIONS AS SERVICES; IT IS ALSO A CATALYST FOR INNOVATION,

SPEED AND AGILITY. CLOUD ENABLES COMPANIES TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENTIATING THEIR STRATEGIES, CAPABILITIES AND BUSINESS MODELS RATHER THAN ON THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY.

THE

IBM CLOUD BRINGS A UNIQUE SET OF CHARACTERISTICS TO CLIENTS.



IT IS A WORLD-CLASS CLOUD PLATFORM DESIGNED FOR ENTERPRISES, WHERE SECURITY, RELIABILITY, SCALABILITY AND PERFORMANCE ARE CRITICAL.



IT IS THE INDUSTRY-LEADING HYBRID CLOUD, ENABLING CLIENTS TO EXTEND THEIR EXISTING IT INVESTMENTS, CONNECTING VALUABLE DATA AND APPLICATIONS

ACROSS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUDS.



IT IS A WORLD-CLASS COGNITIVE CLOUD PLATFORM WITH IBM WATSON SERVICES THAT DEVELOPERS CAN EMBED INTO THEIR APPLICATIONS TO CREATE

DIFFERENTIATING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES AND POWERFUL INSIGHTS.

THE

IBM CLOUD HAS A STRONG GLOBAL PRESENCE, WITH MORE THAN 50 CLOUD DATA CENTERS AROUND THE WORLD GIVING CLIENTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO OPTIMIZE THE DEPLOYMENT OF DATA AND APPLICATION, FOR

PERFORMANCE, SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE.

THE

IBM CLOUD IS ALSO CONTINUALLY EXPANDING ITS BASE OF ADVANCED CAPABILITIES INCLUDING CLOUD DATA SERVICES, CLOUD OBJECT STORAGE, CLOUD VIDEO SERVICES, AS WELL AS INTERNET OF THINGS,

BLOCKCHAIN AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. IN 2016, IBM BROUGHT NEW COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS TO PROFESSIONALS IN MARKETING, COMMERCE, SUPPLY CHAIN AND HUMAN RESOURCES, EXTENDING INDUSTRY CLOUDS TO FURTHER

DIFFERENTIATE ITS CLOUD OFFERINGS.

INDUSTRY FOCUS

TO BRING HIGHER VALUE TO CLIENTS, IBM IS PROVIDING SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC AND TAILORED TO CHALLENGES CLIENTS FACE IN THEIR INDUSTRY, USING

THE POWER OF IBM'S ADVANCED COGNITIVE COMPUTING

2

CAPABILITIES

BUILT ON THE IBM CLOUD. IN 2016, IBM DEEPENED ITS COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING HIGHER VALUE IN SEVERAL KEY WAYS.



IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY, IBM WATSON HEALTH COMBINES THE POWER OF CLOUD AND COGNITIVE WITH VALUE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE,

ENGAGE CONSUMERS, ENABLE EFFECTIVE CARE AND MANAGE POPULATION HEALTH. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTHCARE SPACE, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITION OF MERGE AND TRUVEN, HAS ENABLED THE COMPANY TO EXPAND

THE SCOPE OF SOLUTIONS AIMED AT SOLVING SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING HEALTH CHALLENGES.



IBM CONTINUES TO PARTNER WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES CLIENTS TO BUILD A ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE ADDRESSING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND FAST-CHANGING

DEMANDS. FROM PREVENTING FRAUD TO SUPPORTING CYBER SECURITY EFFORTS, IBM IS BECOMING EVER-MORE ESSENTIAL TO THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY.



IBM OFFERS ANALYTICS TO HELP CLIENTS ASSESS THEIR RISK AND COMPLIANCE AGAINST INDUSTRY GUIDELINES, AND USES A COGNITIVE APPROACH TO PROVIDE

DEEPER AND FASTER FINDINGS. IN LATE 2016, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP, LLC (PROMONTORY), ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING REGULATORY CONSULTING FIRMS. PROMONTORY IS TRAINING

WATSON TO BE A MARKET-LEADING EXPERT IN THE REGULATORY FIELD, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE COMPANY TO DELIVER SERVICES AT NEW LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY.



IBM IS COMMITTED TO BLOCKCHAIN TO PROVIDE A HIGHLY SECURE METHOD OF FACILITATING MULTI-STEP TRANSACTIONS, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DISPUTES AND

POINTS OF FRICTION, INCLUDING ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE HYPERLEDGER PROJECT. THIS CROSS-INDUSTRY CONSORTIUM IS WORKING TO BUILD THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK IN THE CLOUD, DOING FOR TRUSTED TRANSACTIONS WHAT

THE INTERNET DID FOR INFORMATION, AND SETTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR YEARS TO COME. BLOCKCHAIN WILL ENABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SETTLE SECURITIES IN MINUTES INSTEAD OF DAYS; MANUFACTURERS TO

REDUCE PRODUCT RECALLS BY SHARING PRODUCTION LOGS ALONG THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN; AND BUSINESSES OF ALL TYPES TO MORE CLOSELY MANAGE THE FLOW OF GOODS AND PAYMENTS. IBM IS WORKING WITH COMPANIES RANGING

FROM RETAILERS, BANKS AND SHIPPERS TO APPLY THIS TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSFORM THEIR ECOSYSTEMS THROUGH OPEN STANDARDS AND OPEN PLATFORMS.



IBM'S GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES CONSULTING BUSINESS, WITH BROAD EXPERTISE ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND A STRONG GLOBAL FOOTPRINT AND SCALE, PROVIDES A

UNIQUE COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES TO HELP CLIENTS ACHIEVE THEIR BUSINESS OUTCOMES.

TRANSFORMING CORE BUSINESSES

WHILE THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS, CLOUD PLATFORM AND INDUSTRY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE COGNITIVE, CLOUD AND INDUSTRY ARE

BEING EMBEDDED ACROSS IBM'S OFFERINGS. THESE CORE BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO RUN CLIENTS' MOST CRITICAL BUSINESS PROCESSES. IBM'S HARDWARE SYSTEMS ARE BEING DESIGNED FROM THE GROUND UP TO POWER THE CLOUD

AND COGNITIVE SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY SERVICES HELP CLIENTS MOVE TO THE CLOUD, EMBEDDING COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES TAILORED FOR THEIR INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE OFFERINGS

ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE CLOUD AS WELL AS BEING CONNECTED TO THE CLOUD WHERE OUR CLIENTS CHOOSE TO KEEP THEM ON PREMISES. ADDITIONALLY, COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES ARE BEING ADDED TO

THESE OFFERINGS TO PROVIDE NEW LEVELS OF INNOVATION. IN SHORT, ALL OF IBM IS TRANSFORMING TO SUPPORT THE WAY ITS CLIENTS ARE TRANSFORMING.

SUMMARY

EACH TRANSFORMATION OF IBM USHERS IN A NEW CAPABILITY TO THE WORLD. MORE THAN 50 YEARS AGO, IBM INTRODUCED THE PROGRAMMABLE ERA AND

TRANSFORMED THE WORLD'S TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THE MAINFRAME. IN THE DECADES THAT FOLLOWED, IBM COMMERCIALIZED THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CREATED AN INDUSTRY AROUND IT SERVICES AND A SOFTWARE MARKET AROUND

MIDDLEWARE. EACH OF THESE INNOVATIONS REMAINS ESSENTIAL TO BUSINESS AND THE WORLD TODAY.

EXPANDS THE CUSTOMER BASE. THIS GENERATES IP INCOME FOR THE COMPANY BOTH UPON LICENSING, AND WITH ONGOING ROYALTY ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN IT AND THE LICENSEE. WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY IP

RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR

IS LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

IBM HAS AN EXTENSIVE INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES GLOBALLY. ADDITIONALLY, GROWTH IN CLIENT SPEND MANAGED BY IBM'S

PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE CLIENTS' FAITH THAT IBM CAN REDUCE CLIENTS' COST THROUGH THE TRANSFORMATION OF SOURCE-TO-PAY OPERATIONS. THE SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS

OPERATIONS ARE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED AND HAVE OPTIMIZED INVENTORIES OVER TIME. SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES HAS IMPROVED SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND

EFFICIENCY. SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY ENABLES IBM TO REDUCE ITS RISK DURING MARKETPLACE CHANGES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO DERIVE BUSINESS VALUE FROM ITS OWN GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN PROVIDING A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY TO CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS. IBM LEVERAGES

ITS SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERTISE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING SERVICE TO OPTIMIZE AND HELP OPERATE CLIENTS' END-TO-END SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES, FROM PROCUREMENT TO

LOGISTICS. UTILIZING ANALYTICS, MOBILE, CLOUD AND SOCIALWITH NUMEROUS PROJECTS, HAS ALLOWED THE INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN TO DRIVE POSITIVE BUSINESS OUTCOMES FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS

CLIENTS.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE ELECTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ANNUALLY AS PROVIDED IN THE BY-LAWS. EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER NAMED ABOVE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KENNETH M. KEVERIAN, HAS BEEN

AN EXECUTIVE OF IBM OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

MR.

KEVERIAN WAS A SENIOR PARTNER AT THE BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP, A GLOBAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTING FIRM, UNTIL JOINING IBM IN 2014. HE WAS WITH BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP FOR 26 YEARS AND HE

FOCUSED ON SERVING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR IBM'S PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CLIENT BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER AGILITY, PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS

PROCESSES, FUNCTIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES AND OFFERINGS IN BOTH EMERGING AND MORE ESTABLISHED MARKETS. THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES MAY NOT YIELD

THEIR INTENDED GAINS IN SPEED, QUALITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVENESS AND ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE

IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION, BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D AND ATTRACTING A SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE

ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING ENVIRONMENT OR IS UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE SUCH INNOVATIONS, EXPAND AND SCALE THEM WITH SUFFICIENT SPEED AND VERSATILITY, THE

COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND

OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS AND AS A COGNITIVE

LEADER. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS, ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN ITS

STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE

12

GAINS.

CLIENT ADOPTION RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE LESS CERTAIN IN THE HIGH-VALUE, HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND RAPIDLY-GROWING SEGMENTS, AND NEW DELIVERY MODELS MAY UNFAVORABLY IMPACT DEMAND AND

PROFITABILITY FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, IT NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND

EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL, AND DEVELOP ECOSYSTEMS AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS. IN EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE PRESENTS POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS FROM

EVOLVING GOVERNMENTAL POLICY, INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION AND CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS

GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS, LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE OWNERSHIP AND PROTECTION OF PATENTS.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS MAY AFFECT

CRITICAL THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR INVOLVE THE STORAGE, PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA, INCLUDING VALUABLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OTHER PROPRIETARY OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, REGULATED DATA,

AND PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THERE ARE NUMEROUS AND EVOLVING RISKS TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY, INCLUDING CRIMINAL HACKERS, HACKTIVISTS,

STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS, INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE, EMPLOYEE MALFEASANCE, AND HUMAN OR TECHNOLOGICAL ERROR. AS A GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WITH REGARD TO CYBERSECURITY, PRIVACY AND

DATA PROTECTION ISSUES IS INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING AND MAY HAVE IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING INCREASED RISK, COSTS, AND EXPANDED COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS. AS THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS FOCUS

ON DATA GROWS, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THESE VULNERABILITIES AND REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, RISKS, AND REPUTATION MAY GROW ACCORDINGLY. THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION THAT WILL

COME INTO FORCE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN MAY 2018 WILL CAUSE THE COMPANY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS.

COMPUTER

HACKERS AND OTHERS ROUTINELY ATTEMPT TO BREACH THE SECURITY OF TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SYSTEMS, AND TO FRAUDULENTLY INDUCE EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS TO DISCLOSE

INFORMATION OR UNWITTINGLY PROVIDE ACCESS TO SYSTEMS OR DATA. THE RISK OF SUCH ATTACKS TO THE COMPANY INCLUDES ATTEMPTED BREACHES NOT ONLY OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SYSTEMS, BUT ALSO THOSE OF

CUSTOMERS,

CONTRACTORS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL BREACHES, EMPLOYEE MALFEASANCE, OR HUMAN OR TECHNOLOGICAL ERROR COULD RESULT IN, FOR EXAMPLE, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO,

DISCLOSURE, MODIFICATION, MISUSE, LOSS, OR DESTRUCTION OF COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY DATA OR SYSTEMS; THEFT OF SENSITIVE, REGULATED, OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION

AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; THE LOSS OF ACCESS TO CRITICAL DATA OR SYSTEMS THROUGH RANSOMWARE OR OTHER ATTACKS; AND BUSINESS DELAYS, SERVICE OR SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS OR DENIAL OF SERVICE. IN THE EVENT OF

SUCH ACTIONS, THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES COULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY, LITIGATION, AND REGULATORY OR OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTION, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR

POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION, AND OTHER FINANCIAL LOSS. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF RESPONDING TO BREACHES AND IMPLEMENTING REMEDIATION MEASURES COULD

BE SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES AND RESPONDS TO CYBERSECURITY THREATS, ALTHOUGH NONE HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY TO DATE. AS THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE CYBERSECURITY

13

LANDSCAPE

EVOLVE, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO FIND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT FURTHER INVESTMENTS TO PROTECT DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE. CYBERSECURITY RISK TO THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS WILL ALSO

DEPEND ON FACTORS SUCH AS ACTIONS, PRACTICES AND INVESTMENTS OF CUSTOMERS, CONTRACTORS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES. CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS RESULTING IN

DISRUPTIONS TO OR FAILURES IN POWER, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COULD RESULT IN INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS TO COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY

OPERATIONS OR SERVICES, FINANCIAL LOSS, INJURY TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY, POTENTIAL LIABILITY, AND DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES.

MOREOVER, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES INVOLVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW CUSTOMERS, NEW AND EVOLVING COMPETITORS, AND NEW MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE NATURE OF ITS CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES; FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANY'S SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW BY REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED

FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS HAD LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION,

THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE

QUARTER.

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 175 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY'S

OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS, INFLATION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN

TRADE RELATIONSHIPS AMONGST THOSE COUNTRIES. FURTHER, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE SCOPE OF ITS OFFERINGS, BOTH WITHIN THE U.S. AND GLOBALLY, IT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL

REGULATORY OR OTHER RISKS. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS, PANDEMIC OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE OR UNCERTAIN POLITICAL CLIMATES, INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES, NATURAL

DISASTERS, OR ANY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

14

OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) IS ISSUING GUIDELINES THAT ARE DIFFERENT, IN SOME RESPECTS, THAN LONG-STANDING

INTERNATIONAL TAX PRINCIPLES. AS COUNTRIES UNILATERALLY AMEND THEIR TAX LAWS TO ADOPT CERTAIN PARTS OF THE OECD GUIDELINES, THIS MAY INCREASE TAX UNCERTAINTY AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

INCOME TAXES. LOCAL COUNTRY, STATE, PROVINCIAL OR MUNICIPAL TAXATION MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND POTENTIAL OVERRIDE BY REGIONAL, FEDERAL, NATIONAL OR SIMILAR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION,

IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE

LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL

NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS.

ADVERSE

FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY

HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PREMIUMS FOR MANDATORY PENSION INSOLVENCY INSURANCE COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. PREMIUM INCREASES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE LEVEL OF INSOLVENCIES OF UNRELATED COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY AT ISSUE. IBM'S 2016 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION

ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING PENSION MATTERS.

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS AND FUTURE EVENTS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY'S MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2016 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE M,

"CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2016 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE AREAS WHERE THE COMPANY

COMPETES ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF OR INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS. IN ADDITION,

AS GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY DEMAND SHIFTS, REALIGNMENT, TRAINING AND SCALING OF SKILLED RESOURCES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY RAPID OR SUCCESSFUL. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A

TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. ANY NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE

15

COMPANY'S

USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, AND

WITH THE COMPLETION OF GLOBALFOUNDRIES' ACQUISITION OF IBM'S GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SEMICONDUCTOR BUSINESS IN 2015, IT BECAME IBM'S EXCLUSIVE SERVER PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER FOR CERTAIN

SEMICONDUCTORS. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE

FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES, IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY HAS RIGOROUS QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS AND

PROCESSES INTENDED TO PREVENT, DETECT AND CORRECT ERRORS, MALFUNCTIONS AND OTHER DEFECTS IN ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF ERRORS, MALFUNCTIONS, DEFECTS OR DISRUPTIONS IN SERVICE ARE EXPERIENCED BY

CUSTOMERS, THERE COULD BE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD IMPACT CUSTOMERS' BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND HARM THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS'S OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FUNDING APPROVAL.

FUNDING REDUCTIONS OR DELAYS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT PUBLIC SECTOR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, SOME AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE

AND PROVIDING FOR HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COULD BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED AS A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACTOR AND COULD INCUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND

PENALTIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT

PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES AND COSTS FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND THE U.S.

DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT

AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY.

IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND FINANCING RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS

ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S 2016 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF

THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF

16

FUTURE

ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND ECOSYSTEMS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS

DIRECTLY AND THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM PARTNERS. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM

PARTNERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS THE COMPANY MOVES INTO NEW AREAS, DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM PARTNERS MAY BE UNABLE

TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND ENABLE APPROPRIATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE OF THIRD PARTY

DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM PARTNERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM WORKING WITH THEM AND COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS

ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS

RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY OR THAT STRATEGIC ACQUISITION

OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND

COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY DISPOSES OR ATTEMPTS TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NO LONGER CENTRAL TO ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ANY SUCH DISPOSITION OR ATTEMPTED DISPOSITION IS SUBJECT TO

RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO

THE TERMS AND TIMING OF SUCH DISPOSITION, RISKS RELATED TO OBTAINING NECESSARY GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY APPROVALS AND RISKS RELATED TO RETAINED LIABILITIES NOT SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S CONTROL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RISKS.

AS A COMPANY WITH A SUBSTANTIAL EMPLOYEE POPULATION AND WITH CLIENTS IN MORE THAN 175

COUNTRIES, IBM IS INVOLVED, EITHER AS PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT, IN A VARIETY OF ONGOING CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS, INVESTIGATIONS, TAX MATTERS AND PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2016 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF

INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED

"RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

17

IBM

COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT

MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF 8 MILLION

SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 7 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 1 MILLION WAS LEASED. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 16 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 6 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 2 MILLION WAS OWNED AND

4 MILLION WAS LEASED. THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES ARE UTILIZED FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS OF ALL ITS SEGMENTS.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS, DIVESTITURES AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE

AND UPGRADING OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

REFER TO NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," ON PAGES 127 TO 129 OF IBM'S 2016 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH IS

THE

MATERIAL FEATURES OF EACH EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN UNDER WHICH EQUITY SECURITIES ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE THAT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PIAN

THE 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "2001 PLAN") HAS BEEN USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY.

AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED FROM THE STOCKHOLDER-APPROVED 1999 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "1999 PLAN"); THE 1999 PLAN IS ALSO USED TO FUND

AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR

22

EXECUTIVES,

OTHERWISE, THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN ARE IDENTICAL TO THE 1999 PLAN, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN (STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNIT AWARDS

AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE AWARDS).

THE

2001 PLAN IS ADMINISTERED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE "COMMITTEE"), AND THAT COMMITTEE MAY DELEGATE TO OFFICERS OF

THE COMPANY CERTAIN OF ITS DUTIES, POWERS AND AUTHORITY. PAYMENT OF AWARDS MAY BE MADE IN THE FORM OF CASH, STOCK OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF AND MAY BE DEFERRED WITH COMMITTEE APPROVAL. AWARDS ARE NOT

TRANSFERABLE OR ASSIGNABLE EXCEPT (I) BY LAW, WILL OR THE LAWS OF DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION, (II) AS A RESULT OF THE DISABILITY OF THE RECIPIENT, OR (III) WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE

COMMITTEE.

IF

THE EMPLOYMENT OF A PARTICIPANT TERMINATES, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF A PARTICIPANT, ALL UNEXERCISED, DEFERRED AND UNPAID AWARDS SHALL BE CANCELED

IMMEDIATELY, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT PROVIDES OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT OR IN THE EVENT A PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE DISABLED AND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

IBM LONG-TERM DISABILITY PLAN (OR ANY SUCCESSOR PLAN OR SIMILAR PLAN OF ANOTHER EMPLOYER), THE PARTICIPANT'S ESTATE, BENEFICIARIES OR REPRESENTATIVE, AS THE CASE MAY BE, SHALL HAVE THE RIGHTS AND

DUTIES OF THE PARTICIPANT UNDER THE APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT SPECIFIES OTHERWISE, THE COMMITTEE MAY CANCEL, RESCIND, SUSPEND, WITHHOLD OR OTHERWISE LIMIT OR

RESTRICT ANY UNEXPIRED, UNPAID, OR DEFERRED AWARD AT ANY TIME IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE AWARDS AGREEMENT AND THE 2001 PLAN. IN ADDITION, AWARDS MAY

BE CANCELLED IF THE PARTICIPANT ENGAGES IN ANY CONDUCT OR ACT DETERMINED TO BE INJURIOUS, DETRIMENTAL OR PREJUDICIAL TO ANY INTEREST OF THE COMPANY.

PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

THE IBM PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "PWCC PLAN") WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S

ACQUISITION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS CONSULTING ("PWCC") FROM PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 1, 2002. THE PWCC PLAN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED SOLELY TO

FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OF PWCC WHO HAVE BECOME EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE FUNDED FROM THE PWCC PLAN. THE TERMS

AND CONDITIONS OF THE PWCC PLAN ARE SUBSTANTIVELY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN, DESCRIBED ABOVE.

IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN

THE IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN (THE "DCEAP") WAS ADOPTED IN 1993 AND AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014.

UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED DCEAP, NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS RECEIVE PROMISED FEE SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH DEFERRED ANNUAL RETAINER PAYMENTS. EACH PROMISED FEE SHARE IS EQUAL IN VALUE TO ONE SHARE

OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. UPON A DIRECTOR'S RETIREMENT OR OTHER COMPLETION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR, AMOUNTS DEFERRED INTO PROMISED FEE SHARES ARE PAYABLE IN EITHER CASH AND/OR SHARES OF THE

COMPANY'S STOCK EITHER AS LUMP SUM OR INSTALLMENTS PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTOR'S DISTRIBUTION ELECTION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DCEAP, SEE "2016 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION NARRATIVE" IN IBM'S
