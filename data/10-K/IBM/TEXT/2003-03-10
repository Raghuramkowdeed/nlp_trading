part i
item 1. business:
international business machines corporation (ibm) was incorporated in the state of new york on june16, 1911, as the computing-tabulating-recording co.
(c-t-r), a consolidation of the computing scale co. of america, the tabulating machine co., and the international time recording co. of new york. in 1924,
c-t-r adopted the name international business machines corporation.
ibm
uses advanced information technology to provide customer solutions. the company operates primarily in a single industry using several segments that create value by offering a variety
of solutions that include, either singularly or in some combination, technologies, systems, products, services, software and financing.
organizationally,
the company's major operations comprise a global services segment; three hardware product segmentssystems group, personal systems group and technology
group; a software segment; a global financing segment and an enterprise investments segment. the segments are determined based on several factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products,
technology and delivery channels.
ibm
offers its products through its global sales and distribution organizations. the sales and distribution organizations have both a geographic focus (in the americas, europe/middle
east/africa, and asia pacific) and a specialized and global industry focus. in addition, these organizations include a global sales and distribution effort devoted exclusively to small and medium
businesses. ibm also offers its products through a variety of third party distributors and resellers, as well as through its on-line channels.
while
the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, ibm believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular
patent or license, or any
particular group of patents or licenses. ibm owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. licenses under patents owned by ibm have been and are
being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. these protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of the
company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. also, there can be no assurances that ibm will be
able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future.
ibm's
businesses employ a wide variety of components, supplies and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. certain of the company's businesses rely on a
single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver
components, supplies and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business.
ibm's
revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. as a result, the company's
results are difficult to predict. these factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter.
the
value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues from the company's product offerings due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume
of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product delivery schedules. with respect to the company's global services segment, in 2002 the company signed contracts totaling
$53billion, which contributed to a services backlog at december31, 2002 of $112billion, compared with $102billion at the end of 2001.
the
company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. the company's businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from fortune 50 companies
to
an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. the company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and
the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors.
intense
competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and /or loss of market opportunity. unlike many
of its competitors, the company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines.
as a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing
resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete.
the
company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of its revenues from sales outside the united states. changes in the laws or policies of the
countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's results of operations. the company's results of operations also could be affected by
economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation.
the
audit committee of the board of directors approved the categories of all non-audit services performed by the company's independent accountants during the period covered by this
report.

forward-looking
and cautionary statements: certain statements contained in this annual report may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995 ("reform act"). the company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission, in materials delivered to
stockholders and in press releases. in addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements provide current expectations of
future events based on certain
assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "projects,"
and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. in accordance with the reform act, set
forth below are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. the following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other
factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report, in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference.
new
products and the pace of technological change: the company's results of operations depend on the continued successful development and marketing of new and innovative products and
services. the development of new products and services requires significant capital investments by the company's various businesses and the success of these products and services depends on their
acceptance by customers and business partners. further, the company's businesses are characterized by rapid technological changes and corresponding shifts in customer demand, resulting in
unpredictable product
transitions and shortened life cycles and increasing emphasis on being first to market with new products and services.
there
can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce new products and services, that these products and services will be accepted by customers, or that the company's
businesses will recoup or realize a return on their capital investments. in addition, from time to time the company may experience difficulties or delays in the development, production or marketing of
new products and services.
volatility
of stock prices: the company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in results, the competitive landscape, general economic and
market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. as a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock price is subject to significant volatility.
dependence
on and compensation of key personnel: much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including technical,
marketing and staff positions. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that the company
will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. many of the company's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes stock options and other equity
awards. new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the value of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the
company to use more cash compensation.
currency
and customer financing risks: the company derives a significant percentage of its non-u.s. revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and
its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-u.s. currencies and the u.s. dollar. further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to
the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the customer, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. the
company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. in
addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful.
distribution
channels: the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. changes in the financial or business condition of these
distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market.
acquisitions
and alliances: the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. acquisitions and alliances present significant
challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully.
item 2. properties:
at december31, 2002, ibm's manufacturing and development facilities in the united states had aggregate floor space of 34million square feet, of
which 23million was owned and 11million was leased. of these amounts, 4million square feet was vacant and 2million square feet was being leased to non-ibm
businesses. similar facilities in 16 other countries totaled 15million square feet, of which 10million was owned and 5million was leased. of these amounts, 1million
square feet was vacant and 2million square feet was being leased to non-ibm businesses.
although
improved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous upgrading of facilities is
essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand. for additional information on expenditures for plant, rental machines and other property, refer to
"investments" on pages56 of ibm's 2002 annual report to stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference.

report of independent auditors
to
the board of directors of
international business machines corporation:
we
have audited the statement of assets and liabilities of the business consulting services reporting unit (the "reporting unit") (a reporting unit as defined in statement of financial accounting
standards no.142), of international business machines corporation (the "company") as of december31, 2002 and the related statement of revenues and expenses (collectively, the
"statements") for the three months then ended (not separately presented herein). these statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these statements based on our audit.
we
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statements. an audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statements. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
the
statements were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission (for use by the company in connection with its various filings with
the commission). certain corporate assets, liabilities and corporate expenses, that are not the responsibility of the reporting unit, and which have not been allocated, have been excluded from the
statements. accordingly, these statements are not intended to be a complete presentation of the financial position or results of operations of the reporting unit.
in
our opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the reporting unit as of december31, 2002
and for the three months then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
