PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS

THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME,

IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER 90 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN

C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: THE COMPANY CREATES VALUE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS THAT LEVERAGE: DATA,

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, DEEP EXPERTISE IN INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND A BROAD ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS AND ALLIANCES. IBM SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY CREATE VALUE BY ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES FOR

CLIENTS THAT TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES AND HELP THEM ENGAGE WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES IN NEW WAYS. THESE SOLUTIONS DRAW FROM AN INDUSTRY-LEADING PORTFOLIO OF CONSULTING AND IT IMPLEMENTATION

SERVICES, CLOUD AND COGNITIVE OFFERINGS, AND ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE; ALL BOLSTERED BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS.

STRATEGY

IBM HAS TRANSFORMED THROUGHOUT ITS 100+ YEAR HISTORY, AND IN ITS CURRENT TRANSFORMATION, IBM IS LEADING A REORDERING OF THE TECHNOLOGY

INDUSTRY.

IN

2014, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES WERE DECLARED AROUND THE THREE MAIN FORCES BEHIND "DIGITAL": BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENT. SINCE 2010, IBM HAS INVESTED

APPROXIMATELY $30 BILLION IN THESE AREAS, BUILT OUT THE IBM CLOUD ON A GLOBAL SCALE, ESTABLISHED THE WATSON GROUP, ANNOUNCED 50 ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERED INTO MAJOR PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING THE

LANDMARK ALLIANCE WITH APPLE TO BRING MOBILE TO THE ENTERPRISE.

AS

IBM'S CLIENTS TRANSFORM, "DIGITAL" ITSELF IS NOT THE DESTINATION, BUT A FOUNDATION TO CREATE A TRULY COGNITIVE ENTERPRISE. THIS IS RESULTING IN NEW TYPES OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN

PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS AND MACHINES.

THROUGH

THESE DEVELOPMENTS, IBM IS EMERGING AS MORE THAN A HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES COMPANY; IBM IS TRANSFORMING INTO A COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS AND CLOUD PLATFORM COMPANY. KEY TENETS

OF THE COMPANY'S HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED STRATEGY INCLUDE.

COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS.

COGNITIVE, ADVANCED ANALYTICS AND KEY DATA ARE BEING INTEGRATED INTO ALL LEADING SOLUTIONS.

CLOUD PLATFORM.

NEW SOLUTIONS WILL BE BUILT ON THE IBM CLOUD AND THE COMPANY'S OFFERINGS WILL BE CLOUD-ENABLED. THE COMPANY IS

CONTINUING TO BUILD

THE PREMIER CLOUD STACK, DEVELOPER ENVIRONMENT AND MOST SECURE HYBRID CLOUD PLATFORM IN THE INDUSTRY.

INDUSTRY FOCUS.

BECAUSE INDUSTRY CONTEXT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE VALUE OF IBM'S SOLUTIONS, THESE SOLUTIONS WILL BE BUILT FOR THE NEEDS

OF INDIVIDUAL

INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS.

COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS

SINCE 2011 WHEN IBM'S WATSON WAS INTRODUCED, IBM HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A NEW GENERATION OF COGNITIVE SYSTEMS THAT CAN SEE AND ANALYZE THE

MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN INVISIBLE TO COMPUTERS AND ENTERPRISES. COGNITIVE SYSTEMS HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO INJECT A KIND OF THINKING ABILITY INTO EVERY DIGITALIZED OBJECT,

PROCESS AND SERVICE. IBM IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF DEPLOYING THESE SYSTEMS AND ASSISTING CLIENTS TO BECOME TRULY COGNITIVE ENTERPRISES.

1

COGNITIVE

SYSTEMS ARE NOT PROGRAMMED; LIKE HUMANS, THEY LEARN FROM EXPERTS, FROM EVERY INTERACTION, AND FROM BIG DATA. THEY ARE ENABLED TO LEARN BY USING ADVANCED ALGORITHMS TO SENSE,

PREDICT AND INFER. ULTIMATELY THEY CAN AUGMENT HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS.

FOR

THE PAST FIVE YEARS, IBM HAS CONTINUED TO INVEST IN WATSON, INCLUDING DEDICATING $100 MILLION TO VENTURE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT START-UPS BUILDING COGNITIVE APPS THROUGH THE

WATSON DEVELOPER ZONE ON BLUEMIX. IBM IS ALSO MAKING WATSON MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WATSON ECOSYSTEM, WHICH HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN 500 PARTNERS.

PAIRED

WITH WATSON IS THE COMPANY'S CORE BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS BUSINESS. IBM HAS INVESTED OVER $15 BILLION IN THESE AREAS SINCE 2010, INCLUDING OVER $7 BILLION ON MORE

THAN 20 ACQUISITIONS. NEARLY HALF OF IBM RESEARCH'S SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON ANALYTICS AND COGNITIVE.

IBM'S

LEADING-EDGE COGNITIVE TECHNOLOGY IS ONLY THE STARTING POINT. THE COMPANY IS DEVELOPING ENTIRELY NEW SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES AROUND THAT COGNITIVE CAPABILITY. IN 2015, THE WATSON

HEALTH UNIT WAS FORMED, WHICH IS IBM'S FIRST BUSINESS UNIT DESIGNED AROUND A SINGLE INDUSTRY. WATSON HEALTH WILL CREATE COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BETTER HELP DOCTORS DIAGNOSE AND ANTICIPATE

DISEASE; IT WILL RECOMMEND TREATMENTS THAT ARE TAILORED TO INDIVIDUALS; AND IT WILL ASSIST RESEARCHERS TO PREDICT AND PREVENT THE NEXT GENERATION OF DISEASES.

ANOTHER

SET OF COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS IBM IS BUILDING IS THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT). IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 9 BILLION CONNECTED DEVICES OPERATING IN THE WORLD

TODAY, GENERATING 2.5 QUINTILLION BYTES OF NEW DATA DAILY. WATSON IOT WILL BRING THE POWER OF COGNITIVE TO THE CHALLENGE OF EXTRACTING AND ANALYZING DATA EMBEDDED IN INTELLIGENT DEVICES IN REAL TIME.

IN ADDITION, THE RECENT CLOSURE OF THE

WEATHER COMPANY ACQUISITION ESSENTIALLY EXPANDS THE COMPANY'S IOT PLATFORM; WITH ONE THAT COLLECTS, INTEGRATES AND ANALYZES DATA FROM THREE BILLION WEATHER FORECAST REFERENCE POINTS, INCLUDING

SATELLITES, WEATHER STATIONS, AIRPLANES, CONSUMER APPS AND MORE FOR IBM AND OUR CLIENTS.

THROUGH

COGNITIVE, IBM IS USHERING IN A NEW ERA FOR THE INDUSTRY AND FOR CLIENTS.

CLOUD PLATFORM

CLOUD IS AT THE HEART OF THE "DIGITAL" REVOLUTION. NO ENTERPRISE IS UNTOUCHED BY THIS REVOLUTION AND THE SHIFTS ARE OCCURRING RAPIDLY.

ENTERPRISES

ARE BENEFITING FROM CLOUD BY USING IT TO TRANSFORM THEIR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) AND BUSINESS PROCESSES INTO DIGITAL SERVICES. CLOUD BRINGS TWO COMPELLING SOURCES OF

VALUE.



INNOVATION.

IN ADDITION TO CLOUD ENABLING THE SHARING OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THE REAL

PROMISE OF CLOUD IS INNOVATION. BY FORCING GREATER LEVELS OF STANDARDS THROUGHOUT THE TECHNOLOGY VALUE CHAIN, NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND EVEN ENTIRE BUSINESS MODELS, CAN BE CREATED IN WEEKS RATHER

THAN MONTHS OR YEARS.



HYBRID.

DATA, CLOUD AND ENGAGEMENT ARE POWERFUL FORCES CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE OF

TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESSES. ENTERPRISES NEED TO BRING THIS NEW WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER WITH THEIR EXISTING SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THEIR FULL VALUE. HYBRID CLOUD BRINGS TOGETHER THE BACK-END

SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE NEW STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE "DIGITAL" TECHNOLOGIES. UNLESS THE NEW AND TRADITIONAL IT WORLDS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER, THEY WILL BE ISOLATED WITHIN THE ENTERPRISE. IBM SERVERS

AND STORAGE CAN HANDLE MOBILE TRANSACTIONS, COMPOSE AND EXPOSE APIS AND INTEGRATE ACROSS HYBRID CLOUDS TO UNLOCK NEW VALUE FROM DATA.

MAKING

APPLICATIONS WORK ACROSS ON-PREMISE, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS IS WHAT HYBRID CLOUD IS ALL ABOUT. THIS REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NEW IT

MODELS, SOMETHING THAT IBM IS UNIQUE IN BRINGING TO ITS CLIENTS.

2



IN TRADITIONAL IT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE Z SYSTEMS MAINFRAME IS USED BY ALL OF THE TOP 25 GLOBAL BANKS AND ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF THE TOP

25 U.S. RETAILERS. IN ADDITION, 70 PERCENT OF THE TOP 25 FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES RELY ON IBM TO MANAGE THEIR CRITICAL IT INFRASTRUCTURES.



IN THE NEW WORLD OF IT, THE IBM CLOUD HAS BECOME THE STANDARD FOR ENTERPRISE-GRADE CLOUDBRINGING PERFORMANCE AND THE

INTEGRATION ACROSS ALL IT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BUILD CLOUD INTO GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY SERVICES' (GTS) LARGE BASE OF OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS.



EACH OF THESE AREAS OF IT REQUIRES UNCOMPROMISING SECURITY. IBM SECURITY BRINGS TO CLIENTS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IN FRAUD AND THREAT

PROTECTION, IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT, APPLICATION AND DATA SECURITY, MOBILE AND CLOUD SECURITY. IBM'S SYSTEMS ARE AMONG THE MOST SECURE IN THE WORLD WITH ADVANCED ENCRYPTION, THREAT MONITORING

AND TRACKING AND BEHAVIORAL ANALYTICS. FURTHER, HIGH-END SECURITY CONSULTING BRINGS THE EXPERTISE OF 6,000 DEDICATED SECURITY SPECIALISTS. BUILT ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS, IBM MANAGES OVER

20 BILLION SECURITY EVENTS PER DAY ON 2.5 MILLION DESKTOPS FOR 12,000 CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTERS.

IBM'S

CLOUD PLATFORM INCLUDES.



IBM CLOUD'S INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE, WHICH OFFERS BARE METAL, PRIVATE CLOUD AND VIRTUAL SERVER INSTANCES, ENABLING IT TO COVER

MANY DIFFERENT WORKLOADS WITH UNPRECEDENTED PERFORMANCE. IBM'S PLATFORM ALSO HAS TREMENDOUS GEOGRAPHIC REACHWITH 46 CLOUD CENTERS AROUND THE GLOBE.



BLUEMIX IS IBM'S PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE, BUILT ON THE OPEN STANDARDS FOUNDATION OF CLOUD FOUNDRY AND POWERED BY IBM CLOUD'S

INFRASTRUCTURE. BLUEMIX OFFERS CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, APIS AND LEADING THIRD-PARTY SERVICES TO DEVELOPERS IN AN INTEGRATED PLATFORM. WITH $1 BILLION OF INVESTMENT, BLUEMIX IS NOW THE LARGEST

CLOUD FOUNDRY DEVELOPMENT, HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SERVICES AND IS ONBOARDING THOUSANDS OF DEVELOPERS PER WEEK.



IBM CLOUD MARKETPLACE BRINGS TOGETHER THE COMPANY'S EXTENSIVE PORTFOLIO OF CLOUD CAPABILITIES, PROVIDING A SELF-SERVICE, DIGITAL

EXPERIENCE FOR DEVELOPERS, IT AND BUSINESS LEADERS. IBM HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE OFFERINGS AND VISITORS TO THE MARKETPLACE HAVE ACCESS TO AN EXTENSIVE AND GROWING PORTFOLIO OF

CLOUD CAPABILITIES FROM IBM AND QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS.



IN 2015, IBM ACQUIRED: BLUE BOX GROUP, INC. (PRIVATE CLOUD), COMPOSE (DATABASE-AS-A-SERVICE), STRONGLOOP, INC.

(DEVELOPER TECHNOLOGY), CLEVERSAFE, INC. (OBJECT-BASED STORAGE), GRAVITANT, INC. (CLOUD BROKERAGE) AND CLEARLEAP, INC. (CLOUD- BASED VIDEO).



THE WEATHER COMPANY ACQUISITION IN JANUARY 2016, WHOSE DYNAMIC CLOUD DATA PLATFORM POWERS THE FOURTH MOST-USED DAILY MOBILE APP IN THE

UNITED STATES AND HANDLES 26 BILLION INQUIRIES TO ITS CLOUD-BASED SERVICES EACH DAY. THIS HIGH-VOLUME CLOUD PLATFORM PROCESSES, ANALYZES AND DISTRIBUTES ENORMOUS DATA SETS AT SCALE IN REAL

TIME. IT ADDS AN IMPORTANT DIMENSION TO THE COMPANY'S CLOUD PLATFORM.



IBM HAS ENTERED INTO STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ALL FOCUSED ON BRINGING INNOVATIVE DATA AND ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS TO THE MARKET. THE IBM

CLOUD IS THE MOST POWERFUL PLATFORM FOR ENTERPRISE-GRADE ENVIRONMENTS, BRINGING CLIENTS UNPARALLELED LEVELS OF SECURITY, PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY.

INDUSTRY FOCUS

IBM'S SOLUTIONS AND PLATFORMS ARE MOST RELEVANT IN THE CONTEXT OF EACH CLIENT'S INDUSTRY. GENERAL-PURPOSE TOOLS HAVE THEIR PLACE, BUT

THE COMPANY CAN UNLOCK MUCH GREATER VALUE IN BUILDING SOLUTIONS FOR THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF AN INDUSTRY. IN THIS CONTEXT, INDUSTRIES ARE THE FOCUS.

WATSON

HEALTH IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE COMPANY IS DEFINING SOLUTIONS AROUND INDUSTRY NEEDS. IN ADDITION TO WATSON HEALTH, IN 2015, 20 NEW INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS WERE

LAUNCHED WITH

3

PRE-BUILT

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES. THESE INCLUDE SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW CLIENTS TO MINE CUSTOMER DATA FOR HIDDEN INSIGHTS FOR ACTION, SPOT FRAUD OR RISK AND PREDICT VULNERABILITIES TO PREEMPT

BEFORE THEY OCCUR. THESE SOLUTIONS, WHICH ARE TAILORED SPECIFICALLY FOR RETAIL, BANKING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INSURANCE AND OTHERS, WILL MAKE IT EASIER AND FASTER FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO UNCOVER AND ACT

ON CRITICAL BUSINESS INSIGHTS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ANNOUNCED OVER 100 APPS THROUGH ITS ALLIANCE WITH APPLE THAT BRING VALUE IN THE CONTEXT OF INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIES.

COMPLEMENTING

THE POWER OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS IS THE INDUSTRY EXPERTISE OF IBM'S GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES CONSULTING BUSINESS. IT IS THE COMBINATION OF IBM'S TECHNOLOGY

AND SERVICES, WHICH ENABLE CLIENTS TO ACHIEVE THEIR BUSINESS OUTCOMES.

SUMMARY

EACH SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF IBM HAS BROUGHT SOMETHING NEW AND INNOVATIVE TO THE WORLD. MORE THAN 50 YEARS AGO, IBM BROUGHT

FORWARD A REVOLUTIONARY TRANSACTIONAL COMPUTER CALLED THE MAINFRAME. IN THE DECADES THAT FOLLOWED, IBM COMMERCIALIZED THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CREATED AN INDUSTRY AROUND IT SERVICES AND A SOFTWARE

MARKET AROUND MIDDLEWARE. EACH OF THESE INNOVATIONS IS WITH THE WORLD TODAY; THEY WERE BUILT TO LAST.

THE

COMPANY'S NEXT CHAPTER IS USHERING IN AN ENTIRELY NEW ERA OF HUMAN-ORGANIZATION-COMPUTER INTERACTIONEMBODIED IN COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS AND THE CLOUD PLATFORM.

BUSINESS MODEL

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS MODEL IS BUILT TO SUPPORT TWO PRINCIPAL GOALS: HELPING ENTERPRISE CLIENTS TO BECOME MORE INNOVATIVE, EFFICIENT

AND COMPETITIVE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND IT SOLUTIONS; AND PROVIDING LONG-TERM VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME THROUGH STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS IN CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE SUPERIOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY PROSPECTS BASED ON THE VALUE THEY DELIVER TO CLIENTS.

THE

COMPANY'S GLOBAL CAPABILITIES INCLUDE SERVICES, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH AND RELATED FINANCING. THE BROAD MIX OF BUSINESSES AND CAPABILITIES ARE COMBINED TO PROVIDE

INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS AND PLATFORMS TO THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS.

THE

BUSINESS MODEL IS DYNAMIC, ADAPTING TO THE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S TRANSFORMATION INTO CLOUD AND AS-A-SERVICE DELIVERY

MODELS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION THROUGH STRATEGIC ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN HIGHER-VALUE AREAS WHILE DIVESTING CERTAIN BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

TRANSFORMING INTO A MORE AGILE ENTERPRISE HELPING TO DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY, WHICH SUPPORTS INVESTMENTS FOR PARTICIPATION IN MARKETS WITH SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITY.

THIS

BUSINESS MODEL, SUPPORTED BY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL MODEL, HAS ENABLED THE COMPANY TO DELIVER STRONG EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE LONG TERM.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES

SERVICE CONTRACTS. GLOBAL FINANCING ALSO FACTORS A SELECTED PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRIMARILY FOR CASH MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. ALL INTERNAL FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AT

ARM'S-LENGTH RATES AND ARE BASED UPON MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMMERCIAL FINANCING.

SHORT-TERM INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING TO SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND REMARKETERS OF IBM AND OEM

PRODUCTS.

REMANUFACTURING AND REMARKETING.

ASSETS INCLUDE USED EQUIPMENT RETURNED FROM LEASE TRANSACTIONS, OR USED SURPLUS EQUIPMENT ACQUIRED

INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY. THESE ASSETS MAY BE REFURBISHED OR UPGRADED AND SOLD OR LEASED TO NEW OR EXISTING CLIENTS BOTH EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY. EXTERNALLY REMARKETED EQUIPMENT REVENUE REPRESENTS

SALES OR LEASES TO CLIENTS AND RESELLERS. INTERNALLY REMARKETED EQUIPMENT REVENUE PRIMARILY REPRESENTS USED EQUIPMENT THAT IS SOLD INTERNALLY TO SYSTEMS HARDWARE AND GLOBAL SERVICES. SYSTEMS HARDWARE

MAY ALSO SELL THE EQUIPMENT THAT IT PURCHASES FROM GLOBAL FINANCING TO EXTERNAL CLIENTS.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS

THE FOLLOWING WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS PLAY KEY ROLES IN IBM'S DELIVERY OF VALUE TO ITS

CLIENTS.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION



RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

IBM HAS A SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL PRESENCE, OPERATING IN MORE THAN 175 COUNTRIES, WITH AN INCREASINGLY BROAD-BASED GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

OF REVENUE. THE COMPANY'S SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION MANAGES THE IBM GLOBAL FOOTPRINT, WITH DEDICATED COUNTRY-BASED OPERATING UNITS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING UNIQUE VALUE AND A SUPERIOR CLIENT

EXPERIENCE. WITHIN THESE UNITS, CLIENT RELATIONSHIP PROFESSIONALS WORK WITH INTEGRATED TEAMS OF CONSULTANTS, PRODUCT SPECIALISTS AND DELIVERY FULFILLMENT TEAMS TO ENABLE CLIENTS' BUSINESS GROWTH AND

INNOVATION. THESE TEAMS DELIVER VALUE BY UNDERSTANDING THE CLIENTS' BUSINESS AND NEEDS, AND THEN BRINGING TOGETHER CAPABILITIES FROM ACROSS IBM AND AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF BUSINESS PARTNERS TO DEVELOP

AND IMPLEMENT CLIENT SOLUTIONS.

8

BY

COMBINING GLOBAL EXPERTISE AND DIGITAL SALES CAPABILITIES WITH LOCAL EXPERIENCE, IBM'S GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ENABLES CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DEDICATED MANAGEMENT FOCUS FOR LOCAL

CLIENTS, SPEED IN ADDRESSING NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES. THE GEOGRAPHIC UNITS ALIGN INDUSTRY SOLUTION, PRODUCT AND SERVICES EXPERTISE TO SERVE CLIENTS'

AGENDAS. IBM ALSO EXTENDS THE REACH OF ITS CAPABILITIES TO COMMERCIAL CLIENTS BY LEVERAGING INDUSTRY SKILLS WITH DIGITAL MARKETING, DIGITAL SALES AND LOCAL BUSINESS PARTNER RESOURCES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST TO CAPTURE THE LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITY IN KEY GROWTH MARKETS AROUND THE WORLDINDIA, CHINA AND COUNTRIES WITHIN SOUTHEAST ASIA, EASTERN EUROPE,

THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA. THE COMPANY'S MAJOR MARKETS INCLUDE THE G7 COUNTRIES OF CANADA, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES (U.S.) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) PLUS

AUSTRIA, THE BAHAMAS, BELGIUM, THE CARIBBEAN REGION, CYPRUS, DENMARK, FINLAND, GREECE, ICELAND, IRELAND, ISRAEL, MALTA, THE NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SPAIN, SWEDEN AND SWITZERLAND.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) OPERATIONS DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPANY FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IBM ANNUALLY INVESTS APPROXIMATELY

6 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR R&D, FOCUSING ON HIGH-GROWTH, HIGH-VALUE OPPORTUNITIES. IBM RESEARCH WORKS WITH CLIENTS AND THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH GLOBAL LABS ON NEAR-TERM AND

MIDTERM INNOVATIONS. IT CONTRIBUTES MANY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO IBM'S PORTFOLIO EVERY YEAR AND HELPS CLIENTS ADDRESS THEIR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. IBM RESEARCH ALSO EXPLORES THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENCE

AND TECHNOLOGYFROM NANOTECHNOLOGY AND FUTURE SYSTEMS, TO BIG DATA ANALYTICS, SECURE CLOUDS AND ADVANCING THE WORLD'S FIRST COGNITIVE COMPUTING PLATFORM, IBM WATSON.

IN

2015, IBM WAS AWARDED MORE U.S. PATENTS THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THE 23RD CONSECUTIVE YEAR. IBM'S 7,355 PATENTS AWARDED IN 2015 POSITION THE COMPANY TO COMPETE AND LEAD IN

THE EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES REPRESENTED BY BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS, SECURITY, SOCIAL AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES. THESE INVENTIONS WILL ADVANCE IBM'S CLOUD PLATFORM AND THE NEW ERA OF COMPUTING IN WHICH

MACHINES WILL LEARN, REASON AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE IN MORE NATURAL WAYS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY SEEK INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) PROTECTION FOR ITS INNOVATIONS, WHILE INCREASING EMPHASIS ON OTHER INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE ITS IP LEADERSHIP.

SOME OF IBM'S

TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE LICENSED AND MAY BE USED IN IBM PRODUCTS AND/OR THE PRODUCTS OF THE LICENSEE. WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY

IP RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS

OR IS LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

IBM HAS AN EXTENSIVE INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES GLOBALLY. IN 2015, THE COMPANY ALSO MANAGED

APPROXIMATELY $24 BILLION IN PROCUREMENT SPENDING FOR ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THE GLOBAL PROCESS SERVICES ORGANIZATION. THE SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS OPERATIONS ARE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED

AND HAVE OPTIMIZED INVENTORIES OVER TIME. SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES HAS IMPROVED SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY

ENABLES IBM TO REDUCE ITS RISK DURING MARKETPLACE CHANGES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO DERIVE BUSINESS VALUE FROM ITS OWN GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN PROVIDING A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY TO CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS. IBM LEVERAGES

ITS SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERTISE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING SERVICE TO OPTIMIZE AND HELP OPERATE CLIENTS' END-TO-END SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES, FROM PROCUREMENT TO

LOGISTICS. UTILIZING ANALYTICS, MOBILE, CLOUD AND SOCIALWITH NUMEROUS PROJECTS, HAS ALLOWED THE INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN TO DRIVE POSITIVE BUSINESS OUTCOMES FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS

CLIENTS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY-INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, OPERATING IN MORE THAN 175 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT, WHERE ITS COMPETITORS VARY BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT, AND RANGE FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES TO SMALLER, MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED ENTITIES. OVERALL, ACROSS ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES HUNDREDS OF COMPETITORS WORLDWIDE.

ACROSS

ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION ARE: TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; PRICE; QUALITY; BRAND; ITS BROAD RANGE OF CAPABILITIES, PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES; CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; THE ABILITY TO DELIVER BUSINESS VALUE TO CLIENTS; AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP, A CORPORATION MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST, INNOVATE AND

INTEGRATE. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXECUTING A STRATEGY TO TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING SHIFTING TO HIGHER VALUE MARKET SEGMENTS AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASING ITS CAPABILITIES THROUGH ORGANIC

INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. AS THE COMPANY EXECUTES ITS STRATEGY, IT ENTERS NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS CLOUD, BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND "AS-A-SERVICE" SOLUTIONS, WHICH EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO NEW

COMPETITORS. OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS THE LEADER OR AMONG THE LEADERS IN EACH OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

A

SUMMARY OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS INCLUDED BELOW.

GLOBAL SERVICES.

THE SERVICES SEGMENTS, GTS AND GBS, OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CONTINUALLY EVOLVING GLOBAL MARKET. GTS COMPETES IN STRATEGIC

OUTSOURCING, CLOUD SERVICES, AND A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNICAL AND IT SUPPORT SERVICES. GBS COMPETES IN CONSULTING, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, APPLICATION MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING SERVICES.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS INCLUDE: TECHNICAL SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES, INNOVATIVE SERVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE, VALUE AND SPEED,

SOFTWARE.

THE ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND INCREASINGLY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT

SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE BUSINESS OUTCOMES FOR THEIR CLIENTS. THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE: FUNCTIONALITY, EASE-OF-USE, SCALABILITY, OPEN STANDARDS, TOTAL

COST-OF-OWNERSHIP AND BUSINESS VALUE. IBM'S LEADERSHIP IN EACH OF THESE AREAS, AND THE ABILITY TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS THAT DRIVE BUSINESS RESULTS, PROVIDES IT WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. THE COMPANY'S

SOFTWARE BUSINESS INCLUDES MIDDLEWARE AND SOLUTIONS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, DELIVERED BOTH ON-PREMISE AND "AS-A-SERVICE", AND OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE MIDDLEWARE PORTFOLIO IS THE BROADEST IN THE INDUSTRY

AND COVERS BOTH MAINFRAME AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. THE MIDDLEWARE PORTFOLIO ALSO UNDERPINS IBM'S SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND ENHANCES THE BUSINESS VALUE THE COMPANY BRINGS TO CLIENTS. THE

SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC OFFERINGS TO NEW TYPES OF IT DECISION MAKERS, SUCH AS CHIEF MARKETING AND PROCUREMENT OFFICERS, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY

OFFICERS AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS. THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF THE SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, COUPLED WITH THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL SALES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, DIFFERENTIATE THE SOFTWARE

BUSINESS FROM ITS COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PATENT

10

12

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR IBM'S PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CLIENT BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER AGILITY, PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS

PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES AND OFFERINGS IN BOTH EMERGING AND MORE ESTABLISHED MARKETS. THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES MAY NOT YIELD THEIR INTENDED

GAINS IN SPEED, QUALITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVENESS AND ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE

IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING ENVIRONMENT OR IS UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE SUCH INNOVATIONS, EXPAND AND SCALE THEM WITH SUFFICIENT SPEED AND VERSATILITY, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS ONGOING EFFORTS

TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS, ITS

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN ITS

STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. CLIENT ADOPTION RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE LESS CERTAIN IN THE HIGH-VALUE, HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND RAPIDLY-GROWING

SEGMENTS, AND NEW DELIVERY MODELS MAY UNFAVORABLY IMPACT DEMAND AND PROFITABILITY FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, IT

NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL, AND DEVELOP ECOSYSTEMS AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS. IN EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE

PRESENTS POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS FROM

EVOLVING GOVERNMENTAL POLICY, INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION AND CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS

GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS, LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE OWNERSHIP AND PROTECTION OF PATENTS.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS MAY AFFECT

CRITICAL THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR INVOLVE THE STORAGE, PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA, INCLUDING VALUABLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OTHER PROPRIETARY OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, REGULATED DATA,

AND PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. IN

13

THE

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THERE ARE NUMEROUS AND EVOLVING RISKS TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY, INCLUDING CRIMINAL HACKERS, HACKTIVISTS, STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS, INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE, EMPLOYEE

MALFEASANCE, AND HUMAN OR TECHNOLOGICAL ERROR. COMPUTER HACKERS AND OTHERS ROUTINELY ATTEMPT TO BREACH THE SECURITY OF TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS. THE RISK OF SUCH ATTACKS TO THE

COMPANY INCLUDES ATTEMPTED BREACHES NOT ONLY OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SYSTEMS, BUT ALSO THOSE OF CUSTOMERS, CONTRACTORS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL

BREACHES COULD RESULT IN, FOR EXAMPLE, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, DISCLOSURE, MODIFICATION, MISUSE, LOSS, OR DESTRUCTION OF COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY DATA OR SYSTEMS; THEFT OF SENSITIVE,

REGULATED, OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; AND SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS OR DENIAL OF SERVICE. IN THE EVENT OF SUCH BREACHES, THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR

OTHER THIRD PARTIES COULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY, LITIGATION, AND REGULATORY ACTION, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION, AND OTHER

FINANCIAL LOSS. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF RESPONDING TO BREACHES AND IMPLEMENTING REMEDIATION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES AND RESPONDS TO

CYBERSECURITY THREATS, ALTHOUGH NONE HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY TO DATE. AS THE CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE EVOLVES, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO FIND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT

FURTHER INVESTMENTS TO PROTECT DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AS A GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES RELATED TO DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL DATA, COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY EXISTING AND

PROPOSED LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY, PRIVACY, DATA LOCALIZATION AND DATA PROTECTION, AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANY OF ANY

SUCH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACHES, COULD BECOME GREATER. ADDITIONALLY, CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS RESULTING IN DISRUPTIONS TO OR FAILURES IN POWER,

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COULD RESULT IN INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS TO COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR SERVICES, FINANCIAL

LOSS, INJURY TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY, POTENTIAL LIABILITY, AND DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES.

MOREOVER, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES INVOLVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW CUSTOMERS, NEW AND EVOLVING COMPETITORS, AND NEW MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE NATURE OF ITS CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES; FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANY'S SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW BY REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED

FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS HAD LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION,

THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE

QUARTER.

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 175 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY'S

OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS,

INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. FURTHER, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE SCOPE OF ITS OFFERINGS, BOTH WITHIN THE U.S. AND

GLOBALLY, IT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR OTHER RISKS. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS, PANDEMIC OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE OR UNCERTAIN POLITICAL

CLIMATES, INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR ANY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

14

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES

AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS.

ADVERSE

EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PREMIUMS FOR MANDATORY PENSION INSOLVENCY INSURANCE COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PREMIUM INCREASES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE LEVEL OF INSOLVENCIES OF

UNRELATED COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY AT ISSUE. CURRENTLY, CANADA, GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE UNITED KINGDOM REQUIRE THAT THESE PREMIUMS BE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND NOT OUT OF PLAN ASSETS, WHICH

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. IBM'S 2015 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

PENSION MATTERS.

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS AND FUTURE EVENTS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY'S MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2015 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN

15

ADDITION,

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2015 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE AREAS WHERE THE COMPANY

COMPETES ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED WORKERS LEAVE

THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, AS GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY DEMAND SHIFTS, REALIGNMENT, TRAINING AND SCALING OF SKILLED RESOURCES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY RAPID. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL

RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S

EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, AND

WITH THE COMPLETION OF GLOBALFOUNDRIES' ACQUISITION OF IBM'S GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SEMICONDUCTOR BUSINESS, IT BECAME IBM'S EXCLUSIVE SERVER PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER FOR CERTAIN SEMICONDUCTORS.

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE FAILURE OF THE

COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES, IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY HAS RIGOROUS QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS AND

PROCESSES INTENDED TO PREVENT, DETECT AND CORRECT ERRORS, MALFUNCTIONS AND OTHER DEFECTS IN ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF ERRORS, MALFUNCTIONS OR DEFECTS ARE EXPERIENCED BY CUSTOMERS, THERE COULD BE

NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD IMPACT CUSTOMERS' BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND HARM THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS'S OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS MAY

BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FUNDING APPROVAL. FUNDING REDUCTIONS OR DELAYS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT PUBLIC SECTOR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, SOME AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS ALLOWING

THE CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE AND PROVIDING FOR HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COULD BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED AS A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACTOR AND COULD

INCUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT

PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES AND COSTS FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND THE U.S.

DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT

AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE

16

USE

OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND

FINANCING RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS

ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S 2015 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF

THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND ECOSYSTEMS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS

DIRECTLY AND THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM PARTNERS. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM

PARTNERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS THE COMPANY MOVES INTO NEW AREAS, DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM PARTNERS MAY BE UNABLE

TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND ENABLE APPROPRIATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE

OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND ECOSYSTEM PARTNERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM WORKING WITH THEM AND COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES

AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS

RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY OR THAT STRATEGIC ACQUISITION

OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND

COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY DISPOSES OR ATTEMPTS TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NO LONGER CENTRAL TO ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ANY SUCH DISPOSITION OR ATTEMPTED DISPOSITION IS SUBJECT TO

RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO THE TERMS AND TIMING OF SUCH DISPOSITION, RISKS RELATED TO OBTAINING NECESSARY GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY APPROVALS AND RISKS RELATED TO RETAINED LIABILITIES NOT

SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S CONTROL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RISKS.

AS A COMPANY WITH A SUBSTANTIAL EMPLOYEE POPULATION AND WITH CLIENTS IN MORE THAN 175

COUNTRIES, IBM IS INVOLVED, EITHER AS PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT, IN A VARIETY OF ONGOING CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS, INVESTIGATIONS, TAX MATTERS AND PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2015 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

17

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF

INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED

"RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF

9 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 8 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 1 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT. THE AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE IN THE UNITED

STATES DECLINED 8 MILLION SQUARE FEET COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF THE MICROELECTRONICS BUSINESS. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 14 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 7 MILLION

SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 3 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS LEASED.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING

OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

REFER TO NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," ON PAGES 118 TO 120 OF IBM'S 2015 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH

THE

MATERIAL FEATURES OF EACH EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN UNDER WHICH EQUITY SECURITIES ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE THAT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PIAN

THE 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "2001 PLAN") HAS BEEN USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE

COMPANY. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED FROM THE STOCKHOLDER-APPROVED 1999 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "1999 PLAN"); THE 1999 PLAN IS ALSO

USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR

22

EXECUTIVES,

OTHERWISE, THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN ARE IDENTICAL TO THE 1999 PLAN, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN (STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNIT AWARDS

AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE AWARDS).

THE

2001 PLAN IS ADMINISTERED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE "COMMITTEE"), AND THAT COMMITTEE MAY DELEGATE TO OFFICERS OF

THE COMPANY CERTAIN OF ITS DUTIES, POWERS AND AUTHORITY. PAYMENT OF AWARDS MAY BE MADE IN THE FORM OF CASH, STOCK OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF AND MAY BE DEFERRED WITH COMMITTEE APPROVAL. AWARDS ARE NOT

TRANSFERABLE OR ASSIGNABLE EXCEPT (I) BY LAW, WILL OR THE LAWS OF DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION, (II) AS A RESULT OF THE DISABILITY OF THE RECIPIENT, OR (III) WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE

COMMITTEE.

IF

THE EMPLOYMENT OF A PARTICIPANT TERMINATES, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF A PARTICIPANT, ALL UNEXERCISED, DEFERRED AND UNPAID AWARDS SHALL BE CANCELED

IMMEDIATELY, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT PROVIDES OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT OR IN THE EVENT A PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE DISABLED AND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

IBM LONG-TERM DISABILITY PLAN (OR ANY SUCCESSOR PLAN OR SIMILAR PLAN OF ANOTHER EMPLOYER), THE PARTICIPANT'S ESTATE, BENEFICIARIES OR REPRESENTATIVE, AS THE CASE MAY BE, SHALL HAVE THE RIGHTS AND

DUTIES OF THE PARTICIPANT UNDER THE APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT SPECIFIES OTHERWISE, THE COMMITTEE MAY CANCEL, RESCIND, SUSPEND, WITHHOLD OR OTHERWISE LIMIT OR

RESTRICT ANY UNEXPIRED, UNPAID, OR DEFERRED AWARD AT ANY TIME IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE AWARDS AGREEMENT AND THE 2001 PLAN. IN ADDITION, AWARDS MAY

BE CANCELLED IF THE PARTICIPANT ENGAGES IN ANY CONDUCT OR ACT DETERMINED TO BE INJURIOUS, DETRIMENTAL OR PREJUDICIAL TO ANY INTEREST OF THE COMPANY.

PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

THE IBM PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "PWCC PLAN") WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS CONSULTING ("PWCC") FROM PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 1, 2002. THE PWCC PLAN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED

SOLELY TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OF PWCC WHO HAVE BECOME EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE FUNDED FROM THE PWCC PLAN.

THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PWCC PLAN ARE SUBSTANTIVELY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN, DESCRIBED ABOVE.

IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN

THE IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN (THE "DCEAP") WAS ADOPTED IN 1993 AND AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2014. UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED DCEAP, NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS RECEIVE PROMISED FEE SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH DEFERRED ANNUAL RETAINER PAYMENTS. EACH PROMISED FEE SHARE IS

EQUAL IN VALUE TO ONE SHARE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. UPON A DIRECTOR'S RETIREMENT OR OTHER COMPLETION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR, AMOUNTS DEFERRED INTO PROMISED FEE SHARES ARE PAYABLE IN EITHER

CASH AND/OR SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK EITHER AS LUMP SUM OR INSTALLMENTS PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTOR'S DISTRIBUTION ELECTION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DCEAP, SEE "2015 DIRECTOR

COMPENSATION NARRATIVE" IN IBM'S DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND DELIVERED TO STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
