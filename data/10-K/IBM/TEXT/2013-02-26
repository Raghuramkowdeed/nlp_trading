PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS

THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF

NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME, IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER

85 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: THE COMPANY CREATES BUSINESS VALUE FOR CLIENTS AND SOLVES BUSINESS PROBLEMS

THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS THAT LEVERAGE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. IBM SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY CREATE VALUE BY REDUCING A CLIENT'S OPERATIONAL COSTS OR BY ENABLING

NEW CAPABILITIES THAT GENERATE REVENUE. THESE SOLUTIONS DRAW FROM AN INDUSTRY LEADING PORTFOLIO OF CONSULTING, DELIVERY AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES, ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS AND FINANCING.

STRATEGY

DESPITE THE VOLATILITY OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) INDUSTRY OVER THE PAST DECADE, IBM HAS CONSISTENTLY DELIVERED STRONG

PERFORMANCE, WITH A STEADY TRACK RECORD OF SUSTAINED EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH AND CASH GENERATION. THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED ITS BUSINESS MIX, EXITING CERTAIN SEGMENTS WHILE INCREASING ITS PRESENCE IN

HIGHER-VALUE AREAS SUCH AS SERVICES, SOFTWARE AND INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. AS PART OF THIS SHIFT, THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED MORE THAN 140 COMPANIES SINCE 2000, COMPLEMENTING AND SCALING ITS PORTFOLIO OF

PRODUCTS AND OFFERINGS.

IBM'S

STRATEGY OF DELIVERING HIGH VALUE SOLUTIONS TO ENTERPRISE CLIENTS HAS YIELDED CONSISTENT BUSINESS RESULTS. WORKING WITH ENTERPRISE CLIENTS ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF THEIR

BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL OPPORTUNITIES, IBM DELIVERS LEADERSHIP INNOVATION IN TECHNOLOGY, HIGH VALUE SOLUTIONS AND INSIGHTS THAT IMPROVE CLIENT AND INDUSTRY OUTCOMES. A HIGHLY ENGAGED, GLOBAL WORKFORCE

WITH DEEP TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS SKILLS, TEAMED WITH AN UNMATCHED ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS PROVIDES A WORLD-CLASS CLIENT EXPERIENCE.

THESE

PRIORITIES REFLECT A BROAD SHIFT IN CLIENT SPENDING TOWARD INNOVATION AND EFFICIENCY, AS COMPANIES SEEK HIGHER LEVELS OF BUSINESS VALUE FROM THEIR IT INVESTMENTS. IBM HAS BEEN ABLE

TO DELIVER THIS ENHANCED CLIENT VALUE THANKS TO ITS INDUSTRY EXPERTISE, UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENTS' BUSINESSES, SUSTAINED INVESTMENT IN CORE AND APPLIED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D), GLOBAL REACH AND

THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THE COMPANY'S CAPABILITIES.

NEW

TYPES OF SOLUTIONS, NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW DECISION MAKERS ARE EMERGING AS CLIENTS LOOK TO MAKE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THESE

OPPORTUNITIES ARE DRIVEN BY A NEW ERA OF COMPUTING THAT IS ENABLED BY ANALYTICS, CLOUD COMPUTING, BIG DATA, MOBILITY, SOCIAL COMPUTING AND SUPPORTED BY ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY SOLUTIONS. THE

COMPANY'S STRATEGY IS TO ESTABLISH LEADERSHIP IN THIS NEW ERA OF SMARTER COMPUTINGCOMPUTING THAT IS DESIGNED FOR BIG DATA, BUILT ON SOFTWARE-DEFINED ENVIRONMENTS AND OPENIN

ORDER TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER, CREATE NEW MARKETS AND ENGAGE NEW CLIENTS.

TO

CAPTURE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARISING FROM THESE MARKET TRENDS, IBM IS FOCUSED ON FOUR KEY GROWTH INITIATIVES: SMARTER PLANET, GROWTH MARKETS, BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND OPTIMIZATION AND

CLOUD COMPUTING. EACH INITIATIVE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITY WITH ATTRACTIVE PROFIT MARGINS FOR IBM.

SMARTER PLANET

SMARTER PLANET IS IBM'S VISION OF A TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED WORLD THAT IS MORE INSTRUMENTED, INTERCONNECTED AND INTELLIGENT THAN EVER

BEFORE, ENABLING PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO TACKLE SIGNIFICANT

1

BUSINESS

AND SOCIETAL CHALLENGES. AT THE HEART OF THIS VISION IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MEANINGFUL INNOVATIONEXPLORING AND EXTENDING THE BOUNDARIES OF BUSINESSES, INDUSTRIES AND COMMUNITIES.

IT'S ABOUT HELPING THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS BECOME BETTER AT WHAT THEY DO FOR THEIR CLIENTS. IBM'S STRATEGY IS TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARD A "SMARTER PLANET" BY EQUIPPING CLIENTS WITH THE ADVANCED,

INTEGRATED CAPABILITIES THEY NEED TO THRIVE IN THIS EXCITING NEW WORLD THAT IS UNFOLDING BEFORE USCAPABILITIES SUCH AS ANALYTICS FOR BUSINESS AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, BUSINESS PROCESS

MANAGEMENT, SOCIAL BUSINESS, MOBILE COMPUTING AND CLOUD COMPUTING.

IBM

HAS CONTINUED TO DEEPEN ITS COMMITMENT TO UNDERSTANDING AND DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF SMARTER PLANET FOR BOTH LINE OF BUSINESS AND IT EXECUTIVES ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF

INDUSTRIES. AN INDUSTRY-BASED APPROACH IS CENTRAL TO THE STRATEGY, SINCE EVERY INDUSTRY CONFRONTS A DISTINCT SET OF CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN TODAY'S CONSTANTLY TRANSFORMING WORLD. WHETHER

"SMARTER" MEANS HELPING A HOSPITAL GROUP TO DELIVER IMPROVED HEALTHCARE, A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO EASE TRAFFIC CONGESTION, OR A RETAIL CHAIN TO EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL CROSS-CHANNEL CAMPAIGN, IBM IS

AGGRESSIVELY DEVELOPING AND INVESTING IN A PORTFOLIO OF INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS THAT HELPS THESE CLIENTS ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.

THREE

INITIATIVES THAT DRIVE SIGNIFICANT VALUE ILLUSTRATE IBM'S DEEP COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A SMARTER PLANET: SMARTER COMMERCE, SMARTER CITIES AND SOCIAL BUSINESS. IBM'S SMARTER COMMERCE

MODEL INTEGRATES AND TRANSFORMS HOW COMPANIES MANAGE AND ADAPT THEIR BUY, MARKET, SELL AND SERVICE PROCESSES, PLACING THE CUSTOMER SQUARELY AT THE CENTER OF THEIR BUSINESS. IBM'S SMARTER CITIES

INITIATIVE ENABLES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SMARTER DECISIONS, ANTICIPATE ISSUES AND COORDINATE RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY, WHILE DELIVERING CITIZEN-CENTRIC SERVICES THAT UNDERPIN

SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. IBM'S SOCIAL BUSINESS INITIATIVE HELPS CLIENTS INTEGRATE SOCIAL TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES INTO THEIR FRONT-END PROCESSES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY CREATE AND SHARE

KNOWLEDGE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND BUILD A SMARTER WORKFORCE. EACH OF THESE INITIATIVES IS POWERED BY MARKET-LEADING IBM INNOVATIONS AND SOFTWARE, DEVELOPED BOTH BY IBM

AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS.

GROWTH MARKETS

THE COMPANY HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE GROWTH MARKETS. THE FOCUS NOW IS ON GEOGRAPHIC

EXPANSION OF IBM'S PRESENCE; ON SELECTED INDUSTRIES OF THE HIGHEST IMPACT AND OPPORTUNITY; ON COUNTRIES' BUILD-OUTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE ALIGNED WITH THEIR NATIONAL AGENDAS; AND, ON CREATING

MARKETS AND NEW BUSINESS MODELS TO SERVE THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAT EXIST IN THESE EMERGING COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY'S EFFORT IN DEVELOPING NEW GROWTH MARKETS WITHIN THE AFRICAN CONTINENT IS A GOOD

EXAMPLE OF THIS FOCUS. MANY OF THESE INITIATIVES ARE LEADING-EDGE, BOTH IN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, AND ARE DELIVERING BOTH INCREASED REVENUE AND MARGIN EXPANSION.

IN

ORDER TO SUPPORT THIS GROWTH, IBM CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE MARKETS TO EXPAND CAPACITY, TO DEVELOP TALENT AND TO DEEPEN ITS R&D CAPABILITIES ON THE GROUND. AT THE

SAME TIME, IBM CONTINUES TO LEVERAGE TALENT ACROSS THE GROWTH MARKETS UNDER ITS GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE MODEL TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH ITS CLIENTS AND THE COMPANY WORLDWIDE.

BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND OPTIMIZATION

BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND OPTIMIZATION (BAO) IS THE CATEGORY OF SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT HELP ORGANIZATIONS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

ALL THE DATA AVAILABLE TO THEM FOR BETTER AND FASTER DECISION MAKING AND PROCESS OPTIMIZATION. THIS INCLUDES DATA THAT IS BEING LABELED "BIG DATA," WHICH IS DATA OF EXTREME VOLUME, DATA BEING

GENERATED AT A HIGH VELOCITY, AND NEWER VARIETIES OF DATA LIKE BLOGS, TWEETS, PICTURES, VIDEOS, UNSTRUCTURED TEXT CREATED BY THE EXPLOSION OF SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES AND THE INSTRUMENTATION OF NEARLY

EVERYTHING. BAO IS CORE TO ACHIEVING A SMARTER PLANET, HELPING LEADERS OF THIS NEW INFORMATION-CENTRIC AND INSIGHT-DRIVEN WORLD INFUSE INTELLIGENCE INTO THEIR BUSINESS PROCESSES.

2

SMARTER

ANALYTICS IS IBM'S UNIQUE OFFERING FOR THE BAO CATEGORY. WITH SMARTER ANALYTICS AND THE COMPANY'S DEEP EXPERTISE, IBM CAN HELP ORGANIZATIONS: 1) GROW, RETAIN AND SATISFY

CUSTOMERS THROUGH DEEP INSIGHT ON INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS AND SIMILAR SEGMENTS; 2) INCREASE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION, PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE, FRAUD

REDUCTION AND OPTIMIZATION OF SALES INCENTIVES AND COMPENSATION; 3) TRANSFORM THEIR FINANCIAL PROCESSES SUCH AS PLANNING, BUDGETING,

FORECASTING, FINANCIAL CONSOLIDATION, REGULATORY FILING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING; AND 4) BETTER MANAGE RISK AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.

THE

COMPANY'S APPROACH TO ANALYTICS IS TO ENSURE CLIENTS HAVE COMPLETE END-TO-END SOLUTIONS ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND FUNCTIONAL FOCUS AREAS LIKE FINANCE, SALES,

MARKETING, OPERATIONS AND RISK. THESE SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS: 1) ALIGN AROUND ALL THEIR DATABOTH TRADITIONAL AND BIG DATAAND ESTABLISH A STRONG

INFORMATION FOUNDATION; 2) APPLY ANALYTICS TO THEIR DATA SO THEY CAN ANTICIPATE AND SHAPE BUSINESS OUTCOMES, IDENTIFY PATTERNS AND GAIN INSIGHTS INTO FUTURE PERFORMANCE; 3) ENABLE

WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES WHO COLLECTIVELY MAKE THOUSANDS AND EVEN MILLIONS OF DECISIONS DAILY WITH INSIGHT THAT IS IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE SO THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE

DECISIONDECISIONS LIKE WHAT CLAIMS TO FAST TRACK IN AN INSURANCE CALL CENTER, OR WHAT OFFER IS THE BEST FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER WHO CALLS A CALL CENTER; AND 4) CREATE A

CULTURE THAT TAKES ACTION ON ANALYTICS AND THAT TRULY TRANSFORMS.

IBM

IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUALLY INNOVATING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF ANALYTIC CAPABILITIES, SYSTEMS, RESEARCH, SERVICES, DEPLOYMENT AND SKILLS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2012, THE GAME CHANGING

INNOVATIONS IN WATSON WERE APPLIED TO HEALTHCARE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES, ANALYTIC RESEARCH LIKE THE GROUND-BREAKING WORK BEING DONE ON TEMPORAL CAUSAL MODELING AND VISUALIZATION, AND INVESTMENTS IN

ANALYTIC SKILLS AND DEPLOYMENT ABILITY IN OUR NEW ANALYTICS RESEARCH CENTERS IN COLUMBUS, OHIO AND HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA.

CLOUD COMPUTING

CLOUD IS A MODEL FOR CONSUMING AND DELIVERING BUSINESS AND IT SERVICES. IT CAN DELIVER SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIES, ENABLE NEW LEVELS OF

SPEED, FLEXIBILITY AND AGILITY AND EVEN SERVE AS A TRANSFORMATIVE PLATFORM FOR BUSINESS INNOVATION. FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, CLOUD COMPUTING IS RESHAPING INDUSTRY ECOSYSTEMS, INVIGORATING PRODUCT

INNOVATION AND ENABLING NEW BUSINESS MODELS THAT LEVERAGE NEW SOURCES OF COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION. FROM AN IT PERSPECTIVE, CLOUD OFFERS IMPROVED ACCESS TO AND UTILIZATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

THROUGH USE OF HIGHLY EFFICIENT VIRTUALIZATION AND MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY, CONSUMER-STYLE USER INTERFACES AND UBIQUITOUS CONNECTIVITY, INCLUDING VIA MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES.

IBM

HAS ALREADY HELPED THOUSANDS OF ITS CLIENTS ADOPT AND LEVERAGE CLOUD COMPUTING THROUGH ITS BROAD PORTFOLIO OF IBM SMARTCLOUD PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES. ORGANIZATIONS MOVING

BEYOND INITIAL EXPLORATION OF CLOUD COMPUTING SEEK SOLUTIONS THAT ALIGN WITH THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. IBM'S BREADTH OF CLOUD CAPABILITIES GIVES IT A UNIQUE ABILITY TO HELP CLIENTS EXPLOIT THE ADVANTAGES

OF CLOUD. IBM HAS CLOUD SOLUTIONS THAT SPAN INFRASTRUCTURE, PLATFORM, APPLICATIONS AND BUSINESS PROCESS SERVICES ALL GEARED TO ENABLE CLIENTS TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS VALUE THROUGH THE RAPID

ADOPTION AND EXPLOITATION OF NEW CLOUD CAPABILITIES. IBM'S EXPERT CONSULTING, BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGIES AND A PORTFOLIO OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARE SQUARELY FOCUSED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

ENTERPRISE.

THE

COMPANY OFFERS A FULL ARRAY OF CLOUD DELIVERY MODELS, INCLUDING PRIVATE CLOUDS, PUBLIC CLOUDS AND A HYBRID OF BOTH. IBM HELPS BUILD OUT PRIVATE, ON-PREMISES CLOUD-BASED

ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROVIDE THE CONTROL, SECURITY AND ISOLATION THAT CLIENTS REQUIRE FOR THEIR MOST MISSION-CRITICAL WORKLOADS. IBM PUBLIC CLOUDS PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE, PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS AS

RAPIDLY PROVISIONED AND HIGHLY-SCALABLE CLOUD SERVICES ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS. HYBRID CLOUDS PROVIDE SEAMLESS INTEGRATION ACROSS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CLOUD MODELS,

ENSURING THE INTEROPERABILITY, PORTABILITY AND SCALABILITY THAT CLIENTS NEED TO REALIZE THE FULL VALUE OF CLOUD.

3

BUSINESS MODEL

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS MODEL IS BUILT TO SUPPORT TWO PRINCIPAL GOALS: HELPING CLIENTS TO BECOME MORE INNOVATIVE, EFFICIENT AND

COMPETITIVE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND IT SOLUTIONS; AND PROVIDING LONG-TERM VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME THROUGH STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS IN CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE SUPERIOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY PROSPECTS BASED ON THE VALUE THEY DELIVER TO CLIENTS.

THE

COMPANY'S GLOBAL CAPABILITIES INCLUDE SERVICES, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH AND RELATED FINANCING. THE BROAD MIX OF BUSINESSES AND CAPABILITIES ARE COMBINED TO PROVIDE

INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS.

THE

BUSINESS MODEL IS RESILIENT, ADAPTING TO THE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING MARKET AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DIVEST CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION

THROUGH STRATEGIC ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN HIGHER- VALUE SEGMENTS LIKE BUSINESS ANALYTICS, SMARTER PLANET AND CLOUD COMPUTING. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO A

GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE WHICH HAS IMPROVED OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY AND IS DRIVING INVESTMENT AND EXPANDING PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING MARKETS.

THIS

BUSINESS MODEL, SUPPORTED BY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL MODEL, HAS ENABLED THE COMPANY TO DELIVER STRONG EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE LONG TERM.

TECHNOLOGIES TO IBM'S PORTFOLIO EVERY YEAR AND HELPS CLIENTS ADDRESS THEIR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. IBM RESEARCH ALSO EXPLORES THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYFROM

NANOTECHNOLOGY, TO FUTURE SYSTEMS, TO BIG DATA ANALYTICS, TO SECURE CLOUDS, TO IBM WATSON, A "COGNITIVE" LEARNING SYSTEM THAT APPLIED ADVANCED ANALYTICS TO DEFEAT THE ALL-TIME CHAMPIONS ON

THE TELEVISION QUIZ SHOW,

JEOPARDY!

. THE WATSON SYSTEM HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE MARKET FOR ADVANCED HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS AND IS BEING FURTHER

DEVELOPED AND EXTENDED WITHIN HEALTHCARE AND IN OTHER INDUSTRIES.

IBM

RESEARCH ALSO FOCUSES ON DIFFERENTIATING IBM'S SERVICES BUSINESSES PROVIDING NEW CAPABILITIES AND SOLUTIONS. IT HAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT OF ANY PUBLIC COMPANY,

ENABLING IBM TO CREATE UNIQUE ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS AND ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH CLIENTS ON THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGES.

IN

2012, IBM WAS AWARDED MORE U.S. PATENTS THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THE 20TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR. IBM'S 6,478 PATENTS IN 2012 INCLUDED INVENTIONS THAT WILL ENABLE FUNDAMENTAL

ADVANCEMENTS IN ANALYTICS, BIG DATA, CYBERSECURITY, CLOUD, MOBILE, SOCIAL NETWORKING AND SOFTWARE DEFINED ENVIRONMENTS,

AS WELL AS INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS FOR RETAIL, BANKING, HEALTHCARE, AND TRANSPORTATION. IT WAS THE MOST U.S. PATENTS EVER AWARDED TO ONE COMPANY IN A SINGLE YEAR.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY SEEK INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR ITS INNOVATIONS, WHILE INCREASING EMPHASIS ON OTHER INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

LEADERSHIP. SOME OF IBM'S TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE LICENSED AND MAY BE USED IN EITHER/BOTH IBM PRODUCTS AND/OR THE PRODUCTS OF THE LICENSEE.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE,

OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS.

ENTERPRISE TRANSFORMATION

A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON BECOMING THE PREMIER GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE. THE COMPANY HAS

IMPLEMENTED A CONSISTENT SET OF PROCESSES AND STANDARDS WORLDWIDE TO REDUCE INEFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE COLLABORATION. WITH ITS PROCESSES FULLY STANDARDIZED, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW OPERATING

MODEL WITH WORK SHARED IN GLOBAL RESOURCE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE LOCATED WHERE IT MADE THE MOST BUSINESS SENSE. THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED RESOURCES TOWARD BUILDING CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND EMPLOYEE

SKILLS, WHILE POSITIONING THE COMPANY FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. DURING THIS TRANSFORMATION, IBM PIONEERED THIS NEW OPERATING MODEL, CHANGING FROM A CLASSIC "MULTINATIONAL," WITH SMALLER VERSIONS

OF THE PARENT COMPANY REPLICATED IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, TO A GLOBAL MODEL WITH ONE SET OF PROCESSES, SHARED SERVICES AND BROADLY DISTRIBUTED DECISION MAKING.

THE

COMPANY HAS NOW EMBARKED ON THE NEXT GENERATION OF ITS TRANSFORMATION IN WHICH NEW CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES LIKE BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND CLOUD COMPUTING WILL DRIVE PERFORMANCE.

THE PROVEN PRINCIPLES OF THE GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL OF THE COMPANY'S SPENDING TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTIVITY BENEFITS IN SHARED SERVICES,

END-TO-END PROCESS TRANSFORMATION AND INTEGRATED OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY REINVESTS THE BENEFITS OF ITS ENTERPRISE TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVES IN REMIXING ITS SPENDING

PROFILE AND RESOURCES TO THE HIGHER GROWTH, HIGHER MARGIN INITIATIVES SUCH AS BUSINESS ANALYTICS, SMARTER PLANET AND CLOUD COMPUTING, IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING PROFITABILITY.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

IBM SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $35 BILLION ANNUALLY THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES GLOBALLY. IN ADDITION,

IN 2012, THE COMPANY MANAGED APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION IN PROCUREMENT SPENDING FOR ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THE GLOBAL PROCESS SERVICES ORGANIZATION. THE SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING, AND LOGISTICS AND

CUSTOMER FULFILLMENT OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED IN ONE OPERATING UNIT THAT HAS OPTIMIZED INVENTORIES OVER TIME. SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES HAS IMPROVED SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND

OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY AGAINST MARKETPLACE CHANGES AND RISKS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN MAINTAINING CONTINUITY DURING

NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER DISRUPTIVE EVENTS.

THE

COMPANY'S CONTINUING EFFORTS TO DERIVE BUSINESS VALUE FROM ITS OWN GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN PROVIDES A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY TO CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS. IBM

LEVERAGES ITS SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERTISE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING SERVICE TO OPTIMIZE AND HELP OPERATE CLIENTS' END-TO-END SUPPLY

CHAIN PROCESSES, FROM PROCUREMENT TO LOGISTICS.

INCREASINGLY

THE COMPANY IS USING ANALYTICS TO MEASURE, MANAGE AND FINE TUNE ITS SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, WHICH WILL HELP TO RESHAPE ITS OPERATIONS AND CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS. THE GOAL

IS TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE USE OF ANALYTICS IN THE FIVE MAJOR AREAS OF SUPPLY CHAIN: 1) SUPPLY CHAIN VISIBILITY, 2) RISK MANAGEMENT, 3) CUSTOMER INSIGHT, 4) COST

CONTAINMENT, AND 5) GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN AND SUSTAINABILITY.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY-INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, OPERATING IN MORE THAN 170 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT, WHERE ITS COMPETITORS VARY BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT, AND RANGE FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES TO SMALLER, MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED ENTITIES. OVERALL, ACROSS ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES HUNDREDS OF COMPETITORS WORLDWIDE.

ACROSS

ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION ARE: TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; PRICE; QUALITY; BRAND; ITS BROAD RANGE OF CAPABILITIES, PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES; CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; THE ABILITY TO DELIVER BUSINESS VALUE TO CLIENTS; AND, SERVICE AND SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP, A CORPORATION MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST, INNOVATE AND

INTEGRATE. THE COMPANY HAS

9

BEEN

EXECUTING A STRATEGY TO TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING SHIFTING TO HIGHER VALUE MARKET SEGMENTS AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASING ITS CAPABILITIES THROUGH ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS. AS THE COMPANY EXECUTES ITS STRATEGY, IT ENTERS NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS SMARTER PLANET AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS, WHICH EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO NEW COMPETITORS. OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS THE

LEADER OR AMONG THE LEADERS IN EACH OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

A

SUMMARY OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS INCLUDED BELOW.

GLOBAL SERVICES.

THE SERVICES SEGMENTS, GTS AND GBS, OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CONTINUALLY EVOLVING GLOBAL MARKET. GTS COMPETES IN STRATEGIC

OUTSOURCING, BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING, CLOUD SERVICES, AND A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNICAL AND IT SUPPORT SERVICES. GBS COMPETES IN CONSULTING, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND APPLICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS INCLUDE: TECHNICAL SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES, INNOVATIVE SERVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE, VALUE AND SPEED,

PRICE, CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, QUALITY OF SALES AND DELIVERY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE SERVICES BUSINESS INCLUDE ITS GLOBAL

REACH AND SCALE, GLOBAL DELIVERY MODEL, BEST-OF-BREED PROCESS AND INDUSTRY SKILLS, EXTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY EXPERTISE, SERVICES ASSETS, AN ABILITY TO DELIVER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS

THAT CAN ADDRESS CLIENTS' NEEDS IN ANY ENVIRONMENT AND A STRONG SET OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS AND STRATEGIC BUSINESS PARTNERS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BROAD BASED COMPETITORS

INCLUDING: ACCENTURE, AMAZON.COM, INC., COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION, FUJITSU AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (HP); INDIA-BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS; THE CONSULTING PRACTICES OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS; AND

MANY COMPANIES THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON LOCAL MARKETS OR NICHE SERVICE AREAS.

SOFTWARE.

THE ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND, INCREASINGLY, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT

SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE BUSINESS OUTCOMES FOR THEIR CLIENTS. THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE: FUNCTIONALITY, EASE-OF-USE, SCALABILITY, OPEN

STANDARDS, TOTAL COST-OF-OWNERSHIP AND BUSINESS VALUE. IBM'S LEADERSHIP IN EACH OF THESE AREAS, AND THE ABILITY TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS THAT DRIVE BUSINESS RESULTS, PROVIDES IT

WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE BUSINESS INCLUDES MIDDLEWARE, SOLUTIONS OFFERINGS AND OPERATING

SYSTEMS. THE MIDDLEWARE PORTFOLIO IS THE BROADEST IN THE INDUSTRY AND COVERS BOTH MAINFRAME AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. THE MIDDLEWARE PORTFOLIO ALSO UNDERPINS IBM'S SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND

ENHANCES THE BUSINESS VALUE THE COMPANY BRINGS TO CLIENTS. THE SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY- SPECIFIC OFFERINGS TO NEW TYPES OF IT DECISION MAKERS, SUCH AS CHIEF

MARKETING AND PROCUREMENT OFFICERS, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICERS, AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS. THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, COUPLED WITH ITS GLOBAL SALES AND

TECHNICAL SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, DIFFERENTIATE THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS FROM ITS COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PATENT PORTFOLIO ALSO

CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SEGMENT'S LEADERSHIP. THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS IN THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE CA, INC., MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ORACLE CORPORATION (ORACLE). THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES

WITH SMALLER, NICHE COMPETITORS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC OR PRODUCT MARKETS WORLDWIDE.

SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY.

THE ENTERPRISE SERVER AND STORAGE MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY ONGOING TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, WITH COMPETITION

FOCUSED ON VALUE, FUNCTION AND RELIABILITY, AND NEW ENTRANTS LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO COMPETE AGAINST TRADITIONAL OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. (CISCO),

DELL, INC., EMC CORPORATION, HP AND ORACLE. THE COMPANY'S LEADERSHIP IN VIRTUALIZATION, POWER MANAGEMENT, SECURITY, MULTI-OPERATING SYSTEM CAPABILITIES AND THE ABILITY OF ITS SYSTEMS PLATFORMS

TO LEVERAGE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, FROM THE COMPANY'S CUSTOM

10

SEMICONDUCTORS

THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STACK TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND LOWER COST, PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THIS SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

CAPABILITIES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PATENT PORTFOLIO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THIS SEGMENT'S LEADERSHIP.

GLOBAL FINANCING.

GLOBAL FINANCING PROVIDES CLIENT FINANCING, COMMERCIAL FINANCING AND PARTICIPATES IN THE REMARKETING OF USED EQUIPMENT. THE ECONOMIC

CRISIS OF 2008 AND 2009 DROVE AN INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS AND A TIGHTENING SUPPLY OF CREDIT WHICH HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY EASED. HOWEVER, GOING FORWARD CREDIT SPREADS MAY INCREASE AND THE SUPPLY OF CREDIT

MAY TIGHTEN BASED ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. GLOBAL FINANCING'S ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE INCREASED EXPOSURES

PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY. THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE PRICE, IT PRODUCT EXPERTISE, CLIENT SERVICE, CONTRACT FLEXIBILITY, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND

RESIDUAL VALUES. IN CLIENT AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING, GLOBAL FINANCING COMPETES WITH THREE TYPES OF COMPANIES IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES TO IT CUSTOMERS: OTHER CAPTIVE FINANCING ENTITIES OF

COMPANIES SUCH AS CISCO AND HP AND NON-CAPTIVE FINANCING ENTITIES OF COMPANIES SUCH AS GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND BANKS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN REMARKETING, THE COMPANY COMPETES

WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL BROKERS PLUS ORIGINAL MANUFACTURERS IN THE FRAGMENTED WORLDWIDE USED IT EQUIPMENT MARKET.

MR.

DANIELS WILL RETIRE ON MARCH 31, 2013, AFTER A 36-YEAR CAREER WITH THE COMPANY.

ALL

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE ELECTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SERVE UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION OF OFFICERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS AS PROVIDED IN THE

BY-LAWS. EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER NAMED ABOVE HAS BEEN AN EXECUTIVE OF IBM OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE IT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS,

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CORPORATE BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND

FUNCTIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES AND OFFERINGS IN BOTH EMERGING AND MORE ESTABLISHED MARKETS. THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES MAY NOT YIELD THEIR INTENDED GAINS IN QUALITY,

PRODUCTIVITY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVENESS AND ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM CERTAIN

SEGMENTS OF THE IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE

INNOVATION IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS ONGOING

12

EFFORTS

TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE

PERCEPTIONS, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING HIGHER-VALUE SEGMENTS OF ENTERPRISE COMPUTING, CLOUD COMPUTING, AND NEW AND EMERGING MARKETS AND COUNTRIES TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. CLIENT ADOPTION

RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE LESS CERTAIN IN THE HIGH-VALUE AND RAPIDLY-GROWING SEGMENTS, AND NEW DELIVERY MODELS MAY UNFAVORABLY IMPACT DEMAND FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, IT NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL. IN EMERGING GROWTH

COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE PRESENTS POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS FROM INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION

AND CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS MAY AFFECT

CRITICAL THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR INVOLVE THE STORAGE, PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES,

CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. BREACHES OF SECURITY COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS TO RISKS OF LOSS, INCLUDING THE MISUSE OF INFORMATION OR SYSTEMS, RESULTING IN LITIGATION AND POTENTIAL

LIABILITY FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY'S BRAND AND REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPLEMENTING

FURTHER DATA PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. ALSO, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY EXISTING AND PROPOSED LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES

AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE NATURE OF ITS CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES; FOR

EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW BY REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. AS A RESULT

OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS HAD LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH

QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS

BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER.

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 170 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR

13

INADEQUATE

ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY'S OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS, INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. FURTHER,

AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE SCOPE OF ITS OFFERINGS, BOTH WITHIN THE U.S. AND GLOBALLY, IT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR OTHER RISKS. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD

OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS, PANDEMIC OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR ANY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS

ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS

EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE

EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION

PLANS.

ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE

ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY

COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PREMIUMS FOR MANDATORY PENSION INSOLVENCY INSURANCE COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE U.S. PREMIUM INCREASES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE LEVEL OF

INSOLVENCIES OF UNRELATED COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY AT ISSUE. CURRENTLY, CANADA, GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE UNITED KINGDOM REQUIRE THAT THESE PREMIUMS BE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND NOT OUT OF

PLAN ASSETS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. IBM'S 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING PENSION MATTERS.

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS,

14

OR

IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS AND FUTURE EVENTS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY'S MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE M,

"CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO

STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, ACTUAL

FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE

IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED WORKERS LEAVE THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, AS GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY DEMAND SHIFTS, REALIGNMENT, TRAINING AND SCALING OF SKILLED RESOURCES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY RAPID. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A

TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY

AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. CHANGES

IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO

DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES

OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES, RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FUNDING APPROVAL.

ALSO, SOME AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE AND PROVIDING FOR HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COULD BE SUSPENDED

OR DEBARRED AS A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACTOR AND COULD INCUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A

SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES AND COSTS FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S.

CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE

THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; DERIVATIVES INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

15

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS

ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF

THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS

ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS THE COMPANY MOVES INTO NEW AREAS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE

UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND ENABLE APPROPRIATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH OBJECTIVES.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS RELATING TO THE

INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO

ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO

LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF

INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A.

ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT

16

MAKE

A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF

18 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 16 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 2 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 3 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS

BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 14 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED

6 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 2 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING

OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

THE

MATERIAL FEATURES OF EACH EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN UNDER WHICH EQUITY SECURITIES ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE THAT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

THE 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "2001 PLAN") HAS BEEN USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN SENIOR

EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY

21

HAVE

BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED FROM THE STOCKHOLDER-APPROVED 1999 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "1999 PLAN"); THE 1999 PLAN IS ALSO USED TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN

SENIOR EXECUTIVES. OTHERWISE, THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN ARE IDENTICAL TO THE 1999 PLAN, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN (STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNIT

AWARDS AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE AWARDS).

THE

2001 PLAN IS ADMINISTERED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THAT COMMITTEE MAY DELEGATE TO OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY

CERTAIN OF ITS DUTIES, POWERS AND AUTHORITY. PAYMENT OF AWARDS MAY BE MADE IN THE FORM OF CASH, STOCK OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF AND MAY BE DEFERRED WITH COMMITTEE APPROVAL. AWARDS ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE

OR ASSIGNABLE EXCEPT (I) BY LAW, WILL OR THE LAWS OF DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION, (II) AS A RESULT OF THE DISABILITY OF THE RECIPIENT, OR (III) WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE COMMITTEE.

IF

THE EMPLOYMENT OF A PARTICIPANT TERMINATES, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF A PARTICIPANT, ALL UNEXERCISED, DEFERRED AND UNPAID AWARDS SHALL BE CANCELED

IMMEDIATELY, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT PROVIDES OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT OR IN THE EVENT A PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE DISABLED AND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE IBM LONG-TERM DISABILITY PLAN (OR ANY SUCCESSOR PLAN OR SIMILAR PLAN OF ANOTHER EMPLOYER), THE PARTICIPANT'S ESTATE, BENEFICIARIES OR REPRESENTATIVE, AS THE CASE MAY

BE, SHALL HAVE THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTICIPANT UNDER THE APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT SPECIFIES OTHERWISE, THE COMMITTEE MAY CANCEL, RESCIND, SUSPEND,

WITHHOLD OR OTHERWISE LIMIT OR RESTRICT ANY UNEXPIRED, UNPAID, OR DEFERRED AWARDS AT ANY TIME IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE AWARD AGREEMENT AND THE

PLAN. IN ADDITION, AWARDS MAY BE CANCELLED IF THE PARTICIPANT ENGAGES IN ANY CONDUCT OR ACT DETERMINED TO BE INJURIOUS, DETRIMENTAL OR PREJUDICIAL TO ANY INTEREST OF THE COMPANY.

PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

THE IBM PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (THE "PWCC PLAN") WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION

WITH THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS CONSULTING ("PWCC") FROM PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 1, 2002. THE PWCC PLAN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO

BE USED SOLELY TO FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OF PWCC WHO HAVE COME OVER TO THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE FUNDED FROM THE PWCC PLAN.

THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PWCC PLAN ARE SUBSTANTIVELY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN, DESCRIBED ABOVE.

IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN

THE IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN (THE "DCEAP") WAS ADOPTED IN 1993. UNDER THE DCEAP, NON-MANAGEMENT

DIRECTORS RECEIVE PROMISED FEE SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH DEFERRED ANNUAL RETAINER PAYMENTS. EACH PROMISED FEE SHARE IS EQUAL IN VALUE TO ONE SHARE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. UPON A DIRECTOR'S

RETIREMENT OR OTHER COMPLETION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR, ALL AMOUNTS DEFERRED INTO PROMISED FEE SHARES ARE PAYABLE IN EITHER CASH AND/OR SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT THE DIRECTOR'S ELECTION. (FOR
