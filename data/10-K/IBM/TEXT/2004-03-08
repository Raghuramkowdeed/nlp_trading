PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO.

(C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO., AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME, IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION

OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INVENTION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED 80 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: IBM IS THE LARGEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE WORLD, THE WORLD'S LARGEST BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICES COMPANY, THE

WORLD'S LARGEST CONSULTING SERVICES ORGANIZATION, THE WORLD'S LARGEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST FINANCIER OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

OVER

THE PAST DECADE, IBM HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE IT MARKET'S SHIFT OF FOCUS FROM SELLING HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES, TO THE CREATION OF SOLUTIONS TO CLIENTS' BUSINESS PROBLEMS.

DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE INTERNET'S ENTRY INTO MAINSTREAM COMMERCE, COMMUNICATIONS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE MID-TO LATE-1990S, VALUE WAS CREATED FIRST THROUGH PROVIDING WIDESPREAD ACCESS

AND THEN THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF BUSINESS PROCESSES, SUCH AS SUPPLY CHAIN, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND HUMAN RESOURCES. TODAY, IBM IS ONCE AGAIN LEADING THE INDUSTRY TOWARD THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL,

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF ON DEMAND BUSINESS.

IN

ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CLIENTS, IBM HAS FOUND THAT A MAJORITY OF ENTERPRISES ARE CONCERNED WITH FOUR MAIN ISSUES.



DEMAND

FOR FASTER INNOVATION



REDUCING

EXPENSES



INTEGRATION

ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION'S "VALUE CHAIN" (REPRESENTING EVERY TRANSACTION OR INTERACTION WITHIN AN ENTERPRISE, WITH OTHER ENTERPRISES, AND WITH INDIVIDUALS)



DEMAND

FOR PREDICTABLE RETURN ON INVESTMENT

BY

REDESIGNING THEIR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, SUPPORTED BY AND ENABLED BY NEW SYSTEMS OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS, THESE CLIENTS ARE SEEKING TO BECOME "ON DEMAND"

BUSINESSES.

IBM

DEFINES AN ON DEMAND BUSINESS AS AN ENTERPRISE WHOSE BUSINESS PROCESSES ARE.



RESPONSIVE

TO ANY CLIENT DEMAND, MARKET OPPORTUNITY, OR EXTERNAL THREAT;



INTEGRATED

END-TO-END ACROSS THE COMPANY; AND



INTEGRATED

ACROSS INDUSTRY VALUE NETS, THE INTERCONNECTED CHAINS OF PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND CLIENTS.

AN

ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF AN ON DEMAND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IS THAT ITS INFRASTRUCTURE BE BASED ON INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS "OPEN STANDARDS"). IN IBM'S

VIEW, AN INVESTMENT IN SUCH AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDES THE GREATEST RETURNS, RATHER THAN RELYING ON PROPRIETARY CONTROL BY A SINGLE COMPANY OR AFFILIATION OF COMPANIES. ONE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN

THIS REGARD IS THE EMERGENCE OF "OPEN SOURCE" OPERATING SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES THAT BENEFIT FROM FURTHER

DEVELOPMENT BY THE BUSINESS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) COMMUNITIES, AS IN THE CASE OF THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM OR THE JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

HOWEVER,

TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS OF AN ON DEMAND ENVIRONMENT, SOLUTIONS WITH THE HIGHEST RETURNS ALSO REQUIRE THE TRANSFORMATION AND INTEGRATION OF BUSINESS PROCESSES WITHIN AND

AMONG INSTITUTIONS.

IBM'S

CLIENTS INCLUDE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENTERPRISES, FROM SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND COMPANIES, REPRESENTING EVERY MAJOR INDUSTRY

AND ENDEAVOR.

OVER

THE PAST DECADE, IBM HAS EXITED OR GREATLY DE-EMPHASIZED ITS INVOLVEMENT IN CONSUMER MARKETS AND DIVESTED ITSELF OF OTHER NON-CORE BUSINESSES TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

ENTERPRISE MARKET. IN IBM'S VIEW, THE ENTERPRISE MARKET REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE IT INDUSTRY'S REVENUE, AS WELL AS TWICE THE GROWTH AND THREE TIMES THE PROFITS COMPARED

TO CONSUMER AREAS OF THE INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, IBM HAS MADE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTED IN EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IMPORTANT TO ITS ENTERPRISE CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE SINCE

GROWN TO A POINT WHERE THEIR REVENUE AND OPPORTUNITY NOW CAN BE CONSIDERED PART OF IBM'S MAINLINE BUSINESSES. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S ENTERPRISE BUSINESS, WHICH EXCLUDES THE COMPANY'S ORIGINAL

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS, OCCURS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE BROADLY GROUPED INTO SIX SECTORS AROUND WHICH THE COMPANY'S SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS AN INCREASING

NUMBER OF ITS SERVICES AND PRODUCTS BUSINESSES ARE ORGANIZED.

THE IT INDUSTRY AND IBM'S STRATEGY

IBM OPERATES IN BOTH THE BUSINESS SERVICES AND IT INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES.



BUSINESS

VALUE



INFRASTRUCTURE

VALUE



COMPONENT

VALUE

THE

PRIMARY RATIONALE FOR IBM'S INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPONENT VALUE CATEGORY IS TO PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE VALUE CATEGORY, WHICH IN TURN IS CONSIDERED A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE BUSINESS VALUE CATEGORY.

IBM

SEES A SHIFT IN REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH UP FROM COMPONENT VALUE TO INFRASTRUCTURE VALUE AND INTO THE BUSINESS VALUE CATEGORY, WHERE REVENUE AND PROFIT POTENTIAL ARE THOUGHT TO BE

GREATEST IN THE DECADE AHEAD.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

ORGANIZATIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S MAJOR OPERATIONS COMPRISE A GLOBAL SERVICES SEGMENT; THREE HARDWARE PRODUCT SEGMENTSSYSTEMS GROUP, PERSONAL SYSTEMS

GROUP AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP; A SOFTWARE SEGMENT; AND A GLOBAL FINANCING SEGMENT. SEE THE IT INDUSTRY AND IBM'S STRATEGY SECTION ABOVE FOR THE SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES RELATING TO THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

GLOBAL SERVICES

IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY OF PROVIDING INSIGHT AND SOLUTIONS TO CLIENTS. WHILE SOLUTIONS OFTEN

INCLUDE INDUSTRY-LEADING IBM SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE, OTHER SUPPLIERS' PRODUCTS ARE ALSO USED IF A SPECIFIC CLIENT SOLUTION REQUIRES IT. GLOBAL SERVICES OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS AS

WELL AS BCS CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES ARE TYPICALLY SEVEN TO TEN YEARS IN DURATION. OTHER CONTRACTS RANGE IN PERIODS GENERALLY UP TO ONE YEAR, INCLUDING CONSULTING

CONTRACTS AND ITS.

THE

COMPANY'S NEW BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING (BTO) CAPABILITIES COMBINE THE INSIGHT OF BCS WITH THE COMPANY'S PROCESS OUTSOURCING CAPABILITIES TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF A CLIENT'S BUSINESS PROCESSES IN AREAS INCLUDING HUMAN RESOURCES, PROCUREMENT, CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGEMENT, FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION, AMONG OTHERS. THE COMPANY WILL

ONLY ENTER INTO BTO AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS WHEN IT BELIEVES THAT IBM CAN LEVERAGE ITS BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY TO DRIVE CLIENT PRODUCTIVITY AND COST IMPROVEMENTS. THESE GENERALLY ARE

LARGE-SCALE, MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS RANGING UP TO TEN YEARS IN LENGTH THAT INCLUDE THE OPERATION TRANSFORMATION OF THE CLIENT'S BUSINESS PROCESSES. BTO ENGAGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE SUPPORT AND INVOLVEMENT OF

VARIOUS BUSINESS UNITS THAT HAVE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS BCS, APPLICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES, E-BUSINESS HOSTING SERVICES, MIDDLEWARE AND HARDWARE.

SYSTEMS GROUP

PROVIDES BUSINESS SOLUTIONS TO CLIENTS. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE SYSTEMS GROUP'S SALES TRANSACTIONS ARE THROUGH BUSINESS

PARTNERS AND APPROXIMATELY 46 PERCENT ARE DIRECT TO CLIENTS, SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF WHICH ARE THROUGH THE WEB AT IBM.COM. WHILE APPROPRIATELY NOT REPORTED AS EXTERNAL REVENUE, HARDWARE IS

ALSO DEPLOYED TO SUPPORT GLOBAL SERVICES SOLUTIONS.

TECHNOLOGY GROUP

PROVIDES LEADING SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS, PACKAGING SOLUTIONS AND ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY SERVICES TO OEM

CLIENTS (APPROXIMATELY 78 PERCENT) AND, ALTHOUGH APPROPRIATELY NOT REPORTED AS EXTERNAL REVENUE, TO THE SYSTEMS GROUP (APPROXIMATELY 21 PERCENT).

USING

A "ONE-TEAM" APPROACH, SYSTEMS GROUP WORKS HAND-IN-HAND WITH THE TECHNOLOGY GROUP ON PRODUCT PLANNING AND STRATEGY GIVEN THE HIGH CONTENT LEVEL

OF TECHNOLOGY GROUP COMPONENTS INSIDE SYSTEMS GROUP PRODUCTS. IN RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASING DEGREE OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO SEGMENTS AND AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 118 OF THE IBM 2003 ANNUAL

REPORT WHICH IS HEREBY INCORPORATED

5

BY

REFERENCE, THE COMPANY COMBINED THE SYSTEMS GROUP AND THE TECHNOLOGY GROUP IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004.

PERSONAL SYSTEMS GROUP

INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S LINES OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, PRINTERS AND POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS.

THESE OFFERINGS ARE DESIGNED TO ASSIST CLIENTS TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND TO REDUCE CLIENTS' TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP.

SOFTWARE

CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF MIDDLEWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEMS SOFTWARE. MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE ENABLES CLIENTS TO INTEGRATE SYSTEMS,

PROCESSES, AND APPLICATIONS ACROSS THE CLIENTS' ENTERPRISE THROUGH THE USE OF OPEN STANDARDS. MIDDLEWARE IS DESIGNED TO BE THE UNDERLYING SUPPORT FOR APPLICATIONS PROVIDED BY BUSINESS PARTNER

INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS (ISVS) WHO BUILD INDUSTRY- OR PROCESS-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS ACCORDING TO OPEN INDUSTRY STANDARDS. OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE THE ENGINES THAT RUN COMPUTERS. APPROXIMATELY

70 PERCENT OF SOFTWARE VOLUMES ARE DIRECTLY WITH THE END-USER CLIENTS AND ABOUT 20 PERCENT ARE THROUGH BUSINESS PARTNERS. WHILE APPROPRIATELY NOT REPORTED AS EXTERNAL

REVENUE, THE REMAINDER IS DEPLOYED INTERNALLY TO SUPPORT GLOBAL SERVICES SOLUTIONS.

APPROXIMATELY

40 PERCENT OF EXTERNAL SOFTWARE REVENUE RELATES TO ONE-TIME CHARGE (OTC) ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY THE CLIENT PAYS ONE UP-FRONT PAYMENT FOR A

LIFETIME LICENSE. TYPICALLY, ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF OTC SOFTWARE INCLUDE ONE YEAR OF MAINTENANCE. THE CLIENT CAN ALSO PURCHASE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, WHICH INCLUDES PRODUCT

UPGRADES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. THE REMAINING SOFTWARE IS SOLD ON A MONTHLY LICENSE CHARGE ARRANGEMENT.

GLOBAL FINANCING

IS DESCRIBED ON PAGES 69 TO 73 OF THE IBM 2003 ANNUAL REPORT WHICH ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

ENTERPRISE INVESTMENTS

DEVELOPS AND PROVIDES INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC IT SOLUTIONS SUPPORTING THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND GLOBAL SERVICES SEGMENTS

OF THE COMPANY. PRIMARY PRODUCT LINES INCLUDE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENT PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES. PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE PRIMARILY SERVES THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR

AND HELPS CLIENTS MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING OF THEIR PRODUCTS. DOCUMENT PROCESSOR PRODUCTS SERVICE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR AND INCLUDE PRODUCTS THAT ENABLE ELECTRONIC BANKING.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS

THE FOLLOWING THREE COMPANY-WIDE ORGANIZATIONS PLAY KEY ROLES IN IBM'S DELIVERY OF VALUE TO ITS CLIENTS.



SALES

AND DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION, AND RELATED SALES CHANNELS



RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



SUPPLY

CHAIN

SALES & DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION

IBM OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH ITS GLOBAL SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS. CONSISTENT WITH IBM'S FOCUS ON BUSINESS VALUE, THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL CORPS OF

ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVES COMBINE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF EACH CLIENT'S ORGANIZATIONAL AND INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC NEEDS WITH COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES OFFERED BY IBM

AND ITS NETWORK OF BUSINESS PARTNERS.

IBM

ALSO OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF OTHER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CHANNELS: FOUR OF THESE CHANNELS COMPRISE IBM'S BUSINESS PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, THROUGH WHICH THE COMPANY

RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF ITS REVENUE.

INTERNAL ROUTES-TO-MARKET

GLOBAL SERVICES CONSULTANTS: PARTICULARLY IN SELLING END-TO-END SOLUTIONS FOR LARGE, COMPLEX BUSINESS CHALLENGES, IBM VERY OFTEN RELIES ON

THE PRACTITIONERS AND CONSULTANTS WITHIN ITS GLOBAL SERVICES UNIT, AS

6

THESE

CHALLENGES GENERALLY REQUIRE INTEGRATING SERVICES AND ON DEMAND SOLUTIONS FROM IBM AND OTHER SUPPLIERS.

HARDWARE

AND SOFTWARE BRAND SPECIALISTS: IBM'S OWN HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE BRAND PRODUCT SPECIALISTS WORK FACE-TO-FACE WITH CLIENTS, SELLING IBM PLATFORMS AS PART

OF A DISCRETE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM DECISION, TYPICALLY TO "SELF-INTEGRATING" IT DEPARTMENTS.

IBM.COM.

ONLINE AND TELEPHONE SALES AND ASSISTANCE OPERATIONS HANDLE BASIC COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES AND SMALL-TO-MEDIUM BUSINESSES.

BUSINESS PARTNERS ROUTES-TO-MARKET

GLOBAL/MAJOR INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS: ISVS DELIVER BUSINESS PROCESS OR INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS AND, IN DOING SO, OFTEN INFLUENCE THE SALE OF IBM

HARDWARE, MIDDLEWARE AND SERVICES.

GLOBAL/MAJOR

SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS (SIS): SIS IDENTIFY BUSINESS PROBLEMS AND DESIGN SOLUTIONS WHEN GLOBAL SERVICES IS NOT THE PREFERRED SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR; THEY ALSO SELL COMPUTING

INFRASTRUCTURES FROM IBM AND ITS COMPETITORS.

REGIONAL

ISVS AND SIS: SIS IDENTIFY THE BUSINESS PROBLEMS, AND ISVS DELIVER BUSINESS PROCESS OR INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS TO MEDIUM-SIZED AND LARGE BUSINESSES REQUIRING IBM

COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE OFFERINGS.

SOLUTIONS

PROVIDERS, RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS: RESELLERS SELL IBM PLATFORMS AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICES AS PART OF A DISCRETE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM DECISION TO CLIENTS WANTING THIRD-PARTY

ASSISTANCE.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) OPERATIONS DIFFERENTIATE IBM FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IBM ANNUALLY SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION FOR R&D, INCLUDING

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, FOCUSING ITS INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. RECENT SUCH EFFORTS INCLUDE E-BUSINESS, INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT LINUX, MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS, AUTONOMIC COMPUTING, ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SUPPORTING ON DEMAND. AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS, IBM WAS ONCE AGAIN AWARDED MORE U.S.

PATENTS IN 2003 THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY. THIS MARKS THE 11TH YEAR IN A ROW THAT IBM ACHIEVED THIS DISTINCTION.

A

KEY TRANSFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE OVER THE PAST DECADE AND CONTINUES TODAY IS THE CHANGE IN THE FOCUS AND THE CULTURE OF IBM'S R&D ORGANIZATION TO BE MORE CLOSELY LINKED TO

AND PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC AND CLIENT-SPECIFIC NEEDS. SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY THIS CHANGING FOCUS, SUCH AS AUTONOMIC COMPUTING AND LINUX DEVELOPMENTS, AS MENTIONED

ABOVE.

IN

ADDITION TO PRODUCING WORLD-CLASS PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS, THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN R&D ALSO RESULT IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) INCOME. SOME OF IBM'S

TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE USED BY THE COMPANY'S LICENSEES FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WHEN THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY IS NOT STRATEGIC TO IBM'S BUSINESS GOALS.

A THIRD GROUP IS BOTH USED INTERNALLY AND LICENSED EXTERNALLY.

IN

ADDITION TO THESE IP INCOME SOURCES, THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES VALUE FROM ITS PATENT PORTFOLIO THROUGH CROSS-LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS AND IP LICENSED IN DIVESTITURE TRANSACTIONS.

CROSS-LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE LICENSING OF THE COMPANY'S IP TO A THIRD PARTY IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RIGHT TO USE THIRD PARTY'S IP. THE VALUE OF THESE OTHER TWO SOURCES IS NOT READILY APPARENT IN

THE FINANCIAL RESULTS ON PAGES 54 AND 74 OF THE IBM 2003 ANNUAL REPORT WHICH ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE, DUE TO THE FACT THAT INCOME ON CROSS-LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS IS RECORDED ONLY

TO THE EXTENT CASH IS RECEIVED. THE VALUE RECEIVED BY IBM FOR IP TRANSFERRED IN DIVESTITURE TRANSACTIONS IS INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE DIVESTITURE, NOT IN THE SEPARATELY DISPLAYED

IP INCOME AMOUNTS ON PAGES 54 AND 74 OF THE IBM 2003 ANNUAL REPORT WHICH ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

7

SUPPLY CHAIN

JUST AS IBM WORKS TO TRANSFORM ITS CLIENTS' SUPPLY CHAINS FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND RESPONSIVENESS TO MARKET CONDITIONS, IBM HAS UNDERTAKEN A LARGE-SCALE

INITIATIVE TO RE-CAST IBM'S OWN SUPPLY CHAIN AS AN ON DEMAND BUSINESS OPERATION, THEREBY TURNING WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN A COST/EXPENSE TO BE MANAGED INTO A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE

COMPANY AND, ULTIMATELY, FOR ITS CLIENTS.

IBM

SPENDS NEARLY $39 BILLION ANNUALLY IN ITS SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES AROUND THE WORLD. PRIOR TO 2002, THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING, AND DISTRIBUTION

OPERATIONS WERE SPREAD ACROSS ITS PRODUCT BRANDS AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE ARE NOW INTEGRATED IN ONE OPERATING UNIT THAT CAN.



UNDERSTAND

AND RESPOND TO MARKETPLACE OPPORTUNITIES AND EXTERNAL RISKS, AS WELL AS THE NEEDS OF CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES AND PARTNERS



CONVERT

FIXED COSTS TO VARIABLE COSTS



SIMPLIFY

AND STREAMLINE INTERNAL OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROCESSES AND THEREBY, CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCES OF THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS

WHEN WORKING WITH IBM



REDUCE

INVENTORIES

THE

COST SAVINGS THIS UNIT GENERATES PROVIDES TWO OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY: DIRECTLY IMPROVE FINANCIAL RESULTS MOSTLY THROUGH IMPROVED GROSS PROFIT MARGINS OR IMPROVE

COMPETITIVENESS AND MARKET SHARE BY PASSING SOME OR ALL OF THE COST SAVINGS TO CLIENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COST SAVINGS GENERATED BY

THIS UNIT WILL NOT ALWAYS RESULT IN A DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR APPARENT GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.

WHILE

THESE EFFORTS ARE LARGELY CONCERNED WITH PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND DELIVERY, IBM IS ALSO APPLYING SUPPLY CHAIN PRINCIPLES TO SERVICE DELIVERY ACROSS ITS SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES

LINES OF BUSINESS.

BY

THE END OF 2003, THE WORK OF TRANSFORMING AND INTEGRATING ITS SUPPLY CHAIN RESULTED IN THE LOWEST INVENTORY LEVELS FOR IBM IN MORE THAN 20 YEARS.

IN

ADDITION TO ITS OWN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY USES A NUMBER OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURING (CM) COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO MANUFACTURE IBM-DESIGNED PRODUCTS. THE

USE OF CM COMPANIES IS INTENDED TO GENERATE COST EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCE TIME-TO-MARKET FOR CERTAIN IBM PRODUCTS. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH CM COMPANIES ARE EXCLUSIVE. IBM HAS KEY

RELATIONSHIPS WITH SANMINA-SCI FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF MANY INTEL-BASED PRODUCTS, OR WITH SOLECTRON FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OF GLOBAL ASSET RECOVERY

SERVICESAN OPERATION OF GLOBAL FINANCING THAT RESTORES END-OF-LEASE PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND OTHER IT EQUIPMENT FOR RESALE. FURTHER, SOME IBM-BRANDED

PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY THIRD-PARTY OEMS AND THEN PURCHASED BY IBM AND RESOLD UNDER THE IBM BRAND.

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING IBM'S BUSINESS

FORWARD-LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS.

CERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT MAY CONSTITUTE "FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 ("REFORM ACT"). THE COMPANY MAY ALSO MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN MATERIALS DELIVERED TO STOCKHOLDERS AND IN PRESS RELEASES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S REPRESENTATIVES MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS PROVIDE CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND INCLUDE ANY STATEMENT THAT DOES NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO ANY HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACT. WORDS

SUCH AS "ANTICIPATES," "BELIEVES," "EXPECTS," "ESTIMATES," "INTENDS," "PLANS," "PROJECTS," AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, MAY IDENTIFY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO

UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REFORM ACT, SET FORTH BELOW ARE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THOSE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. READERS SHOULD CAREFULLY

REVIEW THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AS THEY IDENTIFY CERTAIN IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL

TRENDS. THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN ADDITION TO OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED

8

ELSEWHERE

IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, IN THE COMPANY'S FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR IN MATERIALS INCORPORATED THEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE IT SPENDING BUDGETS.

ALTHOUGH THE DIVERSE NATURE OF IBM'S CAPABILITIES SOMEWHAT MITIGATES

THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC VOLATILITY ON IBM'S RESULTS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS IMPACTED BY OVERALL MARKETPLACE SPENDING. ALTHOUGH IT SPENDING IS AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF IBM'S FINANCIAL

RESULTS, A KEY OBJECTIVE IS TO OUTPERFORM KEY COMPETITORS AND GAIN MARKET SHARE DURING STRONG AND WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS.

HARDWARE

AND A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE BUSINESS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO CHANGING DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY'S MIX OF

OFFERINGS WITH CONTRACTUAL LONG-TERM CASH AND INCOME STREAMS AND OFFERINGS WITH CYCLICAL TRANSACTION-BASED SALES, COMBINED WITH THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIES DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT TWO

PARAGRAPHS, ARE DESIGNED TO RESULT IN INCREASED MARKET SHARE GAINS IN STRONG AND WEAK ECONOMIES.

TECHNOLOGY

GROUP'S MICROELECTRONICS BUSINESS IS ALSO PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO CYCLICAL CHANGES IN THAT INDUSTRY; ALTHOUGH SUCH SENSITIVITY HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED IN RECENT YEARS

THROUGH THE COMPANY'S EXIT OF SOME OF THE COMMODITY SEGMENTS OF THAT INDUSTRY, SUCH AS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (DRAM). MOVEMENTS IN THE GENERAL OR INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT CREATE

FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S CONSULTING BUSINESS AND CERTAIN OF ITS INVENTORIES.

TO

THE EXTENT DEMAND FOR GLOBAL SERVICES SHARPLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY DECLINES, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE EXCESS PEOPLE RESOURCES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO DECIDE WHETHER TO

HAVE A WORKFORCE ACTION RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL SEVERANCE CHARGES (WHICH COULD RESULT IN CHARGES TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSE), OR TO CARRY AN UNDERUTILIZED CONSULTING WORKFORCE IN

THE HOPES THAT THE ECONOMIC DROP IS SHORT-TERM IN NATURE (WHICH COULD REDUCE SERVICES GROSS

MARGINS). CONVERSELY, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DEMAND FOR GLOBAL SERVICES SHARPLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY INCREASES, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND HIRE THE CORRECT NUMBER OF CONSULTANTS

WITH THE APPROPRIATE SKILLS AT THE SAME TIME THAT ITS COMPETITORS HAVE THE SAME GOALS. THE COMPANY MANAGES THESE RISKS BY FORECASTING FUTURE DEMAND AND BY THE SELECTED USE OF SUBCONTRACTED LABOR. AS

REFERENCED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES ARE ALSO AN INTEGRAL PART OF MANAGING THESE RISKS TO THE GLOBAL SERVICES BUSINESS.

TO

THE EXTENT DEMAND FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS SHARPLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY DECLINES, THE COMPANY MAY BE LEFT WITH EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY (WHICH COULD RESULT IN WRITE-DOWNS TO COST OF

GOODS SOLD AND THEREFORE, IN LOWER GROSS MARGINS). MANAGEMENT ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THIS RISK BY CAREFUL FORECASTING AND THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES DISCUSSED ABOVE. PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

INITIATIVES IS THE REDUCTION OF INVENTORY LEVELS ON HAND. CONVERSELY, A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED RISE IN DEMAND MAY RESULT IN SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS (WHICH COULD REDUCE REVENUE AND GROSS MARGINS TO THE

EXTENT THERE ARE STRANDED FIXED COSTS). AGAIN, THE COMPANY MINIMIZES THIS RISK THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES THAT CONVERT TRADITIONALLY FIXED COST AND INFLEXIBLE ASPECTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

INTO A VARIABLE AND FLEXIBLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY: ONE OF THE PILLARS OF AN ON DEMAND BUSINESS.

INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES.

KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF IBM'S STRATEGY ARE ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO

DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS AS IBM CONTINUES TO TRANSFORM ITSELF INTO AN ON DEMAND ENTERPRISE. INTEGRAL TO THESE EFFORTS WILL BE THE INTERNAL SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES DISCUSSED ABOVE

AS WELL THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE THE COST OF ITS RESOURCES WORLDWIDE. THESE EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE TO INCLUDE THE REBALANCING OF SKILLS, DEVELOPING THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WORKFORCE

STRUCTURE, AND CONTINUING TO MAKE COMPANY'S COMPENSATION PROGRAMS COMPETITIVE AND ALIGNED WITH ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS. THE DEGREE OF CONTINUED SUCCESS IN THIS AREA WILL IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF COMPANY

EXPENSE AND COST STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF COMPETITIVE LEVERAGE IT CAN APPLY BY PASSING SUCH SAVINGS ALONG TO CLIENTS.

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS.

IBM INVESTS FOR NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM COMMODITIZED

CATEGORIES OF THE IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS WHERE IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE

9

ITSELF

THROUGH INNOVATION, AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. EXAMPLES INCLUDE IBM'S LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ASICS); THE

DESIGN OF SMALLER, FASTER AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES (USING INDUSTRY-LEADING INNOVATIONS SUCH AS COPPER TECHNOLOGY, SILICON ON INSULATOR, SILICON GERMANIUM, LOW-K

DIELECTRIC, AND NANOTECHNOLOGY); THE DESIGN OF "AUTONOMIC" OR SELF-MANAGING COMPUTING SYSTEMS AND "GRID" COMPUTING NETWORKS THAT ALLOW COMPUTERS TO SHARE PROCESSING POWER; AND THE

COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO ADVANCE OPEN TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS SUCH AS LINUX. IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IT INDUSTRY WITH LARGE DIVERSIFIED COMPETITORS AS WELL AS SMALLER AND NIMBLE SINGLE-TECHNOLOGY

COMPETITORS, IBM'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING AND INCREASING MARKET SHARE. IBM IS MANAGING THIS RISK BY MORE CLOSELY LINKING ITS

R&D ORGANIZATION TO INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC AND CLIENT-SPECIFIC NEEDS, AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OPEN STANDARDS.

THE BROAD ADOPTION OF OPEN STANDARDS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPUTING MODEL FOR E-BUSINESS ON

DEMAND. WITHOUT THE OPEN STANDARDS THAT ENABLE ALL MANNER OF COMPUTING PLATFORMS TO COMMUNICATE AND WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER, THE INTEGRATION OF ANY CLIENT'S INTERNAL SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSES

REMAINS A MONUMENTAL AND EXPENSIVE TASK. THE BROAD-BASED ACCEPTANCE OF OPEN STANDARDSRATHER THAN CLOSED, PROPRIETARY ARCHITECTURESALSO ALLOWS THE COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO

MORE EASILY ABSORB NEW TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS. IBM IS COMMITTED TO FOSTERING OPEN STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY BENEFIT CLIENTS, BECAUSE THEY ARE VITAL TO THE ON DEMAND COMPUTING MODEL, AND BECAUSE THEIR

ACCEPTANCE WILL EXPAND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE BUSINESS SERVICES AND IT INDUSTRY. IBM'S SUPPORT IS EVIDENCED BY THE ENABLING OF ITS PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT OPEN STANDARDS SUCH AS LINUX, AS

WELL AS ITS RECENT ACQUISITION OF RATIONAL. RATIONAL'S SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP AND UPGRADE ANY OTHER COMPANY'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. ACCORDINGLY, THIS ACQUISITION IS A CRITICAL

PART OF IBM'S OPEN STANDARDS STRATEGY.

PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO

ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A

NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS. LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED BY IBM HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING GRANTED TO OTHERS UNDER REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THESE

PROTECTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S NOR CAN THERE BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS WILL

ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW

MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO ASSURE

THAT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IF THE NEED ARISES. THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY

MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

SEASONALITY OF REVENUES.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, THE LENGTH OF THE

SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THESE FACTORS HISTORICALLY HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER

THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER.

LOCAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 160 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVES MORE THAN HALF OF

ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN THAT COUNTRY AND THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS AND INFLATION.

10

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESSES FACE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, RANGING FROM FORTUNE 50 COMPANIES TO AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL, RAPIDLY GROWING AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT ITS COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY, PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY, PRICE AND THE BREADTH OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICE OFFERINGS ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

INTENSE

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, RESULTING IN REDUCED PROFIT MARGINS AND/OR LOSS OF MARKET OPPORTUNITY. UNLIKE MANY OF

ITS COMPETITORS, THE COMPANY HAS A PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES AND MUST ALLOCATE RESOURCES ACROSS THESE BUSINESSES WHILE COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE PRODUCT LINES. AS

A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY NOT FUND OR INVEST IN CERTAIN OF ITS BUSINESSES TO THE SAME DEGREE THAT ITS COMPETITORS DO AND THESE COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES

AVAILABLE TO THEM THAN THE BUSINESSES AGAINST WHICH THEY COMPETE.

VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICES.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN

RESULTS, THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS BY THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT, LIKE OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, THE COMPANY'S STOCK

PRICE IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY.

DEPENDENCE ON AND COMPENSATION OF KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE

AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR

TALENTS IS INTENSE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RETAIN AND ATTRACT THE KEY PERSONNEL IT NEEDS. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A TOTAL

COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY AWARDS,

PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS NON-U.S. REVENUES FROM

ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS AND ITS RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND THE U.S.

DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CLIENT, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES AND THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. DERIVATIVES INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE THESE RISKS WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL.

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND

RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES FROM

TIME TO TIME. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL

MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY.

BACKLOG.

THE VALUE OF UNFILLED ORDERS IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATOR OF FUTURE REVENUES FROM THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF REVENUE FROM SERVICES, THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTS DELIVERED FROM SHELF INVENTORIES, AND THE SHORTENING OF PRODUCT DELIVERY SCHEDULES. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S

GLOBAL SERVICES SEGMENT, IN 2003 THE COMPANY SIGNED CONTRACTS TOTALING $55 BILLION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A SERVICES BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 OF $120 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$112 BILLION AT THE END OF 2002.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF 33 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF

WHICH 24 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 9 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 4 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 2 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM

BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 15 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 10 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 6 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 1 MILLION

SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS UPGRADING OF FACILITIES IS

ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY, AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

TO

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION.

WE

HAVE AUDITED THE STATEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS CONSULTING SERVICES REPORTING UNIT (THE "REPORTING UNIT") (A REPORTING UNIT AS DEFINED IN STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142), OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (THE "COMPANY") AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND THE RELATED STATEMENT OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES (COLLECTIVELY,

THE "STATEMENTS") FOR THE THREE MONTHS THEN ENDED (NOT SEPARATELY PRESENTED HEREIN). THESE STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON

THESE STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO

INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL PRESENTATION OF THE STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

THE

STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (FOR USE BY THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH ITS VARIOUS

FILINGS WITH THE COMMISSION). CERTAIN CORPORATE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CORPORATE EXPENSES, THAT ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REPORTING UNIT, AND WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED

FROM THE STATEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF THE REPORTING UNIT AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS THEN ENDED, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES.
