PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS

THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME,

IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER 85 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN

C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: THE COMPANY CREATES BUSINESS VALUE FOR CLIENTS AND SOLVES BUSINESS PROBLEMS THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS

THAT LEVERAGE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. IBM SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY CREATE VALUE BY REDUCING A CLIENT'S OPERATIONAL COSTS OR BY ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES THAT

GENERATE REVENUE. THESE SOLUTIONS DRAW FROM AN INDUSTRY LEADING PORTFOLIO OF CONSULTING, DELIVERY AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES, ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS AND FINANCING.

STRATEGY

IBM'S STRATEGY IS ONE OF INNOVATION, TRANSFORMATION AND A CONSTANT EVOLUTION TO HIGHER VALUE. THE COMPANY DELIVERS INNOVATIVE

SOLUTIONS, SOFTWARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPROVE CLIENT OUTCOMES. THE COMPANY HELPS ENTERPRISES APPLY TECHNOLOGY TO CAPTURE NEW VALUE ACROSS THEIR ENTIRE ORGANIZATIONS, AND IT PROVIDES A

DIFFERENTIATED CLIENT EXPERIENCE THROUGH A HIGHLY ENGAGED AND SKILLED GLOBAL WORKFORCE AND A BROAD ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER ON IBM'S PURPOSE OF MAKING

OUR COMPANY ESSENTIAL TO CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, INVESTORS AND COMMUNITIES.

THREE

STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES SHAPE OUR APPROACH AS WE CONTINUOUSLY TRANSFORM IBM AND ALIGN THE COMPANY FOR HIGHER VALUE.

1. MAKE MARKETS BY TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS WITH DATA

THE EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA AS THE WORLD'S NEW NATURAL RESOURCE IS THE PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME. IT IS BEING FUELED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF

MOBILE DEVICES, THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INFUSION OF TECHNOLOGY INTO ALL THINGS AND PROCESSES. TODAY, ENTERPRISES MUST HARNESS DATA TO CREATE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE VALUE FOR ENTERPRISES

INCREASES AS THEY APPLY MORE SOPHISTICATED ANALYTICS ACROSS MORE DISPARATE DATA SOURCES. THEIR REAL-TIME USE OF DATA WILL INCREASINGLY BECOME A COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATOR. ENTERPRISES WILL ALSO NEED

COGNITIVE COMPUTING CAPABILITIES AS DATA CONTINUES TO GROW IN ALL DIMENSIONS. THEREFORE, IBM'S STRATEGY IS TO MAKE MARKETS BY TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS WITH DATA. THE COMPANY HAS

INVESTED MORE THAN $22 BILLION, INCLUDING $15 BILLION ON MORE THAN 30 ACQUISITIONS, TO BUILD ITS CAPABILITIES IN BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS. ONE THIRD OF IBM'S RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON DATA, ANALYTICS AND

COGNITIVE COMPUTING. THE COMPANY IS INVESTING $1 BILLION IN WATSON SOLUTIONS TO BUILD OUT THE NEXT ERA OF COGNITIVE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. IN 2013, THE COMPANY REALIZED $15.7 BILLION IN

BUSINESS ANALYTICS REVENUE. THE ORIGINAL TARGET FOR THIS BUSINESS WAS TO ACHIEVE $16 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2015AS A RESULT OF THIS PERFORMANCE THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN ITS 2015

OBJECTIVE FOR BUSINESS ANALYTICS REVENUE TO $20 BILLION.

2. REMAKE ENTERPRISE IT FOR THE ERA OF CLOUD

ENTERPRISES ARE INCREASINGLY RELYING ON CLOUD, WHICH IS BEING FUELED BY ABUNDANT BANDWIDTH, THE EMERGENCE OF STANDARDS AND THE DEMAND

FOR CONSUMABILITY. THEY ARE BENEFITTING FROM CLOUD BY USING IT TO TRANSFORM THEIR IT AND BUSINESS PROCESSES INTO DIGITAL SERVICES, TO REINVENT THEIR CORE BUSINESS PROCESSES AND TO DRIVE INNOVATION.

ENTERPRISES ARE INTEGRATING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUDS WITH

BACK-END SYSTEMS TO CREATE HYBRID, DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS. THEY WILL INCREASINGLY NEED TO MANAGE THEIR CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS WITH THE SAME RIGOR AS AN ON-PREMISE DATACENTER. THEREFORE, IBM'S STRATEGY IS TO

REMAKE ENTERPRISE IT

1

FOR

THE ERA OF CLOUD. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED OVER $6 BILLION TO ACQUIRE MORE THAN 15 COMPANIES RELATED TO CLOUD, AND IS INVESTING MORE THAN $1 BILLION TO EXPAND ITS GLOBAL FOOTPRINT TO 40

DATACENTERS WORLDWIDE. IBM NOW HAS MORE THAN 100 SAAS OFFERINGS, AND IBM CLOUD SUPPORTS 24 OF THE TOP 25 FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES. ALL OF THIS DROVE $4.4 BILLION OF REVENUE FOR CLOUD-BASED

SOLUTIONS IN 2013.

3. ENABLE "SYSTEMS OF ENGAGEMENT" FOR ENTERPRISES AND LEAD BY EXAMPLE.

SOCIAL, MOBILE AND UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO DATA ARE CHANGING HOW INDIVIDUALS ARE UNDERSTOOD AND ENGAGED. A NEW CLASS OF INDIVIDUAL IS

EMERGING: ONE THAT IS EMPOWERED WITH KNOWLEDGE, ENRICHED BY NETWORKS AND EXPECTS VALUE IN RETURN FOR ITS INFORMATION. ENTERPRISES MUST CREATE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO ENGAGE THIS NEW CLASS OF

INDIVIDUAL AND INCREASE ITS SPEED AND RESPONSIVENESS BY BECOMING MOBILE. INTERACTIONS NEED TO BE PERSONALIZED TO OFFER MORE VALUE. IN ADDITION, ENTERPRISES WILL BENEFIT FROM SECURING INFORMATION AND

INCREASING TRUST. THEREFORE, IBM'S STRATEGY IS TO ENABLE "SYSTEMS OF ENGAGEMENT" FOR ENTERPRISES; AND THE COMPANY IS LEADING BY EXAMPLE. IBM HAS ACQUIRED 20 COMPANIES RELATED TO MOBILE, SOCIAL AND

SECURITY. IBMERS ARE COLLABORATING IN MORE THAN 200,000 INTERNAL SOCIAL COMMUNITIES AND 85 PERCENT OF IBM'S SELLERS USE THE COMPANY'S SALES CONNECT PORTAL. IN 2013, THE COMPANY'S MOBILE, SOCIAL

AND SECURITY PORTFOLIO GENERATED DOUBLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH WITH MOBILE INCREASING 69 PERCENT, SECURITY 19 PERCENT AND SOCIAL BUSINESS 45 PERCENT.

TO

CAPTURE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARISING FROM THESE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES, IBM IS FOCUSED ON FOUR KEY GROWTH INITIATIVES: SMARTER PLANET, BUSINESS ANALYTICS, CLOUD COMPUTING AND GROWTH

MARKETS.

SMARTER PLANET

SMARTER PLANET IS IBM'S STRATEGY TO LEAD IN A TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED WORLD THAT IS MORE INSTRUMENTED, INTERCONNECTED AND INTELLIGENT THAN

EVER BEFORE, ALLOWING PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS AND SOCIETAL CHALLENGES. AT THE HEART OF THIS STRATEGY ARE SOLUTIONS THAT DRIVE INNOVATION AND OUTCOMES FOR

CLIENTSEXTENDING THE BOUNDARIES OF

BUSINESSES, INDUSTRIES AND COMMUNITIES. IT IS ABOUT HELPING THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS BECOME BETTER AT WHAT THEY DO FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. IBM DOES THIS THROUGH ADVANCED, INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS BASED ON

CAPABILITIES SUCH AS ANALYTICS FOR BUSINESS AND PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, CLOUD COMPUTING, MOBILE, SOCIAL BUSINESS AND BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT.

IBM

CONTINUES TO DEEPEN ITS COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF SMARTER PLANET FOR BOTH LINE OF BUSINESS EXECUTIVES (CFOS, CHROS, CMOS, ETC.) AS WELL AS IT EXECUTIVES ACROSS A

BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIES. IBM'S INDUSTRY-BASED APPROACH AND SOLUTIONS ARE GROUNDED IN A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISTINCT SET OF CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE CONFRONTING COMPANIES AND

EXECUTIVES IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WHETHER 'SMARTER' MEANS HELPING A BANK TO RETAIN MORE CUSTOMERS THROUGH WORLD-CLASS MOBILE SOLUTIONS, A HOSPITAL GROUP TO DELIVER HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED CARE

COORDINATED WITH SOCIAL SERVICES, A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ANTICIPATE AND ALLEVIATE TRAFFIC CONGESTION BEFORE IT HAPPENS, OR A RETAIL CHAIN TO PROVIDE A SEAMLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE

CHANNELS, IBM IS DEVELOPING AND INVESTING IN A PORTFOLIO OF REPLICABLE INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS TO HELP CLIENTS ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND DRIVE IMPORTANT OUTCOMES FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.

THERE

ARE SEVERAL AREAS OF FOCUS WITHIN THE SMARTER PLANET STRATEGY, INCLUDING IBM'S SOCIAL BUSINESS, MOBILEFIRST, SMARTER COMMERCE AND SMARTER CITIES INITIATIVES.

IBM'S

SOCIAL BUSINESS INITIATIVE HELPS CLIENTS INTEGRATE SOCIAL CAPABILITIES ACROSS CORE BUSINESS PROCESSES TO DRIVE MEASURABLE BUSINESS RESULTS. THE SOCIAL BUSINESS INITIATIVE CAN

UNLOCK THE INTRINSIC KNOWLEDGE OF PEOPLE WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION TO HELP COMPANIES FUEL CUSTOMER-CENTRIC INNOVATION, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND EXPAND SALES, LOYALTY AND ADVOCACY. TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARISE FROM A DIGITAL ECONOMY, IBM SOCIAL BUSINESS CAN LET CLIENTS APPLY INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED ANALYTICS TO GAIN ACTIONABLE INSIGHT AND TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE

WITH CUSTOMERS. BEHAVIORAL, HUMAN DATA IS THE NEWEST FORM OF DATA AND CAN BE USED TO BUILD A STRONGER, MORE AGILE WORKFORCE AND REINVENT HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT BY APPLYING BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES ACROSS

THE TALENT

2

LIFECYCLE.

THE SOCIAL BUSINESS INITIATIVE IS POWERED BY WORLD CLASS IBM SERVICES AND SOFTWARE, DEVELOPED ORGANICALLY BY IBM AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS.

IN

2013, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED IBM MOBILEFIRST, A UNIFIED APPROACH TO HELP CLIENTS AND PARTNERS DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MOBILE SOLUTIONS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MORE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND

PROVIDE A SUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. IBM HAS A BREADTH OF EXPERTISE AND TECHNOLOGY TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS EFFICIENTLY BUILD AND DEPLOY MOBILE APPLICATIONS, MAINTAIN VISIBILITY AND CONTROL OVER THEIR

MOBILE INFRASTRUCTURE, ENGAGE CUSTOMERS IN CONTEXT AND TRANSFORM THE VALUE CHAIN IN WAYS THAT CAN DRIVE GROWTH AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY CAN HELP ITS CLIENTS ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THROUGH A

COMPLETE PORTFOLIO OF IBM MOBILE SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND INDUSTRY EXPERTISE. THROUGHOUT 2013, IBM INVESTED IN

CORE MOBILE ENTERPRISE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS IBM WORKLIGHT AND IBM RATIONAL, WHILE ROUNDING OUT ITS PORTFOLIO WITH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS SUCH AS FIBERLINK, TRUSTEER, XTIFY AND THE NOW FACTORY.

INTEGRATED WITH 270 PATENTS IN WIRELESS INNOVATIONS AND STRENGTHENED BY THOUSANDS OF MOBILE SPECIALISTS FROM IBM MOBILE ENTERPRISE SERVICES AND IBM INTERACTIVE, THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY HELPED MORE

THAN 1,000 CLIENTS BECOME MORE MOBILE ENTERPRISES.

IN

ADDITION TO SOCIAL AND MOBILE, IBM'S DEEP COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A SMARTER PLANET CAN BE SEEN IN THE ONGOING EFFORTS AROUND SMARTER COMMERCE AND SMARTER CITIES. IBM'S SMARTER COMMERCE

MODEL CAN INTEGRATE AND TRANSFORM HOW COMPANIES MANAGE AND ADAPT THEIR BUY, MARKET, SELL AND SERVICE PROCESSES TO PLACE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AT THE CENTER OF THEIR BUSINESS. IBM'S SMARTER CITIES

INITIATIVE HELPS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS, ANTICIPATE ISSUES AND COORDINATE RESOURCES ACROSS AGENCIES MORE EFFECTIVELY AND DELIVER CITIZEN-CENTRIC SERVICES THAT

CAN DRIVE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH.

BUSINESS ANALYTICS

BUSINESS ANALYTICS IS THE CATEGORY OF SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT HELPS ORGANIZATIONS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BIG DATA TO MAKE BETTER

AND FASTER DECISIONS AND OPTIMIZE PROCESSES. BIG DATA INCLUDES BOTH ENTERPRISE DATA, CONTENT AND NEW DATA FROM BOTH STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED SOURCES: IN PREVIOUSLY UNIMAGINABLE VOLUMES (PETABYTES),

WITH HUGE VARIETY (FROM BLOGS, TWEETS, PICTURES, VIDEOS AND TEXT), AT HIGH VELOCITY (MACHINE-TO-MACHINE DATA FROM THE INTERNET OF THINGS) AND WITH DECREASING VERACITY (FROM UNCERTAIN OR INCOMPLETE

SOURCES). BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS ARE CORE TO ACHIEVING THE SMARTER PLANET STRATEGY, HELPING DATA-SAVVY, INSIGHT-DRIVEN LEADERS TO INFUSE INTELLIGENCE INTO BUSINESS DECISIONS, PROCESSES AND CLIENT

INTERACTIONS FOR FASTER ACTIONS AND BETTER OUTCOMES.

IBM

CAN SERVE NEW BUYERS AND MAKE NEW MARKET SEGMENTS BY BRINGING IT TO INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS THAT ARE BEING TRANSFORMED BY DATA. THE COMPANY HAS A UNIQUE SET OF OFFERINGS AND DEEP

EXPERTISE RELATED TO BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS.

THE

COMPANY'S APPROACH TO BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS HELPS ORGANIZATIONS TO SUCCEED IN THEIR INDUSTRIES. IBM RECOMMENDS ORGANIZATIONS DO THREE THINGS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. FIRST, BUILD A CULTURE THAT INFUSES

ANALYTICS EVERYWHERE. SECOND, BE PROACTIVE ABOUT THE PRIVACY, SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE OF THEIR DATA. THIRD, INVEST IN THE RIGHT PLATFORM AND SOLUTIONS TO HARNESS AND ANALYZE ALL OF THEIR DATA FOR NEW

INSIGHTS AND OUTCOMES.

IBM

IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUALLY INNOVATING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES, SOLUTIONS, SYSTEMS, RESEARCH, SERVICES, DEPLOYMENT AND SKILLS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN

2013, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A BREAKTHROUGH DYNAMIC IN-MEMORY DATABASE TECHNOLOGY CALLED BLU ACCELERATION, PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS FOR BIG DATA WITH IBM ANALYTIC CATALYST, A PUREDATA SYSTEM FOR HADOOP

THAT MARRIES IBM'S ENTERPRISE-CLASS HADOOP DISTRIBUTION (INFOSPHERE BIGINSIGHTS) WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF AN APPLIANCE, INFOSPHERE DATA PRIVACY FOR HADOOP THAT PROVIDES SECURITY AND PROTECTION FOR

SENSITIVE BIG DATA, A WATSON ENGAGEMENT ADVISOR SOLUTION TO HELP TRANSFORM HOW BRANDS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS INTERACT AND NEW ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE EXPANDING SCOPE OF

CAREERS IN BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS.

CLOUD COMPUTING

CLOUD IS A MODEL FOR CONSUMING AND DELIVERING BUSINESS AND IT SERVICES THAT CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ECONOMIES OF

SCALE AND BUSINESS AGILITY AND SERVE AS A PLATFORM FOR BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION. IBM HAS DEVELOPED A PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS THAT IS HELPING THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS ADOPT AND

ON-PREMISES CLOUD-BASED ENVIRONMENTS THAT HAVE THE CONTROL, SECURITY AND ISOLATION REQUIRED FOR THEIR MOST MISSION-CRITICAL WORKLOADS. IBM ALSO OFFERS PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES, INCLUDING THE NEWLY

ACQUIRED SOFTLAYER PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES AN INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECOSYSTEM FOR MIDDLEWARE AND APPLICATIONS. IBM'S PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES CAN BE SIMPLY PROVISIONED AS A SELF SERVICE, PAY-AS-YOU-GO

CONSUMPTION MODEL. IBM'S SOFTWARE DEFINED ENVIRONMENTS CAN PROVIDE A SEAMLESS INTEGRATION ACROSS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CLOUD MODELS, WITH INTEROPERABILITY, PORTABILITY AND SCALABILITY TO HELP CLIENTS

REALIZE THE FULL VALUE OF CLOUD.

IN

THE NEW ERA OF COMPUTING, IBM'S PLANS TO ENABLE NEARLY EVERYTHING AS A DIGITAL SERVICE. DURING 2013, IBM MADE SEVERAL CLOUD-RELATED STRATEGIC ANNOUNCEMENTS,

GROWTH MARKETS

IBM CONTINUES TO INVEST IN GROWTH MARKETS WHERE MANY COUNTRIES AND COMPANIES ARE EMBRACING BIG DATA, MOBILE, SOCIAL AND CLOUD, OFTEN AT

FASTER RATES THAN MATURE COUNTRIES. IN CHINA, FOR EXAMPLE, 32 PERCENT OF CONSUMERS MAKE THEIR PURCHASES ONLINE, COMPARED TO ONLY 14 PERCENT OF CONSUMERS GLOBALLY. IN AFRICA,

18 PERCENT OF THE CONTINENT'S GDP IS EXPECTED TO BE HANDLED THROUGH MOBILE MONEY TRANSFERS BY 2015, WHILE IN SINGAPORE, CITIZENS SPEND 40 MINUTES ON AVERAGE EACH DAY ON FACEBOOK, COMPARED TO

LESS THAN 25 MINUTES IN THE UNITED STATES. IBM IS HELPING CLIENTS IN GROWTH MARKETS CAPITALIZE ON THESE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE.



SUMMARY

IBM'S STRATEGY IS ONE OF INNOVATION, TRANSFORMATION AND A CONSTANT EVOLUTION TO HIGHER VALUE. THE COMPANY HAS STEADILY REMIXED ITS

PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS MODEL TO REFLECT ITS STRATEGIC BELIEFS AND PURSUE ITS GROWTH INITIATIVES. IBM HAS A BALANCED HISTORY OF EXITING COMMODITY BUSINESSES THAT NO LONGER FIT THE HIGH-VALUE MODEL

WHILE INVESTING IN STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND ORGANIC CAPABILITIES. IN 2013, THE COMPANY INVESTED $3.1 BILLION FOR ACQUISITIONS, $3.8 BILLION IN NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $6.2 BILLION IN RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED MORE THAN 150 COMPANIES SINCE 2000 TO BOLSTER ITS PORTFOLIO IN AREAS LIKE BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS, CLOUD AND SYSTEMS OF ENGAGEMENT.

GLOBAL FINANCING

FACILITATES CLIENTS' ACQUISITION OF IBM SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. GLOBAL FINANCING INVESTS IN FINANCING ASSETS,

LEVERAGES WITH DEBT AND MANAGES THE ASSOCIATED RISKS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING CONSISTENTLY STRONG RETURNS ON EQUITY. THE PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE COMPANY'S OFFERINGS AND CLIENTS MITIGATES MANY OF

THE RISKS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A FINANCING COMPANY. GLOBAL FINANCING HAS THE BENEFIT OF BOTH A DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF ITS CLIENT BASE AND A CLEAR INSIGHT INTO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE BEING

FINANCED. THIS COMBINATION ALLOWS GLOBAL FINANCING TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE TWO OF THE MAJOR RISKS (CREDIT AND RESIDUAL VALUE) THAT ARE NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCING.

GLOBAL

FINANCING CAPABILITIES

CLIENT FINANCING.

LEASE AND LOAN FINANCING TO END USERS AND INTERNAL CLIENTS FOR TERMS GENERALLY BETWEEN ONE

AND SEVEN YEARS. INTERNAL FINANCING IS PREDOMINANTLY IN SUPPORT OF GLOBAL SERVICES' LONG-TERM CLIENT SERVICE CONTRACTS. GLOBAL FINANCING ALSO FACTORS A SELECTED PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE, PRIMARILY FOR CASH MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. ALL INTERNAL FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AT ARM'S-LENGTH RATES AND ARE BASED UPON MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMMERCIAL FINANCING.

SHORT-TERM INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING TO DEALERS AND REMARKETERS OF IT PRODUCTS.

REMANUFACTURING AND REMARKETING.

AS EQUIPMENT IS RETURNED AT THE CONCLUSION OF A LEASE TRANSACTION, THESE ASSETS ARE REFURBISHED AND SOLD

OR LEASED TO NEW OR EXISTING CLIENTS BOTH EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY. EXTERNALLY REMARKETED EQUIPMENT REVENUE REPRESENTS SALES OR LEASES TO CLIENTS AND RESELLERS. INTERNALLY REMARKETED EQUIPMENT

REVENUE PRIMARILY REPRESENTS USED EQUIPMENT THAT IS SOLD INTERNALLY TO SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBAL SERVICES. SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO SELL THE EQUIPMENT THAT IT PURCHASES FROM GLOBAL

FINANCING TO EXTERNAL CLIENTS.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

IBM HAS A SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL PRESENCE, OPERATING IN MORE THAN 175 COUNTRIES, WITH AN INCREASINGLY BROAD-BASED GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

OF REVENUE. THE COMPANY'S SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION MANAGES A STRONG GLOBAL FOOTPRINT, WITH DEDICATED COUNTRY-BASED OPERATING UNITS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING CLIENT VALUE. WITHIN THESE UNITS,

CLIENT RELATIONSHIP PROFESSIONALS WORK WITH INTEGRATED TEAMS OF CONSULTANTS, PRODUCT SPECIALISTS AND DELIVERY FULFILLMENT TEAMS TO IMPROVE CLIENTS' BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. THESE TEAMS DELIVER VALUE BY

UNDERSTANDING THE CLIENTS' BUSINESSES AND NEEDS, AND THEN BRING TOGETHER CAPABILITIES FROM ACROSS IBM AND AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF BUSINESS PARTNERS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS.

BY

COMBINING GLOBAL EXPERTISE WITH LOCAL EXPERIENCE, IBM'S GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ENABLES DEDICATED MANAGEMENT FOCUS FOR LOCAL CLIENTS, SPEED IN ADDRESSING NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND

TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES. THE GEOGRAPHIC UNITS ALIGN INDUSTRY-SKILLED RESOURCES TO SERVE CLIENTS' AGENDAS. IBM EXTENDS CAPABILITIES TO MID-MARKET CLIENT SEGMENTS BY LEVERAGING

INDUSTRY SKILLS WITH MARKETING, INSIDE SALES AND LOCAL BUSINESS PARTNER RESOURCES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST TO CAPTURE THE LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITY IN MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE MARKET GROWTH RATES GREATER THAN THE GLOBAL AVERAGECOUNTRIES

WITHIN SOUTHEAST ASIA, EASTERN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND LATIN AMERICA. THE COMPANY'S MAJOR MARKETS INCLUDE THE G7 COUNTRIES OF CANADA, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES (U.S.)

AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) PLUS AUSTRIA, THE BAHAMAS, BELGIUM, THE CARIBBEAN REGION, CYPRUS, DENMARK, FINLAND, GREECE, ICELAND, IRELAND, ISRAEL, MALTA, THE NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SPAIN,

SWEDEN AND SWITZERLAND.

THE

MAJORITY OF IBM'S REVENUE, EXCLUDING THE COMPANY'S ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS, OCCURS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE BROADLY GROUPED INTO SIX

SECTORS.



FINANCIAL SERVICES: BANKING, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE



PUBLIC: EDUCATION, GOVERNMENT, HEALTHCARE, LIFE SCIENCES



INDUSTRIAL: AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE, AUTOMOTIVE, CHEMICAL AND PETROLEUM, ELECTRONICS



DISTRIBUTION: CONSUMER PRODUCTS, RETAIL, TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION



COMMUNICATIONS: TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT, ENERGY AND UTILITIES



GENERAL BUSINESS: CROSS-SECTOR REPRESENTATION OF INTERMEDIATE-SIZED LARGE ENTERPRISES AS WELL AS MID-MARKET CLIENTS

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) OPERATIONS DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPANY FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IBM ANNUALLY INVESTS APPROXIMATELY

$6 BILLION FOR R&D, FOCUSING ON HIGH-GROWTH, HIGH-VALUE OPPORTUNITIES. IBM RESEARCH WORKS WITH CLIENTS AND THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH 12 GLOBAL LABS ON NEAR-TERM AND MID-TERM

INNOVATIONS. IT CONTRIBUTES MANY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO IBM'S PORTFOLIO EVERY YEAR AND HELPS CLIENTS ADDRESS THEIR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. IBM RESEARCH ALSO EXPLORES THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENCE AND

TECHNOLOGYFROM NANOTECHNOLOGY TO FUTURE SYSTEMS, BIG DATA ANALYTICS, SECURE CLOUDS AND TO IBM WATSON, A "COGNITIVE" LEARNING SYSTEM.

IBM

RESEARCH ALSO FOCUSES ON DIFFERENTIATING IBM'S SERVICES BUSINESSES, PROVIDING NEW CAPABILITIES AND SOLUTIONS. IT HAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT OF ANY PUBLIC COMPANY,

ENABLING IBM TO CREATE UNIQUE ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS AND ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH CLIENTS ON THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGES.

IN

2013, IBM WAS AWARDED MORE U.S. PATENTS THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THE 21ST CONSECUTIVE YEAR. IBM'S 6,809 PATENTS AWARDED IN 2013 REPRESENT A DIVERSE RANGE OF INVENTIONS POISED

TO ENABLE SIGNIFICANT INNOVATIONS THAT WILL POSITION THE COMPANY TO COMPETE AND LEAD IN STRATEGIC AREAS SUCH AS WATSON, CLOUD COMPUTING AND BIG DATA ANALYTICS. THESE INVENTIONS ALSO WILL ADVANCE THE

NEW ERA OF COGNITIVE SYSTEMS WHERE MACHINES WILL LEARN, REASON AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE IN MORE NATURAL WAYS. IT WAS THE MOST U.S. PATENTS EVER AWARDED TO ONE COMPANY IN A SINGLE YEAR.

10

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY SEEK INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR ITS INNOVATIONS, WHILE INCREASING EMPHASIS ON OTHER INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

LEADERSHIP. SOME OF IBM'S TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE LICENSED AND MAY BE USED IN IBM PRODUCTS AND/OR THE PRODUCTS OF THE LICENSEE. WHILE THE

COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY

PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS.

ENTERPRISE TRANSFORMATION

A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY IS BECOMING A SMARTER ENTERPRISE. THE TRANSFORMATION TO A SMARTER ENTERPRISE IS BUILT ON THE

FOUNDATION OF INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION UNDERTAKEN IN THE RECENT PAST, WHERE IBM STANDARDIZED BUSINESS PROCESSES, DROVE ENTERPRISEWIDE TRANSFORMATION GOVERNANCE, IMPLEMENTED A GLOBAL OPERATING MODEL,

INSTRUMENTED DATA, AND CONNECTED EMPLOYEES TO DRIVE COLLABORATION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AND FUNCTIONAL BOUNDARIES.

THE

SMARTER ENTERPRISE IS ENABLED THROUGH APPLICATION OF ANALYTICS, SOCIAL, MOBILE AND CLOUD TOOLS, APPROACHES AND TECHNOLOGIES. ANALYTICS ENABLE DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS FOR FASTER, SMARTER

DECISION MAKING. SOCIAL TOOLS ENCOURAGE PEER-TO-PEER INTERACTIONS, AND ALLOW DATA TO BE SHARED WITHIN AND OUTSIDE IBM IN A SOCIAL WAY. MOBILE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS WORKERS TO WORK SEAMLESSLY FROM

ANYWHERE. CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES ENABLE APPLICATION DELIVERY. COLLECTIVELY THESE ENABLERS ALLOW IBM TO MAKE DECISIONS DIFFERENTLY, CREATE VALUE DIFFERENTLY AND DELIVER VALUE DIFFERENTLY,

THEREBY IMPROVING EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND CLIENT EXPERIENCE AND ULTIMATELY DRIVING BETTER BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY REINVESTS THE BENEFITS OF ITS ENTERPRISE TRANSFORMATION

INITIATIVES IN REMIXING ITS SPENDING PROFILE AND RESOURCES TO ITS HIGHER GROWTH, HIGHER MARGIN INITIATIVES, IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING PROFITABILITY.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

IBM HAS AN EXTENSIVE INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES GLOBALLY. IN 2013, THE COMPANY ALSO MANAGED

APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION IN PROCUREMENT SPENDING FOR ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THE GLOBAL PROCESS SERVICES ORGANIZATION. THE SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS AND SALES TRANSACTION SUPPORT

OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED IN ONE OPERATING UNIT THAT HAS OPTIMIZED INVENTORIES OVER TIME. SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES HAS IMPROVED SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND OPERATIONAL

EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY ENABLES IBM TO REDUCE ITS RISK DURING MARKETPLACE CHANGES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO DERIVE BUSINESS VALUE FROM ITS OWN GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN PROVIDING A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY TO CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS. IBM LEVERAGES

ITS SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERTISE FOR CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING SERVICE TO OPTIMIZE AND HELP OPERATE CLIENTS' END-TO-END SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES, FROM PROCUREMENT TO

LOGISTICS.

THE

COMPANY HAS EXPANDED ITS USE OF ANALYTICS TO MEASURE, MANAGE AND FINE TUNE ITS SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, WHICH WILL HELP RESHAPE ITS OPERATIONS AND CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY-INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, OPERATING IN MORE THAN 175 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT, WHERE ITS COMPETITORS VARY BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT, AND RANGE FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES TO SMALLER, MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED ENTITIES. OVERALL, ACROSS ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES HUNDREDS OF COMPETITORS WORLDWIDE.

11

ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION ARE: TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; PRICE; QUALITY; BRAND; ITS BROAD RANGE OF CAPABILITIES, PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES; CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; THE ABILITY TO DELIVER BUSINESS VALUE TO CLIENTS; AND, SERVICE AND SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO

MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP, A CORPORATION MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST, INNOVATE AND INTEGRATE. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXECUTING A STRATEGY TO TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING SHIFTING TO HIGHER VALUE MARKET

SEGMENTS AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASING ITS CAPABILITIES THROUGH ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. AS THE COMPANY EXECUTES ITS STRATEGY, IT ENTERS NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS SMARTER PLANET AND

BUSINESS ANALYTICS, WHICH EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO NEW COMPETITORS. OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS THE LEADER OR AMONG THE LEADERS IN EACH OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

A

SUMMARY OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS INCLUDED BELOW.

OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE ELECTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SERVE UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION OF OFFICERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS AS PROVIDED IN THE

BY-LAWS. EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER NAMED ABOVE HAS BEEN AN EXECUTIVE OF IBM OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE

AND SERVICES DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CLIENT BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND

FUNCTIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES AND OFFERINGS IN BOTH EMERGING AND MORE ESTABLISHED MARKETS. THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES MAY NOT YIELD THEIR INTENDED GAINS IN

14

QUALITY,

PRODUCTIVITY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVENESS AND ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE

IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT OR IS UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE SUCH INNOVATIONS OR EXPAND AND SCALE THEM WITH SUFFICIENT SPEED, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET

SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE

COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN

STRATEGIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING NEW AND EMERGING MARKETS AND COUNTRIES, TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. CLIENT ADOPTION RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE LESS CERTAIN IN

THE HIGH-VALUE, HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND RAPIDLY-GROWING SEGMENTS, AND NEW DELIVERY MODELS MAY UNFAVORABLY IMPACT DEMAND FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO

CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, IT NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL. IN EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE PRESENTS

POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS FROM EVOLVING GOVERNMENTAL POLICY, INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION AND

CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY PROPOSED CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS, LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE OWNERSHIP AND PROTECTION OF PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS MAY AFFECT

CRITICAL THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR INVOLVE THE STORAGE, PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, INCLUDING VALUABLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL

INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THERE ARE NUMEROUS AND EVOLVING RISKS TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY, INCLUDING CRIMINAL HACKERS, STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS,

INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE, EMPLOYEE MALFEASANCE, AND HUMAN OR TECHNOLOGICAL ERROR. COMPUTER HACKERS AND OTHERS ROUTINELY ATTEMPT TO BREACH THE SECURITY OF TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS, AND

THOSE OF CUSTOMERS, THIRD-PARTIES CONTRACTORS AND VENDORS, AND SOME OF THOSE ATTEMPTS MAY BE SUCCESSFUL. SUCH BREACHES COULD RESULT IN, FOR EXAMPLE, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, DISCLOSURE, MODIFICATION,

MISUSE, LOSS, OR DESTRUCTION OF COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY DATA OR SYSTEMS, THEFT OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, SYSTEM

DISRUPTIONS, AND DENIAL OF SERVICE. IN THE EVENT OF SUCH BREACHES, THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES COULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY, LITIGATION, AND REGULATORY ACTION, AS WELL

AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION, AND OTHER FINANCIAL LOSS. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF RESPONDING

15

TO

BREACHES AND IMPLEMENTING REMEDIATION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AS THESE THREATS DEVELOP AND GROW, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO FIND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT FURTHER INVESTMENTS TO PROTECT

DATA

AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AS A GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY EXISTING AND PROPOSED LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY,

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION. ADDITIONALLY, CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS RESULTING IN DISRUPTIONS TO OR FAILURES IN POWER, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR OTHER CRITICAL

INFRASTRUCTURE COULD RESULT IN INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS TO COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR SERVICES, FINANCIAL LOSS, POTENTIAL LIABILITY, AND DAMAGE TO BRAND AND REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. MOREOVER, THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC GROWTH AREAS INVOLVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW

CUSTOMERS, AND NEW MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE NATURE OF ITS CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES; FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

REVIEW BY REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS HAD

LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE

FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER.

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 175 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY'S

OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS,

INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. FURTHER, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE SCOPE OF ITS OFFERINGS, BOTH WITHIN THE U.S. AND

GLOBALLY, IT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR OTHER RISKS. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS, PANDEMIC OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE OR UNCERTAIN POLITICAL

CLIMATES, INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR ANY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION

FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH

LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS,

REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS SUBJECT

TO THE CONTINUOUS

16

EXAMINATION

OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE

EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS.

ADVERSE

EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PREMIUMS FOR MANDATORY PENSION INSOLVENCY INSURANCE COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE U.S. PREMIUM INCREASES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE LEVEL OF INSOLVENCIES OF UNRELATED

COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY AT ISSUE. CURRENTLY, CANADA, GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE UNITED KINGDOM REQUIRE THAT THESE PREMIUMS BE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND NOT OUT OF PLAN ASSETS, WHICH COULD

NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. IBM'S 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

PENSION MATTERS.

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS AND FUTURE EVENTS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY'S MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT

DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO

STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, ACTUAL

FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE AREAS WHERE THE COMPANY

COMPETES ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED WORKERS LEAVE

THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, AS GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY DEMAND SHIFTS, REALIGNMENT, TRAINING AND SCALING OF SKILLED RESOURCES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY RAPID. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL

RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S

EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

17

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. CHANGES

IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S

SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES, IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FUNDING APPROVAL.

FUNDING REDUCTIONS OR DELAYS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT PUBLIC SECTOR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALSO, SOME AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE

AND PROVIDING FOR HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COULD BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED AS A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACTOR AND COULD INCUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND

PENALTIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A

SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES AND COSTS FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES

AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS,

INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS

CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS

ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF

THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CONDITION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND

AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS THE COMPANY MOVES INTO NEW AREAS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY

MAY BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND ENABLE APPROPRIATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL

18

APPLICABLE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM WORKING WITH THEM AND COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES AND DISPOSITIONS. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

AND RISKS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY OR THAT STRATEGIC

ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE

IMPROVEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE

ACQUIRED BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY DISPOSES OR ATTEMPTS TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NO LONGER CENTRAL TO ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ANY SUCH DISPOSITION OR ATTEMPTED DISPOSITION IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO THE TERMS AND TIMING OF SUCH DISPOSITION, RISKS RELATED TO OBTAINING NECESSARY GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY APPROVALS AND RISKS RELATED TO RETAINED

LIABILITIES NOT SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S CONTROL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RISKS.

AS A COMPANY WITH A SUBSTANTIAL EMPLOYEE POPULATION AND WITH CLIENTS IN MORE THAN 175

COUNTRIES, IBM IS INVOLVED, EITHER AS PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT, IN A VARIETY OF ONGOING CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS, INVESTIGATIONS, TAX MATTERS AND PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE M, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS, HOWEVER, WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF

INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED

"RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF

18 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 16 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 2 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 3 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS

BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 15 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 6 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 2 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS LEASED.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING

OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.
