PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS

THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF

NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME, IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INVENTION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER 80

YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: THE COMPANY CREATES BUSINESS VALUE FOR CLIENTS AND SOLVES BUSINESS PROBLEMS

THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS THAT LEVERAGE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. IBM SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY CREATE VALUE BY REDUCING A CLIENT'S OPERATIONAL COSTS OR BY ENABLING

NEW CAPABILITIES THAT GENERATE REVENUE. THESE SOLUTIONS DRAW FROM AN INDUSTRY LEADING PORTFOLIO OF CONSULTING, DELIVERY AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES, ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS AND FINANCING.

STRATEGY

IN IBM'S VIEW, TODAY'S NETWORKED ECONOMY HAS CREATED A GLOBAL BUSINESS LANDSCAPE AND A MANDATE FOR BUSINESS CHANGE. IT ALSO OPENS THE

OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH EMBEDDED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYWHAT IBM CALLS A "SMARTER PLANET." SMART AIRPORTS, SMART

HIGHWAYS, SMART SUPPLY CHAINS ARE ALL POSSIBLE. IBM IS WORKING WITH CLIENTS AND GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD TO EXPLORE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPLEMENT NEW IDEAS.

INTEGRATED

GLOBAL ECONOMIES HAVE OPENED MARKETS OF NEW OPPORTUNITY AND NEW SOURCES OF SKILLS. THE INTERNET HAS ENABLED COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION ACROSS THE WORLD AND BROUGHT WITH

IT A NEW COMPUTING MODEL PREMISED ON CONTINUOUS GLOBAL CONNECTION. IN THAT LANDSCAPE, COMPANIES CAN DISTRIBUTE WORK AND TECHNOLOGY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. IBM CONTINUES TO ADJUST ITS FOOTPRINT TOWARD

EMERGING GEOGRAPHIES, TAPPING THEIR HIGHER GROWTH, PROVIDING THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TALENT POOLS THEY PROVIDE TO BETTER SERVICE THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS.

AT

THE SAME TIME, THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS INCREASES THE PRESSURE ON BOTH BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD TO ADAPT. THE NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY, SECURITY AND

EFFICIENCIES ARE CLEAR.

GIVEN

THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, IBM IS WORKING WITH ITS CLIENTS TO DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS DESIGNS AND TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURES THAT ALLOW THEIR BUSINESSES THE FLEXIBILITY

REQUIRED TO COMPETE IN THIS NEW LANDSCAPE. IBM'S STRATEGY ADDRESSES THIS NEW ERA AND DELIVERS VALUE TO ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THREE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES.

FOCUS ON OPEN TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS

A NEW COMPUTING MODEL HAS EMERGED, REPLACING THE PC-BASED, CLIENT/SERVER APPROACH. THIS NEW MODEL IS NETWORKED, MODULAR, OPEN AND

REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS. IBM IS WELL POSITIONED TO PROVIDE ITS ENTERPRISE CLIENTS THE OPEN TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGH-VALUE

SOLUTIONS THEY WILL NEED TO COMPETE.



IBM IS LEVERAGING ITS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE CONVERGENCE OF SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, IN SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE

(SOA), IN VIRTUALIZATION, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS, IN OPEN AND MODULAR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)CONTINUING ITS SHIFT FROM COMMODITIZING SEGMENTS TO HIGHER VALUE SEGMENTS

WITH BETTER PROFIT OPPORTUNITY.



THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE A LEADING FORCE IN OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS TO ENABLE ITS CLIENTS TO ACHIEVE HIGHER LEVELS OF

INTEROPERABILITY, COST EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY.

1

DELIVER INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION TO CLIENTS

CHANGES IN THE MARKET HAVE CAUSED IBM'S CLIENTS TO SEEK FLEXIBILITY AND INNOVATION IN EVERYTHING FROM TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE TO THEIR

BUSINESS MODEL. IN RESPONSE, IBM IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION TO ITS CLIENTSOFFERING THEM TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT REAL VALUE CREATION.



IBM HAS A LONG HERITAGE OF TRANSFORMING THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF LARGE ENTERPRISES AND HAS EARNED THE TRUST TO BE THEIR

INNOVATION PARTNER AND GLOBAL INTEGRATOR.



THE COMPANY HAS AN EXTENSIVE SET OF GLOBAL ASSETS AND CAPABILITIES IT IS APPLYING TO IMPROVE SERVICES PROFITABILITY, BOTH

FOR ITS CLIENTS AND FOR ITSELF.

BECOME THE PREMIER GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE

AS GLOBAL NETWORKS AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES CHANGE BUSINESS ECONOMICS, LEGACY BUSINESS DESIGNS CAN QUICKLY BECOME NONCOMPETITIVE.

IBM BELIEVES A GLOBALLY-INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, DESIGNED FOR THIS NEW LANDSCAPE, CAN COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND WILL BENEFIT FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED.



TO RESHAPE ITS BUSINESS FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, IBM HAS REPLACED VERTICAL HIERARCHIES WITH HORIZONTALLY INTEGRATED TEAMS.



ACROSS THE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING MARKETS, TAKING CORE PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS

THAT WERE ONCE MANAGED REGIONALLY AND SHIFTING THEM TO A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED MODEL.

LOOKING

FORWARD, IBM IS CONFIDENT IT UNDERSTANDS THE ECONOMIC SHIFT OF GLOBALIZATION, THE EVOLUTION OF THE NEW COMPUTING MODEL AND THE POWERFUL ROLE OF INNOVATION IN THIS NEW LANDSCAPE.

ITS UNIQUE CAPABILITIES ARE WELL ADAPTED TO HELP THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS INNOVATE AND COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT.

BUSINESS MODEL

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS MODEL IS BUILT TO SUPPORT TWO PRINCIPAL GOALS: HELPING CLIENTS SUCCEED IN DELIVERING BUSINESS VALUE BY BECOMING

MORE INNOVATIVE, EFFICIENT AND COMPETITIVE THROUGH THE USE OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND IT SOLUTIONS; AND, PROVIDING LONG-TERM VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER

TIME THROUGH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE THE BEST LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY PROSPECTS BASED ON THE VALUE THEY DELIVER TO CLIENTS.

THE

COMPANY'S GLOBAL CAPABILITIES INCLUDE SERVICES, SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH AND RELATED FINANCING. THE BROAD MIX OF BUSINESSES AND CAPABILITIES ARE COMBINED TO PROVIDE

BUSINESS INSIGHT AND SOLUTIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS.

THE

BUSINESS MODEL IS FLEXIBLE, ADAPTING TO THE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING MARKET AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY HAS DIVESTED COMMODITIZING BUSINESSES LIKE PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND HARD

DISK DRIVES, AND STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION THROUGH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN HIGHER VALUE SEGMENTS LIKE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS, VIRTUALIZATION AND GREEN SOLUTIONS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE WHICH HAS IMPROVED OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY AND IS DRIVING INVESTMENT AND PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING

MARKETS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS A HIGHER PERFORMING ENTERPRISE TODAY THAN IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

THE

BUSINESS MODEL, SUPPORTED BY THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL MODEL, HAS ENABLED THE COMPANY TO DELIVER CONSISTENTLY STRONG EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND RETURNS ON INVESTED

CAPITAL IN CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE IT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS,

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CORPORATE BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND

FUNCTIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES IN BOTH EMERGING AND

MORE ESTABLISHED GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS. THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT YIELD THEIR INTENDED GAINS IN OVERALL EFFICIENCY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH

AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM

COMMODITIZED CATEGORIES OF THE IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS

CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IT INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION,

IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED

FOR ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING HIGHER-VALUE SEGMENTS OF ENTERPRISE COMPUTING AND DOZENS OF EMERGING COUNTRIES, INCLUDING BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA, TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS.

CLIENT ADOPTION RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE UNCERTAIN IN THE HIGH-VALUE AND RAPIDLY-GROWING SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES,

IT NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL. IN EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE PRESENTS POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC

RISKS FROM INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION AND CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND

TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE.

BREACHES OF DATA PROTECTION COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND

PROCESSES, INVOLVE THE STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. BREACHES IN SECURITY

COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED TO A RISK OF LOSS OR MISUSE OF THIS INFORMATION, RESULTING IN LITIGATION AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE

LOSS OF EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY'S BRAND AND REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPLEMENTING FURTHER DATA PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE

SIGNIFICANT.

10

THE COMPANY'S REVENUES FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE INTRODUCTION OF

NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES, THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THESE FACTORS HISTORICALLY HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS ORDERED

AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER.

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 170 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN THAT COUNTRY

AND THE COMPANY'S OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING

RECESSIONS, INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND LOCAL CURRENCY. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS, PANDEMIC OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE, OR ANY

TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY

REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM

THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION

PLANS.

ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE

ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY

COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IBM'S 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING PENSION MATTERS.

11

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S MOST CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE O,

"CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS" IN IBM'S 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 5, "ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES," INCLUDING

DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. BECAUSE BY DEFINITION THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT, ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES (SEE DISCUSSION ABOUT

COMPETITION IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS ABOVE).

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED

WORKERS RETIRE. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH

THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. CHANGES

IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO

DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES

OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES, RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A

SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES

AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS,

INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; DERIVATIVES INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S

EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE

12

VARIETY

OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S

2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE

WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT

BASIS AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF

FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS RESERVES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS

ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES FROM TIME TO TIME. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT

CHALLENGES AND RISKS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY. THE RELATED

RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE

ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF

INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED

"RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF

19 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 15 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 2 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS

BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 8 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 6 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 2 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS

LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING

OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.
