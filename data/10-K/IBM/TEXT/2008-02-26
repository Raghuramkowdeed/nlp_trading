PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM OR THE COMPANY) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS THE

COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO. (C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW

YORK. SINCE THAT TIME, IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INVENTION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED OVER

80 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: IBM IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED INNOVATION

COMPANY, SERVING THE NEEDS OF ENTERPRISES AND INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE. TO HELP CLIENTS ACHIEVE GROWTH, EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY AND THE REALIZATION OF GREATER VALUE THROUGH INNOVATION, IBM DRAWS UPON

THE WORLD'S LEADING SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES CAPABILITIES.

*

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

IBM IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE THAT TARGETS THE INTERSECTION OF TECHNOLOGY AND EFFECTIVE BUSINESS. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO BE A PARTNER IN ITS CLIENTS'

SUCCESS BY ENABLING THEIR OWN CAPACITY FOR DISTINCTIVE INNOVATION. TO HELP CLIENTS ACHIEVE GROWTH, EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY AND THE REALIZATION OF GREATER VALUE THROUGH INNOVATION, IBM DRAWS UPON THE

WORLD'S LEADING SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES CAPABILITIES.

IBM'S STRATEGY

IN IBM'S VIEW, TODAY'S NETWORKED ECONOMY HAS CREATED A GLOBAL BUSINESS LANDSCAPE AND A MANDATE FOR BUSINESS CHANGE. INTEGRATED GLOBAL ECONOMIES HAVE OPENED

MARKETS OF NEW OPPORTUNITY AND NEW SOURCES OF SKILLS. THE INTERNET HAS ENABLED COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION ACROSS THE WORLD AND BROUGHT WITH IT A NEW COMPUTING MODEL PREMISED ON CONTINUOUS GLOBAL

CONNECTION. IN THAT LANDSCAPE, COMPANIES CAN DISTRIBUTE WORK AND TECHNOLOGY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

GIVEN

THESE OPPORTUNITIES, IBM IS WORKING WITH ITS CLIENTS TO DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS DESIGNS AND TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURES THAT ALLOW THEIR BUSINESSES THE FLEXIBILITY REQUIRED TO COMPETE IN

THIS NEW LANDSCAPE. THE BUSINESS IS ALSO ADJUSTING ITS FOOTPRINT TOWARDS EMERGING GEOGRAPHIES, TAPPING THEIR DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH, PROVIDING THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED, AND TAKING

ADVANTAGE OF THE TALENT POOLS THEY PROVIDE TO BETTER SERVICE THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS.

IBM'S

STRATEGY ADDRESSES THIS NEW ERA AND DELIVERS VALUE TO ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THREE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES.

FOCUS ON OPEN TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS

THE PC ERA HAS ENDED, REPRESENTING A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS. IBM IS WELL POSITIONED TO PROVIDE ITS ENTERPRISE

CLIENTS THE OPEN TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS THEY WILL NEED TO COMPETE.



IBM IS LEVERAGING ITS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE CONVERGENCE OF SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, IN SOA, IN VIRTUALIZATION, IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE

CHIPS, IN OPEN AND MODULAR ITCONTINUING ITS SHIFT FROM COMMODITIZING SEGMENTS TO HIGHER VALUE SEGMENTS WITH BETTER PROFIT OPPORTUNITY.



THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE A LEADING FORCE IN OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS TO ENABLE ITS CLIENTS TO ACHIEVE HIGHER LEVELS OF INTEROPERABILITY, COST

EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY.

1

DELIVER INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION TO CLIENTS

CHANGES IN THE MARKET HAVE CAUSED IBM'S CLIENTS TO SEEK FLEXIBILITY AND INNOVATION IN EVERYTHING FROM TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE TO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. IN RESPONSE,

IBM IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION TO ITS CLIENTSOFFERING THEM TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT REAL VALUE CREATION.



IBM HAS A LONG HERITAGE OF TRANSFORMING THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF LARGE ENTERPRISES AND HAS EARNED THE TRUST TO BE THEIR INNOVATION PARTNER AND

GLOBAL INTEGRATOR.



THE COMPANY HAS A DEEP SET OF GLOBAL ASSETS AND CAPABILITIES IT IS APPLYING TO IMPROVE SERVICES PROFITABILITY, BOTH FOR ITS CLIENTS AND FOR

ITSELF.

BECOME THE PREMIER GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE

AS GLOBAL NETWORKS AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES CHANGE BUSINESS ECONOMICS, LEGACY BUSINESS DESIGNS CAN QUICKLY BECOME NON-COMPETITIVE. IBM BELIEVES A

GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, DESIGNED FOR THIS NEW LANDSCAPE CAN COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND WILL BENEFIT FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED.



TO RESHAPE ITS BUSINESS FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, IBM HAS REPLACED VERTICAL HIERARCHIES WITH HORIZONTALLY INTEGRATED TEAMS.



ACROSS THE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING MARKETS, TAKING CORE PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS THAT WERE ONCE MANAGED

REGIONALLY AND SHIFTING THEM TO A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED MODEL.

LOOKING

FORWARD, IBM IS CONFIDENT IT UNDERSTANDS THE ECONOMIC SHIFT OF GLOBALIZATION, THE EVOLUTION OF THE NEW COMPUTING MODEL AND THE POWERFUL ROLE OF INNOVATION IN THIS NEW LANDSCAPE.

ITS UNIQUE

CAPABILITIES ARE WELL ADAPTED TO HELP THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS INNOVATE AND COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THE NEW LANDSCAPE.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) OPERATIONS DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPANY FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IBM ANNUALLY SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $6 BILLION FOR R&D,

FOCUSING ITS INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-GROWTH, HIGH-VALUE OPPORTUNITIES. IN 2007, THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN R&D WAS APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT OF ITS COMBINED HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE REVENUE. AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS, IBM WAS ONCE AGAIN AWARDED MORE U.S. PATENTS IN 2007 THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY. THIS MARKS THE 15TH YEAR IN A ROW THAT IBM ACHIEVED

THIS DISTINCTION.

IN

ADDITION TO PRODUCING WORLD-CLASS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IBM INNOVATIONS ARE A MAJOR DIFFERENTIATOR IN PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS THROUGH ITS GROWING

SERVICES ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN R&D ALSO RESULT IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION ANNUALLY. SOME OF IBM'S TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED

EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE LICENSED AND MAY BE USED IN EITHER/BOTH IBM PRODUCTS AND/OR THE PRODUCTS OF THE LICENSEE.

INTEGRATED OPERATIONS

IBM'S ABILITY TO DELIVER DIFFERENTIATING INNOVATION TO ITS CLIENTS IS BEING GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL INTEGRATION WHICH IS SIMULTANEOUSLY GIVING

THE COMPANY BETTER ECONOMICS AND DEEPER CAPABILITIES, WHILE ELIMINATING REDUNDANCIES THAT WERE BUILT UP OVER FIFTY YEARS AS A GROWING MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN 170 COUNTRIES,

WITH APPROXIMATELY 69 PERCENT OF ITS EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE U.S. AS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY ORGANIZES WORK BASED ON THE RIGHT COSTS, THE RIGHT SKILLS AND THE RIGHT BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT, INTEGRATING DEEPLY WITH ITS PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND CLIENTS. BEING GLOBAL IS ABOUT GAINING ACCESS TO TALENT AND SKILLS AND THEN SCALING THEM GLOBALLY TO DEVELOP NEW, DISTINCTIVE

CAPABILITIES. THE COMPANY'S INTEGRATED OPERATIONS ENABLE IBM TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT, RESPONSIVE AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISEABLE TO INSTANTLY LEVERAGE ITS EXPERTISE AND

CAPABILITIESANYWHERE, AT ANY TIME. ALTHOUGH BOUND BY A COMMON MISSION AND PRINCIPLES, INTEGRATED OPERATIONS IS COMPRISED OF THREE DISTINCT UNITS, EACH WITH VERY SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE IBM BUSINESSES THEY SUPPORT.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

JUST AS IBM WORKS TO TRANSFORM ITS CLIENTS' SUPPLY CHAINS FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO GLOBAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DERIVE

BUSINESS VALUE FROM ITS OWN GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN, REINVENTED AS A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY TO CREATE VALUE FOR CLIENTS AND SHAREHOLDERS. IBM LEVERAGES ITS SUPPLY-CHAIN EXPERTISE

FOR CLIENTS THROUGH ITS SUPPLY-CHAIN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING SERVICE TO OPTIMIZE AND HELP OPERATE CLIENTS' END-TO-END SUPPLY-CHAIN PROCESSES, FROM PROCUREMENT TO

LOGISTICS.

IBM

SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $38 BILLION ANNUALLY THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS AND

CUSTOMER FULFILLMENT OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED IN ONE OPERATING UNIT THAT HAS REDUCED INVENTORIES, IMPROVED RESPONSE TO MARKETPLACE OPPORTUNITIES AND EXTERNAL RISKS AND CONVERTED FIXED TO VARIABLE

COSTS. SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES HAS IMPROVED OPERATIONS, SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROCESSES, AND THESE ACTIONS HAVE IMPROVED CLIENT SATISFACTION.

INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY DELIVERY

INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY DELIVERY (ITD) BRINGS TOGETHER ALL OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE SERVICE DELIVERY CAPABILITIES FOR STRATEGIC OUTSOURCING WITH STRONG LOCAL AND

REGIONAL MANAGEMENT TEAMS SUPPORTED BY A SET OF GLOBAL COMPETENCIES. ITD LEVERAGES THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL SCALE AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER STANDARDIZED SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AUTOMATED, REPEATABLE

AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATED.

6

THROUGH

THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL POSITION, CLIENTS GAIN COST ADVANTAGES, ACCESS TO INDUSTRY-LEADING SKILLS AND ACCESS TO IBM'S SCALE AND OVERALL FLEXIBILITY. ITD MANAGES THE WORLD'S LARGEST

PRIVATELY-OWNED IT INFRASTRUCTURE WITH EMPLOYEES IN OVER 30 COUNTRIES SUPPORTING OVER 400 DATA CENTERS.

INTEGRATED MANAGED BUSINESS PROCESS DELIVERY

INTEGRATED MANAGED BUSINESS PROCESS DELIVERY (IMBPD) PROVIDES HIGHLY EFFICIENT, WORLD CLASS DELIVERY CAPABILITIES IN IBM'S BUSINESS PROCESS DELIVERY OPERATIONS,

WHICH INCLUDE BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OUTSOURCING, BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING, BUSINESS PROCESS SERVICES AND APPLICATION ON DEMAND. IMBPD HAS EMPLOYEES AND DELIVERY CENTERS IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES

WORLDWIDE.

KEY BUSINESS DRIVERS

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE KEY DRIVERS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE SPENDING BUDGETS

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IBM'S DIVERSE SET OF PRODUCTS AND OFFERINGS

IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE MORE CONSISTENT RESULTS IN BOTH STRONG AND WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS. THE COMPANY ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY NOT ONLY HAVING A MIX OF OFFERINGS WITH LONG-TERM CASH AND

INCOME STREAMS, AS WELL AS CYCLICAL TRANSACTION-BASED SALES, BUT ALSO BY CONTINUALLY DEVELOPING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGING A SKILLED RESOURCE BASE. IBM CONTINUES TO

TRANSFORM ITSELF TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SHIFTING DEMAND TRENDS, FOCUSING ON CLIENT- OR INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS, BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND OPEN STANDARDS.

INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION INITIATIVES

IBM IS COMMITTED TO ITS TRANSFORMATION TO A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY

TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION TO ELIMINATING REDUNDANCIES AND OVERHEAD STRUCTURES TO DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY, THIS INTEGRATION HAS IMPROVED

IBM'S CAPACITY TO INNOVATE BY PROVIDING GREATER CLARITY OF KEY PRIORITIES AROUND SHARED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND LED TO A SHARPER FOCUS FOR THE COMPANY ON LEARNING, DEVELOPMENT AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING.

INNOVATION INITIATIVES

IBM INVESTS TO IMPROVE ITS ABILITY TO HELP ITS CLIENTS INNOVATE. INVESTMENT MAY OCCUR IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS IN

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW COLLABORATIVE AND CO-CREATION RELATIONSHIPS WITH DEVELOPERS, OTHER COMPANIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE IBM'S LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE DESIGN OF

SMALLER, FASTER AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES; SYSTEMS VIRTUALIZATION, GREEN DATA CENTERS AND THE DESIGN OF "GRID" COMPUTING NETWORKS THAT ALLOW COMPUTERS TO SHARE PROCESSING POWER.

OPEN STANDARDS

THE BROAD ADOPTION OF OPEN STANDARDS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPUTING MODEL FOR AN ON DEMAND BUSINESS AND IS A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION ACROSS

ALL INDUSTRIES. WITHOUT INTEROPERABILITY AMONG ALL MANNER OF COMPUTING PLATFORMS, THE INTEGRATION OF ANY CLIENT'S INTERNAL SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSES REMAINS A MONUMENTAL AND EXPENSIVE TASK.

THE BROAD-BASED ACCEPTANCE OF OPEN STANDARDSRATHER THAN CLOSED, PROPRIETARY ARCHITECTURESALSO ALLOWS THE COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO MORE EASILY ABSORB (AND THUS BENEFIT

FROM) NEW TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS. IBM'S SUPPORT OF OPEN STANDARDS IS EVIDENCED BY THE ENABLING OF ITS PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT OPEN STANDARDS SUCH AS LINUX,

7

AND

THE DEVELOPMENT OF RATIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS, WHICH CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP AND UPGRADE OTHER COMPANIES' SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO REFOCUS ITS BUSINESS ON THE HIGHER VALUE SEGMENTS OF ENTERPRISE COMPUTINGPROVIDING TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSFORMATION

SERVICES TO CLIENTS' BUSINESSES. CONSISTENT WITH THAT FOCUS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY INVEST IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS A WAY TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. AREAS OF

INVESTMENT INCLUDE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY IN SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, FOCUSED CLIENT- AND INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS, MAINTAINING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP AND EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES

WORLDWIDE.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE IT SPENDING BUDGETS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES CHANGES, WHETHER

DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CORPORATE BUYING PATTERNS, SALES PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED. IBM'S DIVERSE SET OF PRODUCTS AND OFFERINGS IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE MORE CONSISTENT

RESULTS IN BOTH STRONG AND WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS. THE COMPANY ADDRESSES THIS BY NOT ONLY HAVING A MIX OF OFFERINGS WITH LONG-TERM CASH AND INCOME STREAMS, AS WELL AS CYCLICAL

TRANSACTION-BASED SALES, BUT ALSO BY CONTINUALLY DEVELOPING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGING A SKILLED RESOURCE BASE. IBM CONTINUES TO TRANSFORM ITSELF TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

SHIFTING DEMAND TRENDS, FOCUSING ON CLIENT OR INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS, BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND OPEN STANDARDS.

INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION INITIATIVES.

IBM CONTINUES TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY

AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION TO ELIMINATING REDUNDANCIES AND OVERHEAD STRUCTURES TO DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY, THIS

INTEGRATION HAS IMPROVED IBM'S CAPACITY TO INNOVATE BY PROVIDING GREATER CLARITY OF KEY PRIORITIES AROUND SHARED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND LEADS TO A SHARPER FOCUS FOR THE COMPANY ON LEARNING,

DEVELOPMENT AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING. AS IBM CONTINUES TO DRIVE HIGHER LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND INTEGRATION INTO ITS BUSINESS, IBM'S DEPENDENCY ON INTERNAL IT SYSTEMS ALSO INCREASES.

INNOVATION INITIATIVES.

IBM INVESTS TO IMPROVE ITS ABILITY TO HELP ITS CLIENTS INNOVATE. INVESTMENT MAY OCCUR IN THE RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW COLLABORATIVE AND CO-CREATION RELATIONSHIPS WITH DEVELOPERS, OTHER COMPANIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. TO

DELIVER VALUE THAT HELPS CLIENTS DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES FOR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM COMMODITIZED CATEGORIES OF THE IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN

DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IT INDUSTRY, WITH LARGE DIVERSIFIED COMPETITORS AS WELL AS SMALLER AND NIMBLE SINGLE

TECHNOLOGY COMPETITORS, IBM'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING AND INCREASING MARKET SHARE. IBM IS MANAGING THIS RISK BY MORE CLOSELY LINKING ITS

R&D ORGANIZATION TO INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC AND CLIENT-SPECIFIC NEEDS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION DEPENDS IN PART ON ITS ABILITY

TO CONTINUE TO STAND FOR INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE BUSINESS ADVANTAGES.

OPEN STANDARDS.

THE BROAD ADOPTION OF OPEN STANDARDS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPUTING MODEL FOR ON DEMAND BUSINESS AND IS A

SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. WITHOUT INTEROPERABILITY AMONG ALL MANNER OF COMPUTING PLATFORMS, THE INTEGRATION OF ANY CLIENT'S INTERNAL SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS

AND PROCESSES REMAINS A MONUMENTAL AND EXPENSIVE TASK. THE BROAD-BASED ACCEPTANCE OF OPEN STANDARDSRATHER THAN CLOSED, PROPRIETARY ARCHITECTURESALSO ALLOWS THE COMPUTING

INFRASTRUCTURE TO MORE EASILY ABSORB (AND THUS BENEFIT FROM) NEW TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS. IBM IS COMMITTED TO FOSTERING OPEN STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY ARE VITAL TO THE ON DEMAND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, AND

BECAUSE THEIR ACCEPTANCE WILL EXPAND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE BUSINESS SERVICES AND IT INDUSTRY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS IN THE IT INDUSTRY WITH SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND

INVESTMENTS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO CLOSED AND PROPRIETARY PLATFORMS AS A WAY TO LOCK CUSTOMERS INTO A PARTICULAR ARCHITECTURE. THIS COMPETITION MAY RESULT IN INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE AND/OR IP CLAIMS

AND PROCEEDINGS.

INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO REFOCUS ITS BUSINESS ON THE HIGHER-VALUE SEGMENTS OF

ENTERPRISE COMPUTINGPROVIDING TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSFORMATION SERVICES TO CLIENTS' BUSINESSES. CONSISTENT WITH THAT FOCUS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY INVEST IN GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES, AS A WAY TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. IBM CONTINUES TO INVEST IN DOZENS OF EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES INCLUDING BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA. THE DEVELOPING NATURE

OF EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES PRESENTS POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS TO IBM'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING

10

RISKS

FROM INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND LABOR DISRUPTIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE WORLD.

PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO

ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A

NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS. LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED BY IBM HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING GRANTED TO OTHERS UNDER REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THESE

PROTECTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S NOR CAN THERE BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS WILL

ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE.

DATA PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, INVOLVE THE STORAGE AND

TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. BREACHES OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITY MEASURES COULD EXPOSE

THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED TO A RISK OF LOSS OR MISUSE OF THIS INFORMATION, RESULTING IN LITIGATION AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING

OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY'S BRAND AND REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPLEMENTING FURTHER DATA PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONALITY OF REVENUES AND PURCHASES.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THESE FACTORS HISTORICALLY HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER

REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER,

MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER.

LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN 170 COUNTRIES

WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN THAT COUNTRY AND THE COMPANY'S OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND

BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS, INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND LOCAL CURRENCY. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS OR OTHER HEALTH ISSUE, SUCH AS SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS), AVIAN INFLUENZA (BIRD

FLU) OR ANY OTHER PANDEMIC, OR LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND CUSTOMER

DEMAND.

INSURANCE.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS THIRD PARTY INSURANCE COVERAGE AGAINST VARIOUS LIABILITY RISKS AND RISKS OF PROPERTY LOSS.

WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO INSURE AGAINST LIABILITY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE RISKS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE RISKS OR OTHER EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE

COVERAGE PROVIDED BY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING

THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS,

FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

11

REGULATIONS.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION.

TAX MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN

COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX

LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS

SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING

FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

INTERNAL CONTROLS.

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO

ITS FINANCIAL REPORTS AND TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FRAUD. IF THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO ITS FINANCIAL REPORTS AND EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FRAUD, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED. PURSUANT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FURNISH A REPORT BY MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT'S

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH CONTROL. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF

HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. THEREFORE, EVEN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE

CONTROL MAY

BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS, AND THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE.

USE OF ESTIMATES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND THE PREPARATION

OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY USES CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND MANAGEMENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT THE

COMPANY MAY UNDERTAKE IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 47 TO 49 OF IBM'S 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS.

IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE N, "CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS" ON PAGES 94 THROUGH 96 OF IBM'S 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 5, "ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES", INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BY DEFINITION THEY INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT AND THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETION, AND THEREFORE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESSES FACE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, RANGING FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST GLOBAL ENTERPRISES TO AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL, RAPIDLY GROWING AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED

ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY, PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY, PRICE AND THE BREADTH OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICE OFFERINGS ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, RESULTING IN REDUCED PROFIT MARGINS AND/OR LOSS OF MARKET OPPORTUNITY. UNLIKE

12

MANY

OF ITS COMPETITORS, THE COMPANY HAS A BROAD SET OF CAPABILITIES AND BUSINESSES AND MUST ALLOCATE RESOURCES ACROSS THESE BUSINESSES WHILE COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN ONE OR MORE OF

THESE PRODUCT LINES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY NOT FUND OR INVEST IN CERTAIN OF ITS BUSINESSES TO THE SAME DEGREE THAT ITS COMPETITORS DO, AND THESE COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL,

TECHNICAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM THAN THE BUSINESSES AGAINST WHICH THEY COMPETE.

VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN

FINANCIAL RESULTS, THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS BY THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT, LIKE OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, THE

COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL AND RELIANCE ON CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE

CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND

AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED WORKERS RETIRE. IN ADDITION,

COMPANIES IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES INDUSTRY WHOSE EMPLOYEES ACCEPT POSITIONS WITH IBM MAY CLAIM THAT IBM HAS INTERFERED WITH NONCOMPETE OBLIGATIONS OF THEIR FORMER EMPLOYEES, ENGAGED

IN UNFAIR HIRING PRACTICES OR THAT THE EMPLOYMENT OF THESE PERSONS BY IBM WOULD INVOLVE THE DISCLOSURE OR USE OF TRADE SECRETS. ANY SUCH CLAIMS COULD LIMIT OR PREVENT IBM FROM HIRING EMPLOYEES OR

CAUSE IT TO INCUR LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN DEFENDING THE COMPANY OR ITS EMPLOYEES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE MERIT. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S KEY PERSONNEL

RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S

EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW

MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO

ASSURE THAT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IF THE NEED ARISES. THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A

TIMELY MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES, RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES FROM ITS AFFILIATES

OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S

CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION

OF RESIDUAL VALUES, AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS

WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM

BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL SERVICES, PUBLIC, AND SMALL

AND MEDIUM BUSINESS SECTORS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS AND THE

COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS'

13

FINANCIAL

CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RESERVES THAT IT BELIEVES ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER EXPOSURE FOR ANY UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES AND REGULARLY REVIEWS SUCH RESERVES BY CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH

AS WRITE-OFF HISTORY, AGING ANALYSIS AND ANY SPECIFIC, KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS. IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER,

OR, IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS RESERVES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET

INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND

RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES FROM

TIME TO TIME. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL

MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE

FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUES DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL

MARKETS FROM TIME TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING, THE METHODS

EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL,

DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS

ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS". THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS", INCLUDING THE SECTION ENTITLED "VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE", AS WELL AS

ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY, TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND

THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF 20 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF

WHICH 16 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 2 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM

BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 8 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 6 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 2 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 1 MILLION

SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADING

OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

ON

APRIL 24, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED $15.0 BILLION IN FUNDS FOR USE IN THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM; THE COMPANY STATED THAT IT MAY REPURCHASE

SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING STRUCTURED OR ACCELERATED TRANSACTIONS, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE NOTE M "STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY ACTIVITY" ON

PAGES 92 THROUGH 93 OF IBM'S 2007 ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007. THE COMMON STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE M "STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY ACTIVITY" ON PAGES 92 THROUGH 93 OF IBM'S 2007 ANNUAL REPORT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THE ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS SETTLEMENT PERIODS TO CONCLUDE UNTIL MARCH 2008. ON DECEMBER 3, 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO REPURCHASE UP TO

$1 BILLION OF ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS BY THE END OF FEBRUARY 2008. THIS TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE SHARES TENDERED TO SATISFY THE EXERCISE PRICE IN CONNECTION WITH

CASHLESS EXERCISES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS OR SHARES TENDERED TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS.

IDENTICAL TO THE 1999 PLAN, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF AWARDS THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN (STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE AWARDS).

THE

2001 PLAN IS ADMINISTERED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THAT COMMITTEE MAY DELEGATE TO OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY

CERTAIN OF ITS DUTIES, POWERS AND AUTHORITY. PAYMENT OF AWARDS MAY BE MADE IN THE FORM OF CASH, STOCK OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF AND MAY BE DEFERRED WITH COMMITTEE APPROVAL. AWARDS ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE

OR ASSIGNABLE EXCEPT (I) BY LAW, WILL OR THE LAWS OF DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION, (II) AS A RESULT OF THE DISABILITY OF THE RECIPIENT, OR (III) WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE COMMITTEE.

IF

THE EMPLOYMENT OF A PARTICIPANT TERMINATES, OTHER THAN AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OR DISABILITY OF THE PARTICIPANT, ALL UNEXERCISED, DEFERRED AND UNPAID AWARDS SHALL BE CANCELED

IMMEDIATELY, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT PROVIDES OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT OF THE DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT OR IN THE EVENT A PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE DISABLED AND ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE IBM LONG-TERM DISABILITY PLAN (OR ANY SUCCESSOR PLAN OR SIMILAR PLAN OF ANOTHER EMPLOYER), THE PARTICIPANT'S ESTATE, BENEFICIARIES OR REPRESENTATIVE, AS THE CASE MAY

BE, SHALL HAVE THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTICIPANT UNDER THE APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNLESS THE AWARD AGREEMENT SPECIFIES OTHERWISE, THE COMMITTEE MAY CANCEL, RESCIND, SUSPEND,

WITHHOLD OR OTHERWISE LIMIT OR RESTRICT ANY UNEXPIRED, UNPAID, OR DEFERRED AWARDS AT ANY TIME IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE AWARD AGREEMENT AND THE

PLAN. IN ADDITION,

AWARDS ARE CANCELLED IF THE PARTICIPANT ENGAGES IN ANY CONDUCT OR ACT DETERMINED TO BE INJURIOUS, DETRIMENTAL OR PREJUDICIAL TO ANY INTEREST OF THE COMPANY.

FUND AWARDS FOR EMPLOYEES OF PWCC WHO HAVE COME OVER TO THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION. AWARDS FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE FUNDED FROM THE PWCC PLAN. THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS OF THE PWCC PLAN ARE SUBSTANTIVELY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE 2001 PLAN, DESCRIBED ABOVE.
