PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 16, 1911, AS THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO.

(C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING MACHINE CO., AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW YORK. SINCE THAT TIME, IBM HAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION

OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INVENTION, AND ITS OPERATIONS AND AIMS HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE. THIS WAS SIGNALED 80 YEARS AGO, IN 1924, WHEN C-T-R CHANGED ITS NAME TO

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. AND IT CONTINUES TODAY: IBM IS THE LARGEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE WORLD, THE WORLD'S LARGEST BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICES COMPANY, THE

WORLD'S LARGEST CONSULTING SERVICES ORGANIZATION, THE WORLD'S LARGEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST FINANCIER OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

IBM

IS AN INNOVATION-BASED BUSINESS SERVING THE NEEDS OF ENTERPRISES AND INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE. IT DEFINES INNOVATION AS THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS INSIGHT AND TECHNOLOGICAL

INVENTION. IBM SEEKS TO DELIVER CLIENT SUCCESSIN WHATEVER WAYS ITS CLIENTS DEFINE SUCCESSBY GIVING THEM DIFFERENTIATING CAPABILITIES THAT PROVIDE UNIQUE COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE.

BY

HELPING ITS CLIENTS REDESIGN THEIR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, ENABLED BY NEW OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS, IBM HELPS THEM TO BECOME ON DEMAND BUSINESSES. IBM DEFINES

AN ON DEMAND BUSINESS AS AN ENTERPRISE WHOSE BUSINESS PROCESSES ARE RESPONSIVE TO ANY DEMAND, OPPORTUNITY OR THREAT; INTEGRATED END-TO-END ACROSS THE COMPANY; AND CAPABLE OF

INTEGRATING FLUIDLY ACROSS EXTENDED BUSINESS ECOSYSTEMS OF PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND CLIENTS.

IBM

FIRST DESCRIBED THIS NEW MODEL AND SET OF CAPABILITIES IN 2002, BELIEVING THEY REPRESENT THE CURRENT EVOLUTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURES AND OF BUSINESS AND

INSTITUTIONAL MODELS. IBM CALLS THIS ARCHITECTURE THE ON DEMAND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: AN INFRASTRUCTURE BASED ON INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS "OPEN STANDARDS"), RATHER

THAN PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES. IN IBM'S VIEW, AN ENTERPRISE'S INVESTMENT IN SUCH AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDES BOTH SUPERIOR RETURNS AND MAXIMUM FREEDOM OF INTEROPERABILITY AND ACTION. STANDARDS HAVE

BECOME A CORE ELEMENT OF IBM'S OVERALL STRATEGY AND IMPACT ALL OF OUR UNIT STRATEGIES.

THE

SHIFT TO STANDARDS-BASED TECHNOLOGIES HAS BEEN BOLSTERED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS BY THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE "OPEN SOURCE" SOFTWARE MOVEMENT, A RESULT OF LARGE-SCALE

COLLABORATION AMONG MEMBERS OF THE WORLDWIDE DEVELOPER AND BUSINESS COMMUNITIES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM, THE ECLIPSE COMPUTING PLATFORM AND THE JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

IBM'S

CLIENTS INCLUDE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENTERPRISES, FROM SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND COMPANIES REPRESENTING EVERY MAJOR INDUSTRY AND

ENDEAVOR. OVER THE LAST DECADE, IBM HAS EXITED OR GREATLY DE-EMPHASIZED ITS INVOLVEMENT IN CONSUMER MARKETS AND DIVESTED ITSELF OF OTHER NONCORE BUSINESSES TO CONCENTRATE ON THE ENTERPRISE

MARKET. IN IBM'S VIEW, OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ENTERPRISE MARKET ARE SUPERIORREPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE IT INDUSTRY'S REVENUE. AS A RESULT, IBM HAS MADE

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTED IN EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IMPORTANT TO ITS ENTERPRISE CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE GROWN INTO MULTIBILLION DOLLAR BUSINESSES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT, AND ARE

NOW CONTRIBUTING TO IBM'S GROWTH.

THE

MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S ENTERPRISE BUSINESS, WHICH EXCLUDES THE COMPANY'S ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS, OCCURS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE BROADLY GROUPED

INTO SIX SECTORS AROUND WHICH THE COMPANY'S GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGIES, AND SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

ORGANIZATIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S MAJOR OPERATIONS COMPRISE A GLOBAL SERVICES SEGMENT; A SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP; A PERSONAL SYSTEMS GROUP; A SOFTWARE SEGMENT;

A GLOBAL FINANCING SEGMENT; AND AN ENTERPRISE INVESTMENTS SEGMENT.

GLOBAL SERVICES

IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY OF PROVIDING INSIGHT AND SOLUTIONS TO CLIENTS. WHILE SOLUTIONS OFTEN

INCLUDE INDUSTRY-LEADING IBM SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE, OTHER SUPPLIERS' PRODUCTS ARE ALSO USED IF A CLIENT SOLUTION REQUIRES IT. GLOBAL SERVICES OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS AS WELL AS BCS CONTRACTS RANGE FROM

LESS THAN ONE YEAR TO TEN YEARS.

SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP

PROVIDES IBM'S CLIENTS WITH BUSINESS SOLUTIONS REQUIRING ADVANCED COMPUTING POWER AND STORAGE CAPABILITIES.

MORE THAN HALF OF THE SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP'S ESERVER AND STORAGE SYSTEMS SALES TRANSACTIONS ARE THROUGH BUSINESS PARTNERS AND APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT ARE DIRECT TO END-USER

CLIENTS AND MORE THAN HALF ARE THROUGH THE WEB AT IBM.COM. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP PROVIDES LEADING SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS, PACKAGING SOLUTIONS AND ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY SERVICES TO OEM

CLIENTS (APPROXIMATELY 14 PERCENT OF SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP REVENUE) AND FOR IBM'S OWN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDS. WHILE APPROPRIATELY NOT REPORTED AS EXTERNAL REVENUE, HARDWARE IS ALSO

DEPLOYED TO SUPPORT GLOBAL SERVICES SOLUTIONS.

PERSONAL SYSTEMS GROUP

INCLUDES SALES OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, BUSINESS AND COMPUTING SOLUTIONS FOR RETAIL STORES AND ADVANCED PRINTING

CAPABILITIES FOR LARGE ENTERPRISE CLIENTS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. IN DECEMBER 2004, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT LENOVO GROUP LIMITED, THE LARGEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN

CHINA, WILL ACQUIRE IBM'S PERSONAL COMPUTING DIVISION. THIS TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005.

SOFTWARE

CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF MIDDLEWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEMS SOFTWARE. MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE ENABLES CLIENTS TO INTEGRATE SYSTEMS,

PROCESSES AND APPLICATIONS ACROSS THEIR ENTERPRISES. MIDDLEWARE IS DESIGNED

TO BE THE UNDERLYING SUPPORT FOR APPLICATIONS PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS (ISVS), WHO BUILD INDUSTRY- OR PROCESS-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS ACCORDING TO OPEN INDUSTRY STANDARDS. OPERATING

SYSTEMS ARE THE ENGINES THAT RUN COMPUTERS. APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF EXTERNAL SOFTWARE REVENUE RELATES TO ONE-TIME CHARGE (OTC) ARRANGEMENTS, WHEREBY THE CLIENT PAYS ONE UP-FRONT

PAYMENT FOR A LIFETIME LICENSE. THE REMAINING ANNUITY REVENUE CONSISTS OF BOTH MAINTENANCE REVENUE SOLD WITH OTC ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS SOFTWARE SOLD ON A MONTHLY LICENSE CHARGE (MLC) ARRANGEMENT.

TYPICALLY, ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF OTC SOFTWARE INCLUDE ONE YEAR OF MAINTENANCE. THE CLIENT CAN ALSO PURCHASE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, WHICH INCLUDES PRODUCT UPGRADES AND

TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

GLOBAL FINANCING

IS DESCRIBED ON PAGES 35 TO 39 OF IBM'S 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS WHICH IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

ENTERPRISE INVESTMENTS

DEVELOPS AND PROVIDES INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC IT SOLUTIONS SUPPORTING THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND GLOBAL SERVICES SEGMENTS

OF THE COMPANY. PRIMARY PRODUCT LINES INCLUDE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENT PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES. PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE PRIMARILY SERVES THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR

AND HELPS CLIENTS MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING OF THEIR PRODUCTS. DOCUMENT PROCESSOR PRODUCTS SERVICE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR AND INCLUDE PRODUCTS THAT ENABLE ELECTRONIC BANKING.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS

THE FOLLOWING THREE COMPANY-WIDE ORGANIZATIONS PLAY KEY ROLES IN IBM'S DELIVERY OF VALUE TO ITS CLIENTS.



SALES & DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION

WITH COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF IBM'S BUSINESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES OFFERED BY IBM AND ITS

NETWORK OF BUSINESS PARTNERS, THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL TEAM OF ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVES AND SOLUTIONS PROFESSIONALS GAIN A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF EACH CLIENT'S ORGANIZATIONAL, INFRASTRUCTURE AND

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC NEEDS TO DETERMINE THE BEST APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING THE CLIENT'S CRITICAL BUSINESS AND IT CHALLENGES. THESE PROFESSIONALS WORK IN INTEGRATED TEAMS WITH IBM CONSULTANTS AND TECHNOLOGY

REPRESENTATIVES, COMBINING THEIR DEEP SKILLS AND EXPERTISE TO DELIVER HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS.

SOLUTIONS

PROVIDERS, RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. RESELLERS SELL IBM PLATFORMS AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICES AS PART OF A DISCRETE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM DECISION TO CLIENTS WANTING THIRD-PARTY

ASSISTANCE.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) OPERATIONS DIFFERENTIATE IBM FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IBM ANNUALLY SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $5-6 BILLION FOR R&D,

INCLUDING CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, FOCUSING ITS INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS, IBM WAS ONCE AGAIN AWARDED MORE U.S.

PATENTS IN 2004 THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY. THIS MARKS THE 12TH YEAR IN A ROW THAT IBM ACHIEVED THIS DISTINCTION.

IN

ADDITION TO PRODUCING WORLD-CLASS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IBM INNOVATIONS ARE A MAJOR DIFFERENTIATOR IN PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS THROUGH ITS GROWING

SERVICES ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN R&D ALSO RESULT IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) INCOME. SOME OF IBM'S TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN IBM PRODUCTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE

USED BY THE COMPANY'S LICENSEES FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WHEN THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY IS NOT STRATEGIC TO IBM'S BUSINESS GOALS. A THIRD GROUP IS BOTH USED INTERNALLY AND LICENSED EXTERNALLY.

IN

ADDITION TO THESE IP INCOME SOURCES, THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES VALUE FROM ITS PATENT PORTFOLIO THROUGH CROSS-LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS AND IP LICENSED IN DIVESTITURE TRANSACTIONS. THE

VALUE OF THESE OTHER TWO SOURCES IS NOT READILY APPARENT IN THE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS, BECAUSE INCOME ON CROSS-LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS IS RECORDED ONLY TO THE EXTENT

CASH IS RECEIVED. THE VALUE RECEIVED BY IBM FOR IP INVOLVING THE SALE OF A BUSINESS IS INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE DIVESTITURE, NOT IN THE SEPARATELY DISPLAYED IP INCOME AMOUNTS IN

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.

6

IN

JANUARY 2005, IBM ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD PLEDGE 500 OF ITS PATENTS FOR USE BY THE OPEN COMPUTING COMMUNITY, REPRESENTING A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE WAY IBM MANAGES AND DEPLOYS ITS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO. IBM'S INTENT IS TO HELP FORM AN INDUSTRY-WIDE "PATENT COMMONS," IN WHICH PATENTS ARE USED TO ESTABLISH A PLATFORM FOR FURTHER INNOVATION IN AREAS OF BROAD

INTEREST TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS AND USERS. THE PLEDGE IS APPLICABLE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY, OR COMPANY WORKING ON OR USING SOFTWARE THAT MEETS THE OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE (OSI)

DEFINITION OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

JUST AS IBM WORKS TO TRANSFORM ITS CLIENTS' SUPPLY CHAINS FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO MARKET CONDITIONS, IBM HAS UNDERTAKEN A LARGE-SCALE

INITIATIVE TO RECAST ITS OWN INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN AS AN ON DEMAND BUSINESS OPERATION, TURNING WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN AN EXPENSE TO BE MANAGED INTO A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY AND,

ULTIMATELY, IMPROVED DELIVERY AND OUTCOMES FOR ITS CLIENTS. IBM SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $41 BILLION ANNUALLY THROUGH ITS SUPPLY CHAIN, PROCURING MATERIALS AND SERVICES AROUND THE WORLD. THE

COMPANY'S SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED IN ONE OPERATING UNIT THAT HAS REDUCED INVENTORIES, IMPROVED RESPONSE TO MARKETPLACE OPPORTUNITIES AND EXTERNAL RISKS AND

CONVERTED FIXED TO VARIABLE COSTS. SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING INTERNAL OPERATIONS HAS IMPROVED SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROCESSES AND THEREBY THE EXPERIENCES OF THE COMPANY'S CLIENTS WHEN

WORKING WITH IBM. BECAUSE SOME OF THE COST SAVINGS THIS UNIT GENERATES ARE PASSED ALONG TO CLIENTS, THEY WILL NOT ALWAYS RESULT IN A VISIBLE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. WHILE THESE EFFORTS ARE LARGELY CONCERNED WITH PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND DELIVERY, IBM IS ALSO APPLYING SUPPLY CHAIN PRINCIPLES TO SERVICE DELIVERY ACROSS ITS SOLUTIONS AND

SERVICES LINES OF BUSINESS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, IBM IS CREATING A NEW LABOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMBASED ON A UNIFORM TAXONOMY OF SKILLSTHAT WILL ENABLE THE ORGANIZATION

TO MORE EFFICIENTLY MATCH ITS LABOR RESOURCES TO THE NEEDS OF IBM CLIENTS, DEPLOY THE RIGHT EXPERTISE QUICKLY, AND CREATE A BETTER SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BALANCE OF LABOR

SUPPLY AND DEMAND BY COMPARING THE DEMANDS OF THE MARKET AGAINST THE DATABASE OF AVAILABLE SKILLS.

IN

ADDITION TO ITS OWN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY USES A NUMBER OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURING (CM) COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO MANUFACTURE IBM-DESIGNED PRODUCTS. THE

USE OF CM COMPANIES IS INTENDED TO GENERATE COST EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCE TIME-TO-MARKET FOR CERTAIN IBM PRODUCTS. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH CM COMPANIES ARE

EXCLUSIVE. THE COMPANY HAS KEY RELATIONSHIPS WITH SANMINA-SCI FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF SOME INTEL-BASED PRODUCTS AND WITH SOLECTRON FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

OF GLOBAL ASSET RECOVERY SERVICESAN OPERATION OF GLOBAL FINANCING THAT RESTORES END-OF-LEASE PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND OTHER IT EQUIPMENT FOR RESALE.

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING IBM'S BUSINESS

FORWARD-LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS.

CERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT MAY CONSTITUTE "FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 ("REFORM ACT"). THE COMPANY MAY ALSO MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN MATERIALS DELIVERED TO STOCKHOLDERS AND IN PRESS RELEASES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S REPRESENTATIVES MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS PROVIDE CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND INCLUDE ANY STATEMENT THAT DOES NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO ANY HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACT. WORDS

SUCH AS "ANTICIPATES," "BELIEVES," "EXPECTS," "ESTIMATES," "INTENDS," "PLANS," "PROJECTS," AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, MAY IDENTIFY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO

UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REFORM ACT, SET FORTH BELOW ARE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THOSE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. READERS SHOULD CAREFULLY

REVIEW THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AS THEY IDENTIFY CERTAIN IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL

TRENDS. THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN ADDITION TO OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, IN THE COMPANY'S FILING WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION OR IN MATERIALS INCORPORATED THEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE IT SPENDING BUDGETS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES CHANGES,

WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CORPORATE BUYING PATTERNS, SALES PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED. IBM'S DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND OFFERINGS IS DESIGNED TO GAIN MARKET

SHARE IN STRONG AND WEAK ECONOMIC CLIMATES. THE COMPANY ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY NOT ONLY HAVING A MIX OF OFFERINGS WITH LONG-TERM CASH AND INCOME STREAMS AS WELL AS CYCLICAL TRANSACTION-BASED

SALES, BUT ALSO BY CONTINUALLY DEVELOPING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGING A SKILLED RESOURCE BASE. IBM CONTINUES TO TRANSFORM ITSELF TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SHIFTING DEMAND

TRENDS, FOCUSING ON CLIENT OR INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS, BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND OPEN STANDARDS.

INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES.

IBM CONTINUES TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS AS

IT TRANSFORMS ITSELF INTO AN ON DEMAND ENTERPRISE. THIS INCLUDES THE INTERNAL SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES DISCUSSED ABOVE, AS WELL AS DRIVING COLLABORATION ACROSS THE IBM ENTERPRISE TO STIMULATE

INNOVATION AND DRIVE GROWTH. TRANSFORMATION EFFORTS ARE IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT OF ITS COSTS WORLDWIDE: THE REBALANCING OF SKILLS, OPTIMIZING ITS WORKFORCE TO DRIVE GROWTH, KEEPING THE

COMPANY'S COMPENSATION PROGRAMS COMPETITIVE, AND CREATING A COST EFFICIENT AND CUTTING-EDGE IT INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT ITS TRANSFORMATION. IBM IS EXTENDING ITS SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES TO LABOR

COSTS AND OTHER INTERNAL PROCESSES. CONTINUED SUCCESS IN THIS AREA WILL IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COST STRUCTURE

IMPROVEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF COMPETITIVE LEVERAGE IT CAN APPLY BY PASSING SAVINGS ALONG TO CLIENTS.

INNOVATION INITIATIVES.

IBM INVESTS FOR NEW AND INNOVATIVE CAPABILITIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM

COMMODITIZED CATEGORIES OF THE IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF THROUGH INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. EXAMPLES INCLUDE IBM'S LEADERSHIP POSITION

IN THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF ASICS; THE DESIGN OF SMALLER, FASTER AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES; THE DESIGN OF "GRID" COMPUTING NETWORKS THAT ALLOW COMPUTERS TO SHARE PROCESSING

POWER; THE TRANSFORMATION AND INTEGRATION OF BUSINESS PROCESSES; AND THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO ADVANCE OPEN TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS AND TO ENGAGE WITH GOVERNMENTS, ACADEMIA, THINK TANKS AND

NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS ON EMERGING TRENDS IN TECHNOLOGY, SOCIETY AND CULTURE. IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IT INDUSTRY, WITH LARGE DIVERSIFIED COMPETITORS AS WELL AS SMALLER AND NIMBLE SINGLE-

TECHNOLOGY COMPETITORS, IBM'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING AND INCREASING MARKET SHARE. IBM IS MANAGING THIS RISK BY MORE CLOSELY LINKING ITS

R&D ORGANIZATION TO INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC AND CLIENT-SPECIFIC NEEDS, AS DISCUSSED IN DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSIBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.

OPEN STANDARDS.

THE BROAD ADOPTION OF OPEN STANDARDS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPUTING MODEL FOR ON DEMAND BUSINESS AND IS A

SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. WITHOUT INTEROPERABILITY AMONG ALL MANNER OF COMPUTING PLATFORMS, THE INTEGRATION OF ANY CLIENT'S INTERNAL SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS

AND PROCESSES REMAINS A MONUMENTAL AND EXPENSIVE TASK. THE BROAD-BASED ACCEPTANCE OF OPEN STANDARDSRATHER THAN CLOSED, PROPRIETARY ARCHITECTURESALSO ALLOWS THE COMPUTING

INFRASTRUCTURE TO MORE EASILY ABSORB (AND THUS BENEFIT FROM) NEW TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS. IBM IS COMMITTED TO FOSTERING OPEN STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY ARE VITAL TO THE ON DEMAND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, AND

BECAUSE THEIR ACCEPTANCE WILL EXPAND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE BUSINESS SERVICES AND IT INDUSTRY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS IN THE IT INDUSTRY WITH SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND

INVESTMENTS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO CLOSED AND PROPRIETARY PLATFORMS AS A WAY TO LOCK CUSTOMERS INTO A PARTICULAR ARCHITECTURE. THIS COMPETITION WILL RESULT IN INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE AND/OR IP CLAIMS

AND PROCEEDINGS. IBM'S SUPPORT OF OPEN STANDARDS IS EVIDENCED BY THE ENABLING OF ITS PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT OPEN STANDARDS SUCH AS LINUX, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF RATIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS, WHICH

CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP AND UPGRADE ANY OTHER COMPANY'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO REFOCUS ITS BUSINESS ON THE HIGHER VALUE SEGMENTS OF ENTERPRISE

COMPUTINGPROVIDING TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSFORMATION SERVICES TO CLIENTS' BUSINESSES. CONSISTENT WITH THAT FOCUS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY INVEST IN EMERGING BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES, AS A WAY TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAIN. AREAS OF INVESTMENT

8

INCLUDE

STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY IN SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, INFORMATION-BASED MEDICINE, ON DEMAND RETAIL, SENSOR AND ACTUATOR SOLUTIONS, BUSINESS PERFORMANCE TRANSFORMATION SERVICES, KEY

TECHNOLOGIES (POWER5 AND POWERBLADE) AND EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA, RUSSIA, INDIA AND BRAZIL.

PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO

ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A

NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS. LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED BY IBM HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING GRANTED TO OTHERS UNDER REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THESE

PROTECTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S NOR CAN THERE BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS WILL

ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW

MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO ASSURE

THAT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IF THE NEED ARISES. THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY

MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

SEASONALITY OF REVENUES.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, THE LENGTH OF THE

SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THESE FACTORS HISTORICALLY HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER

THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER.

LOCAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 160 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVES MORE THAN HALF OF

ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN THAT COUNTRY AND THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS AND INFLATION.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING

THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS,

FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE

WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION.

INTERNAL CONTROLS.

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO

ITS FINANCIAL REPORTS AND TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FRAUD. IF THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO ITS FINANCIAL REPORTS AND EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FRAUD, THE COMPANY'S BRAND AND

OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED. PURSUANT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FURNISH A REPORT BY MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING

MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH CONTROL. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE

POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. THEREFORE, EVEN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND

FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE

CONTROL MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS

9

INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING

RESULTS COULD BE HARMED, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS REPORTING OBLIGATIONS, AND THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESSES FACE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, RANGING FROM FORTUNE 50 COMPANIES TO AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL, RAPIDLY GROWING AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT ITS COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY, PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY, PRICE AND THE BREADTH OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICE OFFERINGS ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

INTENSE

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, RESULTING IN REDUCED PROFIT MARGINS AND/OR LOSS OF MARKET OPPORTUNITY. UNLIKE MANY OF

ITS COMPETITORS, THE COMPANY HAS A PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES AND MUST ALLOCATE RESOURCES ACROSS THESE BUSINESSES WHILE COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE PRODUCT LINES. AS

A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY NOT FUND OR INVEST IN CERTAIN OF ITS BUSINESSES TO THE SAME DEGREE THAT ITS COMPETITORS DO, AND THESE COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL AND MARKETING

RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM THAN THE BUSINESSES AGAINST WHICH THEY COMPETE.

VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICES.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN

RESULTS, THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS BY THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT, LIKE OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, THE COMPANY'S STOCK

PRICE IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY.

DEPENDENCE ON AND COMPENSATION OF KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE

AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR

TALENTS IS INTENSE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY RETAIN AND ATTRACT THE KEY PERSONNEL IT NEEDS. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE

STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE

CASH COMPENSATION.

CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS NON-U.S. REVENUES FROM

ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS AND ITS RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE

COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CLIENT, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND

LIABILITIES AND THE DETERMINATION OF RESIDUAL VALUES. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. DERIVATIVES INVOLVE THE

RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE THESE RISKS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND

RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES FROM

TIME TO TIME. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL

MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY.

BACKLOG.

THE VALUE OF UNFILLED ORDERS IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATOR OF FUTURE REVENUES FROM THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF REVENUE FROM SERVICES, THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTS DELIVERED FROM SHELF INVENTORIES, AND THE SHORTENING OF PRODUCT DELIVERY SCHEDULES. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S

GLOBAL SERVICES SEGMENT, IN 2004 THE COMPANY SIGNED CONTRACTS TOTALING $43 BILLION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A SERVICES BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 OF $111 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$120 BILLION AT THE END OF 2003.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF 27 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF

WHICH 20 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 7 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 3 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO

NON-IBM BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 9 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED 9 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 6 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 3 MILLION WAS LEASED.

OF THESE AMOUNTS, 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES.

ALTHOUGH

IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR SPACE, CONTINUOUS UPGRADING OF FACILITIES IS

ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY, AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION.

WE

HAVE AUDITED THE STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS CONSULTING SERVICES REPORTING UNIT (THE "REPORTING UNIT") (A REPORTING UNIT AS DEFINED IN STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142), OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (THE "COMPANY") AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 AND THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES

(COLLECTIVELY, THE "STATEMENTS") FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 AND THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 (NOT SEPARATELY PRESENTED HEREIN). THESE STATEMENTS ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUDITING STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL PRESENTATION OF THE

STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

THE

STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (FOR USE BY THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH ITS VARIOUS

FILINGS WITH THE COMMISSION). CERTAIN CORPORATE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CORPORATE EXPENSES, THAT ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REPORTING UNIT, AND WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED

FROM THE STATEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 AND

ITS REVENUES AND EXPENSES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION

WE

HAVE EXAMINED MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION THAT THE CONTROLS OVER THE INITIATION AND RECORDING OF REVENUE TRANSACTIONS AND THE RECORDING OF DIRECT COSTS OF THE BUSINESS CONSULTING SERVICES

REPORTING UNIT ("THE REPORTING UNIT") (A REPORTING UNIT AS DEFINED IN STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142), OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION ("IBM") ARE EFFECTIVE,

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CONTROLS OVER THE INITIATION AND RECORDING OF REVENUE TRANSACTIONS AND THE RECORDING OF DIRECT COSTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION BASED ON OUR EXAMINATION.

THE

CONTROL OBJECTIVES THAT FORMED THE BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION INCLUDED (1) CREDIT CHECKS, CONTRACT PRICING, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND A VALID SIGNED CONTRACT

ARE OBTAINED, REVIEWED AND APPROVED, AND NON-STANDARD CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR REVIEW PRIOR TO REVENUE RECOGNITION; (2) INVOICES ARE GENERATED BASED ON

CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND REVIEWED PRIOR TO ISSUANCE; (3) REVENUES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE MONITORED AND APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TIMELY; (4) COSTS ARE APPROPRIATELY

AND TIMELY CAPTURED BY CONTRACT AND BUSINESS UNIT AND RECONCILED WITH RELATED REVENUES; AND (5) LOSSES ON CONTRACTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS MADE BASED ON ESTABLISHED

ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

OUR

EXAMINATION WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ATTESTATION STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES) AND, ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLS OVER THE INITIATION AND RECORDING OF REVENUE TRANSACTIONS AND THE RECORDING OF DIRECT COSTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE CONTROLS, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXAMINATION PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

OUR

EXAMINATION WAS LIMITED TO THOSE CONTROLS THAT ARE APPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL REVENUE TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE INITIATED WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT, AND TO THOSE CONTROLS THAT ARE APPLIED TO

THE DIRECT COSTS BY REPORTING UNIT PERSONNEL. OUR EXAMINATION DID NOT EXTEND TO IBM'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS IT RELATES TO APPLICATIONS AND CONTROLS THAT ARE COMMON TO ALL

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN IBM, OR TO IBM ENTITY-LEVEL CONTROLS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ALSO AFFECT THE RECORDING OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S REVENUES AND DIRECT COSTS.

BECAUSE

OF INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ANY INTERNAL CONTROL, MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY OCCUR AND NOT BE DETECTED. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE CONTROLS OVER THE

INITIATION AND RECORDING OF REVENUE TRANSACTIONS AND THE RECORDING OF DIRECT COSTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF

CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONTROLS MAY DETERIORATE.

IN

OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION THAT THE CONTROLS OVER THE INITIATION AND RECORDING OF REVENUE TRANSACTIONS AND THE RECORDING OF DIRECT COSTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT ARE EFFECTIVE

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, IS FAIRLY STATED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THE CONTROL OBJECTIVES DESCRIBED ABOVE.
