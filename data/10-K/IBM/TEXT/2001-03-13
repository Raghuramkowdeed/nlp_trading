PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE

STATE OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 15, 1911, AS THE COMPUTING-TABULATING-RECORDING CO.

(C-T-R), A CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPUTING SCALE CO. OF AMERICA, THE TABULATING

MACHINE CO., AND THE INTERNATIONAL TIME RECORDING CO. OF NEW YORK. IN 1924,

C-T-R ADOPTED THE NAME INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION.

IBM USES ADVANCED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS. THE

COMPANY OPERATES PRIMARILY IN A SINGLE INDUSTRY USING SEVERAL SEGMENTS THAT

CREATE VALUE BY OFFERING A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE, EITHER SINGULARLY

OR IN SOME COMBINATION, TECHNOLOGIES, SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, SOFTWARE AND

FINANCING.

ORGANIZATIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S MAJOR OPERATIONS COMPRISE THREE HARDWARE

PRODUCT SEGMENTS--TECHNOLOGY, PERSONAL SYSTEMS AND ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS; A GLOBAL

SERVICES SEGMENT; A SOFTWARE SEGMENT; A GLOBAL FINANCING SEGMENT AND AN

ENTERPRISE INVESTMENTS SEGMENT. THE SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING CUSTOMER BASE, HOMOGENEITY OF PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY AND

DELIVERY CHANNELS.

IBM OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH ITS GLOBAL SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

ORGANIZATIONS. THE SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BOTH A GEOGRAPHIC

FOCUS (IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE/MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA, AND ASIA PACIFIC) AND A

SPECIALIZED AND GLOBAL INDUSTRY FOCUS. IN ADDITION, THESE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE

A GLOBAL SALES AND DISTRIBUTION EFFORT DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO SMALL AND MEDIUM

BUSINESSES. IBM ALSO OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH A VARIETY OF

THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS PARTNERS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, AS WELL AS

THROUGH ITS ON-LINE CHANNELS.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE

IMPORTANT TO ITS SUCCESS, IBM BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY

DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE, OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF

PATENTS OR LICENSES. IBM OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS, WHICH

VARY IN DURATION, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS. LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED BY IBM

HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING GRANTED TO OTHERS UNDER REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

THESE PROTECTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S NOR CAN THERE

BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS WILL ADEQUATELY DETER MISAPPROPRIATION

OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES

THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE

FUTURE.

IBM'S BUSINESSES EMPLOY A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES AND RAW

MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS,

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO ASSURE THAT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES ARE

AVAILABLE IF THE NEED ARISES. THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY

MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY

SEGMENT RESULTS WERE AFFECTED BY SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS OF WAFERS AND CERAMIC

SUBSTRATES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2000. IN BOTH CASES, STRONG DEMAND FOR THESE

ITEMS FROM INTERNAL USERS AND EXTERNAL ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM)

CUSTOMERS EXCEEDED THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUPPLY THESE COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY

IMPROVED ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE THIS CHALLENGE TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR THROUGH

SHORT-TERM AND STRATEGIC ACTIONS.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY

PURCHASES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THESE

FACTORS HISTORICALLY HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN

THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER.

THE VALUE OF UNFILLED ORDERS IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATOR OF FUTURE

REVENUES FROM THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION

OF REVENUE FROM SERVICES, THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTS

2

DELIVERED FROM SHELF INVENTORIES, AND THE SHORTENING OF PRODUCT DELIVERY

SCHEDULES. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL SERVICES SEGMENT, IN 2000 THE

COMPANY SIGNED CONTRACTS TOTALING $55 BILLION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A SERVICES

BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 OF $85 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $60 BILLION AT THE

END OF 1999.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES FACE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS,

RANGING FROM FORTUNE 50 COMPANIES TO AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL,

RAPIDLY GROWING AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

ITS COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY, PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY, PRICE AND THE

BREADTH OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICE OFFERINGS ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, RESULTING IN REDUCED PROFIT MARGINS AND/OR LOSS

OF MARKET OPPORTUNITY. UNLIKE MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS, THE COMPANY HAS A

PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES AND MUST ALLOCATE RESOURCES ACROSS THESE BUSINESSES

WHILE COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE PRODUCT

LINES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY NOT FUND OR INVEST IN CERTAIN OF ITS

BUSINESSES TO THE SAME DEGREE THAT ITS COMPETITORS DO AND THESE COMPETITORS MAY

HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM THAN

THE COMPANY BUSINESSES AGAINST WHICH THEY COMPETE.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVES MORE

THAN HALF OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE

LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING

RECESSIONS AND INFLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, WEAKNESS IN THE ASIAN AND LATIN AMERICAN

ECONOMIES HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN 1998.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN IBM'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO

STOCKHOLDERS AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND REVENUE BY CLASSES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES--PAGES 89 THROUGH 93.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS--PAGE 93.

AMOUNT SPENT DURING EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES--PAGE 82.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES--PAGE 78.

THE NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED BY THE REGISTRANT--PAGE 63.

THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION OVERVIEW--PAGE 52.

FORWARD-LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS: CERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN

THIS ANNUAL REPORT MAY CONSTITUTE "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE

MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 ("REFORM ACT").

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN MATERIALS DELIVERED TO STOCKHOLDERS

AND IN PRESS RELEASES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S REPRESENTATIVES MAY FROM TIME

TO TIME MAKE ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS PROVIDE

CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND INCLUDE

ANY STATEMENT THAT DOES NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO ANY HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACT.

WORDS SUCH AS "ANTICIPATES," "BELIEVES," "EXPECTS," "ESTIMATES," "INTENDS,"

"PLANS," "PROJECTS," AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, MAY IDENTIFY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR REVISE ANY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REFORM ACT, SET FORTH BELOW

ARE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY THOSE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

READERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AS THEY IDENTIFY

CERTAIN IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL TRENDS. THE

FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN ADDITION TO OTHER

FACTORS DISCUSSED

3

ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, IN THE COMPANY'S FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR IN MATERIALS INCORPORATED THEREIN BY REFERENCE.

NEW PRODUCTS AND THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE: THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF NEW

AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS BY THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS

BUSINESSES AND THE SUCCESS OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEPENDS ON THEIR

ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES

ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND CORRESPONDING SHIFTS IN

CUSTOMER DEMAND, RESULTING IN UNPREDICTABLE PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND SHORTENED

LIFE CYCLES AND INCREASING EMPHASIS ON BEING FIRST TO MARKET WITH NEW PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THAT THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL BE ACCEPTED BY

CUSTOMERS, OR THAT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES WILL RECOUP OR REALIZE A RETURN ON

THEIR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME THE COMPANY MAY

EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION OR MARKETING OF

NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICES: THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS AFFECTED BY A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN RESULTS, THE COMPETITIVE

LANDSCAPE, GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS

BY THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT, LIKE OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, THE

COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY.

DEPENDENCE ON AND COMPENSATION OF KEY PERSONNEL: MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS

OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED

PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED

PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND

COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RETAIN AND ATTRACT THE KEY PERSONNEL IT

NEEDS. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE

THAT INCLUDES STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY

IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S

EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE

COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS: THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT

PERCENTAGE OF ITS NON-U.S. REVENUES FROM ITS AFFILIATES OPERATING IN LOCAL

CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS AND ITS RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE

VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE

COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF

CREDIT RISK AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES AND THE DETERMINATION OF

RESIDUAL VALUES. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE

RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. DERIVATIVES

INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE THESE RISKS WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL.

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS: THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND THROUGH

A VARIETY OF THIRD- PARTY BUSINESS PARTNERS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND

RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS

AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO

BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES: THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO

MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES FROM TIME TO TIME. ACQUISITIONS AND

ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION

OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE

COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, IBM'S MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN THE

UNITED STATES HAD AGGREGATE FLOOR SPACE OF 40.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH

31.5 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 8.8 MILLION WAS LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS,

1.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 2.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED

TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES. SIMILAR FACILITIES IN 15 OTHER COUNTRIES TOTALED

15.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 10.9 MILLION WAS OWNED AND 4.1 MILLION WAS

LEASED. OF THESE AMOUNTS, 0.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET WAS VACANT AND 0.6 MILLION

SQUARE FEET WAS BEING LEASED TO NON-IBM BUSINESSES.

ALTHOUGH IMPROVED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND

INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING FLOOR

SPACE, CONTINUOUS UPGRADING OF FACILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL

LEADERSHIP, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY, AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON EXPENDITURES FOR PLANT, RENTAL MACHINES AND OTHER PROPERTY, REFER

TO "INVESTMENTS" ON PAGE 60 OF IBM'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS WHICH IS
