ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

DOWNTURN IN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE IT SPENDING BUDGETS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

IF OVERALL DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS,

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES DECREASES, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR A SHIFT IN CORPORATE BUYING PATTERNS, THE COMPANY'S REVENUE AND PROFIT COULD BE IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES UNDER ITS INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

INITIATIVES.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, IBM SEEKS TO DRIVE GREATER PRODUCTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY AND COST SAVINGS BY TRANSFORMING AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATING ITS OWN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND

FUNCTIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND TO ENABLE SCALING OF RESOURCES AND OFFERINGS IN BOTH EMERGING AND MORE ESTABLISHED MARKETS. THESE VARIOUS INITIATIVES MAY NOT YIELD THEIR INTENDED GAINS IN QUALITY,

PRODUCTIVITY AND ENABLEMENT OF RAPID SCALING, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVENESS AND ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OBJECTIVES.

FAILURE OF INNOVATION INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY.

IBM HAS BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM CERTAIN

SEGMENTS OF THE IT INDUSTRY AND INTO AREAS IN WHICH IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF

11

THROUGH

INNOVATION AND BY LEVERAGING ITS INVESTMENTS IN R&D. IF IBM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS CUTTING-EDGE INNOVATION IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL IN ITS

ONGOING EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ITS MARKET SHARE AND ITS PROFIT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, IBM

HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST BRAND NAMES IN THE WORLD, AND ITS BRAND AND OVERALL REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR

ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S BRAND IMAGE IS TARNISHED BY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS COULD BE IMPACTED.

RISKS FROM INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING HIGHER-VALUE SEGMENTS OF ENTERPRISE COMPUTING AND DOZENS OF EMERGING COUNTRIES TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. CLIENT ADOPTION RATES AND VIABLE ECONOMIC MODELS

ARE UNCERTAIN IN THE HIGH-VALUE AND RAPIDLY-GROWING SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS TO CAPTURE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, IT NEEDS TO RAPIDLY SECURE THE APPROPRIATE MIX

OF TRAINED, SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL. IN EMERGING GROWTH COUNTRIES, THE DEVELOPING NATURE PRESENTS POTENTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS FROM INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE,

CREDITWORTHINESS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, LABOR DISRUPTION AND CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND TO DELIVER TO ITS CLIENTS AROUND THE

WORLD.

IBM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS, AND IBM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES.

THE

COMPANY'S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SIMILAR TO OR DUPLICATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S, NOR CAN THERE BE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE RESOURCES INVESTED BY THE COMPANY TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WILL ADEQUATELY DETER

MISAPPROPRIATION OR IMPROPER USE OF THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY BE THE TARGET OF AGGRESSIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC ENFORCEMENT OF PATENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

NON-PRACTICING ENTITIES. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT IBM WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES THE LICENSES IT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE.

CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS MAY AFFECT

CRITICAL THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS OR INVOLVE THE STORAGE, PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEES,

CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS. BREACHES OF SECURITY COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANY, ITS CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS TO RISKS OF LOSS, INCLUDING THE MISUSE OF INFORMATION OR SYSTEMS, RESULTING IN LITIGATION AND POTENTIAL

LIABILITY FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY'S BRAND AND REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, THE COST AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPLEMENTING

FURTHER DATA PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. ALSO, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY EXISTING AND PROPOSED LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

IBM'S REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE LENGTH OF THE SALES CYCLES AND THE SEASONALITY OF TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES CONTRACTS AND THE NATURE OF ITS CUSTOMERS' BUSINESSES; FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

REVIEW BY REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS HAD

LOWER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH VOLUME OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ORDERED AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, ESPECIALLY AT THE

END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER, MAY AFFECT IBM'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY SHIP ALL ORDERS BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER.

12

DUE TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PRESENCE, ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOCAL LEGAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND HEALTH

CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED ENTITY, OPERATING IN OVER 170 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVING MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OR INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS OR POLICIES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY'S

OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND BY MACROECONOMIC CHANGES, INCLUDING RECESSIONS,

INFLATION AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND NON-U.S. CURRENCIES. FURTHER, AS THE COMPANY EXPANDS ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE SCOPE OF ITS OFFERINGS, BOTH WITHIN THE U.S.

AND GLOBALLY, IT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR OTHER RISKS. IN ADDITION, ANY WIDESPREAD OUTBREAK OF AN ILLNESS, PANDEMIC OR OTHER LOCAL OR GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUE, OR ANY TERRORIST

ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO SOURCE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE U.S. SUPERFUND LAW. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF IT WERE TO VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IBM'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

INCOME BEFORE TAXES BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE

COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES

FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND CASH TAX LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION

PLANS.

ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION TRUST ASSETS AND ITS FUTURE

ESTIMATED PENSION LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN A PERIOD OF AN EXTENDED FINANCIAL MARKET DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY

COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INCREMENTAL PENSION PLAN FUNDING WITH RESULTING LIQUIDITY RISK WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FURTHER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PREMIUMS FOR MANDATORY PENSION INSOLVENCY INSURANCE COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE U.S. PREMIUM INCREASES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE LEVEL OF

INSOLVENCIES OF UNRELATED COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY AT ISSUE. CURRENTLY, CANADA, GERMANY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE UNITED KINGDOM REQUIRE THAT THESE PREMIUMS BE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND NOT OUT OF

PLAN ASSETS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. IBM'S 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PENSION FUNDING AND THE USE OF CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING PENSION MATTERS.

13

INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR, THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF CONTROLS, OR FRAUD. EVEN EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN THE ADEQUACY OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROLS, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REQUIRED NEW OR IMPROVED CONTROLS, OR IF THE COMPANY EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE HARMED AND THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN ITEMS AND FUTURE EVENTS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY'S MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION IN IBM'S 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES." IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE M,

"CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS," IN IBM'S 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN ESTIMATES INCLUDING DECISIONS RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RESERVES. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE THE USE OF JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON SKILLED PERSONNEL AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF CRITICAL SKILLS.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY

DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE, AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF RESOURCES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE

IN HIGH DEMAND, AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND LABOR WORK FORCE TRENDS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AS EXPERIENCED

WORKERS LEAVE THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, AS GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INDUSTRY DEMAND SHIFTS, REALIGNMENT, TRAINING AND SCALING OF SKILLED RESOURCES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY RAPID. FURTHER, MANY OF IBM'S

KEY PERSONNEL RECEIVE A TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES EQUITY AWARDS. NEW REGULATIONS, VOLATILITY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE COMPANY'S USE, AND THE VALUE, OF

THE COMPANY'S EQUITY AWARDS, PUTTING THE COMPANY AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR FORCING THE COMPANY TO USE MORE CASH COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CRITICAL SUPPLIERS.

IBM'S BUSINESS EMPLOYS A WIDE VARIETY OF

COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES RELY ON SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. CHANGES

IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE SUPPLIERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. FURTHER, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO

DELIVER COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS, SUPPLIES

OR MATERIALS, OR INADEQUATE SERVICES, RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS COULD REDUCE THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HARM THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY ITS BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., INCLUDING THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FUNDING APPROVAL.

ALSO, SOME AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE AND PROVIDING FOR HIGHER LIABILITY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COULD BE SUSPENDED

OR DEBARRED AS A GOVERNMENTAL CONTRACTOR AND COULD INCUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT ITS REVENUE AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A

SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUES AND COSTS FROM ITS AFFILIATES

14

OPERATING

IN LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS, AND THOSE RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF NON-U.S. CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR. FURTHER, INHERENT IN THE COMPANY'S

CUSTOMER FINANCING BUSINESS ARE RISKS RELATED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT, CLIENT CREDITWORTHINESS, INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT AND LIABILITIES, THE DETERMINATION

OF RESIDUAL VALUES AND THE FINANCING OF OTHER THAN TRADITIONAL IT ASSETS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THESE RISKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS;

DERIVATIVES INVOLVE THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO MANAGE ITS CURRENCY AND CUSTOMER FINANCING RISKS

WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS AND BY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ON

RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTOR DYNAMICS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS ITS

ACCESS TO FUNDING, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IBM'S 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S CLIENT BASE INCLUDES MANY WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES, FROM SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE

COMING FROM GLOBAL CLIENTS ACROSS MANY SECTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, AND THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS' FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF

THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR, IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD IMPACT ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS. CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS CONDITION OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO LOSSES AND AFFECT ITS

ABILITY TO BRING ITS PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS THE COMPANY MOVES INTO NEW AREAS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE

UNABLE TO RECRUIT AND ENABLE APPROPRIATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH OBJECTIVES.

RISKS TO THE COMPANY FROM ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INCLUDE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES, AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

ACQUISITIONS OR ENTER INTO ALLIANCES. ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS RELATING TO THE

INTEGRATION OF THE BUSINESS INTO THE COMPANY, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL MANAGE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES SUCCESSFULLY. THE RELATED RISKS INCLUDE THE COMPANY FAILING TO

ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND ANTICIPATED REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS, AS WELL AS THE FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO

LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO IBM SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES IN THE WORLDWIDE CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME

TO TIME, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FLUCTUATES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR CALCULATING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITIES, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SECURITIES OUTSTANDING, THE REDEMPTION FEATURES FOR THE SECURITIES, THE LEVEL, DIRECTION AND VOLATILITY OF

INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, GOVERNMENTAL AND STOCK EXCHANGE REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PAY INTEREST AND REPAY THE PRINCIPAL FOR ITS DEBT SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED

"RISK FACTORS." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ANY OF THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY.

15

THE

COMPANY ALSO ISSUES ITS COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS COMPENSATION PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN AND CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, DUE TO OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THIS ITEM 1A. ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS," AS WELL AS ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY,

TRADING VOLUMES, SPECULATION BY THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SINCE THE MARKET PRICE OF

IBM'S COMMON STOCK FLUCTUATES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES.

IN

ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE A MARKET IN EITHER ITS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO THE LIQUIDITY OR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES.
