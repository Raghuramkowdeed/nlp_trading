TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN AUGUST 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)

GRANTED A NEW INDICATION FOR

HYZAAR

FOR INITIAL USE IN APPROPRIATE PATIENTS WITH SEVERE

HYPERTENSION.

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE INDICATIONS FOR

CANCIDAS

WERE EXPANDED WITH FDA APPROVAL FOR EMPIRICAL

THERAPY FOR PRESUMED FUNGAL INFECTIONS IN FEBRILE NEUTROPENIC PATIENTS.

VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF VIOXX 

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MERCK ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY WORLDWIDE

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION. THE COMPANYS DECISION, WHICH WAS

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, WAS BASED ON NEW THREE-YEAR DATA FROM A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED,

PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL, APPROVE (ADENOMATOUS POLYP PREVENTION ON

VIOXX

).

THE TRIAL, WHICH WAS STOPPED, WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF

VIOXX

25 MG IN

PREVENTING THE RECURRENCE OF COLORECTAL POLYPS IN PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF COLORECTAL ADENOMAS

AND TO FURTHER ASSESS THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY OF

VIOXX

. IN THIS STUDY, THERE WAS AN INCREASED

RELATIVE RISK FOR CONFIRMED CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, SUCH AS HEART ATTACK AND STROKE, BEGINNING AFTER

18 MONTHS OF TREATMENT IN THE PATIENTS TAKING

VIOXX

COMPARED TO THOSE TAKING PLACEBO. THE RESULTS

FOR THE FIRST 18 MONTHS OF THE APPROVE STUDY DID NOT SHOW ANY INCREASED RISK OF CONFIRMED

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS ON

VIOXX

, AND IN THIS RESPECT, WERE SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS OF TWO

PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDIES DESCRIBED IN THE MOST RECENT U.S. LABELING FOR

VIOXX.

MERCK PRESENTED DATA FROM APPROVE AT THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY (ACR) ANNUAL

SCIENTIFIC MEETING IN SAN ANTONIO ON OCTOBER 18, 2004. THE COMPANY HAD REQUESTED THE OPPORTUNITY

TO PRESENT THE DATA AT THE ACR MEETING.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE 105 MILLION U.S. PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN FOR

VIOXX

FROM

MAY 1999 THROUGH AUGUST 2004. BASED ON THIS ESTIMATE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE NUMBER OF

PATIENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN

VIOXX

IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE ITS 1999 LAUNCH IS APPROXIMATELY 20

MILLION. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHO HAVE TAKEN

VIOXX

IS UNDETERMINED AT

THIS TIME.

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE

SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, REQUESTING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATED TO

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY ALSO RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM OTHER CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO COOPERATE WITH THESE INQUIRIES SO THAT THE COMPANY CAN CONTINUE TO DESCRIBE THE REASONS

FOR THE COMPANYS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS DEVELOPMENT AND EXTENSIVE TESTING OF THE MEDICINE AND ITS DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF

ITS STUDIES.

ALSO, IN OCTOBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A GROUP OF FIVE STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL RAISING CONCERNS THAT THE COMPANYS RETURN AND REFUND PROGRAM FOR UNUSED

VIOXX

WILL NOT

PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH ADEQUATE NOTICE AND WILL BE UNDULY BURDENSOME. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL TO RESPOND TO THEIR CONCERNS.

ON FEBRUARY 16-18, 2005, THE FDA HELD A JOINT MEETING OF THE ARTHRITIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND

THE DRUG SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEES DISCUSSED THE OVERALL

BENEFIT TO RISK CONSIDERATIONS (INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL SAFETY CONCERNS) FOR

COX-2 SELECTIVE NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND RELATED AGENTS. ON FEBRUARY 18, 2005, THE

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES WERE ASKED TO VOTE ON WHETHER THE OVERALL RISK VERSUS BENEFIT PROFILE FOR

VIOXX

SUPPORTS MARKETING IN THE UNITED STATES. THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES VOTED 17 TO 15 IN

SUPPORT OF THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX

IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY LOOKS FORWARD TO DISCUSSIONS

WITH THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ABOUT

VIOXX.

AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPOINTED A SPECIAL COMMITTEE

TO REVIEW THE COMPANYS ACTIONS PRIOR TO ITS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX,

TO ACT FOR THE BOARD IN

RESPONDING TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION MATTERS RELATED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

AND TO ADVISE THE

BOARD WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW.

ARCOXIA

-

ARCOXIA

HAS BEEN LAUNCHED IN 51 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA AND ASIA. ON

OCTOBER 29, 2004, THE COMPANY CONFIRMED THAT IT HAD RECEIVED AN APPROVABLE LETTER FROM THE FDA

FOR THE COMPANYS NEW DRUG APPLICATION (NDA) FOR

ARCOXIA

. THE FDA INFORMED MERCK IN THE LETTER

THAT BEFORE APPROVAL OF THE NDA CAN BE ISSUED, ADDITIONAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA FOR

ARCOXIA

ARE

REQUIRED. ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES EVALUATION AGENCY (EMEA) ANNOUNCED THAT IT

WOULD CONDUCT A REVIEW OF ALL COX-2 INHIBITORS, INCLUDING

ARCOXIA

, IN LIGHT OF THE WORLDWIDE

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

. THE EMEA SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN ASKED TO CONDUCT THE REVIEW BY THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND THAT IT WOULD LOOK AT ALL ASPECTS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR

SAFETY OF COX-2 INHIBITORS, INCLUDING THROMBOTIC AND CARDIO-RENAL EVENTS. ON JANUARY 18, 2005, THE

EMEAS COMMITTEE ON MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (CHMP) HELD HEARINGS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

REVIEW. ADDITIONAL MEETINGS WERE HELD BY THE CHMP IN MID-FEBRUARY TO CONTINUE ITS REVIEW TO

DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A NEED TO MAKE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)-WIDE CHANGES TO THE PRODUCTS

MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS, INCLUDING LABELING, AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER ADDITIONAL STUDIES ARE

NEEDED. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2005, CHMP ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD CONCLUDED THAT THE AVAILABLE DATA SHOW AN

INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR ADVERSE EVENTS FOR COX-2 INHIBITORS AS A CLASS RELATIVE TO PLACEBO

AND SOME NSAIDS. ACCORDING TO CHMP, THE DATA ALSO SUGGESTED AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DURATION OF USE

AND DOSE AND THE PROBABILITY OF SUFFERING A CARDIOVASCULAR EVENT AND THEREFORE RECOMMENDED USE OF

THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF COX-2 INHIBITORS FOR THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE DURATION OF TREATMENT.

FURTHER, CHMP INTRODUCED A CONTRA-INDICATION FOR ALL COX-2 INHIBITORS IN PATIENTS WITH ISCHEMIC

HEART DISEASE OR STROKE, AND EXPANDED THE CONTRA-INDICATION FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS HAVING HIGHER

CLASSES OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO

ARCOXIA,

CHMP ALSO INTRODUCED A

CONTRA-INDICATION IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION WHOSE BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOT UNDER CONTROL, AND

ADVISED THAT

ARCOXIA

MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE,

PARTICULARLY AT HIGHER DOSES, THAN SOME OTHER COX-2 INHIBITORS, AND RECOMMENDED MONITORING OF BLOOD

PRESSURE FOR ALL PATIENTS TAKING

ARCOXIA.

CHMP STATED THAT THESE ARE INTERIM MEASURES PENDING THE

FINALIZATION OF THE CLASS REVIEW WHICH IS EXPECTED IN APRIL 2005. FINALLY, CHMP CONCLUDED THAT

MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED IN THE FIELD TO EVALUATE THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY OF COX-2 INHIBITORS, AND

THAT ONGOING CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS SHOULD CONTINUE AS PLANNED.

MERCK IS WORKING WITH OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE

ARCOXIA

IS APPROVED TO

ASSESS WHETHER CHANGES TO THE PRESCRIBING INFORMATION FOR THE COXIB CLASS OF DRUGS, INCLUDING

ARCOXIA,

ARE WARRANTED.

ACQUISITIONS

3⁄4

IN MARCH 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ATON PHARMA, INC. (ATON), A

PRIVATELY HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR CANCER AND

OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES. ATONS CLINICAL PIPELINE OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS REPRESENTS A

CLASS OF ANTI-TUMOR AGENTS WITH POTENTIAL FOR EFFICACY BASED ON A NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION. THE

LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE, SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC ACID (SAHA), IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE II CLINICAL

TRIALS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, MSD (JAPAN) CO., LTD., COMPLETED

TENDER OFFERS TO ACQUIRE THE REMAINING 49% OF THE COMMON SHARES OF BANYU PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

(BANYU) THAT IT DID NOT ALREADY OWN FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5

BILLION. ON MARCH 30, 2004, MERCK COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF BANYU. FULL OWNERSHIP OF BANYU

ENHANCES MERCKS POSITION IN JAPAN, THE WORLDS SECOND-LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET.

JOINT VENTURES

3⁄4

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO

DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT

AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. IN DECEMBER 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN OCTOBER

2002,

ZETIA (

EZETIMIBE) (BRANDED

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

EZETROL

HAS BEEN LAUNCHED IN MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN JULY 2004,

VYTORIN

(EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN) (MARKETED AS

INEGY

IN MANY COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), A

COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR,

WAS APPROVED IN THE

UNITED STATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES,

VYTORIN

HAD BEEN

APPROVED IN 15 COUNTRIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH ANNOUNCED A NEW CLINICAL TRIAL FOR

VYTORIN,

IMPROVE IT (IMPROVED REDUCTION OF OUTCOMES.

VYTORIN

EFFICACY INTERNATIONAL TRIAL). THIS TRIAL

WILL EVALUATE

VYTORIN

IN REDUCING MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS THROUGH INTENSIVE LIPID LOWERING OF

LDL CHOLESTEROL IN 10,000 PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME. IMPROVE IT IS THE FOURTH

LARGE-SCALE OUTCOMES TRIAL BEING CONDUCTED ON

VYTORIN.

IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB (ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET

ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN EQUALLY OWNED JOINT

VENTURE THAT DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC

, THE FIRST OF A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH

SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA RESTRUCTURED THE JOINT VENTURE WHEREBY THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

ASTRAS INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED KBIS OPERATING

ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE PARTNERSHIP), IN

WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP,

BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY EARNS

CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP RETURNS AS WELL AS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE KBI

PRODUCTS. THE PARTNERSHIP RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP

AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS,

AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED PARTNERSHIP GAAP

EARNINGS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, FOR A PAYMENT OF $443.0 MILLION, ASTRA

PURCHASED AN OPTION TO BUY THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE COMPANYS

INTEREST IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

. THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTED ASTRA AN

OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION) TO BUY THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI, AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

IN APRIL 1999, ASTRA MERGED WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC, FORMING ASTRAZENECA AB (ASTRAZENECA). AS

A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPANYS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA

PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4

MILLION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A TRUE-UP CALCULATION IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE MERGER ALSO TRIGGERS A PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF THE COMPANYS LIMITED

PARTNER INTEREST IN 2008. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, ASTRAZENECAS OPTION TO BUY THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS IS EXERCISABLE IN 2010 AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO

REQUIRE ASTRAZENECA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008. IN ADDITION, THE SHARES OPTION IS

EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS PURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS.

IN 1989, THE COMPANY FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO DEVELOP, MARKET AND

MANUFACTURE CONSUMER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS 50% OWNED JOINT VENTURE WAS

EXPANDED INTO EUROPE IN 1993, AND INTO CANADA IN 1996. SIGNIFICANT JOINT VENTURE PRODUCTS ARE

PEPCID AC

(FAMOTIDINE), AN OVER-THE-COUNTER FORM OF THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION

PEPCID

(FAMOTIDINE), AS WELL AS

PEPCID COMPLETE,

AN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT WHICH COMBINES THE COMPANYS

ULCER MEDICATION WITH ANTACIDS (CALCIUM CARBONATE AND MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE). IN MARCH 2004, THE

COMPANY SOLD TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON ITS INTEREST IN THE EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE WHICH IS DISCUSSED

FURTHER ON PAGE 9 UNDER

DIVESTITURES.

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1992, THE COMPANY, THROUGH THE MERCK VACCINE DIVISION, AND CONNAUGHT

LABORATORIES, INC. (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.), AGREED TO COLLABORATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND

MARKETING OF COMBINATION PEDIATRIC VACCINES AND TO PROMOTE SELECTED VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE RESEARCH AND MARKETING COLLABORATION ENABLES THE COMPANIES TO POOL THEIR RESOURCES TO EXPEDITE

THE DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES COMBINING SEVERAL DIFFERENT ANTIGENS TO PROTECT CHILDREN AGAINST A

VARIETY OF DISEASES, INCLUDING

HAEMOPHILUS

INFLUENZAE

TYPE B, HEPATITIS B,

DIPHTHERIA, TETANUS, PERTUSSIS AND POLIOMYELITIS. WHILE COMBINATION VACCINE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

CONTINUE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NO VACCINES ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROMOTED.

IN 1994, THE COMPANY, THROUGH THE MERCK VACCINE DIVISION, AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW

SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.) FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET HUMAN VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE THEN EXISTING EU AND THE

EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANY AND SANOFI PASTEUR CONTRIBUTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEIR EUROPEAN VACCINE BUSINESSES FOR

EQUAL SHARES IN THE JOINT VENTURE, KNOWN AS PASTEUR MÉRIEUX MSD, S.N.C. (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR MSD,

S.N.C.). THE JOINT VENTURE IS SUBJECT TO MONITORING BY THE EU, TO WHICH THE PARTNERS MADE CERTAIN

UNDERTAKINGS IN RETURN FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW, EFFECTIVE UNTIL DECEMBER

2006. THE JOINT VENTURE MAINTAINS A PRESENCE, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH AFFILIATES OR BRANCHES IN

BELGIUM, ITALY, GERMANY, SPAIN, FRANCE, AUSTRIA, IRELAND, SWEDEN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND

THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS IN THE REST OF ITS TERRITORY.

IN 1997, THE COMPANY AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW SANOFI-AVENTIS S.A.) COMBINED THEIR

RESPECTIVE ANIMAL HEALTH AND POULTRY GENETICS BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A FULLY

INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH

PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE THE

HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL SPECIES.

COMPETITION

3⁄4

THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED

ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST

CONTAINMENT CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

SUCH COMPETITION INVOLVES AN INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO

MARKET THESE INNOVATIONS EFFECTIVELY. WITH ITS LONG-STANDING EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

THE COMPANY IS WELL PREPARED TO COMPETE IN THE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES TO MEET COMPETITION INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL, FLEXIBILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS,

AN EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND A STRONG TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVE

IN ACQUIRING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND LICENSES AND HAS BEEN REFINING ITS

SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS TO FURTHER ADDRESS CHANGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS. TO ENHANCE ITS

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE EXTERNAL ALLIANCES, FROM EARLY-STAGE TO

LATE-STAGE PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES AND TARGETED ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES BY COMPETITORS MAY RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS AND

PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS, EVEN FOR PRODUCTS PROTECTED BY PATENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS

AVAILABLE TO TREAT DISEASES TYPICALLY INCREASES OVER TIME AND HAS RESULTED IN SLOWING THE GROWTH IN

SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HUMAN

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, ALLOWS, ENCOURAGES OR, IN A FEW INSTANCES, IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC

INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN, MANDATES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS (THOSE

CONTAINING THE SAME ACTIVE CHEMICAL AS AN INNOVATORS PRODUCT) RATHER THAN BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS.

GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER PRESSURES TOWARD THE DISPENSING OF GENERIC PRODUCTS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCED THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY PATENTS, SUCH AS

VASOTEC

AND

VASERETIC

(ENALAPRIL MALEATE IN COMBINATION WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)

,

THE U.S. RIGHTS

TO WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD. IN ADDITION,

ZOCOR

HAS LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES IN THOSE

COUNTRIES.

DISTRIBUTION

3⁄4

THE COMPANY SELLS ITS HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS

AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS

HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. VACCINES ARE ALSO SOLD DIRECTLY TO

PHYSICIANS. THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES

AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FOR U.S.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND INVESTIGATION

3⁄4

THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO

GLOBAL REGULATION BY REGIONAL, COUNTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE

FDA IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY,

EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY

CASES, THE FDA REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW

PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 1997, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

MODERNIZATION ACT (THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT) WAS PASSED AND WAS THE CULMINATION OF A

COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE REFORM EFFORT DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE REGULATORY PROCEDURES WITHIN THE FDA

AND TO IMPROVE THE REGULATION OF DRUGS, MEDICAL DEVICES AND FOOD. THE LEGISLATION WAS PRINCIPALLY

DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE TIMELY AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS BY EXPEDITING

THE PREMARKET REVIEW PROCESS FOR NEW PRODUCTS. A KEY PROVISION OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE

RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT OF 1992, WHICH PERMITS THE CONTINUED

COLLECTION OF USER FEES FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO AUGMENT FDA RESOURCES EARMARKED FOR

THE REVIEW OF HUMAN DRUG APPLICATIONS. THIS HELPS PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE

PROMPT APPROVAL OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NEW DRUGS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN EXPANDING HEALTH CARE ACCESS

BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS

SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER 2003. THIS STATUTE ADDED A VOLUNTARY DRUG DISCOUNT CARD FOR MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES IN JUNE 2004 AND WILL ADD PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BENEFIT WILL SUPPORT THE COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICINES

BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE PRESERVING MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

INNOVATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BENEFIT IS DESIGNED TO ASSURE THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WILL

BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND BY ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES. THE

COMPANY HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDICARE-ENDORSED

DISCOUNT CARDS BY PROVIDING ITS MEDICINES FREE FOR LOW-INCOME MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO EXHAUST

THEIR $600 TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE ALLOWANCE IN MEDICARE-ENDORSED DRUG DISCOUNT CARDS. THIS ACTION

IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS LONG-STANDING PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FREE

MEDICINES TO PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO LACK DRUG COVERAGE AND CANNOT AFFORD THEIR

MEDICINES. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY WILL BE NEGOTIATING WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS UNDER THE NEW

MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT TO OFFER MERCK PRODUCTS TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2006

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE NEW BENEFIT.

IN ADDRESSING COST CONTAINMENT OUTSIDE OF MEDICARE, THE COMPANY HAS MADE A CONTINUING EFFORT

TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP SAVE COSTS IN OVERALL PATIENT HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION,

PRICING FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE COMPANYS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO HAS ENCOURAGED GROWING USE OF ITS

MEDICINES AND MITIGATED THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

FOR MANY YEARS, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE OVERSIGHT WITH

THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR NEW DRUGS, DRUG SAFETY, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, DRUG PURCHASING AND

REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND FORMULARIES VARIOUSLY UNDER REVIEW. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL

CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW DRUGS TO THE

MARKET, IN THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. ONE TYPE OF FEDERAL INITIATIVE TO CONTAIN FEDERAL HEALTH

CARE SPENDING IS THE PROSPECTIVE OR CAPITATED PAYMENT SYSTEM, FIRST IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE THE

RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS. SUCH A SYSTEM ESTABLISHES IN ADVANCE A FLAT

RATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE PATIENTS FOR WHOM

THE PAYOR IS FISCALLY

RESPONSIBLE. THIS TYPE OF PAYMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER COST CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS ARE NOW WIDELY USED BY

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYORS AND HAVE CAUSED HOSPITALS, HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER

CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY TO BE MORE COST-CONSCIOUS IN THEIR TREATMENT DECISIONS, INCLUDING

DECISIONS REGARDING THE MEDICINES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR PATIENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO

WORK WITH PRIVATE AND FEDERAL EMPLOYERS TO SLOW INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. FURTHER, THE

COMPANYS EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP SAVE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS, AND PRICING

FLEXIBILITY ACROSS ITS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, HAVE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF THE COMPANYS MEDICINES AND

HAVE HELPED OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

ALSO, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED METHODS TO DIRECTLY REDUCE THE COST OF DRUGS

AND VACCINES FOR WHICH THEY PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PAY SPECIFIED

REBATES FOR MEDICINES REIMBURSED BY MEDICAID, TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR OUTPATIENT MEDICINES

PURCHASED BY CERTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ENTITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS

(HOSPITALS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA), AND TO PROVIDE MINIMUM

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCOUNTS OF 24% OFF OF A DEFINED NON-FEDERAL AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR PURCHASES BY CERTAIN

COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT

OF DEFENSE.

INITIATIVES IN SOME STATES SEEK REBATES BEYOND THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY MEDICAID LEGISLATION,

IN SOME CASES FOR PATIENTS BEYOND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. UNDER THE FEDERAL VACCINES

FOR CHILDREN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM, THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) FUNDS

AND PURCHASES RECOMMENDED PEDIATRIC VACCINES AT A PUBLIC SECTOR PRICE FOR THE IMMUNIZATION OF

MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE, UNINSURED, NATIVE AMERICAN AND CERTAIN UNDERINSURED CHILDREN. THE COMPANY WAS

AWARDED A CDC CONTRACT IN 2004 FOR THE SUPPLY OF $322 MILLION OF PEDIATRIC VACCINES FOR THE

VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID

WHO ARE ALSO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES (65 YEARS AND OLDER OR DISABLED) WILL LEAVE THE

STATE-ADMINISTERED MEDICAID SYSTEM TO BE COVERED BY THE NEW MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ENCOUNTERS SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN

MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT DOES BUSINESS. THERE, TOO, THE PRIMARY THRUST OF GOVERNMENTAL

INQUIRY AND ACTION IS TOWARD DETERMINING DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS, OFTEN WITH MECHANISMS FOR

CONTROLLING THE PRICES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE PROFITS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES. THE

EU HAS ADOPTED DIRECTIVES CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION, LABELING, ADVERTISING, WHOLESALE

DISTRIBUTION AND APPROVAL FOR MARKETING OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE. THE COMPANYS

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE ALREADY CONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE DIRECTIVES;

CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND IS, THEREFORE,

SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS AND

OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY ON ITS OWN MAY DEEM

IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, RECOGNIZING THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE

RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY, ARE

WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON PROPOSALS TO COMPLETE THE

SINGLE MARKET IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS

INCLUDING MARKET DEREGULATION.

THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU, GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES REGARDING PRIVACY, INCLUDING FEDERAL PRIVACY REGULATIONS AND

RECENTLY ENACTED STATE PRIVACY LAWS CONCERNING HEALTH AND OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, WHICH HAVE

AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

3⁄4

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO

BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS. PATENTS MAY COVER PRODUCTS

PER SE

, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS,

PROCESSES FOR OR INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE USES OF PRODUCTS.

PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTENDS FOR VARYING PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DATE OF GRANT

AND THE LEGAL LIFE OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE PROTECTION AFFORDED, WHICH MAY ALSO

VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT AND ITS SCOPE OF COVERAGE.

PATENT PORTFOLIOS DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY. BASIC PATENTS ARE IN EFFECT FOR THE FOLLOWING MAJOR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2003,

ZOCOR

LOST ITS BASIC PATENT PROTECTION IN CANADA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE,

INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY, AND THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT INCLUDES A PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE AN

ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INDICATIONS OF NEW OR

CURRENTLY MARKETED DRUGS IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON PEDIATRIC STUDIES ARE COMPLETED BY THE APPLICANT.

THESE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS WERE RE-AUTHORIZED UNTIL OCTOBER 1, 2007 BY THE BEST PHARMACEUTICALS

FOR CHILDREN ACT PASSED IN JANUARY 2002. IN 2004, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

TRUSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008. IN 2003, THE FDA GRANTED AN

ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

FOSAMAX

UNTIL FEBRUARY 2008,

AND

FOSAMAX

ONCE WEEKLY UNTIL JANUARY 2019. HOWEVER, ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND THE COMPANY

EXPECTS A DECLINE IN U.S.

FOSAMAX

SALES AT THAT TIME. PRIOR TO THE DECISION, MERCKS PATENT FOR

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

WAS SET TO EXPIRE IN JULY 2018. MERCK DISAGREES WITH THE

DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS AND HAS REQUESTED RECONSIDERATION BY THE COURT OF APPEALS. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS, SEE

PATENT LITIGATION ON PAGE 22.

WHILE THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT NORMALLY RESULTS IN A LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

THE COVERED PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, COMMERCIAL BENEFITS MAY CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED FROM: (I)

LATER-GRANTED PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES RELATED TO THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF

MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF SUCH PRODUCT; (II) PATENTS RELATING TO THE USE OF SUCH

PRODUCT; (III) PATENTS RELATING TO NOVEL COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS; AND (IV) IN THE UNITED

STATES, MARKET EXCLUSIVITY THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW. THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT

EXPIRATION ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON MANY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE NATURE OF

THE MARKET AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT, THE GROWTH OF THE MARKET, THE COMPLEXITIES AND

ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF THE PRODUCT AND THE

REQUIREMENTS OF NEW DRUG PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT OR SIMILAR LAWS AND

REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

ADDITIONS TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH

ALL RELEVANT LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS INCREASING PATENT LIFE. SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INCREASES IN

PATENT LIFE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GENERAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF, INCENTIVES FOR AND

USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS ARE SOUGHT IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH REFORM OF PATENT AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

WORLDWIDE, ALL OF THE COMPANYS IMPORTANT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD UNDER TRADEMARKS THAT ARE

CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME

COUNTRIES AS LONG AS USED; IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS LONG AS REGISTERED. REGISTRATION IS FOR FIXED

TERMS AND CAN BE RENEWED INDEFINITELY.

ROYALTIES RECEIVED DURING 2004 ON PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES AND OTHER RIGHTS AMOUNTED TO

$113.9 MILLION. THE COMPANY ALSO PAID ROYALTIES AMOUNTING TO $734.1 MILLION IN 2004 UNDER PATENT

AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES IT HOLDS.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

ON AUGUST 19, 2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO

HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO HEALTH) AS A SEPARATE, PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANY. THE SPIN-OFF WAS

EFFECTED BY WAY OF A PRO RATA DIVIDEND TO COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK OF MEDCO HEALTH. BASED ON A LETTER RULING THE COMPANY RECEIVED FROM THE U.S. INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE, RECEIPT OF MEDCO HEALTH SHARES IN THE DISTRIBUTION WAS TAX-FREE FOR U.S. FEDERAL

INCOME TAX PURPOSES, BUT ANY CASH RECEIVED IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES WAS TAXABLE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW USES FOR

EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH A STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY 13,100 PEOPLE

ARE EMPLOYED IN THE COMPANYS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. EXPENDITURES FOR THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WERE $4.0 BILLION IN 2004, $3.2 BILLION IN 2003 AND $2.7 BILLION IN 2002 AND

ARE ESTIMATED TO CONTINUE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THE FULL-YEAR 2004 EXPENSE IN 2005. THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS ITS ONGOING COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH OVER A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS AND CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF NEW PRODUCTS. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PERIOD 1995 THROUGH 2004

EXCEEDED $23.1 BILLION WITH A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 13%.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN

BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. PROJECTS

RELATED TO HUMAN HEALTH ARE BEING CARRIED ON IN VARIOUS FIELDS SUCH AS BACTERIAL, FUNGAL, AND VIRAL

INFECTIONS, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CANCER, DEPRESSION, DIABETES, OBESITY,

NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, PAIN AND INFLAMMATION, IMMUNOLOGY, RESPIRATORY

DISEASES, OPHTHALMOLOGY, RESPIRATORY DISEASES, OSTEOPOROSIS AND MEN/WOMEN HEALTH PROGRAMS,

ENDOPARASITIC AND ECTOPARASITIC DISEASES, COMPANION ANIMAL DISEASES, AND PRODUCTION IMPROVEMENT.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS, INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES AND MOST FOREIGN COUNTRIES PROVIDE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVENESS AND

SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THROUGH PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CONTROLLED CLINICAL EVALUATION.

BEFORE A NEW DRUG MAY BE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES, RECORDED DATA ON PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL

EXPERIENCE ARE INCLUDED IN THE NDA OR THE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT LICENSE APPLICATION (PLA) TO THE FDA

FOR THE REQUIRED APPROVAL. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS COVERING SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A COMPOUND THAT IS THE RESULT OF ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM WILL OBTAIN THE

REGULATORY APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE MARKETED.

AS

STATED ABOVE, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. ONCE

THE COMPANYS SCIENTISTS DISCOVER A NEW COMPOUND THAT THEY BELIEVE HAS PROMISE TO TREAT A MEDICAL

CONDITION, THE COMPANY COMMENCES PRECLINICAL TESTING WITH THAT COMPOUND. PRECLINICAL TESTING

INCLUDES LABORATORY TESTING AND ANIMAL SAFETY STUDIES TO GATHER DATA ON CHEMISTRY, PHARMACOLOGY

AND TOXICOLOGY. COMPOUNDS THAT ARE SELECTED FOR STUDY IN HUMANS THEN MUST UNDERGO FURTHER TESTING

TO DETERMINE HOW THEY ARE METABOLIZED AND EXCRETED IN ANIMALS AND THEN PREPARED IN A STABLE DOSE

FORM THAT IS BIOAVAILABLE. THE PRECLINICAL TESTING PHASE TAKES ABOUT SIX YEARS ON AVERAGE. IF THE

COMPOUND CONTINUES TO SHOW PROMISE, THE COMPANY WILL INITIATE CLINICAL TESTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH

ESTABLISHED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE THREE PHASES OF CLINICAL

TESTING TAKE A TOTAL OF SIX YEARS ON AVERAGE

TO COMPLETE. THE CLINICAL TESTING BEGINS WITH PHASE I STUDIES WHICH ARE USED TO DETERMINE THAT THE

COMPOUND IS SAFE IN HUMANS, USUALLY USING HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. PHASE I STUDIES ARE CONCERNED WITH

DETECTING ADVERSE EFFECTS AND USUALLY DO NOT PROVIDE DATA ON THE

EFFICACY OF THE COMPOUND TO TREAT THE

TARGETED MEDICAL CONDITION. IF PHASE I STUDIES DO NOT IDENTIFY HUMAN TOLERABILITY PROBLEMS, THE

COMPOUND THEN ENTERS PHASE II WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME THE COMPOUND IS STUDIED IN PATIENTS WITH THE DISEASE

THAT THE COMPOUND IS BEING STUDIED TO TREAT. PHASE II DOSE AND EFFICACY TRIALS ARE COMMENCED TO

DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE DOSING FOR THE COMPOUND, TO CONFIRM THE COMPOUNDS EFFICACY AND TO

DETERMINE WHETHER ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS WILL LIMIT THE COMPOUNDS USEFULNESS. IF THE RESULTS FROM THE

PHASE II TRIALS ARE SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY COMMENCES LARGE-SCALE PHASE III TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE COMPOUNDS EFFICACY AND SAFETY. UPON COMPLETION OF THOSE TRIALS, IF

SATISFACTORY, THE

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANY SUBMITS REGULATORY FILINGS WITH THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCIES

AROUND THE WORLD TO HAVE THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE APPROVED FOR MARKETING. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

FDA APPROVAL PROCESS BEGINS ONCE A COMPLETE NDA IS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED BY THE FDA. PURSUANT TO

THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT, THE FDA REVIEW PERIOD TARGETS FOR

EFFICACY NDAS OR SUPPLEMENTAL

NDAS IS EITHER SIX MONTHS, FOR PRIORITY REVIEW, OR TEN MONTHS, FOR A STANDARD REVIEW. WITHIN 60

DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF AN NDA, THE FDA DETERMINES IF THE APPLICATION IS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE TO

PERMIT A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW. THE FDA ALSO ASSESSES, AT THAT TIME, WHETHER THE APPLICATION WILL BE

GRANTED A PRIORITY REVIEW OR STANDARD REVIEW. ACCORDING TO FDA GUIDELINES, A PRIORITY REVIEW IS

GRANTED IF THE COMPOUND IS CONSIDERED TO CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, COMPARED TO

MARKETED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NON-DRUG PRODUCTS/THERAPIES IN THE TREATMENT, DIAGNOSIS, OR PREVENTION

OF A DISEASE. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE APPLICATION IS FILABLE AND TYPE OF REVIEW (I.E.,

STANDARD OR PRIORITY) ARE THEN COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY. ONCE THE REVIEW TIMELINES ARE DEFINED,

IT IS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT THE FDA WILL ACT UPON THE APPLICATION WITHIN THOSE TIMELINES, UNLESS A

MAJOR AMENDMENT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED (EITHER AT THE COMPANYS OWN INITIATIVE OR THE FDAS REQUEST) TO

THE PENDING APPLICATION. IF THIS OCCURS, THE FDA MAY EXTEND THE REVIEW PERIOD TO ALLOW FOR REVIEW

OF THE NEW INFORMATION, BUT BY NO MORE THAN 180 DAYS. EXTENSIONS TO THE REVIEW PERIOD ARE

COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY. THE AVERAGE TIME PERIOD FROM THE START OF PRECLINICAL TESTING TO FDA

APPROVAL IS APPROXIMATELY 14 YEARS.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAD FILED A BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION FOR

PROQUAD

(MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBELLA AND VARICELLA (OKA/MERCK) VIRUS VACCINE LIVE) WITH THE FDA.

PROQUAD

IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL VACCINE FOR SIMULTANEOUS VACCINATION AGAINST MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBELLA

AND VARICELLA IN CHILDREN 12 MONTHS TO 12 YEARS OF AGE.

PROQUAD

COMBINES TWO ESTABLISHED MERCK

VACCINES,

M-M-R

II AND

VARIVAX.

THE COMPANYS LATE-STAGE PIPELINE INCLUDES THREE PHASE III VACCINES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE

SUBMITTED FOR FDA APPROVAL IN 2005. THE THREE VACCINES ARE

GARDASIL,

A VACCINE TO PREVENT HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) INFECTION AND THE ASSOCIATED DEVELOPMENT OF CERVICAL

CANCER AND GENITAL WARTS; A VACCINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF ZOSTER (SHINGLES) AND THE REDUCTION OF

PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH IT; AND

ROTATEQ

, A VACCINE TO PROTECT AGAINST ROTAVIRUS, A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS

VIRUS THAT IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF SEVERE GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO FILE PLAS WITH THE FDA FOR THE ZOSTER VACCINE AND

ROTATEQ

IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2005 AND FOR

GARDASIL

IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005.

ON FEBRUARY 2, 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT AND GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC (GSK) ENTERED

INTO A CROSS-LICENSE AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR CERTAIN PATENT RIGHTS RELATED TO HPV VACCINES.

PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, GSK WILL RECEIVE AN UPFRONT PAYMENT AND

ROYALTIES FROM THE COMPANY BASED ON

SALES OF

GARDASIL,

UPON DEVELOPMENT AND LAUNCH. THE AGREEMENT RESOLVES COMPETING INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY CLAIMS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AND GSKS VACCINE CANDIDATES. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE

WITH ITS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND, AFTER APPROPRIATE REGULATORY REVIEWS, COMMERCIALIZATION

ACTIVITIES, IF APPROVED, FOR

GARDASIL.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO STUDYING A DPP-IV INHIBITOR, A GLUCOSE-LOWERING MECHANISM, USED ALONE AND

IN COMBINATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES. THE COMPOUND IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE III

CLINICAL STUDIES AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO SUBMIT AN NDA TO THE FDA IN 2006.

THE COMPANYS EARLY-STAGE PIPELINE INCLUDES CANDIDATES IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS.

ALZHEIMERS DISEASE, ARTHRITIS, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CANCER, DIABETES, ENDOCRINE DISORDERS, GLAUCOMA,

INFECTIOUS DISEASES, OBESITY, OSTEOPOROSIS, PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, PAIN,

RESPIRATORY DISEASE, UROGENITAL DISORDERS AND VACCINES. THE COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS ITS INTERNAL

RESEARCH WITH AN AGGRESSIVE LICENSING AND EXTERNAL ALLIANCE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM

OF COLLABORATIONS FROM EARLY RESEARCH TO LATE-STAGE COMPOUNDS, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN

2004, THE COMPANY COMPLETED 50 TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, PRECLINICAL AND

CLINICAL COMPOUNDS, AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS. TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED IN 2004 INCLUDE AGREEMENTS

WITH THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES: H. LUNDBECK A/S (LUNDBECK) FOR THE TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISORDERS,

IN FEBRUARY 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH LUNDBECK FOR

THE EXCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF GABOXADOL, A COMPOUND

LICENSED TO LUNDBECK BY A THIRD PARTY THAT IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TREATMENT

OF SLEEP DISORDERS. MERCK AND LUNDBECK WILL JOINTLY COMPLETE THE ONGOING PHASE III CLINICAL

PROGRAM. THE COMPANIES ANTICIPATE THAT MERCK WILL FILE AN NDA WITH THE FDA BETWEEN LATE 2006 AND

EARLY 2007. FOLLOWING FDA APPROVAL, THE COMPANIES PLAN TO CO-PROMOTE GABOXADOL IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN JUNE 2004, MERCK AND LUNDBECK ANNOUNCED AN EXTENSION OF THEIR AGREEMENT FOR THE

EXCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF GABOXADOL TO JAPAN.

IN MARCH 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ATON, A PRIVATELY HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSING ON

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR CANCER AND OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES. ATONS CLINICAL

PIPELINE OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS REPRESENTS A CLASS OF ANTI-TUMOR AGENTS WITH POTENTIAL

FOR EFFICACY BASED ON A NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION. ATONS LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE, SUBEROYLANILIDE

HYDROXAMIC ACID (SAHA), IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS

T-CELL LYMPHOMA.

IN APRIL 2004, MERCK AND BMS ENTERED INTO A WORLDWIDE COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT FOR

MURAGLITAZAR, BMSS PRODUCT FOR USE IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. MERCK AND BMS WILL

GLOBALLY DEVELOP AND MARKET MURAGLITAZAR. IN DECEMBER 2004, BMS SUBMITTED AN NDA TO THE FDA FOR

MURAGLITAZAR. MURAGLITAZAR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE FIRST IN A NOVEL CLASS OF DRUGS KNOWN AS

GLITAZARS. THIS CLASS OF DUAL ALPHA/GAMMA PPAR AGONISTS, INCLUDING MURAGLITAZAR, IS THOUGHT TO

CONTROL BLOOD SUGAR. IN CLINICAL TRIALS, MURAGLITAZAR HAS REDUCED BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS, DECREASED

TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS AND INCREASED HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN TYPE 2

DIABETES PATIENTS AND HAS BEEN GENERALLY WELL TOLERATED.

IN JUNE 2004, MERCK AND VERTEX ENTERED INTO A GLOBAL COLLABORATION TO DEVELOP AND

COMMERCIALIZE VX-680, VERTEXS LEAD AURORA KINASE INHIBITOR THAT IS IN PHASE I CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT

FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. AURORA KINASES ARE IMPLICATED IN THE ONSET AND PROGRESSION OF MANY

DIFFERENT HUMAN CANCERS AND NOVEL AURORA KINASE INHIBITORS, SUCH AS VX-680, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

PLAY AN IMPORTANT FUTURE ROLE IN THE TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF A WIDE RANGE OF TUMOR TYPES.

IN AUGUST 2004, MERCK AND DOV ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION

OF DOVS NOVEL TRIPLE-UPTAKE INHIBITORS BEING DEVELOPED FOR DEPRESSION AND RELATED PSYCHIATRIC

DISORDERS. MERCK HAS LICENSED EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO DOV 21,947, WHICH IS IN PHASE I, FOR

ALL THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, MERCK AND NASTECH ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL ALLIANCE TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

PEPTIDE YY (PYY) 3-36 NASAL SPRAY, NASTECHS PRODUCT FOR THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY, WHICH IS

CURRENTLY IN PHASE I DEVELOPMENT. THE INVESTIGATIONAL PYY 3-36 NASAL SPRAY IS DESIGNED TO DELIVER

THE NATURAL, APPETITE-REGULATING HORMONE PYY DIRECTLY TO THE BLOODSTREAM.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, MERCK AND ONO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT GRANTING MERCK THE

WORLDWIDE LICENSE FOR ONO-2506 ((2R)-2-PROPYLOCTANOIC ACID), A NOVEL INTRAVENOUS COMPOUND CURRENTLY

IN PHASE II DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE STROKE. IN ADDITION, ONO RECEIVED EXCLUSIVE

RIGHTS IN JAPAN TO DEVELOP AND MARKET

EMEND

(APREPITANT), MERCKS DRUG FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH

OTHER ANTIEMETIC AGENTS FOR PREVENTION OF ACUTE AND DELAYED NAUSEA AND VOMITING ASSOCIATED WITH

INITIAL AND REPEAT COURSES OF HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY, INCLUDING CISPLATIN. ONO ALSO

RECEIVED RIGHTS IN JAPAN TO CO-MARKET A SECOND BRAND OF MK-431, MERCKS INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL

COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES, UNDER A YET TO BE DETERMINED TRADEMARK.

THE CHART BELOW REFLECTS THE COMPANYS RESEARCH PIPELINE AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2005. CANDIDATES

SHOWN IN PHASE III INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. CANDIDATES SHOWN IN PHASE I AND II INCLUDE THE MOST

ADVANCED COMPOUND WITH A SPECIFIC MECHANISM IN A GIVEN THERAPEUTIC AREA. BACK-UP COMPOUNDS,

REGARDLESS OF THEIR PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT, ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS IN THE SAME THERAPEUTIC AREAS AND

EMPLOYEES

AT THE END OF 2004, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 63,000 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE, WITH

APPROXIMATELY 32,700 EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO. APPROXIMATELY 22% OF

WORLDWIDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY ARE REPRESENTED BY VARIOUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO ELIMINATE 4,400 POSITIONS AS PART OF A COST-REDUCTION

INITIATIVE THAT WAS COMPLETED AT THE END OF 2004. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD

ELIMINATED 5,100 POSITIONS, AS THE COMPANY IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ELIMINATE

POSITIONS AND REDUCE COSTS. MOST OF THE ADDITIONAL ELIMINATIONS CAME FROM CONTRACTOR POSITIONS.

THIS ACTION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN SAVINGS IN 2005 WITHOUT

IMPACTING EITHER KEY PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES OR THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MEET ITS BUSINESS

OBJECTIVES.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN 2004, THE COMPANY INCURRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF

APPROXIMATELY $50.2 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FACILITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

RESULTING FROM

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES. EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $24.5 MILLION IN 2004, AND ARE ESTIMATED AT $65.6 MILLION FOR THE

YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2009. THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER

PARTIES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS, AND IN

MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS WHICH ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN ACCRUED. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

OUTCOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THOSE PROVIDED

SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE

COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. ONE CAN IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS SUCH AS

EXPECTS, PLANS, WILL, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS, PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR

MEANING. ONE CAN ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR

CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO ADDRESS THE COMPANYS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL

RESULTS, PRODUCT APPROVALS AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH

STATEMENT AND SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM THE COMPANYS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS AND A

BROAD VARIETY OF OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE

NOT. NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY.

ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.



ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MERCK VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

FROM THE

MARKET. NUMEROUS PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AS WELL AS A NUMBER

OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN

STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS RELATING TO THE SALE AND USE OF

VIOXX.

IN ADDITION TO THESE LAWSUITS, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND

FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE

COMPANY MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN

VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). IN ADDITION, A NUMBER

OF SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED DERIVATIVE SUITS ASSERTING CLAIMS

AGAINST THE BOARD MEMBERS AND COMPANY OFFICERS. THE COMPANY HAS

ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS RELATING TO

VIOXX

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,

CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

OFFICE IN MUNICH, GERMANY. THE COMPANY HAS STATED THAT IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL NOT BE

ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSIVE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS (AS DEFINED ON PAGE

18) OR RESULTING FROM THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (AS DEFINED ON PAGE 19) COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.



AS NOTED ABOVE,

ARCOXIA

IS CURRENTLY MARKETED IN 51 COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND IT HAS RECEIVED AN APPROVABLE

LETTER FROM THE FDA. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY UNABLE AT THIS TIME

TO PREDICT ANY FUTURE ACTION THAT THE FDA WILL TAKE WITH RESPECT

TO

ARCOXIA

. THE FDA HELD A HEARING ON FEBRUARY 16-18 TO DISCUSS

SAFETY ISSUES RELATED TO COX-2 INHIBITORS. IN ADDITION, THE CHMP

IN EUROPE IS CONDUCTING A REVIEW OF ALL ASPECTS OF THE

CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY OF COX-2 INHIBITORS. IN CONNECTION WITH

THAT REVIEW, AS INTERIM MEASURES, THE SUMMARY OF PRODUCT

CHARACTERISTICS FOR COX-2 INHIBITORS WAS REVISED, INCLUDING ADDING

NEW CONTRA-INDICATIONS FOR COX-2 INHIBITORS GENERALLY AND FOR

ARCOXIA

SPECIFICALLY. THE COMPANY IS UNABLE AT THIS TIME TO

PREDICT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF CHMPS REVIEW. THE OUTCOMES OF EACH

OF THESE REVIEWS COULD MATERIALLY, NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE MARKET

POTENTIAL OF

ARCOXIA.

IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET

WAS SET TO EXPIRE IN JULY 2018. MERCK DISAGREES WITH THE DECISION OF

THE COURT OF APPEALS AND HAS REQUESTED RECONSIDERATION BY THE COURT OF APPEALS.



IN JULY 2004, THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE RENDERED AN ORAL DECISION TO REVOKE THE COMPANYS

PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THIS DECISION;

HOWEVER, BASED ON THAT DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS AFTER 2007.

THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS

OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A CANDIDATE CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE

LATE-STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING

IN DEVELOPMENT BUT FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS, THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN NECESSARY

REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE AND/OR THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL

TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL

DEFENDANT AND CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD (PAST AND PRESENT), TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS, AS DEFENDANTS. THE COMPLAINTS ARISE OUT OF SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. THE DERIVATIVE SUITS, WHICH ARE PURPORTEDLY

BROUGHT TO ASSERT RIGHTS OF THE COMPANY, ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD MEMBERS AND OFFICERS FOR

BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, ABUSE OF CONTROL AND

GROSS MISMANAGEMENT. AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX,

ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

WERE FILED IN THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT FOR HUNTERDON COUNTY AND IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OFFICERS AND

MEMBERS OF THE BOARD (PAST AND PRESENT) (ALL OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE

COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). TWO OF THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS THAT CERTAIN DIRECTORS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN

ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER

INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER

MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

IN RESPONSE TO THAT DEMAND LETTER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINED AT ITS

NOVEMBER 23, 2004 MEETING THAT THE BOARD WOULD TAKE THE SHAREHOLDERS REQUEST UNDER CONSIDERATION

AND IT REMAINS UNDER CONSIDERATION.

IN ADDITION TO THESE SHAREHOLDER ACTIONS, SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

,

PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA AND IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

NEW JERSEY (THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS) ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).

THE LAWSUITS MAKE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2005, A TOTAL OF 11

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WERE PENDING.

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE PLAINTIFF IN ONE OF THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS FILED A MOTION WITH THE JPML

TO TRANSFER TO A SINGLE FEDERAL JUDGE AND COORDINATE FOR PRETRIAL PURPOSES ALL OF THE

VIOXX

ERISA

LAWSUITS. IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO THAT MOTION AND FILED ITS OWN MOTION

SEEKING COORDINATION OF ALL OF THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS. ON FEBRUARY 23, 2005, THE JPML

GRANTED THE MOTIONS TO TRANSFER ALL

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS NATIONWIDE

INTO ONE MDL FOR COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE MDL HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R. CHESLER.

INTERNATIONAL LAWSUITS

IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN

ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, BRAZIL AND ISRAEL RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

BASED ON MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER SOURCES, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS)

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

INSURANCE

THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS OF UP TO APPROXIMATELY $630 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-INSURANCE. THIS

INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND POTENTIAL DAMAGE AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN

OR WILL BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE EXTENDS TO ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT

MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY

$190 MILLION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS FIDUCIARY AND OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF

$275 MILLION. ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS MAY ALSO BE

AVAILABLE UNDER UPPER LEVEL EXCESS POLICIES THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE DISPUTES WITH

INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE. AT THIS TIME, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

RECENTLY,

MERCK RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS

INSURERS (WHICH PROVIDE EXCESS INSURANCE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE TO

ALL OF THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) COMMENCED AN ARBITRATION SEEKING, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, TO CANCEL THOSE POLICIES AND TO VOID ALL OF THEIR

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THOSE POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS,

AND ALSO TO VOID THEIR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN

OTHER TYPES OF LOSSES COVERED BY THOSE POLICIES. THE NOTICE ALSO

PURPORTS TO RESERVE THE RIGHT OF THE INSURERS TO RAISE OTHER COVERAGE

DEFENSES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF EXCLUSIONS,

THE DEFINITION OF LOSS, COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY CONDITIONS, EXHAUSTION

OF APPLICABLE UNDERLYING AND UPPER COVERAGE LIMITS, AND SATISFACTORY

PROOF OF LOSS. AS MOST OF THOSE INSURERS ALSO ISSUED

LOWER LEVEL EXCESS POLICIES TO MERCK, IT IS LIKELY THAT SUCH INSURERS WILL ALSO DISPUTE THEIR

OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE COVERAGE UNDER OTHER POLICIES. MERCK INTENDS TO CONTEST VIGOROUSLY THE

INSURERS CLAIMS AND WILL ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS UNDER

APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECOVERED UNDER

THE POLICIES DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS

SPECIFIED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN

INFORMAL INQUIRY CONCERNING

VIOXX

. ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED

NOTICE THAT THE SEC ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION. ALSO, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA

FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH,

MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION UNDER

CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.

ALSO, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN MUNICH, GERMANY NOTIFIED THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY IN

GERMANY THAT IT RECEIVED COMPLAINTS AND COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER

ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN GERMANY CONCERNING

VIOXX

(TOGETHER WITH THE PREVIOUSLY

MENTIONED INVESTIGATIONS, THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY WILL COOPERATE WITH ALL OF THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY

COULD RESULT IN A POTENTIAL CIVIL DISPOSITION FROM THE SEC AND/OR POTENTIAL CIVIL OR CRIMINAL

DISPOSITIONS FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

RESERVES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

MAY GO TO TRIAL IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY TRIALS

WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS

DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS

AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS

WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY

POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE

"

VIOXX

LITIGATION). THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A RESERVE OF $675 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS AND IS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES AT THIS TIME IT CAN REASONABLY

ESTIMATE WILL BE SPENT OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD. THE COMPANY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE RESERVE

WHEN IT HAD THE ABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT WERE CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY UP TO

THAT TIME; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE

EXPANDED SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY;

AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN

THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED RESERVES. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR RESULTING FROM THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL LITIGATION

BEGINNING IN 1993, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A NUMBER OF ANTITRUST SUITS, CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE

CERTIFIED AS CLASS ACTIONS, INSTITUTED BY MOST OF THE NATIONS RETAIL PHARMACIES AND CONSUMERS IN

SEVERAL STATES. IN 1994, THESE ACTIONS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE PENDING IN STATE COURTS, WERE

CONSOLIDATED FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. IN 1996, THE

COMPANY AND SEVERAL OTHER DEFENDANTS SETTLED THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTION, WHICH REPRESENTED THE SINGLE

LARGEST GROUP OF CLAIMS. SINCE THAT TIME, THE COMPANY HAS SETTLED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

REMAINING CASES ON SATISFACTORY TERMS; THE FEW REMAINING CASES HAVE BEEN INACTIVE FOR SEVERAL

YEARS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY CONSPIRACY AND NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING WAS MADE NOR

WAS INCLUDED IN ANY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE SOMETIMES USED IN

CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML

ORDERED THE TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON,

MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE

CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF

MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH, LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING

CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION

AND DISMISSED THE COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE

PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE COMPANY AS

A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND 30 OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS REMAIN DEFENDANTS IN SIX

SIMILAR COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT IN MASSACHUSETTS FILED BY THE NEW YORK COUNTIES OF

SUFFOLK, ROCKLAND, NASSAU, WESTCHESTER, ONONDAGA AND NEW YORK CITY AND THREE CASES PENDING IN

KENTUCKY, ALABAMA AND WISCONSIN. THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED AND ARGUED THEIR

MOTION TO DISMISS THE SUFFOLK CASE AND ARE AWAITING THE COURTS FINAL DECISION ON THE MOTION. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN CASES BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS OF KENTUCKY AND

WISCONSIN ALLEGING FRAUDULENT PRACTICES REGARDING AWP, WHICH THE COMPANY WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ANTITRUST CASES IN

FEDERAL COURT IN MINNESOTA AND IN STATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA, EACH ALLEGING AN UNLAWFUL CONSPIRACY

AMONG DIFFERENT SETS OF PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO PROTECT HIGH PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES BY

IMPEDING IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF LOWER-PRICED PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CANADA. THE

COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE ACTION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, A SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN ALABAMA BY TWO PROVIDERS OF HEALTH

SERVICES TO NEEDY PATIENTS ALLEGES THAT 15 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OVERCHARGED THE PLAINTIFFS AND

A CLASS OF THOSE SIMILARLY SITUATED, FOR PHARMACEUTICALS PURCHASED BY THE PLAINTIFFS UNDER THE

PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY SECTION 340B OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER

DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT ON NUMEROUS GROUNDS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2003, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOTIFIED THE FEDERAL

COURT IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO INTERVENE AT THAT TIME IN A PENDING

FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT CASE THAT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL IN DECEMBER 1999 AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE

COURT ISSUED AN ORDER UNSEALING THE COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS FILED BY A PHYSICIAN IN LOUISIANA, AND

ORDERED THAT THE COMPLAINT BE SERVED. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCOUNTING

OF

PEPCID

IN CERTAIN LOUISIANA HOSPITALS LED TO INCREASES IN COSTS TO MEDICAID, WAS DISMISSED. AN

AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL AND THE CASE HAS BEEN ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED BY THE COURT

UNTIL THE SEAL IS LIFTED. THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE AMENDED COMPLAINT ARE UNKNOWN.

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

JUSTICE IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO REPORTED THAT IT HAS RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF TEXAS REGARDING THE COMPANYS

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES RELATING TO TEXAS. IN APRIL 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF

THE COMPANYS INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA. IN

NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER REQUEST FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN CONNECTION

WITH ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS PRICING OF

PEPCID

. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH ALL OF

THESE INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER, IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, OTHER

FEDERAL OR STATE REGULATORS MAY SEEK INFORMATION ABOUT PRACTICES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN

INQUIRIES OTHER THAN THE INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT

THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH INQUIRIES.

VACCINE LITIGATION

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY IN CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1987 IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS A RESULT

OF BEING VACCINATED WITH VARIOUS BIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES AND RUBELLA AND/OR TRIVALENT

VACCINES FOR MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS

M-M-R

II. THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE

AUTISM, WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, EPILEPSY, DIABETES, ENCEPHALITIS,

ENCEPHALOPATHY, DEAFNESS, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME AND TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. IN EARLY SEPTEMBER

2003, THE LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSION (LSC) ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION TO WITHDRAW PUBLIC FUNDING OF

THE LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE CLAIMANTS. THIS DECISION WAS CONFIRMED ON APPEAL BY THE FUNDING

REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC) ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THE CLAIMANTS APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF

THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW PUBLIC FUNDING WAS DISMISSED IN FEBRUARY 2004 AND THE APRIL 2004 TRIAL

DATE WAS VACATED. THE LEAD CLAIMANTS HAVE DECIDED NOT TO APPLY TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR

PERMISSION TO APPEAL THE DECISION. AS A RESULT, LEGAL AID FOR ALL LEAD CLAIMANTS HAS NOW BEEN

DISCHARGED. THE NON-LEAD CLAIMANTS WERE SUBJECT TO A SHOW CAUSE PROCEDURE TO WITHDRAW LEGAL AID

UNLESS THE CLAIMANTS COULD SHOW CAUSE AS TO WHY IT SHOULD NOT BE WITHDRAWN. THE FRC HEARD 37 OF

THE SHOW CAUSE APPEALS BY THE NON-LEAD CLAIMANTS IN OCTOBER 2004. THE APPEALS INVOLVING AUTISM

(26) WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, BUT FUNDING WAS REINSTATED FOR 11 APPEALS INVOLVING OTHER NON-AUTISM

CONDITIONS SUCH AS EPILEPSY, DEAFNESS, ENCEPHALITIS AND TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. IN LIGHT OF THE 11

SUCCESSFUL APPEALS, THE LSC HAS RECONSIDERED THE CASES OF SOME OTHER CLAIMANTS AND, TO DATE,

FUNDING HAS BEEN REINSTATED IN AN ADDITIONAL 86 NON-LEAD, NON-AUTISM CASES, TO THE LIMITED EXTENT

NECESSARY TO ALLOW SOLICITORS TO PROVIDE A REPORT ON THE INDIVIDUAL CASES TO THE LSC. IT IS NOT

YET KNOWN HOW MANY OF THE 97 APPEALS INVOLVE CLAIMANTS SUING THE COMPANY. ALL CLAIMANTS FOR ALL

CONDITIONS HAD UNTIL FEBRUARY 28, 2005 TO GIVE NOTICE OF THEIR INTENTION TO CONTINUE OR DISCONTINUE

WITH THEIR CLAIMS, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD SECURED LEGAL AID FUNDING. DIRECTIONS

FOR FURTHER CONDUCT OF THE LITIGATION WILL BE MADE AT A CASE MANAGEMENT HEARING SCHEDULED TO TAKE

PLACE ON MARCH 17 AND 18, 2005. THE COMPANY WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS PREVIOUS DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS ALSO A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (I.E., HEPATITIS B

VACCINE AND

HAEMOPHILUS

INFLUENZA

TYPE B VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A

PRESERVATIVE USED IN VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING PEDIATRIC VACCINES

IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FALL OF 2001. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 300

ACTIVE THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS WITH APPROXIMATELY 820 PLAINTIFFS. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE

VACCINE MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS

MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT

THEY HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC

VACCINES. TWO STATE COURT CASES AND TWO FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT CASES ARE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN

2005. THE COMPANY WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE

GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM

(NVICP). THE NVICP PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR

FEDERAL COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A

PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE VACCINE

COURT). UNDER THE NVICP, BEFORE FILING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE

PETITIONER MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN VACCINE COURT AND THEN

TIMELY

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE

NUMEROUS CASES PENDING IN VACCINE COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES

AND/OR THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. THE COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO THESE

VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

HUMAN SERVICES.

PATENT LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG

APPLICATIONS (ANDAS) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR

TO THE EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES GENERIC FORMS OF

FOSAMAX

,

PRILOSEC

AND

PROPECIA

PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS (AND ASTRAZENECAS IN THE CASE OF

PRILOSEC)

PATENTS CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. THE GENERIC COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY INCLUDE

ALLEGATIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, INVALIDITY AND UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. GENERIC

MANUFACTURERS HAVE RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A GENERIC FORM OF

PRILOSEC

. THE COMPANY HAS

FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC

ALENDRONATE AND FINASTERIDE, AND ASTRAZENECA AND THE COMPANY HAVE FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS

IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC OMEPRAZOLE. SIMILAR PATENT CHALLENGES

EXIST IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS,

WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET

PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF

EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

A TRIAL IN THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO THE ALENDRONATE DAILY PRODUCT CONCLUDED IN

NOVEMBER 2001. IN NOVEMBER 2002, A DECISION WAS ISSUED BY THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE

FINDING THE COMPANYS PATENT VALID AND INFRINGED. ON OCTOBER 30, 2003, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE VALIDITY AND INFRINGEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BASIC U.S. PATENT

COVERING THE USE OF ALENDRONATE IN ANY FORM. A REQUEST FOR REHEARING WAS DENIED. A TRIAL IN THE

UNITED STATES INVOLVING THE ALENDRONATE WEEKLY PRODUCT WAS HELD IN MARCH 2003. ON AUGUST 28, 2003,

THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE UPHELD THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS U.S. PATENT COVERING THE

WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. HOWEVER, ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY

ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL

LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A DECLINE

IN U.S.

FOSAMAX

SALES AT THAT TIME. PRIOR TO THE DECISION, MERCKS PATENT FOR ONCE-WEEKLY

ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

WAS SET TO EXPIRE IN JULY 2018. MERCK DISAGREES WITH THE DECISION OF THE

COURT OF APPEALS AND HAS REQUESTED RECONSIDERATION BY THE COURT OF APPEALS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES HELD THAT PATENTS OF THE

COMPANY PROTECTING THE ALENDRONATE DAILY AND WEEKLY PRODUCTS WERE INVALID IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

ON NOVEMBER 6, 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS OF ENGLAND AND WALES AFFIRMED THE RULING BY THE HIGH

COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PERMIT COMPANIES SEEKING APPROVAL OF A

GENERIC PRODUCT TO REFERENCE DATA OF THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER DATA

EXCLUSIVITY REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN GRANTED LEAVE TO APPEAL A DECISION OF THE U.K.

REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT ITS DATA FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE MAY BE REFERENCED BY COMPANIES SEEKING

APPROVAL OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO FILED AN APPEAL OF A GRANT

BY THE SWEDISH REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF APPROVAL OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE PRODUCTS WHICH

REFERENCED THE COMPANYS DATA ON WEEKLY ALENDRONATE FOR THEIR APPROVAL.

AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED BY THE COMPANY, ON JULY 20, 2004, THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE

EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE RENDERED AN ORAL DECISION TO REVOKE THE COMPANYS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT

COVERS THE WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. ON AUGUST 19, 2004, THE WRITTEN OPINION WAS

ISSUED CONFIRMING THE ORAL DECISION REVOKING THE COMPANYS PATENT. ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, THE

COMPANY FILED AN APPEAL OF THIS DECISION. BASED ON OTHER PATENTS, THE ALENDRONATE WEEKLY PRODUCT

IS PROTECTED IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS UNTIL AT LEAST 2007.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON OCTOBER 5, 2004, IN AN ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS

AUSTRALIAN PATENT FOR THE WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE, THE PATENT WAS FOUND TO BE INVALID.

THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE DECISION.

IN ADDITION, IN JAPAN A PROCEEDING HAS BEEN FILED CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS

JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE.

IN THE CASE OF OMEPRAZOLE, THE TRIAL COURT IN THE UNITED STATES RENDERED AN OPINION IN OCTOBER

2002 UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS AND ASTRAZENECAS PATENTS COVERING THE STABILIZED

FORMULATION OF OMEPRAZOLE AND RULING THAT ONE DEFENDANTS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT DID NOT INFRINGE THOSE

PATENTS. THE OTHER THREE DEFENDANTS PRODUCTS WERE FOUND TO INFRINGE THE FORMULATION PATENTS. IN

DECEMBER 2003, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL

COURT. WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OTHER GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCTS, NO TRIAL DATE HAS

YET BEEN SET.

IN THE CASE OF FINASTERIDE, AN ANDA HAS BEEN FILED SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC VERSION OF

PROPECIA

AND ALLEGING INVALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS PATENTS. THE COMPANY FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT

LAWSUIT IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF DELAWARE IN SEPTEMBER 2004. A TRIAL IS NOT ANTICIPATED BEFORE

2006.

OTHER LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 6, 2004, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

NEW JERSEY GRANTED A MOTION BY THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO

DISMISS A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INVOLVING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS REVENUE

RECOGNITION PRACTICE FOR RETAIL CO-PAYMENTS PAID BY INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM MEDCO HEALTH PROVIDES

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER ALLEGATIONS. THE COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

ON AUGUST 20, 2004, THE SAME COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE A RELATED

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION. PLAINTIFFS IN BOTH ACTIONS HAVE APPEALED THE DECISIONS.

PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A

CLASS ACTION BASIS, A SERIES OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA (THE GRUER CASES). THE

COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING

PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE PHARMACY

BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS, HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE PROPOSED CLASS

SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND THE

COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A TOTAL OF

$42.5 MILLION, AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TO CONTINUE

CERTAIN SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS

INTENDED TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO

HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME SINCE DECEMBER 17, 1994. IN 2003, THE DISTRICT

COURT PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT AND HELD HEARINGS TO HEAR OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET

DETERMINED THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL ONLY IF AND WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. THREE

NOTICES OF APPEAL HAVE BEEN FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT IS EXPECTED TO HEAR ARGUMENTS REGARDING

THE APPEALS IN MARCH 2005 AND DECIDE THE APPEALS THEREAFTER. CURRENTLY, CERTAIN CLASS MEMBER PLANS

HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH

PLANS AND TWO INDIVIDUALS REMAIN PENDING IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE

CASES HAVE ASSERTED CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME

AS OR SIMILAR TO THE CLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES.

THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY

AGREED TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT COST AND DISTRACTION OF

PROLONGED LITIGATION.

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY

EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH. THESE CASES ARE BEING DEFENDED BY

MEDCO HEALTH.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL

SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED, SHOULD NOT

ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR WHICH A

SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN DECEMBER 2003, THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

(VADEQ) ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION TO THE COMPANYS ELKTON, VIRGINIA FACILITY FOR AIR PERMIT

LIMIT EXCEEDANCES REPORTED BY THE FACILITY AS A RESULT OF PERFORMANCE TESTING OF A PROCESS TRAIN.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH VADEQ AND BELIEVES THAT ITS DISCUSSIONS WILL RESULT IN

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER WITH MONETARY SANCTIONS WHICH WILL BE IMMATERIAL BUT WILL EXCEED

$100,000.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE

DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS. THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED OF AT

THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY

LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE PROCEEDINGS

ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY

REFLECTS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL

LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO

PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES OR PRIVATE

LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, SUCH PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY

LIABILITY WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN

IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REDUCTION FOR

ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM INSURERS, FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER

RECALCITRANT POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
