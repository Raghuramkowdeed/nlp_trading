PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

MERCK & CO., INC. (MERCK OR THE COMPANY) IS A GLOBAL RESEARCH-DRIVEN PHARMACEUTICAL

COMPANY THAT DISCOVERS, DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO

IMPROVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS JOINT VENTURES. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS

PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THE

COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF ITS

PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE

ORGANIZATIONS.

OVERVIEW 

IN DECEMBER 2005, MERCK UNVEILED A PLAN TO RECLAIM ITS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. AS PART OF THE STRATEGY, MERCK IS FOCUSING ON IMPROVING ITS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT (R&D) PRODUCTIVITY BY FOCUSING ON SELECT THERAPEUTIC AREAS, IMPLEMENTING A NEW

COMMERCIAL MODEL THAT WILL DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS, AND REDUCING ITS OVERALL COST

STRUCTURE COMPANYWIDE.

MERCKS NEW R&D MODEL IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF

SUCCESS BY PRIORITIZING THE COMPANYS R&D RESOURCES ON NINE PRIORITY DISEASE AREAS  ALZHEIMERS

DISEASE, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, NOVEL VACCINES, OBESITY, ONCOLOGY,

PAIN AND SLEEP DISORDERS. THESE THERAPEUTIC AREAS WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN BASED ON A SET OF

CRITERIA INCLUDING UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. WITHIN

THESE THERAPEUTIC AREAS, MERCK WILL COMMIT RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE RESEARCH BREADTH AND DEPTH AND TO

DEVELOP BEST-IN-CLASS TARGETED AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT ARE VALUED HIGHLY BY PATIENTS,

PAYERS AND PHYSICIANS.

THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MAKE FOCUSED INVESTMENTS TO PURSUE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS IN THE FOLLOWING

SELECTED DISEASE AREAS: ANTIBIOTICS, ANTIFUNGALS, ANTIVIRALS (HEPATITIS C VIRUS, HUMAN

IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS), ASTHMA, CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE, NEURODEGENERATION,

OPHTHALMOLOGY, OSTEOPOROSIS, SCHIZOPHRENIA AND STROKE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL CAPITALIZE

ON SELECTED OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE THESE AREAS BY CONTINUING TO COMMERCIALIZE ATTRACTIVE CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT CANDIDATES IN THE PIPELINE AND BY PURSUING APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL LICENSING

OPPORTUNITIES.

MERCKS LATE-STAGE PIPELINE IS SHOWING STRONG PROGRESS WITH THREE BIOLOGICS LICENSE

APPLICATION (BLA) SUBMISSIONS TO THE U.S. FOOD AND

DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) IN 2005, ONE NEW DRUG

APPLICATION (NDA) ALREADY FILED WITH THE FDA IN 2006, TWO ADDITIONAL FDA FILINGS ANTICIPATED IN

2006, AND AN EXPECTED FIVE PROGRAMS IN PHASE III BY THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006.

THE

THREE FDA BLA SUBMISSIONS IN 2005 INCLUDE

GARDASIL

, A BREAKTHROUGH VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT

CERVICAL CANCER, THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATHS IN WOMEN WORLDWIDE;

ZOSTAVAX

, A VACCINE

TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF SHINGLES; AND

ROTATEQ

, A PEDIATRIC VACCINE TO PREVENT ROTAVIRUS

GASTROENTERITIS, A LEADING CAUSE OF DIARRHEA IN INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN, WHICH LEADS TO NEARLY

500,000 DEATHS WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR. ON FEBRUARY 3, 2006, MERCK ANNOUNCED THE APPROVAL BY THE FDA

OF

ROTATEQ

. IN ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE FDA HAS ACCEPTED THE BLA

FOR

GARDASIL

AND GRANTED THE VACCINE PRIORITY REVIEW

DESIGNATION. THE FDA'S REVIEW OF

ZOSTAVAX

IS EXPECTED TO BE

COMPLETED BY LATE MAY 2006.

ON FEBRUARY 15, 2006, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE NDA FILED WITH THE FDA FOR

JANUVIA

(THE

PROPOSED TRADEMARK FOR THE COMPOUND KNOWN AS MK-0431), A NOVEL MECHANISM FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE

2 DIABETES, WAS ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW. MERCK ALSO ANTICIPATES TWO ADDITIONAL FDA FILINGS

IN 2006: VORINOSTAT (THE GENERIC NAME FOR THE SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC ACID COMPOUND), A

HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITOR FOR CANCER; AND MK-0517, AN INTRAVENOUS PRODRUG OF APREPITANT TO

TREAT CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING.

TO IMPROVE ITS COMMERCIAL SELLING MODEL, MERCK WILL CONTINUE TO STREAMLINE AND RESTRUCTURE

ITS MARKETING AND SALES OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE TO IMPROVE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND GENERATE GREATER

EFFICIENCIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ALREADY HAS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF SALES

REPRESENTATIVES PROMOTING THE SAME PRODUCT BY 50

PERCENT VERSUS HISTORICAL LEVELS. IN ADDITION, MERCK WILL PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON ACTIVE

ENGAGEMENT WITH KEY

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPINION LEADERS TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF SCIENTIFIC

INFORMATION AND DEVOTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY AND DEMONSTRATING PRODUCT

VALUE TO PHYSICIANS, AS WELL AS PAYERS AND CONSUMERS WHO HAVE INCREASING INFLUENCE ON PRESCRIPTION

DECISIONS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS APPROACH HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLE PRODUCTIVITY

IMPROVEMENTS IN PILOT PROGRAMS AND IS EXPECTED TO LOWER THE COMPANYS SPENDING PER BRAND BY 15 TO

20 PERCENT BY 2010, WHILE MAXIMIZING SALES PERFORMANCE. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO ITS

UPCOMING VACCINE LAUNCHES, IN THE UNITED STATES MERCK IS REDEPLOYING 1,500 SALES REPRESENTATIVES

WHO CURRENTLY PROMOTE ITS MAJOR IN-LINE PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF NEW VACCINES.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST PHASE OF A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS.

THE INITIAL STEPS WILL INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK

MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND

CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, MERCK

PLANS TO SELL OR CLOSE FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES BY THE END OF 2008, AND

ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,000 POSITIONS COMPANY-WIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY 1,100

POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY HAD BEEN ELIMINATED. MERCK INCURRED $401.2 MILLION IN COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WHICH WERE COMPRISED OF $205.4 MILLION OF

SEPARATION COSTS AND $195.8 MILLION OF ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT COSTS.

THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES INCLUDED IN THIS ACTION ARE: PONDERS END, UNITED KINGDOM;

OKAZAKI, JAPAN; KIRKLAND, CANADA; ALBANY, GEORGIA AND DANVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA. THE TWO PRECLINICAL

SITES ARE IN OKAZAKI AND MENUMA, JAPAN. THE COMPANY WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION CHARGES DURING 2006 ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIONS. THE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABANDONMENT OF CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS THAT WILL NO LONGER BE USED IN THE BUSINESS

AS A RESULT OF THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO PLANS TO CLOSE ITS BASIC RESEARCH

CENTER IN TERLINGS PARK, UNITED KINGDOM, AND INCURRED ADDITIONAL ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS OF

$103.1 MILLION DURING 2005 WITH RESPECT TO THIS SITE.

ADDITIONAL CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION TO $1 BILLION ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED

DURING 2006, BASED ON ESTIMATED TIME OF COMPLETION, AS THE SALES/CLOSURES OF THE FACILITIES

PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED OCCUR. MERCK EXPECTS ITS COST REDUCTION PROGRAM TO YIELD CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX

SAVINGS OF $4.5 TO $5.0 BILLION FROM 2006 THROUGH 2010.

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT (AJCA), SIGNED INTO LAW IN OCTOBER 2004, CREATED TEMPORARY

INCENTIVES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2005 FOR U.S. MULTINATIONALS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME

EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN CONNECTION WITH THE AJCA, THE

COMPANY REPATRIATED $15.9 BILLION DURING 2005, AND AS A RESULT, RECORDED AN INCOME TAX CHARGE OF

$766.5 MILLION. THIS CHARGE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $100 MILLION BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DECISION TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MERCK ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY WORLDWIDE

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

CHARGE TO PRE-TAX INCOME OF $726.2 MILLION, OR $552.6 MILLION AFTER TAX ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME,

IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2004. THIS DID NOT INCLUDE CHARGES FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS. THE

VIOXX

WITHDRAWAL PROCESS WAS COMPLETED DURING 2005 AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WITHDRAWAL WERE IN

LINE WITH THE ORIGINAL AMOUNTS RECORDED BY THE COMPANY IN 2004.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD ESTABLISHED A RESERVE OF $675 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS

FUTURE

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY SPENT $285 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE

OF $295 MILLION TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO

VIOXX

TO $685 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND IS THE BEST

ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE WILL BE

SPENT THROUGH 2007.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION FOR 2005 WERE $2.10, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE

GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM OF $0.12 PER SHARE, THE NET TAX CHARGE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

AJCA OF $0.31 PER SHARE AND ADDITIONAL RESERVES ESTABLISHED SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

FOR

VIOXX

LITIGATION (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE).

VOLUNTARY

WITHDRAWAL OF VIOXX 

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MERCK ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY WORLDWIDE

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION. THE COMPANYS DECISION, WHICH WAS

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, WAS BASED ON NEW THREE-YEAR DATA FROM A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED,

PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL, APPROVE (ADENOMATOUS POLYP PREVENTION ON

VIOXX

).

THE TRIAL, WHICH WAS STOPPED, WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF

VIOXX

25 MG IN

PREVENTING THE RECURRENCE OF COLORECTAL POLYPS IN PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF COLORECTAL ADENOMAS

AND TO FURTHER ASSESS THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY OF

VIOXX

. IN THIS STUDY, THERE WAS AN INCREASED

RELATIVE RISK FOR CONFIRMED CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, SUCH AS HEART ATTACK AND STROKE, BEGINNING AFTER

18 MONTHS OF TREATMENT IN THE PATIENTS TAKING

VIOXX

COMPARED TO THOSE TAKING PLACEBO. THE RESULTS

FOR THE FIRST 18 MONTHS OF THE APPROVE STUDY DID NOT SHOW ANY INCREASED RISK OF CONFIRMED

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS ON

VIOXX

, AND IN THIS RESPECT, WERE SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS OF TWO

PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDIES DESCRIBED IN THE MOST RECENT U.S. LABELING FOR

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE 105 MILLION U.S. PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN FOR

VIOXX

FROM

MAY 1999 THROUGH AUGUST 2004. BASED ON THIS ESTIMATE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE NUMBER OF

PATIENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN

VIOXX

IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE ITS 1999 LAUNCH IS APPROXIMATELY 20

MILLION. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHO HAVE TAKEN

VIOXX

IS UNDETERMINED AT

THIS TIME.

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE

SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, REQUESTING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATED TO

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY ALSO RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM OTHER CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO COOPERATE WITH THESE INQUIRIES SO THAT THE COMPANY CAN CONTINUE TO DESCRIBE THE REASONS

FOR THE COMPANYS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS DEVELOPMENT AND EXTENSIVE TESTING OF THE MEDICINE AND ITS DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF

ITS STUDIES.

ON FEBRUARY 16-18, 2005, THE FDA HELD A JOINT MEETING OF THE ARTHRITIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND

THE DRUG SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEES DISCUSSED THE OVERALL

BENEFIT-TO-RISK CONSIDERATIONS (INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL SAFETY CONCERNS) FOR

COX-2 SELECTIVE NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND RELATED AGENTS. ON FEBRUARY 18, 2005, THE

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES WERE ASKED TO VOTE ON WHETHER THE OVERALL RISK VERSUS BENEFIT PROFILE FOR

VIOXX

SUPPORTS MARKETING IN THE UNITED STATES. THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES VOTED 17 TO 15 IN

SUPPORT OF THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX

IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY LOOKS FORWARD TO FURTHER

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ABOUT

VIOXX.

AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPOINTED A SPECIAL COMMITTEE

TO REVIEW THE COMPANYS ACTIONS PRIOR TO ITS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX,

TO ACT FOR THE BOARD IN

RESPONDING TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION MATTERS RELATED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

AND TO ADVISE THE

BOARD WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW. THAT REVIEW IS

ONGOING.

ARCOXIA



ARCOXIA

HAS BEEN LAUNCHED IN 56 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA AND AFRICA.

IN OCTOBER, 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN APPROVABLE LETTER FROM THE FDA FOR THE COMPANYS NDA FOR

ARCOXIA

. THE FDA INFORMED THE COMPANY IN THE LETTER THAT BEFORE

APPROVAL OF THE NDA CAN BE ISSUED, ADDITIONAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA FOR

ARCOXIA

ARE REQUIRED.

ON NOVEMBER 28, 2005, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ADOPTED A BINDING DECISION ON COX-2 INHIBITOR

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

ARCOXIA

, MARKETED IN THE EU. THE DECISION RESULTED FROM A REVIEW BY THE

COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (CHMP) OF THE

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EUROPEAN MEDICINES EVALUATION

AUTHORITY (EMEA), WHICH CONSIDERED ALL ASPECTS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY OF COX-2 INHIBITORS,

INCLUDING THROMBOTIC AND CARDIO-RENAL EVENTS, FOLLOWING THE VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

. THE

DECISION ADOPTED THE OPINION OF THE EMEA ISSUED ON JUNE 27, 2005, WHICH RECOMMENDED NEW

CARDIOVASCULAR CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS FOR INCLUSION IN THE LABELING OF COX-2 INHIBITORS,

INCLUDING

ARCOXIA

, IN THE EU. THE CHMP CONCLUDED THAT THE AVAILABLE DATA SHOW AN INCREASED RISK OF

CARDIOVASCULAR ADVERSE EVENTS FOR COX-2 INHIBITORS AS A CLASS RELATIVE TO PLACEBO AND SOME NSAIDS

AND THAT THE DATA SUGGESTED AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DURATION OF USE AND DOSE AND THE PROBABILITY OF

SUFFERING A CARDIOVASCULAR EVENT. LABEL MODIFICATIONS INCLUDED IN THE EMEAS OPINION REFLECTED

THAT USE OF THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF COX-2 INHIBITORS FOR THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE DURATION OF

TREATMENT WAS RECOMMENDED. FURTHER, A CONTRA-INDICATION FOR ALL COX-2 INHIBITORS IN PATIENTS WITH

ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE OR STROKE AND A CONTRA-INDICATION FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS HAVING HIGHER CLASSES

OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE WERE INCLUDED. SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO

ARCOXIA,

LABEL CHANGES

INCLUDED A CONTRA-INDICATION IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION WHOSE BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOT UNDER

CONTROL AND THAT

ARCOXIA

MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE,

PARTICULARLY AT HIGHER DOSES, THAN SOME OTHER COX-2 INHIBITORS, AND RECOMMENDED MONITORING OF BLOOD

PRESSURE FOR ALL PATIENTS TAKING

ARCOXIA.

ADDITIONAL WARNINGS REGARDING HYPERSENSITIVITY AND

SERIOUS SKIN REACTIONS WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE LABELING FOR ALL COX-2 INHIBITORS IN THE EU.

REGULATORY AGENCIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE

ARCOXIA

IS APPROVED HAVE MADE MODIFICATIONS TO

THE PRODUCT LABELING OF

ARCOXIA

, AS WELL AS OTHER COX-2 INHIBITORS, RELATIVE TO CARDIOVASCULAR

RISKS AND PATIENT USAGE. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE VENEZUELAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH ORDERED THE MARKET

WITHDRAWAL OF ALL COX-2 INHIBITORS, INCLUDING

ARCOXIA

. IN MEXICO, SALES OF

ARCOXIA

120 MG WERE

TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED, BUT THE SUSPENSION HAS BEEN LIFTED.

ACQUISITIONS

3⁄4

IN MARCH 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ATON PHARMA, INC. (ATON), A

PRIVATELY HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR CANCER AND

OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES. ATONS CLINICAL PIPELINE OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS REPRESENTS A

CLASS OF ANTI-TUMOR AGENTS WITH POTENTIAL FOR EFFICACY BASED ON A NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION. THE

LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE, SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC ACID, KNOWN AS VORINOSTAT, IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE

II CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, MSD (JAPAN) CO., LTD., COMPLETED

TENDER OFFERS TO ACQUIRE THE REMAINING 49% OF THE COMMON SHARES OF BANYU PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

(BANYU) THAT IT DID NOT ALREADY OWN FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5

BILLION. ON MARCH 30, 2004, MERCK COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF BANYU. FULL OWNERSHIP OF BANYU

STRENGTHENS MERCKS POSITION IN JAPAN, THE WORLDS SECOND-LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET.

JOINT VENTURES

3⁄4

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO

DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT

AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. IN DECEMBER 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN OCTOBER

2002,

ZETIA (

EZETIMIBE) (MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS

OF CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JULY 2004,

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), A COMBINATION PRODUCT

CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR,

WAS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THE COMMENCEMENT OF PATIENT

ENROLLMENT IN ITS LARGE-SCALE, CLINICAL OUTCOMES TRIAL

,

IMPROVE-IT (IMPROVED REDUCTION OF OUTCOMES.

VYTORIN

EFFICACY INTERNATIONAL TRIAL). THIS TRIAL WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

VYTORIN

COMPARED TO

ZOCOR

ALONE IN

TREATING APPROXIMATELY 10,000 HIGH RISK PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PRESENTING WITH

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES. CLINICAL TRIAL SITES ARE OPENING THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE.

IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB (ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET

ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN EQUALLY OWNED JOINT

VENTURE THAT DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC

, THE

FIRST IN A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH

SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA RESTRUCTURED THE JOINT VENTURE WHEREBY THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

ASTRAS INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED KBIS OPERATING

ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE PARTNERSHIP), IN

WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP,

BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY EARNS

CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP RETURNS AS WELL AS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE KBI

PRODUCTS. THE PARTNERSHIP RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP

AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS,

AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED PARTNERSHIP GAAP

EARNINGS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, FOR A PAYMENT OF $443.0 MILLION, ASTRA

PURCHASED AN OPTION TO BUY THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE COMPANYS

INTEREST IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

. THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTED ASTRA AN

OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION) TO BUY THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI, AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

IN APRIL 1999, ASTRA MERGED WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC, FORMING ASTRAZENECA AB (ASTRAZENECA). AS

A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPANYS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA

PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4

MILLION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A TRUE-UP CALCULATION IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE MERGER ALSO TRIGGERS A PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF THE COMPANYS LIMITED

PARTNER INTEREST IN 2008. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, ASTRAZENECAS OPTION TO BUY THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS IS EXERCISABLE IN 2010 AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO

REQUIRE ASTRAZENECA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008. IN ADDITION, THE SHARES OPTION IS

EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS PURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS. THE

EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION BY ASTRA IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR IN THE YEAR 2017 OR IF COMBINED ANNUAL SALES

OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG AS EITHER THE

MERCK OPTION IN 2008 OR ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 HAS BEEN EXERCISED. THE EXERCISE PRICE IS

BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED

AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE.

IN 1989, THE COMPANY FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO DEVELOP AND MARKET A

BROAD RANGE OF NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS 50% OWNED JOINT VENTURE WAS

EXPANDED INTO EUROPE IN 1993, AND INTO CANADA IN 1996. SIGNIFICANT JOINT VENTURE PRODUCTS ARE

PEPCID AC

(FAMOTIDINE), AN OVER-THE-COUNTER FORM OF THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION

PEPCID

(FAMOTIDINE), AS WELL AS

PEPCID COMPLETE,

AN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT WHICH COMBINES THE COMPANYS

ULCER MEDICATION WITH ANTACIDS (CALCIUM CARBONATE AND MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE). IN MARCH 2004, THE

COMPANY SOLD TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON ITS INTEREST IN THE EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE WHICH IS DISCUSSED

FURTHER ON PAGE 12 UNDER

DIVESTITURES.

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1992, THE COMPANY, THROUGH THE MERCK VACCINE DIVISION, AND CONNAUGHT

LABORATORIES, INC. (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.), AGREED TO COLLABORATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND

MARKETING OF COMBINATION PEDIATRIC VACCINES AND TO PROMOTE SELECTED VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE RESEARCH AND MARKETING COLLABORATION ENABLES THE COMPANIES TO POOL THEIR RESOURCES TO EXPEDITE

THE DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES COMBINING SEVERAL DIFFERENT ANTIGENS TO PROTECT CHILDREN AGAINST A

VARIETY OF DISEASES, INCLUDING

HAEMOPHILUS

INFLUENZAE

TYPE B, HEPATITIS B,

DIPHTHERIA, TETANUS, PERTUSSIS AND POLIOMYELITIS. WHILE COMBINATION VACCINE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

CONTINUE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NO VACCINES ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROMOTED.

IN 1994, THE COMPANY, THROUGH THE MERCK VACCINE DIVISION, AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW

SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.) FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET HUMAN VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE THEN EXISTING EU AND THE

EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY AND SANOFI PASTEUR CONTRIBUTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

THEIR EUROPEAN VACCINE BUSINESSES FOR EQUAL SHARES IN THE JOINT VENTURE, KNOWN AS PASTEUR MÉRIEUX

MSD, S.N.C. (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR MSD, S.N.C.). THE JOINT VENTURE IS SUBJECT TO MONITORING BY THE

EU, TO WHICH THE PARTNERS MADE CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS IN RETURN FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM EUROPEAN

COMPETITION LAW, EFFECTIVE UNTIL DECEMBER 2006. THE JOINT VENTURE MAINTAINS A PRESENCE, DIRECTLY

OR

THROUGH AFFILIATES OR BRANCHES IN BELGIUM, ITALY, GERMANY, SPAIN, FRANCE, AUSTRIA, IRELAND,

SWEDEN, PORTUGAL, THE NETHERLANDS, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS IN THE REST OF ITS TERRITORY.

IN SEPTEMBER, SANOFI PASTEUR MSD (SPMSD), MERCKS VACCINE JOINT VENTURE WITH SANOFI PASTEUR,

ENTERED INTO A LETTER OF UNDERTAKING (LOU) WITH THE EMEA DUE TO

EMEAS CONCERNS REGARDING THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE HEPATITIS B COMPONENT OF

HEXAVAC.

THE

HEPATITIS B COMPONENT OF

HEXAVAC

IS MANUFACTURED BY MERCK. THE LOU REQUIRES, IN RELEVANT PART (1)

SUSPENSION OF THE EU

HEXAVAC

LICENSE; (2) SUSPENSION OF

HEXAVAC

DISTRIBUTION; (3) A RECALL OF

HEXAVAC

PRODUCT IN THE EU; (4) A RECALL OF

HEXAVAC

IN A NUMBER OF NON-EU COUNTRIES; AND (5) A

SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM AND POSSIBLE FUTURE REVACCINATION. SPMSD, WHICH MARKETS AND SELLS

HEXAVAC

IN

PART OF THE EU, HAS NOTIFIED MERCK THAT IT IS RESERVING ANY RIGHTS THAT IT MAY HAVE TO SEEK DAMAGES

FROM MERCK AND TO BE DEFENDED, INDEMNIFIED AND HELD HARMLESS BY MERCK IN THE EVENT OF THIRD PARTY

CLAIMS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE EMEA ALSO INITIATED A FORMAL REVIEW OF THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE

HEPATITIS B VACCINE,

HBVAXPRO

, AND OF THE HEPATITIS B COMPONENT OF THE HEPATITIS B/HIB COMBINATION

VACCINE,

PROCOMVAX

. BOTH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED AND SOLD BY SPMSD IN ITS EUROPEAN TERRITORY, AND

ARE SOLD ELSEWHERE, UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES, BY MERCK. AN ASSESSMENT REPORT PREPARED FOR THE CHMP AND MERCKS RESPONSE WERE CONSIDERED AT A

CHMP MEETING IN FEBRUARY 2006. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CHMP WILL CONCLUDE ITS REVIEW IN APRIL

2006.

IN 1997, THE COMPANY AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW SANOFI-AVENTIS S.A.) COMBINED THEIR

RESPECTIVE ANIMAL HEALTH AND POULTRY GENETICS BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A FULLY

INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH

PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE THE

HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL SPECIES.

MERIAL DIVESTED ITS ENTIRE POULTRY

GENETICS BUSINESS IN THREE SEGMENTS. THE DOMESTIC TURKEY AND LAYER SEGMENTS WERE DIVESTED IN 2004

AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE BROILER AND FOREIGN TURKEY SEGMENTS WERE SOLD IN 2005.

COMPETITION

3⁄4

THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED

ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST

CONTAINMENT CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

SUCH COMPETITION INVOLVES AN INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO

MARKET THESE INNOVATIONS EFFECTIVELY. WITH ITS LONG-STANDING EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

THE COMPANY IS WELL PREPARED TO COMPETE IN THE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES TO MEET COMPETITION INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL, FLEXIBILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS,

AN EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND A STRONG TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVE

IN ACQUIRING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND LICENSES AND HAS BEEN REFINING ITS

SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS TO FURTHER ADDRESS CHANGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS. TO ENHANCE ITS

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE EXTERNAL ALLIANCES, FROM EARLY-STAGE TO

LATE-STAGE PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES AND TARGETED ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES BY COMPETITORS MAY RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS AND

PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS, EVEN FOR PRODUCTS PROTECTED BY PATENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS

AVAILABLE TO TREAT DISEASES TYPICALLY INCREASES OVER TIME AND HAS RESULTED IN SLOWING THE GROWTH IN

SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HUMAN

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, ALLOWS, ENCOURAGES OR, IN A FEW INSTANCES, IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC

INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN, MANDATES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS (THOSE

CONTAINING THE SAME ACTIVE CHEMICAL AS AN INNOVATORS PRODUCT) RATHER THAN BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS.

GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER PRESSURES TOWARD THE DISPENSING OF GENERIC PRODUCTS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCED THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY PATENTS, SUCH AS

VASOTEC

AND

VASERETIC

(ENALAPRIL MALEATE IN COMBINATION WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)

,

THE U.S. RIGHTS

TO WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD. IN ADDITION,

ZOCOR

HAS LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES IN THOSE

COUNTRIES.

DISTRIBUTION

3⁄4

THE COMPANY SELLS ITS HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS

AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS

HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. VACCINES ARE ALSO SOLD DIRECTLY TO

PHYSICIANS. THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES

AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FOR U.S.

WHOLESALERS TO MODERATE THE FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES CAUSED BY WHOLESALER INVESTMENT BUYING AND

IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF COMPANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE NEW PROGRAM

LOWERED PREVIOUS LIMITS ON AVERAGE MONTHLY PURCHASES OF COMPANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY U.S.

CUSTOMERS. FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM, FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES CAUSED BY WHOLESALER

INVESTMENT BUYING SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATED.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE AND ARE NORMALLY AVAILABLE IN QUANTITIES ADEQUATE TO MEET THE

NEEDS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND INVESTIGATION

3⁄4

THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO

GLOBAL REGULATION BY REGIONAL, COUNTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE

FDA IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY,

EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY

CASES, THE FDA REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW

PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 1997, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

MODERNIZATION ACT (THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT) WAS PASSED AND WAS THE CULMINATION OF A

COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE REFORM EFFORT DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE REGULATORY PROCEDURES WITHIN THE FDA

AND TO IMPROVE THE REGULATION OF DRUGS, MEDICAL DEVICES AND FOOD. THE LEGISLATION WAS PRINCIPALLY

DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE TIMELY AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS BY EXPEDITING

THE PREMARKET REVIEW PROCESS FOR NEW PRODUCTS. A KEY PROVISION OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE

RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT OF 1992, WHICH PERMITS THE CONTINUED

COLLECTION OF USER FEES FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO AUGMENT FDA RESOURCES EARMARKED FOR

THE REVIEW OF HUMAN DRUG APPLICATIONS. THIS HELPS PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE

PROMPT APPROVAL OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NEW DRUGS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER

2003. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THIS NEW BENEFIT SUPPORTS THE

COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE PRESERVING

MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BENEFIT WILL ENSURE

THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND BY ENCOURAGING THE

APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES. IN ADDRESSING COST-CONTAINMENT PRESSURE, THE COMPANY HAS MADE A CONTINUING EFFORT TO

DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP SAVE COSTS IN OVERALL PATIENT HEALTH CARE.

FOR MANY YEARS, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE OVERSIGHT WITH

THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR NEW DRUGS, DRUG SAFETY, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, DRUG PURCHASING AND

REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND FORMULARIES VARIOUSLY UNDER REVIEW. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL

CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW DRUGS TO THE

MARKET, IN THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. ONE TYPE OF FEDERAL INITIATIVE TO CONTAIN FEDERAL HEALTH

CARE SPENDING IS THE PROSPECTIVE OR CAPITATED PAYMENT SYSTEM, FIRST IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE THE

RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS. SUCH A SYSTEM ESTABLISHES IN ADVANCE A FLAT

RATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE PATIENTS FOR WHOM THE PAYOR IS FISCALLY

RESPONSIBLE. THIS TYPE OF PAYMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER COST CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS ARE NOW WIDELY USED BY

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYORS AND HAVE CAUSED HOSPITALS, HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER

CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY TO BE MORE COST-CONSCIOUS IN THEIR TREATMENT DECISIONS, INCLUDING

DECISIONS REGARDING THE MEDICINES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR PATIENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO

WORK WITH PRIVATE AND FEDERAL EMPLOYERS TO SLOW INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. FURTHER, THE

COMPANYS EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP SAVE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HAVE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF THE COMPANYS MEDICINES AND

HAVE HELPED OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

ALSO, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED METHODS TO DIRECTLY REDUCE THE COST OF DRUGS

AND VACCINES FOR WHICH THEY PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PAY SPECIFIED

REBATES FOR MEDICINES REIMBURSED BY MEDICAID, TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR OUTPATIENT MEDICINES

PURCHASED BY CERTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ENTITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS

(HOSPITALS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA), AND TO PROVIDE MINIMUM DISCOUNTS OF 24% OFF OF A DEFINED

NON-FEDERAL AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR PURCHASES BY CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

INITIATIVES IN SOME STATES SEEK REBATES BEYOND THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY MEDICAID LEGISLATION,

IN SOME CASES FOR PATIENTS BEYOND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. UNDER THE FEDERAL VACCINES

FOR CHILDREN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM, THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) FUNDS

AND PURCHASES RECOMMENDED PEDIATRIC VACCINES AT A PUBLIC SECTOR PRICE FOR THE IMMUNIZATION OF

MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE, UNINSURED, NATIVE AMERICAN AND CERTAIN UNDERINSURED CHILDREN. THE COMPANY WAS

AWARDED A CDC CONTRACT IN 2005 FOR THE SUPPLY OF $340 MILLION OF PEDIATRIC VACCINES FOR THE

VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID

WHO ARE ALSO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES (65 YEARS AND OLDER OR DISABLED) WILL LEAVE THE

STATE-ADMINISTERED MEDICAID SYSTEM TO BE COVERED BY THE NEW MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ENCOUNTERS SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN

MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT DOES BUSINESS. THERE, TOO, THE PRIMARY THRUST OF GOVERNMENTAL

INQUIRY AND ACTION IS TOWARD DETERMINING DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS, OFTEN WITH MECHANISMS FOR

CONTROLLING THE PRICES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE PROFITS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES. THE

EU HAS ADOPTED DIRECTIVES CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION, LABELING, ADVERTISING, WHOLESALE

DISTRIBUTION AND APPROVAL FOR MARKETING OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE. THE COMPANYS

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE ALREADY CONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE DIRECTIVES;

CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND IS, THEREFORE,

SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS AND

OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY ON ITS OWN MAY DEEM

IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, RECOGNIZING THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE

RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY, ARE

WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON PROPOSALS TO COMPLETE THE

SINGLE MARKET IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS

INCLUDING MARKET DEREGULATION.

THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU, GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED

LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY INITIATIVES REGARDING PRIVACY, INCLUDING FEDERAL PRIVACY REGULATIONS AND RECENTLY

ENACTED STATE PRIVACY LAWS CONCERNING HEALTH AND OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, WHICH HAVE AFFECTED

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

3⁄4

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO

BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS. PATENTS MAY COVER PRODUCTS

PER SE

, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS,

PROCESSES FOR OR INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE USES OF PRODUCTS.

PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTENDS FOR VARYING PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DATE OF GRANT

AND THE LEGAL LIFE OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE PROTECTION AFFORDED, WHICH MAY ALSO

VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT AND ITS SCOPE OF COVERAGE.

PATENT PORTFOLIOS DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY. BASIC PATENTS ARE IN EFFECT FOR THE FOLLOWING MAJOR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES.

CANCIDAS, COMVAX

LICENSE FROM THE COMPANY, SELLS

SUSTIVA

IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND CERTAIN EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY MARKETS

STOCRIN

IN OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE BASIC PATENT

FOR

AGGRASTAT

(TIROFIBAN HYDROCHLORIDE) IN THE UNITED STATES WAS DIVESTED WITH THE PRODUCT IN 2003.

THE COMPANY RETAINS BASIC PATENTS FOR

AGGRASTAT

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT INCLUDES A PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE AN

ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INDICATIONS OF NEW OR

CURRENTLY MARKETED DRUGS IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON PEDIATRIC STUDIES ARE COMPLETED BY THE APPLICANT.

THESE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS WERE RE-AUTHORIZED UNTIL OCTOBER 1, 2007 BY THE BEST PHARMACEUTICALS

FOR CHILDREN ACT PASSED IN JANUARY 2002. IN 2005, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

INVANZ

UNTIL AUGUST 2013. IN 2004, THE FDA GRANTED AN

ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

TRUSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008. IN

2002, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

COZAAR/HYZAAR

UNTIL FEBRUARY 2010. IN 2005, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

SINGULAIR

UNTIL

AUGUST 2012. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE

COMPANYS PATENTS, SEE PATENT LITIGATION ON

PAGE 31.

WHILE THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT NORMALLY RESULTS IN A LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

THE COVERED PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, COMMERCIAL BENEFITS MAY CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED FROM: (I)

LATER-GRANTED PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES RELATED TO THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF

MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF SUCH PRODUCT; (II) PATENTS RELATING TO THE USE OF SUCH

PRODUCT; (III) PATENTS RELATING TO NOVEL COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS; AND (IV) IN THE UNITED

STATES, MARKET EXCLUSIVITY THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW. THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT

EXPIRATION ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON MANY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE NATURE OF

THE MARKET AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT, THE GROWTH OF THE MARKET, THE COMPLEXITIES AND

ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF THE PRODUCT AND THE

REQUIREMENTS OF NEW DRUG PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT OR SIMILAR LAWS AND

REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

ADDITIONS TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH

ALL RELEVANT LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS INCREASING PATENT LIFE. SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INCREASES IN

PATENT LIFE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GENERAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF, INCENTIVES FOR AND

USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS ARE SOUGHT IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH REFORM OF PATENT AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

IN JUNE 2006,

ZOCOR

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANY

EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S.

ZOCOR

SALES AFTER THAT TIME.

IN JUNE 2006, THE BASIC PATENT IN THE UNITED STATES COVERING

PROSCAR

WILL EXPIRE. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S.

PROSCAR

SALES AFTER THAT TIME. THE BASIC

PATENT FOR

PROSCAR

ALSO COVERS

PROPECIA;

HOWEVER,

PROPECIA

IS PROTECTED BY ADDITIONAL PATENTS WHICH

EXPIRE IN OCTOBER 2013.

IN 2003, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES

TO

FOSAMAX

UNTIL FEBRUARY 2008, AND

FOSAMAX

ONCE WEEKLY UNTIL JANUARY 2019. HOWEVER, ON JANUARY

28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS

PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL

OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL

LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S.

FOSAMAX

SALES AFTER THAT TIME.

WORLDWIDE, ALL OF THE COMPANYS IMPORTANT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD UNDER TRADEMARKS THAT ARE

CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME

COUNTRIES AS LONG AS USED; IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS LONG AS REGISTERED. REGISTRATION IS FOR FIXED

TERMS AND CAN BE RENEWED INDEFINITELY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW USES FOR

EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH A STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY 12,400 PEOPLE

ARE EMPLOYED IN THE COMPANYS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. EXPENDITURES FOR THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WERE $3.8 BILLION IN 2005, $4.0 BILLION IN 2004 AND $3.2 BILLION IN 2003 AND

ARE ESTIMATED TO CONTINUE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THE FULL-YEAR 2005 EXPENSE IN 2006. THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS ITS ONGOING COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH OVER A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS AND CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF NEW PRODUCTS. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PERIOD 1996 THROUGH 2005

EXCEEDED $25.6 BILLION WITH A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 11%.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN

BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. MERCKS

NEW R&D

MODEL IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS BY

PRIORITIZING THE COMPANYS R&D RESOURCES ON NINE PRIORITY DISEASE AREAS  ALZHEIMERS DISEASE,

ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, NOVEL VACCINES, OBESITY, ONCOLOGY, PAIN AND

SLEEP DISORDERS. THESE THERAPEUTIC AREAS WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN BASED ON A SET OF CRITERIA

INCLUDING UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. WITHIN THESE

THERAPEUTIC AREAS, MERCK WILL COMMIT RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE RESEARCH BREADTH AND DEPTH AND TO DEVELOP

BEST-IN-CLASS TARGETED AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT ARE VALUED HIGHLY BY PATIENTS, PAYERS AND

PHYSICIANS.

THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MAKE FOCUSED INVESTMENTS TO PURSUE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS IN THE FOLLOWING

SELECTED DISEASE AREAS: ANTIBIOTICS, ANTIFUNGALS, ANTIVIRALS (HEPATITIS C VIRUS, HUMAN

IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS), ASTHMA, CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE, NEURODEGENERATION,

OPHTHALMOLOGY, OSTEOPOROSIS, SCHIZOPHRENIA AND STROKE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL CAPITALIZE ON

SELECTED OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE THESE AREAS BY CONTINUING TO COMMERCIALIZE ATTRACTIVE CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT CANDIDATES IN THE PIPELINE AND BY PURSUING APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL LICENSING

OPPORTUNITIES.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS, INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES AND MOST FOREIGN COUNTRIES PROVIDE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVENESS AND

SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THROUGH PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CONTROLLED CLINICAL EVALUATION.

BEFORE A NEW DRUG MAY BE MARKETED IN THE

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITED STATES, RECORDED DATA ON PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL

EXPERIENCE ARE INCLUDED IN THE NDA OR THE BLA TO THE FDA

FOR THE REQUIRED APPROVAL. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS COVERING SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

ONCE THE COMPANYS SCIENTISTS DISCOVER A NEW COMPOUND THAT THEY BELIEVE HAS PROMISE TO TREAT A

MEDICAL CONDITION, THE COMPANY COMMENCES PRECLINICAL TESTING WITH THAT COMPOUND. PRECLINICAL

TESTING INCLUDES LABORATORY TESTING AND ANIMAL SAFETY STUDIES TO GATHER DATA ON CHEMISTRY,

PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY. PENDING ACCEPTABLE PRECLINICAL DATA, THE COMPANY WILL INITIATE

CLINICAL TESTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ESTABLISHED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE CLINICAL TESTING

BEGINS WITH PHASE I STUDIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ASSESS SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, PHARMACOKINETICS,

AND PRELIMINARY PHARMACODYNAMIC ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUND IN HUMANS. IF FAVORABLE, ADDITIONAL,

LARGER PHASE II STUDIES ARE INITIATED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THE COMPOUND IN THE AFFECTED

POPULATION, DEFINE APPROPRIATE DOSING FOR THE COMPOUND, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS

THAT COULD LIMIT THE COMPOUNDS USEFULNESS. IF THE RESULTS FROM THE PHASE II TRIALS ARE

SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY COMMENCES LARGE-SCALE PHASE III TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE COMPOUNDS EFFICACY

AND SAFETY. UPON COMPLETION OF THOSE TRIALS, IF SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY SUBMITS REGULATORY

FILINGS WITH THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD TO HAVE THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE

APPROVED FOR MARKETING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A COMPOUND THAT IS THE RESULT OF ANY

PARTICULAR PROGRAM WILL OBTAIN THE REGULATORY APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE MARKETED.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS BEGINS ONCE A COMPLETE NDA IS SUBMITTED AND

RECEIVED BY THE FDA. PURSUANT TO THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT, THE FDA REVIEW PERIOD TARGETS

FOR NDAS OR SUPPLEMENTAL NDAS IS EITHER SIX MONTHS, FOR PRIORITY REVIEW, OR TEN MONTHS, FOR A

STANDARD REVIEW. WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF AN NDA, THE FDA DETERMINES IF THE APPLICATION IS

SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE TO PERMIT A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW. THE FDA ALSO ASSESSES, AT THAT TIME, WHETHER

THE APPLICATION WILL BE GRANTED A PRIORITY REVIEW OR STANDARD REVIEW. ONCE THE REVIEW TIMELINES

ARE DEFINED, THE FDA WILL ACT UPON THE APPLICATION WITHIN THOSE TIMELINES, UNLESS A MAJOR AMENDMENT

HAS BEEN SUBMITTED (EITHER AT THE COMPANYS OWN INITIATIVE OR THE FDAS REQUEST) TO THE PENDING

APPLICATION. IF THIS OCCURS, THE FDA MAY EXTEND THE REVIEW PERIOD TO ALLOW FOR REVIEW OF THE NEW

INFORMATION, BUT BY NO MORE THAN 180 DAYS. EXTENSIONS TO THE REVIEW PERIOD ARE COMMUNICATED TO THE

COMPANY. BASED ON FDA STATISTICS, DRUG DEVELOPMENT TIME FROM INITIATION OF PRECLINICAL TESTING TO

NDA APPROVAL CAN RANGE FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 8.5 YEARS.

IN

JUNE 2005, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW THE BLA FOR

ZOSTAVAX,

MERCKS INVESTIGATIONAL VACCINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF HERPES ZOSTER, COMMONLY KNOWN

AS SHINGLES IN ADULTS 60 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. SANOFI PASTEUR MSD HAS SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION

FOR LICENSURE OF

ZOSTAVAX

IN THE

EU, AND MERCK HAS ALSO SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE OF

ZOSTAVAX

IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND IN

COUNTRIES IN ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA. IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE FDA

EXTENDED ITS REVIEW OF

ZOSTAVAX

BY THREE

MONTHS UNTIL LATE MAY.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, MERCK PRESENTED TWO STUDIES OF PHASE II DATA ON THE COMPANYS DPP-4

INHIBITOR,

JANUVIA,

THE PROPOSED TRADEMARK FOR MK-0431 (SITAGLIPTIN), A POTENTIAL NEW APPROACH IN

THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, AT THE 41

ST

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION

FOR THE STUDY OF DIABETES. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2006, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE NDA FOR

JANUVIA

WAS

ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW BY THE FDA. MERCK EXPECTS FDA ACTION ON THE NDA BY MID-OCTOBER 2006.

IN DECEMBER 2005, MERCK SUBMITTED A BLA TO THE FDA FOR

GARDASIL

[QUADRIVALENT HUMAN

PAPILLOMAVIRUS (TYPES 6, 11, 16, 18) RECOMBINANT VACCINE]

,

THE COMPANYS VACCINE TO PROTECT AGAINST

FOUR TYPES OF HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV): TYPES 16 AND 18, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR AN ESTIMATED 70% OF

CERVICAL CANCER CASES, AND TYPES 6 AND 11, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR AN ESTIMATED 90% OF GENITAL WARTS

CASES. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE FDA ACCEPTED THE BLA FOR

GARDASIL

AND THAT

THE INVESTIGATIONAL CERVICAL CANCER VACCINE WILL BE GIVEN PRIORITY REVIEW BY THE AGENCY. A

PRIORITY DESIGNATION IS INTENDED FOR PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. UNDER THE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT, FOR BLAS FILED IN 2005, THE FDAS GOAL IS TO REVIEW AND ACT ON BLAS

DESIGNATED AS PRIORITY REVIEW WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF RECEIPT. THE FDA HAS INFORMED MERCK THAT THE

REVIEW GOAL DATE IS JUNE 8, 2006. SINCE THE SUBMISSION TO THE FDA IN DECEMBER, MERCK HAS ALSO

SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS FOR

GARDASIL

TO

CALLED AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE.

IN JULY 2005, MERCK AND GERON CORPORATION ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP A CANCER VACCINE

AGAINST TELOMERASE. TELOMERASE IS AN ENZYME, ACTIVE IN MOST CANCER CELLS, THAT MAINTAINS TELOMERE

LENGTH AT THE ENDS OF CHROMOSOMES. THIS ACTIVITY ALLOWS THE CANCER TO GROW AND METASTASIZE OVER

LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005,

FOXHOLLOW TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND MERCK ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A NOVEL

PHARMACOGENOMICS COLLABORATION. THE COLLABORATION WILL FOCUS ON ANALYZING ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE

REMOVED FROM PATIENT ARTERIES AS A MEANS OF IDENTIFYING NEW BIOMARKERS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE

THE COMPANY AND BMS REPORTED IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT THE FDA ISSUED AN APPROVABLE LETTER FOR

PARGLUVA

, BMSS INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL MEDICINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES. THE FDA

REQUESTED ADDITIONAL SAFETY INFORMATION FROM ONGOING TRIALS, OR THOSE COMPLETED SINCE THE SAFETY

DATA FROM THE LAST FORMAL REGULATORY SUBMISSION, TO ADDRESS MORE FULLY THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY

PROFILE OF

PARGLUVA

. THIS DATA REQUIREMENT MAY CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE PRODUCTS LAUNCH.

AS A RESULT, BMS AND THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT FOR

EMPLOYEES

AT THE END OF 2005, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 61,500 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE, WITH

APPROXIMATELY 31,900 EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF

WORLDWIDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY ARE REPRESENTED BY VARIOUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS.

AS PART OF A COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER 2003 AND COMPLETED AT THE END OF

2004, THE COMPANY HAD ELIMINATED 5,100 POSITIONS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN 2005

WITH 900 POSITIONS BEING ELIMINATED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2005.

ON NOVEMBER 28, 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST PHASE OF A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS.

THE INITIAL STEPS WILL INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK

MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND

CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

AS A RESULT, MERCK WILL INCUR CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES. AS

PART OF THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,000

POSITIONS IN MANUFACTURING AND OTHER DIVISIONS WORLDWIDE, REPRESENTING ABOUT 11% OF ITS GLOBAL WORK

FORCE, BY THE END OF 2008. ABOUT HALF OF THE POSITION REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE

UNITED STATES, WITH THE REMAINDER IN OTHER COUNTRIES. MERCK INTENDS TO SELL OR CLOSE FIVE OF ITS

31 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WORLDWIDE AND TO REDUCE OPERATIONS AT A NUMBER OF OTHER SITES. THE

COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS TO CLOSE ONE BASIC RESEARCH SITE AND TWO PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT SITES. THE

SITES IDENTIFIED FOR CLOSURE ARE EXPECTED TO BE CLOSED BY THE END OF 2008, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE

WITH LEGAL OBLIGATIONS.

THE PRETAX COSTS OF THE RESTRUCTURING WERE $401.2 MILLION IN 2005 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE $800

MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN 2006. THROUGH THE END OF 2008, WHEN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS OF THE RESTRUCTURING

ACTIVITIES ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2005 ARE EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $1.8 BILLION TO $2.2 BILLION.

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH, RELATING PRIMARILY TO ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION FOR THOSE FACILITIES SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN 2005, THE COMPANY INCURRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF

APPROXIMATELY $35.5 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FACILITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO

REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS

SITES. EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $31.3 MILLION IN 2005, AND

ARE ESTIMATED AT $53.5 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2006 THROUGH 2010. THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT CONSIDER

POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN

IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS, AND IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS WHICH ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN ACCRUED. ALTHOUGH IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR THE

ULTIMATE COSTS OF REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY POSSIBLE

EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THOSE PROVIDED SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY MANAGED ON A PRODUCTS BASIS WITH ONE REPORTABLE

SEGMENT: THE MERCK PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT WHICH INCLUDES PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY OR

THROUGH JOINT VENTURES. MERCK PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC AND PREVENTIVE

AGENTS, SOLD BY PRESCRIPTION, FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF HUMAN DISORDERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH

SUBSIDIARIES. SALES WORLDWIDE BY SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE 42% OF SALES IN 2005,

41% OF SALES IN 2004 AND 41% OF SALES IN 2003.

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ABROAD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REGARD THESE RISKS AS A

DETERRENT TO FURTHER EXPANSION OF ITS OPERATIONS ABROAD. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CLOSELY REVIEWS ITS

METHODS OF OPERATIONS AND ADOPTS STRATEGIES RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPANDING ITS OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN

AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, EASTERN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC WHERE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT

POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO EARN FAIR RETURNS.

BUSINESS IN THESE DEVELOPING AREAS, WHILE SOMETIMES LESS STABLE, OFFERS IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

GROWTH OVER TIME.

THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004,

THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN

MEDICATION, FROM THE MARKET WORLDWIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

APPROXIMATELY 9,650 PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 19,100 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING

FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX,

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF

VIOXX.

(ALL

OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE

COMPANY MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS) AND THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

ERISA

LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED DERIVATIVE SUITS AND ONE SHAREHOLDER

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HAS FILED A DEMAND ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD MEMBERS

AND COMPANY OFFICERS. (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS). THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS). THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN SUED BY FOUR STATES WITH

RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS RELATING TO

VIOXX

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE FUTURE.

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANY CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ISSUED A SUBPOENA REQUESTING

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING

INVESTIGATIONS BY CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. A GROUP OF

ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM THIRTY-ONE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE CONDUCTING AN

INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS SALES AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH

AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. (ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY CAN NOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS;

HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

THREE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE U.S. HAVE GONE TO TRIAL AND RESULTED IN

JURY VERDICTS.

ON AUGUST 19, 2005, IN A TRIAL IN STATE COURT IN TEXAS, THE JURY IN ERNST VS. MERCK REACHED A

VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF AND PURPORTED TO AWARD HER A TOTAL OF $253 MILLION IN

COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. UNDER TEXAS LAW, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT COULD BE AWARDED TO

THE PLAINTIFF IS CAPPED AT APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO APPEAL THIS VERDICT

AFTER THE COMPLETION OF POST-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS STRONG

POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL. SINCE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR AN UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOME IS NOT PROBABLE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A RESERVE WITH RESPECT TO THE VERDICT.

ON NOVEMBER 3, 2005, IN THE SECOND

VIOXX

PERSONAL INJURY CASE TO GO TO TRIAL, FREDERICK AND

MARY JACKSON HUMESTON VS. MERCK & CO., INC., IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, LAW DIVISION,

ATLANTIC COUNTY, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY ON ALL COUNTS. THE JURY FOUND,

BY AN 8 TO 1 VOTE, THAT THE COMPANY DID NOT FAIL TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE WARNING TO PRESCRIBING

PHYSICIANS OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN

VIOXX

AND AN INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

PRIOR TO MR. HUMESTONS HEART ATTACK. THE JURY ALSO UNANIMOUSLY FOUND THAT THE COMPANY DID NOT

VIOLATE THE NEW JERSEY CONSUMER FRAUD ACT IN MARKETING THE DRUG TO PRESCRIBING PHYSICIANS.

ON FEBRUARY 17, 2006, IN A RE-TRIAL OF A CASE IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS BROUGHT BY

EVELYN IRVIN PLUNKETT, ON BEHALF OF HER LATE HUSBAND, RICHARD IRVIN, JR., WHO DIED FROM AN APPARENT

HEART ATTACK, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS.

THE

OUTCOMES OF THESE FIRST

THREE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED TO INDICATE ANY TREND

OR WHAT OUTCOME MAY BE LIKELY IN FUTURE

VIOXX

TRIALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE

TRIED IN 2006. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY TRIALS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS INSURANCE

COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSIVE COSTS AND

ANY LOSSES.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY SPENT $285 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE

RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION).

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $295 MILLION TO INCREASE THE

RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION FROM $675 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 TO $685 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT

THE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2007.

THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO

PAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. THESE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS, ARE CURRENTLY AT A VERY EARLY STAGE AND THE COMPANY HAS VERY LITTLE

INFORMATION AS TO THE COURSE THEY WILL TAKE. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE

OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS

TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING

IN THE PAYMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES, COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE

AND, WHEN THAT OCCURS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS

PRODUCTS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAVE

RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY

FACES STRONG COMPETITION FROM LOWER PRICE GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO A RAPID LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED

GENERIC VERSIONS OF THAT DRUG BECOME AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE

SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPANYS SALES, THE LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN 2003,

ZOCOR,

THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL AND CURRENTLY ITS LARGEST

REVENUE-PRODUCING PRODUCT, LOST ITS BASIC PATENT PROTECTION IN CANADA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN

EUROPE, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY, AND THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AS THE RESULT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF A GENERIC VERSION. WORLDWIDE SALES

OF

ZOCOR

WERE $4.4 BILLION IN 2005, COMPARED TO $5.2 BILLION IN 2004. IN JUNE 2006,

ZOCOR

WILL

LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES AFTER THAT TIME.

IN AUGUST 2004, THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE RENDERED A DECISION TO

REVOKE THE COMPANYS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. THAT

DECISION HAS BEEN APPEALED AND A HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 14 AND 15. DECISIONS IN SUCH

PROCEEDINGS ARE TYPICALLY RENDERED AT THE END OF THE HEARING. IF THE DECISION IS UPHELD, THE

COMPANY WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

FOSAMAX

IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS AFTER

2007. MOREOVER, MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE USE OF ALENDRONATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN

SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IF THE COMPANY IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN THOSE COUNTRIES THE COMPANY COULD

LOSE EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS TO FOSAMAX BEFORE 2007 IN SUCH COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY WOULD EXPECT A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EUROPEAN SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AFTER LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN 2005 HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF

GENERIC PRODUCTS IN SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND GERMANY. NONETHELESS,

GLOBAL SALES OF

FOSAMAX

GREW 1% IN 2005 TO $3.2 BILLION, AS A RESULT OF STRONG SALES IN THE UNITED

STATES.

ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE

COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS

DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008, AND THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

FOSAMAX

SALES AFTER THAT TIME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY

SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS IN

OTHER WAYS; IN CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS

THAT HAVE LOST PATENT PROTECTION.

LIKE OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST

CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS EACH YEAR. DECLINES IN SALES OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

MEAN THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NEW

PRODUCTS WHICH IT DEVELOPS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH

LICENSE OR ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMPANY COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT, FUNDS AND

OTHER RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES, AND THROUGH

VARIOUS COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THE

COMPANY MUST MAKE ONGOING, SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFORTS IT IS

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN A COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO COMMIT SUBSTANTIAL

EFFORTS, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGH QUALITY SCIENTISTS AND OTHER

PERSONNEL WITH PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE.

BASED ON FDA STATISTICS, DRUG DEVELOPMENT TIME FROM INITIATION OF PRECLINICAL TESTING TO NDA

APPROVAL CAN RANGE FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 8.5 YEARS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, SEE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. EACH PHASE OF TESTING IS HIGHLY

REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER

SERIOUS OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANY MAY ABANDON A PRODUCT

IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY. SOME OF THE RISKS ENCOUNTERED IN

THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND

MAY YIELD DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG

MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE APPROVED BY THE FDA

FOR ITS INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A NEW DRUG; OR SALES OF A NEW

PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

THE COMPANY CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER

DEVELOPMENT WILL BE LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE

COMPOUNDS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE LAUNCHED, WILL BE

COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS

AND SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER

ITS SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS PROFITABLE

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

, LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING PRODUCTS

OR THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS THE

COMPANY OBTAINS AND MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING ITS PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA IS OF

PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY, AS IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING,

APPROVAL, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION

PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY

CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION TO

REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, TO DELAY OR WITHHOLD REGISTRATION AND MARKETING APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE

PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET

ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE OBTAINED, THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE

APPROVAL IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL, SIGNIFICANT

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL

PROCESS, OR ITS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM SELLING THE

NEW PRODUCTS IN THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS OBTAINED, IF EVER. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE

ABLE TO REALIZE REVENUES FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT DOES NOT HAVE

APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR

CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE

COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN

MARKETS. PATENTS COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY,

WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SEEKS

PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS

AND WHERE MEANINGFUL PATENT PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES MAY

CHALLENGE OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT

FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TO DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO ITS

PATENTS OR INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS

ITS IMPORTANT PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION. IN PARTICULAR,

MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG

APPLICATIONS (ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY NORMALLY RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY

DEFENDING ITS PATENT, INCLUDING BY FILING LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT LITIGATION

AND OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS ARE COSTLY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE THE

COMPANY OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES, THIRD PARTY PATENTS MAY

PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING AND SELLING A PRODUCT IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

BECOMING AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST

SALES UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE

PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN

SOME COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN IN THE

UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICAL PRESSURES TO REDUCE SPENDING ON

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO LEGISLATION WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF

GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES,

REDUCING THE COMPANYS SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR THE

COMPANYS DRUGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION,

PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR LEGISLATION TO

FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND RAPID APPROVAL OF GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED

INTO LAW COULD WORSEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION

MAY INCREASE AS NEW PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE

SAFER OR MORE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFECTIVE OR MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION, THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS

WHICH ARE SOLD AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, IF THE

COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

ITS BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE

COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS, WILL, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS,

PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO

NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO ADDRESS THE

COMPANYS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT

POTENTIAL, AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH STATEMENT AND SHOULD

UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF

OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE NOT. NO

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY. THE

COMPANY CAUTIONS YOU NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AS THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION.



INCREASED BRAND COMPETITION IN THERAPEUTIC AREAS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.



THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS

OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A CANDIDATE CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE

LATE-STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING

IN DEVELOPMENT BUT FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS, THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN NECESSARY

REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE AND/OR THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL

TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.



PRICING PRESSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, INCLUDING RULES AND PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS, JUDICIAL

DECISIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM, PHARMACEUTICAL

REIMBURSEMENT AND PRICING IN GENERAL.

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, FEDERAL AND STATE PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS INVOLVING INDIVIDUAL

CLAIMS, AS WELL AS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS, HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SERVED OR IS AWARE THAT IT HAS BEEN NAMED

AS A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 9,650 LAWSUITS, WHICH INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 19,100 PLAINTIFF

GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

. OF THESE LAWSUITS,

APPROXIMATELY 4,350 LAWSUITS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 12,075 PLAINTIFF GROUPS ARE OR ARE SLATED

TO BE IN THE FEDERAL MDL (DISCUSSED BELOW) AND APPROXIMATELY 4,200 LAWSUITS REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 4,200 PLAINTIFF GROUPS ARE INCLUDED IN A COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW JERSEY

SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE CAROL E. HIGBEE. CERTAIN OF THESE LAWSUITS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS

REGARDING GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING, CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, THROMBOTIC EVENTS OR KIDNEY DAMAGE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 190 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES OR SEEKING (I) MEDICAL MONITORING AS A RESULT OF THE PUTATIVE CLASS

MEMBERS USE OF

VIOXX

, (II) DISGORGEMENT OF CERTAIN PROFITS UNDER COMMON LAW UNJUST ENRICHMENT

THEORIES, AND/OR (III) VARIOUS REMEDIES UNDER STATE CONSUMER FRAUD AND FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE

STATUTES, INCLUDING RECOVERING THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED BY INDIVIDUALS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS

SUCH AS UNION HEALTH PLANS (ALL OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE COLLECTIVELY

REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS). THE ACTIONS FILED IN THE STATE COURTS OF

CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, NEW JERSEY, AND PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO A SINGLE JUDGE IN EACH STATE FOR COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS.

ON FEBRUARY 16, 2005, THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (THE JPML)

TRANSFERRED ALL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS NATIONWIDE INTO ONE

MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (MDL) FOR COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE MDL HAS BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA BEFORE

DISTRICT JUDGE ELDON E. FALLON.

JUDGE FALLON HAS INDICATED THAT HE INTENDS TO TRY A SERIES OF CASES DURING THE PERIOD

NOVEMBER 2005 THROUGH 2006, IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: (I) HEART ATTACK WITH SHORT TERM USE;

(II) HEART ATTACK WITH LONG TERM USE; (III) STROKE; AND (IV) CARDIOVASCULAR INJURY INVOLVING A

PRESCRIPTION WRITTEN AFTER APRIL 2002 WHEN THE LABELING FOR

VIOXX

WAS REVISED TO INCLUDE THE

RESULTS OF THE VIGOR TRIAL. IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2005, THE CASE BROUGHT BY EVELYN IRVIN

PLUNKETT, ON BEHALF OF HER LATE HUSBAND RICHARD IRVIN, JR., WHO DIED FROM AN APPARENT HEART

ATTACK, WAS TRIED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. PLAINTIFF ALLEGED THAT MR. IRVIN TOOK

VIOXX

FOR

APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH AND, THUS, THE ACTION FELL WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF HEART ATTACK WITH SHORT

TERM USE. AFTER DELIBERATING FOR TWO AND ONE-HALF DAYS, THE COURT FOUND THAT THE JURY WAS

DEADLOCKED AND DECLARED A MISTRIAL. FEDERAL COURT RULES REQUIRE A UNANIMOUS VERDICT. THE

RETRIAL OF THE CASE COMMENCED ON FEBRUARY 6, 2006 IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA. ON FEBRUARY 17, THE

JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS.

THE NEXT SCHEDULED MDL TRIAL IS DIAZ V. MERCK, A CASE IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS CLAIM A HEART

ATTACK WITH LONG TERM USE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR JUNE (IT WAS PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED FOR MAY). IN

ADDITION TO THE DIAZ CASE AND THE GARZA CASE DISCUSSED BELOW, OTHER

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2006. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO PROVIDE A LIST OF

SUCH TRIALS AT ITS WEBSITE AT

WWW.MERCK.COM

WHICH IT WILL PERIODICALLY UPDATE AS APPROPRIATE.

MERCK HAS ENTERED INTO A TOLLING AGREEMENT (THE TOLLING AGREEMENT) WITH THE MDL

PLAINTIFFS STEERING COMMITTEE THAT ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE TO HALT THE RUNNING OF THE STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS (TOLLING) AS TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

BY NON-NEW JERSEY CITIZENS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT APPLIES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT FILED

LAWSUITS AND MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY FILE LAWSUITS AND ONLY TO THOSE CLAIMANTS WHO SEEK TO TOLL

CLAIMS ALLEGING INJURIES RESULTING FROM A THROMBOTIC CARDIOVASCULAR EVENT THAT RESULTS IN A

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION OR ISCHEMIC STROKE. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT PROVIDES COUNSEL ADDITIONAL TIME

TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL CLAIMS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT REQUIRES ANY TOLLED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN

FEDERAL COURT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY 3,800 CLAIMANTS HAD ENTERED INTO TOLLING

AGREEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 19, 2005, IN A TRIAL IN STATE COURT IN TEXAS, THE JURY IN

ERNST VS. MERCK REACHED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF AND PURPORTED TO AWARD HER A TOTAL OF

$253 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. UNDER TEXAS LAW, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT

COULD BE AWARDED TO THE PLAINTIFF IS CAPPED AT APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

APPEAL THIS VERDICT AFTER THE COMPLETION OF POST-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL AND IS HOPEFUL THAT THE APPEALS

PROCESS WILL CORRECT THE VERDICT. SINCE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR AN

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS NOT PROBABLE, IT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A RESERVE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VERDICT.

ON

NOVEMBER 3, 2005, IN THE CASE OF FREDERICK AND MARY JACKSON HUMESTON VS. MERCK, SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, LAW DIVISION, ATLANTIC COUNTY, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN

FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS. THE CASE WAS THE SECOND

VIOXX

PERSONAL INJURY CASE TO GO TO TRIAL.

MR. HUMESTON, A 60-YEAR OLD UNITED STATES POSTAL EMPLOYEE FROM IDAHO, ALLEGED THAT HE SUFFERED A

HEART ATTACK IN SEPTEMBER 2001 AS A RESULT OF TAKING

VIOXX

. HE SOUGHT COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE

DAMAGES. THE JURY FOUND, BY AN 8 TO 1 VOTE, THAT MERCK DID NOT FAIL TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE

WARNING TO PRESCRIBING PHYSICIANS OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN

VIOXX

AND AN INCREASED RISK OF

SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS PRIOR TO MR. HUMESTONS HEART ATTACK. THE JURY ALSO UNANIMOUSLY

FOUND THAT MERCK DID NOT VIOLATE THE NEW JERSEY CONSUMER FRAUD ACT IN MARKETING THE DRUG TO

PRESCRIBING PHYSICIANS.

THE TRIAL OF GARZA V. HEART CLINIC, EVANS, POSADA AND MERCK, BEGAN ON JANUARY

24, 2006, IN THE 229

TH

JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF STARR COUNTY, TEXAS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WILL SHOW THAT

VIOXX

DID NOT CAUSE THE HEART ATTACK OF LEONEL

GARZA, SR. MR. GARZA, 71, DIED OF A HEART ATTACK ON APRIL 21, 2001, FOLLOWING 23 YEARS OF

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND A PRIOR HEART ATTACK. APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH BEFORE HIS DEATH, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS THAT MR. GARZA WAS GIVEN A ONE-WEEK SUPPLY OF

VIOXX

25 MG SAMPLES FOR PAIN.

IN ADDITION, TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED TRIAL OF CONA V. MERCK AND MCDARBY V.

MERCK BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 27, 2006 IN THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR

COURT, LAW DIVISION, ATLANTIC COUNTY

BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT

VIOXX

DID NOT CAUSE EITHER

MR. MCDARBY, 77, OR MR. CONA, 59, TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

OTHER LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 29, 2005, A NEW JERSEY STATE TRIAL COURT CERTIFIED A

NATIONWIDE CLASS OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS (SUCH AS UNIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS) THAT PAID IN

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE

VIOXX

USED BY THEIR PLAN MEMBERS OR INSUREDS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF IN

THAT CASE SEEKS RECOVERY OF CERTAIN

VIOXX

PURCHASE COSTS (PLUS PENALTIES) BASED ON ALLEGATIONS

THAT THE PURPORTED CLASS MEMBERS PAID MORE FOR

VIOXX

THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY KNOWN OF THE

PRODUCTS ALLEGED RISKS. MERCK BELIEVES THAT THE CLASS WAS IMPROPERLY CERTIFIED. THE TRIAL

COURTS RULING IS PROCEDURAL ONLY; IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF PLAINTIFFS ALLEGATIONS,

WHICH THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY. THE NEW JERSEY STATE SUPERIOR COURT, APPELLATE

DIVISION, HAS ACCEPTED MERCKS APPEAL OF THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN SEPARATE LAWSUITS

BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, AND TEXAS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

ALASKA HAS ALSO RECENTLY FILED A LAWSUIT. THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPANY MISREPRESENTED

THE SAFETY OF

VIOXX

AND SEEK (I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED OR REIMBURSED BY THE

STATE AND ITS AGENCIES; (II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE STATE AND ITS AGENCIES FOR

MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS INJURED BY

VIOXX

; (III) DAMAGES UNDER VARIOUS

COMMON LAW THEORIES; AND/OR (IV) REMEDIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE STATUTORY THEORIES, INCLUDING STATE

25

CONSUMER FRAUD AND/OR FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR MEDICAID FRAUD STATUTES, INCLUDING CIVIL

PENALTIES.

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, THE COMPANY,

ALONG WITH VARIOUS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, ARE DEFENDANTS IN A

NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS FILED IN (OR REMOVED TO) FEDERAL COURT

BY SHAREHOLDERS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS), ALL OF WHICH

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED BY THE JPML, ALONG WITH RELATED LAWSUITS DISCUSSED BELOW, TO THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R. CHESLER FOR

INCLUSION IN A NATIONWIDE MDL FOR COORDINATED PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS (THE SHAREHOLDER MDL).

JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. ON JUNE 9, 2005,

PLAINTIFFS IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FILED A FOURTH CONSOLIDATED AND AMENDED CLASS ACTION

COMPLAINT SUPERSEDING PRIOR COMPLAINTS IN THE VARIOUS CASES (THE COMPLAINT). PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF PURCHASERS OF COMPANY STOCK BETWEEN MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER

29, 2004. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934,

AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF SUIT, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE

COMPLAINT ALSO ASSERTS A CLAIM UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT AGAINST

CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES OF MERCK STOCK. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES

ALLEGATIONS UNDER SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 THAT CERTAIN DEFENDANTS

MADE INCOMPLETE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES

FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERCK STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN, A DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN.

DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT, WHICH IS PENDING.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 15, 2005, A COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN OREGON STATE COURT BY

THE STATE OF OREGON THROUGH THE OREGON STATE TREASURER ON BEHALF OF THE OREGON PUBLIC EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT FUND AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THE

COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS BROUGHT UNDER OREGON SECURITIES LAW, ALLEGES THAT PLAINTIFF HAS SUFFERED

DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PURCHASES OF MERCK COMMON STOCK AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES

DUE TO THE COMPANYS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF LAW RELATED TO DISCLOSURES ABOUT

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY

REMOVED THIS LAWSUIT TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON, HOWEVER, PLAINTIFF

MOVED TO REMAND THE CASE TO STATE COURT, WHICH MOTION WAS GRANTED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, A NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN

FEDERAL COURT AND IN NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT AND

CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD (PAST AND PRESENT), TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS

DEFENDANTS. THE COMPLAINTS ARISE OUT OF SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE MADE

IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. THE DERIVATIVE SUITS, WHICH ARE PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT TO ASSERT

RIGHTS OF THE COMPANY, ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD MEMBERS AND OFFICERS FOR BREACH OF

FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, ABUSE OF CONTROL AND GROSS

MISMANAGEMENT. ALL OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS

THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS. THE JPML HAS TRANSFERRED THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS PENDING

IN FEDERAL COURT TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL. JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. ON JUNE 20, 2005, THE FEDERAL DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFFS FILED A VERIFIED

CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT SUPERSEDING PRIOR COMPLAINTS IN THE VARIOUS

CASES. DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS COMPLAINT, WHICH IS PENDING. IN ADDITION,

THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS PENDING IN NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT WERE CONSOLIDATED AND

TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE HIGBEE IN ATLANTIC COUNTY, AND ON APRIL 29, 2005, STATE PLAINTIFFS FILED A

SUPERSEDING VERIFIED CONSOLIDATED AMENDED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT. ON JANUARY 19, 2006,

THESE TWO SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE CASES WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. THE CASES WERE

DISMISSED WHEN THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO STAY THE CASES. THE COURTS ORDER PERMITS

PLAINTIFFS TO RE-FILE THEIR COMPLAINTS ONCE THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE CASE

HAS BEEN RESOLVED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON

THE BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH

RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. IN RESPONSE TO THAT DEMAND LETTER, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINED AT ITS NOVEMBER 23, 2004 MEETING THAT THE BOARD WOULD TAKE THE

SHAREHOLDERS REQUEST UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT REMAINS UNDER CONSIDERATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, A NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED

AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY IN

FEDERAL COURT (THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

THE

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS) ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).

THE LAWSUITS MAKE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND CLAIM THAT THE DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR DUTIES AS PLAN FIDUCIARIES. THE JPML HAS

TRANSFERRED ALL

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL. JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. A CONSOLIDATED AND AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS ON AUGUST 2, 2005. DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS

COMPLAINT, WHICH IS PENDING.

INTERNATIONAL LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN

NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LITIGATION RELATING TO

VIOXX

IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS) IN EUROPE, CANADA, BRAZIL, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, AND ISRAEL.

ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

BASED ON MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER SOURCES, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY,

THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS

AND DIRECTORS IN THE FUTURE.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT IN

THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $630 MILLION AFTER

DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-INSURANCE. THIS INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

POTENTIAL DAMAGE AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE EXTENDS TO ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS INSURANCE COVERAGE APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS FIDUCIARY AND

OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $275

MILLION. ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS MAY ALSO BE AVAILABLE UNDER UPPER-LEVEL

EXCESS POLICIES THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE DISPUTES WITH CERTAIN

INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THERE ARE LIKELY TO

BE ADDITIONAL DISPUTES. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH

RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS (WHICH PROVIDE EXCESS

INSURANCE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL OF THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) HAVE COMMENCED AN ARBITRATION

SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO CANCEL THOSE POLICIES, TO VOID ALL OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

THOSE POLICIES AND TO RAISE OTHER COVERAGE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. A SECOND

ARBITRATION AGAINST ONE OF THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS HAS ALSO BEEN COMMENCED.

MERCK INTENDS TO CONTEST VIGOROUSLY THE INSURERS CLAIMS AND WILL ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS

UNDER APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES DISCUSSED

IN THIS SECTION MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN INFORMAL INQUIRY

CONCERNING

VIOXX

. ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE

SEC ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION. ALSO, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE DOJ) REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH,

MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL

COMMITTEES. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANYS U.K. SUBSIDIARY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED BY THE

MEDICINES AND HEALTHCARE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTS REGULATORY AGENCY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (THE MHRA) OF AN

INVESTIGATION BY THE MHRA OF COMPLIANCE BY THE COMPANY WITH EU ADVERSE

EXPERIENCE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH

VIOXX

. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN

ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY

IS COOPERATING WITH THESE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS (THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY COULD

RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL DISPOSITIONS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE

DEMAND (CID) FROM A GROUP

OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 31 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHO ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER

THE COMPANY VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE CID.

RESERVES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE

TRIED IN 2006. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY TRIALS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF

PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE

CLAIMANTS SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE

MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH

RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE

ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD

ESTABLISHED A RESERVE OF $675 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY SPENT $285 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $295 MILLION TO

INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION TO

$685 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND IS THE BEST

ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE WILL

BE SPENT THROUGH 2007. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND

ONGOING REVIEW OF THE RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL

COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY UP TO THAT TIME; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING

BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE ANTICIPATED

TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EVENTS SUCH AS SCHEDULED TRIALS, THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT 2006

AND INTO 2007, AND THE INHERENT INABILITY TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOMES OF SUCH TRIALS, LIMIT

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS LEGAL COSTS BEYOND THE END OF 2007. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX L

ITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL LITIGATION

BEGINNING IN 1993, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A NUMBER OF ANTITRUST SUITS, CERTAIN OF WHICH

WERE CERTIFIED AS CLASS ACTIONS, INSTITUTED BY MOST OF THE NATIONS RETAIL PHARMACIES AND

CONSUMERS IN SEVERAL STATES. THE COMPANY SETTLED THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTION, WHICH REPRESENTED THE

SINGLE LARGEST GROUP OF CLAIMS AND HAS SETTLED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING CASES ON

SATISFACTORY TERMS. THE FEW REMAINING CASES HAVE BEEN INACTIVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE COMPANY

HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY CONSPIRACY AND NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING WAS MADE OR INCLUDED IN ANY

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION

BY

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE SOMETIMES USED IN

CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML

ORDERED THE TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO FEDERAL COURT IN

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH

AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND ALSO

EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH, LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN

DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED THE COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION

COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND STATE

COURT BROUGHT INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THE COMPANY AND THE

OTHER DEFENDANTS ARE AWAITING THE FINAL RULING ON THEIR MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE SUFFOLK COUNTY

CASE, WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE FILED. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2005, THE COMPANY WAS A DEFENDANT IN STATE CASES BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF

KENTUCKY, ILLINOIS, ALABAMA, WISCONSIN, MISSISSIPPI, AND ARIZONA, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING

VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECEIVED A LETTER INQUIRY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

IDAHO.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ANTITRUST CASES IN

FEDERAL COURT IN MINNESOTA AND IN STATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA, EACH ALLEGING AN UNLAWFUL CONSPIRACY

AMONG DIFFERENT SETS OF PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO PROTECT HIGH PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES

BY IMPEDING IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF LOWER-PRICED PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CANADA. THE

COURT DISMISSED THE FEDERAL CLAIMS IN THE MINNESOTA CASE WITH PREJUDICE AND THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE

FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. THE STATE CLAIMS IN THAT ACTION WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, A SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN ALABAMA BY TWO PROVIDERS OF HEALTH

SERVICES TO NEEDY PATIENTS ALLEGES THAT 15 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OVERCHARGED THE PLAINTIFFS

AND A CLASS OF THOSE SIMILARLY SITUATED, FOR PHARMACEUTICALS PURCHASED BY THE PLAINTIFFS UNDER

THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY SECTION 340B OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. THE COMPANY AND THE

OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT ON NUMEROUS GROUNDS WHICH WAS RECENTLY

DENIED BY THE COURT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2003, THE DOJ NOTIFIED THE FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS,

LOUISIANA THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO INTERVENE AT THAT TIME IN A PENDING FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT

CASE THAT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL IN DECEMBER 1999 AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER

UNSEALING THE COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS FILED BY A PHYSICIAN IN LOUISIANA, AND ORDERED THAT THE

COMPLAINT BE SERVED. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCOUNTING OF

PEPCID

IN

CERTAIN LOUISIANA HOSPITALS LED TO INCREASES IN COSTS TO MEDICAID, WAS DISMISSED. AN AMENDED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL AND THE CASE HAS BEEN ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED BY THE COURT UNTIL

THE SEAL IS LIFTED. THE STATE OF LOUISIANA HAS FILED ITS OWN AMENDED COMPLAINT, INCORPORATING THE

ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED AMENDED COMPLAINT. THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED

AMENDED COMPLAINT ARE UNKNOWN.

IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A QUI TAM LAWSUIT UNDER THE NEVADA FALSE CLAIMS ACT.

THE SUIT, IN WHICH THE NEVADA ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS INTERVENED, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY

INAPPROPRIATELY OFFERED NOMINAL PRICING AND OTHER MARKETING AND PRICING INDUCEMENTS TO CERTAIN

CUSTOMERS AND ALSO FAILED TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MEDICAID BEST PRICE SCHEME

RELATED TO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING AGAINST THIS LAWSUIT.

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH

ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NOMINAL PRICING

PROGRAMS AND SAMPLES. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO REPORTED THAT IT HAS RECEIVED A CID FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS REGARDING THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING

ACTIVITIES RELATING TO TEXAS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY RECEIVED ANOTHER CID FROM THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND

SELLING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO TEXAS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF ITS NOMINAL PRICING

PROGRAMS AND SAMPLES. IN APRIL 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFFICE OF THE

INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA. IN

NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER REQUEST FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS PRICING OF

PEPCID

. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

SUBPOENA FROM THE ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE SUBPOENA SEEKS INFORMATION RELATED TO

REPACKAGING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE DOJ ADVISING IT OF THE

EXISTENCE OF A QUI TAM COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY VIOLATED CERTAIN RULES RELATED TO ITS

CALCULATIONS OF BEST PRICE AND OTHER FEDERAL PRICING BENCHMARK CALCULATIONS, CERTAIN OF WHICH MAY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS MEDICAID REBATE OBLIGATION.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN REGULATORS OR AUTHORITIES MAY

SEEK INFORMATION ABOUT PRACTICES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY OR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

PRACTICES IN INQUIRIES OTHER THAN THE INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION. IT IS NOT

FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH INQUIRIES.

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2004, THE ITALIAN ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES ADOPTED A MEASURE COMMENCING A

FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF MERCK SHARP & DOHME (ITALIA) S.P.A. (MSD ITALY) AND THE COMPANY UNDER

ARTICLE 14 OF THE ITALIAN COMPETITION LAW AND ARTICLE 82 EC TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE COMPANY AND

MSD ITALY COMMITTED AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION BY VIRTUE OF THE COMPANYS REFUSAL TO GRANT

TO ACS DOBFAR S.P.A. (DOBFAR), AN ITALIAN COMPANY, A VOLUNTARY LICENSE, PURSUANT TO DOMESTIC

LEGISLATION PASSED IN 2002, TO PERMIT DOBFAR TO MANUFACTURE

TIENAM

(IMIPENEM AND CILASTATIN) IN

ITALY FOR SALE OUTSIDE ITALY, IN COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION UNDER THE APPLICABLE DOMESTIC

RULES HAS EXPIRED OR NEVER EXISTED. THE COMPANY HAS A SUPPLEMENTARY PROTECTION CERTIFICATE

(SPC) WHICH PROVIDES THE COMPANY CERTAIN RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF

TIENAM

IN ITALY WHICH EXPIRED IN JANUARY 2006. A HEARING BEFORE THE ITALIAN ANTITRUST

AUTHORITIES WAS HELD ON MAY 2, 2005. ON JUNE 17, 2005, THE ITALIAN ANTITRUST AUTHORITY (ICA)

ISSUED AN ORDER IMPOSING INTERIM MEASURES REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO GRANT A LICENSE TO MANUFACTURE

TIENAM

IN ITALY. PURSUANT TO THE ICAS ORDER, THE LICENSE GRANTED TO DOBFAR WILL BE LIMITED TO

THE RIGHT TO ONLY MANUFACTURE AND BUILD SUPPLY STOCK OF

TIENAM

AND WILL NOT ALLOW DOBFAR TO

EXPORT

TIENAM

OUTSIDE OF ITALY OR TO SELL THEIR

TIENAM

PRODUCT WITHIN ITALY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRY

OF THE SPC. ON NOVEMBER 16, 2005, THE ITALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE COURT DENIED THE COMPANYS APPEAL

OF THE ICAS ORDER. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE ICA ARE ONGOING.

VACCINE LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A PARTY IN CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE CONSUMER

PROTECTION ACT OF 1987 IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A

VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING VACCINATED WITH VARIOUS BIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES

AND RUBELLA AND/OR TRIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS

M-M-R

II. THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AUTISM, WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, EPILEPSY,

ENCEPHALITIS, ENCEPHALOPATHY, GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME AND TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. THERE ARE NOW 26

CLAIMANTS PROCEEDING OR, TO THE COMPANYS KNOWLEDGE, INTENDING TO PROCEED AGAINST THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS ALSO A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G., HEPATITIS

B VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING PEDIATRIC VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FALL OF 2001. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 275 ACTIVE THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS WITH

APPROXIMATELY 775 PLAINTIFFS. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED

PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE

ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES

AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC VACCINES. TWO STATE COURT CASES AND TWO

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT CASES WERE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2005. ALL OF THESE CASES HAVE BEEN

DISMISSED. ONE CASE SET FOR TRIAL IN 2006 WAS ALSO DISMISSED. CERTAIN OF THE DISMISSALS HAVE

BEEN APPEALED. THE COMPANY WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THESE

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON

THE GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE

VACCINE ACT). THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION

(IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR VACCINE-RELATED

INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS

(HEREINAFTER THE VACCINE COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A

VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE PETITIONER MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN

VACCINE COURT AND THEN TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF

ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT TO

WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY

PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS CASES PENDING IN VACCINE

COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES AND/OR THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. ALL OF THE CASES REFERRED TO IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH AS HAVING

BEEN DISMISSED HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO HAVE MADE A TIMELY WITHDRAWAL OF

THEIR VACCINE COURT PETITION. THE COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS

BECAUSE THE PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

PATENT LITIGATION

FROM

TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FILE ANDAS WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE UNITED

STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

FOSAMAX

,

PRILOSEC, NEXIUM

,

PROPECIA, TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS (AND ASTRAZENECAS IN THE CASE OF

PRILOSEC

AND

NEXIUM

) PATENTS

CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. THE GENERIC COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF

NON-INFRINGEMENT, INVALIDITY AND UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. GENERIC MANUFACTURERS HAVE

RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A GENERIC FORM OF

PRILOSEC

. THE COMPANY HAS FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE

(

FOSAMAX

), FINASTERIDE (

PROPECIA

), DORZOLAMIDE (

TRUSOPT

) AND DORZOLAMIDE/TIMOLOL (

COSOPT

), AND

ASTRAZENECA AND THE COMPANY HAVE FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST

COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC OMEPRAZOLE (

PRILOSEC

) AND ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

). SIMILAR

PATENT CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY

DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES

ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY

LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL

CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED

ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES

IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S.

FOSAMAX

SALES AFTER THAT

TIME.

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A DECISION REFUSING TO BAR

THE APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON THE GROUND THAT MERCKS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS

LIKELY INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA

IN JUNE 2005. IN JULY 2005, MERCK WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX SEEKING

DAMAGES FOR LOST SALES OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DUE TO THE PATENT PROCEEDING.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES HELD THAT PATENTS OF THE

COMPANY PROTECTING THE ALENDRONATE DAILY AND WEEKLY PRODUCTS WERE INVALID IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

ON NOVEMBER 6, 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS OF ENGLAND AND WALES AFFIRMED THE RULING BY THE HIGH

COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PERMIT COMPANIES SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC PRODUCT TO REFERENCE DATA

OF THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER DATA EXCLUSIVITY REGULATIONS. THE HIGH

COURT OF JUSTICE HAS AFFIRMED THE DECISION OF THE UK REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT ITS DATA FOR

WEEKLY ALENDRONATE MAY BE REFERENCED BY COMPANIES SEEKING APPROVAL OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS FILED FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL A JUDGMENT OF A SWEDISH ADMINISTRATION COURT

AFFIRMING A GRANT BY THE SWEDISH REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF APPROVAL OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE

PRODUCTS WHICH REFERENCED THE COMPANYS DATA ON WEEKLY ALENDRONATE FOR THEIR APPROVAL. THE

COMPANY HAS FILED SIMILAR CASES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED BY THE COMPANY, ON JULY 20, 2004, THE OPPOSITION DIVISION (THE

OPPOSITION DIVISION) OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (THE EPO) RENDERED AN ORAL DECISION TO

REVOKE THE COMPANYS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE.

ON AUGUST 19, 2004, THE WRITTEN OPINION WAS ISSUED CONFIRMING THE ORAL DECISION REVOKING THE

COMPANYS PATENT. ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, THE COMPANY FILED AN APPEAL OF THIS DECISION. THE

HEARING ON THE APPEAL IS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 14 AND 15, 2006. DECISIONS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE

TYPICALLY RENDERED AT THE END OF THE HEARING. IF THE DECISION IS UPHELD, THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

FOSAMAX

IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS AFTER 2007. IN ADDITION, MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE USE OF ALENDRONATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IF THE COMPANY IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN THOSE COUNTRIES THE COMPANY COULD LOSE EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS TO

FOSAMAX

BEFORE 2007 IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING THE ALENDRONATE WEEKLY

PRODUCT IN OTHER MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS BASED ON OTHER PATENTS.

ON OCTOBER 5, 2004, IN AN ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS

AUSTRALIAN PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE, THE PATENT WAS FOUND TO BE

INVALID. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE DECISION.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JAPAN A PROCEEDING HAS BEEN FILED CHALLENGING THE

VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE.

ON

JANUARY 18, 2006, THE COMPANY SUED HI-TECH PHARMACAL CO., INC.

ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN PEOPLE WITH OCULAR HYPERTENSION OR GLAUCOMA. IN THE LAWSUIT,

MERCK SUED TO ENFORCE A PATENT COVERING AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT DORZOLAMIDE, WHICH IS PRESENT IN

BOTH

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

. MERCK HAS ELECTED NOT TO ENFORCE TWO U.S. PATENTS LISTED WITH THE FDA

WHICH COVER THE COMBINATION OF DORZOLAMIDE AND TIMOLOL, THE TWO ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN

COSOPT.

THIS LAWSUIT WILL AUTOMATICALLY STAY FDA APPROVAL OF HI-TECHS ANDAS FOR 30 MONTHS OR UNTIL AN

ADVERSE COURT DECISION, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE PATENT COVERING DORZOLAMIDE PROVIDES

EXCLUSIVITY FOR

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008 (INCLUDING SIX MONTHS OF PEDIATRIC

EXCLUSIVITY). AFTER SUCH TIME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS TO DECLINE.

IN THE CASE OF OMEPRAZOLE, THE TRIAL COURT IN THE UNITED STATES RENDERED AN OPINION IN

OCTOBER 2002 UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS AND ASTRAZENECAS PATENTS COVERING THE

STABILIZED FORMULATION OF OMEPRAZOLE AND RULING THAT ONE DEFENDANTS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT DID NOT

INFRINGE THOSE PATENTS. THE OTHER THREE DEFENDANTS PRODUCTS WERE FOUND TO INFRINGE THE

FORMULATION PATENTS. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

AFFIRMED THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS PATENT INFRINGEMENT

CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN OTHER GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCTS, TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR

MARCH 2006.

THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT RANBAXY LABORATORIES

LIMITED (RANBAXY) HAS FILED AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV

CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA SUED RANBAXY

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDINGLY, FDA APPROVAL OF RANBAXYS ANDA

IS STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS UNTIL APRIL 2008 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER

MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

IN THE CASE OF FINASTERIDE, AN ANDA HAS BEEN FILED SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC VERSION OF

PROPECIA

AND ALLEGING INVALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS PATENTS. THE COMPANY FILED A PATENT

INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF DELAWARE IN SEPTEMBER 2004. A TRIAL IS SCHEDULED

FOR JUNE 2006.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN EUROPE, THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPANIES SEEKING REGISTRATION FOR GENERIC

LOSARTAN (THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOR

COZAAR

). THE COMPANY HAS PATENT RIGHTS TO LOSARTAN VIA

LICENSE FROM E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY (DU PONT). THE COMPANY AND DU PONT HAVE FILED

PATENT INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS COMPANIES IN PORTUGAL.

OTHER LITIGATION

ON JULY 27, 2005, MERCK WAS SERVED WITH A FURTHER SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT FILED IN THE

NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT FOR HUNTERDON COUNTY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THIS LAWSUIT SEEKS TO RECOVER OR CANCEL COMPENSATION AWARDED TO THE

COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN 2004, AND ASSERTS CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE AND

UNJUST ENRICHMENT.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE BOARD ALLEGING THAT

THE COMPANY HAD SUSTAINED DAMAGES THROUGH THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF ITS CHANGE IN CONTROL

SEPARATION BENEFITS PLAN (THE CIC PLAN) IN NOVEMBER 2004. THE SHAREHOLDER MADE A DEMAND ON THE

BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE BOARDS CURRENT OR FORMER MEMBERS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING

DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CIC PLAN. IN RESPONSE TO THAT DEMAND

LETTER, THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD DETERMINED AT THE NOVEMBER 22, 2005 BOARD MEETING

THAT THE BOARD WOULD TAKE THE SHAREHOLDERS REQUEST UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT REMAINS UNDER

CONSIDERATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 6, 2004, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT

OF NEW JERSEY GRANTED A MOTION BY THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO HEALTH) AND

CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO DISMISS A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INVOLVING CLAIMS

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS REVENUE RECOGNITION PRACTICE FOR RETAIL CO-PAYMENTS PAID BY INDIVIDUALS

TO WHOM MEDCO HEALTH PROVIDES PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER ALLEGATIONS. THE

COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. ON AUGUST 20, 2004, THE SAME COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE A RELATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION. PLAINTIFFS IN BOTH

ACTIONS APPEALED THE DECISIONS. ON DECEMBER 15, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT UPHELD THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION DISMISSING THE CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT. IN A

SEPARATE DECISION ISSUED THE SAME DAY, THE COURT OF APPEALS UPHELD MOST OF THE DISTRICT COURTS

DECISION DISMISSING THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT, AND SENT THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE COMPANYS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROPERLY REFUSED THE SHAREHOLDER DEMAND RELATING TO THE COMPANYS TREATMENT OF

RETAIL CO-PAYMENTS BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR RECONSIDERATION UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL

STANDARD.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH

AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS, A SERIES OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA

(THE GRUER CASES). THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A

NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR

WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS, HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY AGREED TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID

THE SIGNIFICANT COST AND DISTRACTION OF PROLONGED LITIGATION. THE PROPOSED CLASS SETTLEMENT HAS

BEEN AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY.

UNDER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A TOTAL OF $42.5

MILLION, AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TO CONTINUE CERTAIN

SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS INTENDED

TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH

ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME SINCE DECEMBER 17, 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD

HEARINGS TO HEAR OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND APPROVED THE

SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE

PROPERLY ELECTED NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL ONLY IF AND

WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. CERTAIN CLASS MEMBER PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL

NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH PLANS AND TWO INDIVIDUALS

REMAIN PENDING IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES HAVE ASSERTED

CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO

THE CLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES. THE COMPANY AND

MEDCO HEALTH ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES.

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THREE NOTICES OF APPEAL WERE FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENT IN MAY 2005.

ON DECEMBER 8, 2005, THE APPELLATE COURT ISSUED A DECISION VACATING THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT

AND REMANDING THE CASES TO THE DISTRICT COURT TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT COURT TO RESOLVE CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. A HEARING WAS HELD TO ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006.

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY

EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING TWO PARAGRAPHS. THESE CASES ARE BEING

DEFENDED BY MEDCO HEALTH.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS NOTE, IN THE OPINION OF THE

COMPANY, ALL SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR

WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED IN THIS NOTE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY

KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS

WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE

DISPOSED OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND

SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES

MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE

COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL

LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. WHILE

IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR

STATE AGENCIES OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, SUCH PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT

ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS

TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE

ANY REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM INSURERS, FORMER SITE OWNERS OR

OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN DECEMBER 2003, THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

(VADEQ) ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION OF THE COMPANYS ELKTON, VIRGINIA FACILITY FOR AIR PERMIT

LIMIT EXCEEDANCES REPORTED BY THE FACILITY AS A RESULT OF PERFORMANCE TESTING OF A PROCESS TRAIN.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS MATTER WITH VADEQ BY AGREEING (I) TO MAKE $3.1 MILLION IN

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AT THE SITE, (II) TO PAY VADEQ A $200,000 FINE, AND (III) TO PERFORM A

SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT FOR $300,000.

ON DECEMBER 21, 2005, THE COMPANY SETTLED CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR ALLEGED DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES AT FOUR NEW JERSEY MERCK

REMEDIATION SITES. IN THE SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREED TO PAY $2.38 MILLION, DONATE 10

ACRES OF LAND ADJACENT TO THE RAHWAY RIVER AND FUND A $30,000 RESTORATION PROJECT IN THE PASSAIC

RIVER WATERSHED FOR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION FOUND AT THE COMPANYS SITES.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
