ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

MERCK & CO., INC. (THE COMPANY) IS A GLOBAL RESEARCH-DRIVEN

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS COMPANY THAT DISCOVERS, DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES AND

MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL

HEALTH, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS JOINT VENTURES. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS

IN JANUARY 2002, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO ESTABLISH MEDCO HEALTH

SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO HEALTH) AS A SEPARATE, PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANY. ON

AUGUST 19, 2003, THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH WAS EFFECTED BY WAY OF A PRO RATA

DIVIDEND TO COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OF MEDCO HEALTH. BASED ON A LETTER RULING THE COMPANY RECEIVED FROM THE U.S.

ACQUISITIONS

 ON FEBRUARY 23, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT

HAD AGREED TO ACQUIRE ATON PHARMA, INC., A PRIVATELY HELD

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TREATMENTS

FOR CANCER AND OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES. (SEE ALSO PAGE 10.)

IN JANUARY 2003, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED

SUBSIDIARY, MSD (JAPAN) CO., LTD., LAUNCHED A TENDER OFFER TO ACQUIRE, FOR AN

ESTIMATED AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $1.5 BILLION, THE REMAINING 49% OF THE

COMMON SHARES OF BANYU PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. (BANYU) THAT IT DID NOT

ALREADY OWN. IN OCTOBER 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AT THE CLOSE OF THE

FINAL COUNT OF SHARES IN ITS SECOND TENDER OFFER FOR ALL REMAINING SHARES IN

BANYU, THE COMPANY OWNED 99.4% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF BANYU COMMON STOCK.

JAPAN IS THE WORLDS SECOND LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET.

IN JULY 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ROSETTA INPHARMATICS, INC., A

PUBLICLY-HELD WASHINGTON BASED INFORMATIONAL GENOMICS COMPANY THAT DESIGNS AND

DEVELOPS UNIQUE TECHNOLOGIES TO EFFICIENTLY ANALYZE GENE DATA TO PREDICT HOW

MEDICAL COMPOUNDS WILL INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF CELLS IN THE BODY.

JOINT VENTURES

 IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA

AB (ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN

1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN EQUALLY OWNED JOINT VENTURE THAT

DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED

PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE PARTNERSHIP), IN WHICH THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS A LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED

ASTRAZENECA LP, BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS FOR

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH KBI

RETAINED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY EARNS CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP RETURNS AS WELL AS

ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS. THE

PARTNERSHIP RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP

AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA

USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS SHARE

OF UNDISTRIBUTED PARTNERSHIP GAAP EARNINGS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998

RESTRUCTURING, FOR A PAYMENT OF $443.0 MILLION, ASTRA PURCHASED AN OPTION TO

BUY THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE COMPANYS

INTEREST IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

. THE COMPANY

ALSO GRANTED ASTRA AN OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION) TO BUY THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK INTEREST IN KBI, AT AN EXERCISE PRICE BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF

ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

IN APRIL 1999, ASTRA MERGED WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC, FORMING ASTRAZENECA AB

(ASTRAZENECA). AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPANYS

RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING

U.S. PATENTS AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4 MILLION, WHICH IS

SUBJECT TO A TRUE-UP CALCULATION IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE MERGER ALSO TRIGGERS A PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF THE

COMPANYS LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN 2008. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER, ASTRAZENECAS OPTION TO BUY THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS

IS EXERCISABLE IN 2010 AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRAZENECA TO

PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008. IN ADDITION, THE SHARES OPTION IS EXERCISABLE

TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS PURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS.

IN 1989, THE COMPANY FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO

DEVELOP, MARKET AND MANUFACTURE CONSUMER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED

STATES. THIS 50% OWNED JOINT VENTURE WAS EXPANDED INTO EUROPE IN 1993, AND INTO

CANADA IN 1996. THE EUROPEAN EXTENSION CURRENTLY MARKETS AND SELLS

OVER-THE-COUNTER PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, SPAIN AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM. SIGNIFICANT JOINT VENTURE PRODUCTS ARE

PEPCID AC

(FAMOTIDINE), AN OVER-THE-COUNTER FORM OF THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION

PEPCID

(FAMOTIDINE), AS WELL AS

PEPCID COMPLETE,

AN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT WHICH

COMBINES THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION WITH ANTACIDS (CALCIUM CARBONATE AND

MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE). ON FEBRUARY 27, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS

INTENTION TO SELL TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON ITS INTEREST IN THE EUROPEAN JOINT

VENTURE WHICH IS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 8 UNDER

DIVESTITURES.

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1992, THE COMPANY, THROUGH THE MERCK VACCINE DIVISION, AND

CONNAUGHT LABORATORIES, INC. (NOW AVENTIS PASTEUR), AGREED TO COLLABORATE ON

THE DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF COMBINATION PEDIATRIC VACCINES AND TO PROMOTE

SELECTED VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE RESEARCH AND MARKETING

COLLABORATION ENABLES THE COMPANIES TO POOL THEIR RESOURCES TO EXPEDITE THE

DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES COMBINING SEVERAL DIFFERENT ANTIGENS TO PROTECT

CHILDREN AGAINST A VARIETY OF DISEASES, INCLUDING HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE

B, HEPATITIS B, DIPHTHERIA, TETANUS, PERTUSSIS AND POLIOMYELITIS. WHILE

COMBINATION VACCINE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS CONTINUE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NO

VACCINES ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROMOTED.

IN 1994, THE COMPANY, THROUGH THE MERCK VACCINE DIVISION, AND PASTEUR

MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW AVENTIS PASTEUR) FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET HUMAN

VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMBINATION

VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE THEN EXISTING EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND THE

EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY AND AVENTIS PASTEUR CONTRIBUTED,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEIR EUROPEAN VACCINE BUSINESSES FOR EQUAL SHARES IN THE

JOINT VENTURE, KNOWN AS PASTEUR MÉRIEUX MSD, S.N.C. (NOW AVENTIS PASTEUR MSD,

S.N.C.). THE JOINT VENTURE IS SUBJECT TO MONITORING BY THE EU, TO WHICH THE

PARTNERS MADE CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS IN RETURN FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM EUROPEAN

COMPETITION LAW, EFFECTIVE UNTIL DECEMBER 2006. THE JOINT VENTURE MAINTAINS A

PRESENCE, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH AFFILIATES OR BRANCHES IN BELGIUM, ITALY,

GERMANY, SPAIN, FRANCE, AUSTRIA, IRELAND, SWEDEN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND

THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS IN THE REST OF EUROPE.

ANIMAL HEALTH AND POULTRY GENETICS BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED

(MERIAL), A FULLY-INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE

JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE

RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND

PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL SPECIES. IN DECEMBER 1999, RHÔNE-POULENC

S.A.S INTEREST IN MERIAL WAS ACQUIRED BY AVENTIS S.A., A CORPORATION

FORMED BY THE MERGER OF RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. AND HOECHST A.G.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION (SCHERING-PLOUGH)

ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE EQUALLY OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO

DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. IN DECEMBER 2001,

THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH ANNOUNCED THE WORLDWIDE EXPANSION (EXCLUDING

JAPAN) OF THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP. IN OCTOBER 2002,

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PHARMACEUTICALS (MSP) ANNOUNCED THE FDA APPROVAL OF

ZETIA

(EZETIMIBE). THE ONCE-DAILY TABLET OF

ZETIA

10 MG WAS APPROVED FOR USE

EITHER BY ITSELF OR TOGETHER WITH A STATIN TO REDUCE LDL CHOLESTEROL AND TOTAL

CHOLESTEROL IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL. MARKETING APPROVAL WAS RECEIVED

IN OCTOBER 2002 IN GERMANY UNDER THE BRAND NAME

EZETROL

FOR USE ALONE AND WITH

ALL MARKETED STATINS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. IN

2003, FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MUTUAL

RECOGNITION PROCEDURE (MRP),

EZETROL

HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN FIVE EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES  GERMANY, THE UNITED KINGDOM, SWITZERLAND, SWEDEN AND THE

NETHERLANDS. WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE MRP PROCESS, THE 15 EU MEMBER STATES,

AS WELL AS ICELAND AND NORWAY, CAN GRANT NATIONAL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION WITH

UNIFIED LABELING FOR

EZETROL.

IN THE EU,

EZETROL

WILL BE INDICATED IN

CO-ADMINISTRATION WITH A STATIN AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY TO DIET FOR USE IN

PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA WHO ARE NOT APPROPRIATELY CONTROLLED

WITH A STATIN ALONE.

EZETROL

AS MONOTHERAPY WILL BE INDICATED AS ADJUNCTIVE

THERAPY TO DIET FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA IN WHOM A

STATIN IS CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE OR IS NOT TOLERATED. IN ADDITION,

EZETROL

AS MONOTHERAPY WILL BE INDICATED AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY TO DIET FOR USE IN

PATIENTS WITH HOMOZYGOUS FAMILIAL SITOSTEROLEMIA AND CO-ADMINISTERED WITH A

STATIN FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH HOMOZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA. IN

SEPTEMBER 2003, MSP SUBMITTED TO THE FDA FOR STANDARD REVIEW A NEW DRUG

APPLICATION (NDA) FOR

VYTORIN

, AN INVESTIGATIONAL CHOLESTEROL LOWERING

MEDICINE, WHICH CONTAINS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

, AS

ADJUNCTIVE TO DIET, FOR THE REDUCTION OF HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (ELEVATED

CHOLESTEROL LEVELS). IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE FILING WAS ACCEPTED BY THE FDA FOR

STANDARD REVIEW. SIMILAR APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN OTHER COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

COMPETITION

 THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS

IS CONDUCTED ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS

TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON PRODUCT

PRICING AND ACCESS.

SUCH COMPETITION INVOLVES AN INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO MARKET THESE INNOVATIONS EFFECTIVELY. WITH ITS

LONG-STANDING EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANY IS WELL

PREPARED TO COMPETE IN THE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES TO MEET COMPETITION INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL, FLEXIBILITY TO MEET

CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS, AN EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND A STRONG

TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVE IN ACQUIRING AND

MARKETING PRODUCTS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND LICENSES AND HAS BEEN REFINING

ITS SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS TO FURTHER ADDRESS CHANGING INDUSTRY

CONDITIONS. TO ENHANCE ITS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE

EXTERNAL ALLIANCES, FROM EARLY-STAGE TO LATE-STAGE PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES,

INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES AND TARGETED ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, THE INTRODUCTION

OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES BY COMPETITORS MAY RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS AND

PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS, EVEN FOR PRODUCTS PROTECTED BY PATENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS AVAILABLE TO TREAT DISEASES TYPICALLY INCREASES OVER TIME

AND HAS RESULTED IN SLOWING THE GROWTH IN SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS,

LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ALL STATES IN THE U.S. ALLOWS, ENCOURAGES OR, IN A FEW

INSTANCES, IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESCRIBING

PHYSICIAN, MANDATES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS (THOSE CONTAINING THE SAME

ACTIVE CHEMICAL AS AN INNOVATORS PRODUCT) RATHER THAN BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS.

GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER PRESSURES TOWARD THE DISPENSING OF GENERIC PRODUCTS HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS NO LONGER

PROTECTED BY PATENTS, SUCH AS

VASOTEC

AND

VASERETIC

(ENALAPRIL MALEATE IN

COMBINATION WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)

,

THE U.S. RIGHTS TO WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD,

PRINIVIL

(LISINOPRIL) AND

PRINZIDE

(LISINOPRIL IN COMBINATION WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE),

PEPCID

AND

MEVACOR

(LOVASTATIN), AND SLOWED THE GROWTH OF CERTAIN OTHER

PRODUCTS.

DISTRIBUTION

 THE COMPANY SELLS ITS HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO

DRUG WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONS. VACCINES ARE ALSO SOLD DIRECTLY TO PHYSICIANS. THE

COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY

AND VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE

PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW DISTRIBUTION

PROGRAM FOR U.S. WHOLESALERS TO MODERATE THE FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES CAUSED BY

WHOLESALER INVESTMENT BUYING AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF

COMPANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE NEW PROGRAM HAS LOWERED PREVIOUS LIMITS

ON AVERAGE MONTHLY PURCHASES OF COMPANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY U.S.

CUSTOMERS. OVERALL, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW U.S. WHOLESALER DISTRIBUTION

PROGRAM HAD AN ESTIMATED $700.0 TO $750.0 MILLION UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WITH AN ESTIMATED $500.0 MILLION UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON

ZOCOR

SALES.

RAW MATERIALS

 RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE NORMALLY AVAILABLE IN

QUANTITIES ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND INVESTIGATION

 THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS

SUBJECT TO GLOBAL REGULATION BY REGIONAL, COUNTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES.

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ADMINISTERS

REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS,

MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY

CASES, THE FDA REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN 1997, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION ACT WAS PASSED

AND WAS THE CULMINATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE REFORM EFFORT DESIGNED

TO STREAMLINE REGULATORY PROCEDURES WITHIN THE FDA AND TO IMPROVE THE

REGULATION OF DRUGS, MEDICAL DEVICES AND FOOD. THE LEGISLATION WAS PRINCIPALLY

DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE TIMELY AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS AND

BIOLOGICS BY EXPEDITING THE PREMARKET REVIEW PROCESS FOR NEW PRODUCTS. A KEY

PROVISION OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

USER FEE ACT OF 1992, WHICH PERMITS THE CONTINUED COLLECTION OF USER FEES FROM

PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO AUGMENT FDA RESOURCES EARMARKED FOR THE

REVIEW OF HUMAN DRUG APPLICATIONS. THIS HELPS PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY

TO ENSURE THE PROMPT APPROVAL OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NEW DRUGS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN

EXPANDING HEALTH CARE ACCESS BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN

DECEMBER 2003. THIS STATUTE ADDS PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE TO MEDICARE

BEGINNING IN 2006 AND A VOLUNTARY DRUG DISCOUNT CARD FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES

EFFECTIVE IN JUNE 2004. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BENEFIT WILL SUPPORT THE

COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE

COVERAGE, WHILE PRESERVING MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

INNOVATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BENEFIT IS DESIGNED TO ASSURE THAT

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND BY

ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN A

LEADERSHIP ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDICARE-ENDORSED

DISCOUNT CARDS BY OFFERING TO PROVIDE ITS MEDICINES FREE DURING 2004 AND 2005

FOR LOW-INCOME MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO EXHAUST THEIR $600 TRANSITIONAL

ASSISTANCE ALLOWANCE IN MEDICARE-ENDORSED DRUG DISCOUNT CARDS. THIS ACTION IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS LONGSTANDING PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, WHICH

PROVIDES FREE MEDICINES TO PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO LACK DRUG COVERAGE

AND CANNOT AFFORD THEIR MEDICINES.

IN ADDRESSING COST CONTAINMENT OUTSIDE OF MEDICARE, THE COMPANY HAS MADE A

CONTINUING EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP SAVE COSTS IN

OVERALL PATIENT HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION, PRICING FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE

COMPANYS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO HAS ENCOURAGED GROWING USE OF ITS MEDICINES AND

MITIGATED THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

FOR MANY YEARS, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER FEDERAL AND

STATE OVERSIGHT WITH THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR NEW DRUGS, DRUG SAFETY,

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, DRUG PURCHASING AND REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND

FORMULARIES VARIOUSLY UNDER REVIEW. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE

TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW DRUGS

TO THE MARKET, IN THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. ONE TYPE OF FEDERAL INITIATIVE

TO CONTAIN FEDERAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING IS THE PROSPECTIVE OR CAPITATED

PAYMENT SYSTEM, FIRST IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE

REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS. SUCH A SYSTEM ESTABLISHES IN ADVANCE A FLAT RATE

FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE PATIENTS FOR WHOM THE PAYER IS

FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. THIS TYPE OF PAYMENT SYSTEM AND OTHER COST CONTAINMENT

SYSTEMS ARE NOW WIDELY USED BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYERS AND HAVE CAUSED

HOSPITALS, HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY

TO BE MORE COST-CONSCIOUS IN THEIR

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TREATMENT DECISIONS, INCLUDING DECISIONS

REGARDING THE MEDICINES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR PATIENTS. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO WORK WITH PRIVATE AND FEDERAL EMPLOYERS TO SLOW INCREASES IN

HEALTH CARE COSTS. FURTHER, THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS

MEDICINES CAN HELP SAVE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS, AND PRICING FLEXIBILITY ACROSS

ITS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, HAVE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF THE COMPANYS MEDICINES AND

HAVE HELPED OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

ALSO, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED METHODS TO DIRECTLY

REDUCE THE COST OF DRUGS AND VACCINES FOR WHICH THEY PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL

LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PAY SPECIFIED REBATES FOR MEDICINES REIMBURSED BY

MEDICAID, TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR OUTPATIENT MEDICINES PURCHASED BY CERTAIN

PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ENTITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS

(HOSPITALS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA), AND TO PROVIDE MINIMUM DISCOUNTS OF 24%

OFF OF A DEFINED NON-FEDERAL AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR PURCHASES BY

CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS

AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

INITIATIVES IN SOME STATES SEEK REBATES BEYOND THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY

MEDICAID LEGISLATION, IN SOME CASES FOR PATIENTS BEYOND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

FOR MEDICAID. UNDER THE FEDERAL VACCINES FOR CHILDREN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM, THE

U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) FUNDS AND PURCHASES

RECOMMENDED PEDIATRIC VACCINES AT A PUBLIC SECTOR PRICE FOR THE IMMUNIZATION OF

MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE, UNINSURED, NATIVE AMERICAN AND CERTAIN UNDERINSURED

CHILDREN. THE COMPANY WAS AWARDED CDC CONTRACTS IN 2003 FOR THE SUPPLY OF

$345.7 MILLION OF PEDIATRIC VACCINES FOR THIS PROGRAM (AND A MONOVALENT

COMPONENT OF CERTAIN OF SUCH VACCINES).

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ENCOUNTERS SIMILAR REGULATORY AND

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT DOES BUSINESS. THERE,

TOO, THE PRIMARY THRUST OF GOVERNMENTAL INQUIRY AND ACTION IS TOWARD

DETERMINING DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS, OFTEN WITH MECHANISMS FOR

CONTROLLING THE PRICES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE PROFITS OF PRESCRIPTION

DRUG COMPANIES. THE EU HAS ADOPTED DIRECTIVES CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION,

LABELING, ADVERTISING, WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION AND APPROVAL FOR MARKETING OF

MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE. THE COMPANYS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE

ALREADY CONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE DIRECTIVES; CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS

BELIEVED THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES

AND IS, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS. SUCH ACTIONS

MAY INCLUDE SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. UNDER

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY ON ITS OWN MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE

PRODUCT RECALLS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, RECOGNIZING THE ECONOMIC

IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF

INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY, ARE WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON PROPOSALS TO COMPLETE THE SINGLE MARKET IN

PHARMACEUTICALS AND IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS

INCLUDING MARKET DEREGULATION.

THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN

COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. IN THE

UNITED STATES, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY INITIATIVES REGARDING PATIENT PRIVACY, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND

RECENTLY ISSUED STATE PRIVACY REGULATIONS CONCERNING HEALTH INFORMATION, WHICH

HAVE AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

 PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE

AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN

HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS.

PATENTS MAY COVER PRODUCTS

PER SE

, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, PROCESSES FOR

OR INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE USES OF PRODUCTS.

PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTENDS FOR VARYING PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE DATE OF GRANT AND THE LEGAL LIFE OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES.

THE PROTECTION AFFORDED, WHICH MAY ALSO VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS

UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT AND ITS SCOPE OF COVERAGE.

PATENT PORTFOLIOS DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY

NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. BASIC PATENTS ARE IN EFFECT FOR THE

FOLLOWING MAJOR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES.

ARCOXIA, CANCIDAS, COMVAX

(HAEMOPHILUS B CONJUGATE AND HEPATITIS B [RECOMBINANT] VACCINE)

, COSOPT,

STATES FOR

ZETIA

, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PHARMACEUTICALS PARTNERSHIP. A BASIC PATENT IS ALSO IN EFFECT FOR

SUSTIVA/STOCRIN

(EFAVIRENZ). BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB, UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE

FROM THE COMPANY, SELLS

SUSTIVA

IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND CERTAIN

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY MARKETS

STOCRIN

IN OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD. THE BASIC PATENT FOR

AGGRASTAT

(TIROFIBAN HYDROCHLORIDE) IN THE

UNITED STATES WAS DIVESTED WITH THE PRODUCT IN 2003. THE COMPANY RETAINS BASIC

PATENTS FOR

AGGRASTAT

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2003,

ZOCOR

LOST ITS BASIC PATENT PROTECTION IN CANADA AND CERTAIN

COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY, AND THE COMPANY

EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IN 2006,

ZOCOR

WILL

LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A

DECLINE IN U.S.

ZOCOR

SALES.

THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1997 (THE MODERNIZATION ACT), INCLUDES A

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INDICATIONS OF NEW OR CURRENTLY

MARKETED DRUGS, IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON PEDIATRIC STUDIES ARE COMPLETED BY THE

APPLICANT. THESE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS WERE RE-AUTHORIZED UNTIL OCTOBER 1,

2007 BY THE BEST PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT PASSED IN JANUARY 2002. IN

2003, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE

UNITED STATES TO

FOSAMAX

UNTIL FEBRUARY 2008, AND

FOSAMAX

ONCE WEEKLY UNTIL

JANUARY 2019. IN ADDITION, IN 2004, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS

OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

TRUSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008 AND TO

VIOXX

FOR SIX MONTHS BEYOND ITS PATENT TERMINATION.

WHILE THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT NORMALLY RESULTS IN A LOSS OF

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR THE COVERED PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, COMMERCIAL BENEFITS

MAY CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED FROM: (I) LATER-GRANTED PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND

INTERMEDIATES RELATED TO THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF SUCH PRODUCT; (II) PATENTS RELATING TO THE USE OF SUCH

PRODUCT; (III) PATENTS RELATING TO NOVEL COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS; AND

(IV) IN THE UNITED STATES, MARKET EXCLUSIVITY THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER

FEDERAL LAW. THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRATION ON PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON MANY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE MARKET

AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT, THE GROWTH OF THE MARKET, THE

COMPLEXITIES AND ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENT OF THE PRODUCT AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF NEW DRUG PROVISIONS OF THE

FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT OR SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES.

ADDITIONS TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

COUNTRIES THROUGH ALL RELEVANT LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS INCREASING PATENT LIFE.

SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INCREASES IN PATENT LIFE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

A GENERAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF, INCENTIVES FOR AND USE OF GENERIC

PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS ARE SOUGHT

IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH REFORM OF PATENT AND OTHER

RELEVANT LAWS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

WORLDWIDE, ALL OF THE COMPANYS IMPORTANT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD UNDER

TRADEMARKS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE.

TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES AS LONG AS USED; IN OTHER

COUNTRIES, AS LONG AS REGISTERED. REGISTRATION IS FOR FIXED TERMS AND CAN BE

RENEWED INDEFINITELY.

ROYALTIES RECEIVED DURING 2003 ON PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES AND OTHER

RIGHTS AMOUNTED TO $86.5 MILLION. THE COMPANY ALSO PAID ROYALTIES AMOUNTING TO

$757.7 MILLION IN 2003 UNDER PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES IT HOLDS.

DIVESTITURES

 ON FEBRUARY 27, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD

SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO

BUY THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT EQUITY STAKE IN THEIR EUROPEAN NON-PRESCRIPTION

PHARMACEUTICALS JOINT VENTURE.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS U.S. RIGHTS IN

AGGRASTAT

(TIROFIBAN

HYDROCHLORIDE INJECTION) TO GUILFORD PHARMACEUTICALS INC. (GUILFORD),

INCLUDING THE BASIC U.S. PRODUCT PATENTS (BUT NOT PROCESS PATENTS) FOR THE

PRODUCT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS OR NEW USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH A STRONG RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY 12,800 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THE COMPANYS

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. EXPENDITURES FOR THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS WERE $3.2 BILLION IN 2003, $2.7 BILLION IN 2002 AND $2.5 BILLION IN

2001 AND ARE ESTIMATED TO INCREASE AT A LOW-TEEN PERCENTAGE GROWTH RATE OVER

THE FULL-YEAR 2003 EXPENSE IN 2004. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ONGOING

COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH OVER A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS AND CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF NEW PRODUCTS. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PERIOD 1994

THROUGH 2003 EXCEEDED $20.2 BILLION WITH A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 10%.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND FUNDAMENTAL

RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS

DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. PROJECTS RELATED TO HUMAN HEALTH ARE

BEING CARRIED ON IN VARIOUS FIELDS SUCH AS BACTERIAL, FUNGAL, AND VIRAL INFECTIONS,

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CANCER, DIABETES,

OBESITY, NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, PAIN AND

INFLAMMATION, IMMUNOLOGY, RESPIRATORY DISEASES, OPHTHALMOLOGY,

RESPIRATORY DISEASES, OSTEOPOROSIS AND MEN/WOMEN HEALTH PROGRAMS, ENDOPARASITIC AND ECTOPARASITIC DISEASES,

COMPANION ANIMAL DISEASES, AND

PRODUCTION IMPROVEMENT.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS, INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST FOREIGN COUNTRIES PROVIDE

FOR THE DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS

THROUGH PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CONTROLLED CLINICAL EVALUATION. BEFORE A NEW

DRUG MAY BE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES, RECORDED DATA ON PRECLINICAL AND

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ARE INCLUDED IN THE NDA OR THE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT LICENSE

APPLICATION (PLA) TO THE FDA FOR THE REQUIRED APPROVAL. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN

OTHER PRODUCTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COVERING SAFETY AND

EFFICACY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT A COMPOUND THAT IS THE RESULT OF ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM WILL

OBTAIN THE REGULATORY APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE MARKETED.

THE COMPANYS LATE-STAGE PIPELINE CANDIDATES INCLUDE NOVEL VACCINES FOR

HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) AND THE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH SHINGLES, AND

ROTATEQ

, A VACCINE FOR ROTAVIRUS-A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS THAT IS THE MOST

COMMON CAUSE OF SEVERE GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO FILE PLAS WITH THE FDA FOR

THESE THREE NOVEL VACCINE CANDIDATES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005. THERE ARE

COMPETING CLAIMS TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE HPV FIELD, BUT THE COMPANY IS

CONFIDENT THAT THE CLAIMS WILL NOT DELAY THE COMPANYS PROGRAM. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO SUBMIT A PLA TO THE FDA FOR ITS

PROQUAD

VACCINE, A PEDIATRIC

COMBINATION VACCINE FOR MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBELLA AND CHICKENPOX, IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2004.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO STUDYING A DP-IV INHIBITOR, A GLUCOSE-LOWERING

MECHANISM, USED ALONE AND IN COMBINATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES.

THE COMPANY PLANS TO ENTER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS WITH THIS INVESTIGATIONAL

COMPOUND IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004 AND EXPECTS TO SUBMIT AN NDA TO THE FDA

IN 2006.

THE COMPANYS EARLY-STAGE PIPELINE INCLUDES CANDIDATES IN EACH OF THE

FOLLOWING AREAS: DIABETES, OBESITY, ALZHEIMERS DISEASE, RESPIRATORY DISEASE,

CORONARY HEART DISEASE, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND VACCINES.

THE COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS ITS INTERNAL RESEARCH WITH AN AGGRESSIVE LICENSING

AND EXTERNAL ALLIANCE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF COLLABORATIONS

FROM EARLY RESEARCH TO LATE-STAGE COMPOUNDS, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN

2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED 47 SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING RESEARCH

COLLABORATIONS, PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS, AND TECHNOLOGY

TRANSACTIONS. TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED IN 2003 INCLUDE AGREEMENTS

WITH THE

FOLLOWING COMPANIES: GENPATH, FOR CANCER; AMRAD, FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASE;

NEUROGEN, FOR PAIN; AND ACTELION, FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.

ON FEBRUARY 10, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED INTO AN

AGREEMENT WITH H. LUNDBECK A/S (LUNDBECK) TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE IN THE

UNITED STATES GABOXADOL, A COMPOUND LICENSED TO LUNDBECK BY A THIRD PARTY THAT

IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISORDERS.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, LUNDBECK WILL RECEIVE AN INITIAL PAYMENT OF

$70.0 MILLION AND UP TO $200.0 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS. THE

COMPANY AND LUNDBECK WILL JOINTLY COMPLETE THE ONGOING PHASE III CLINICAL

PROGRAM, WITH THE COMPANY FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL FILE AN NDA WITH THE FDA

BETWEEN LATE 2006 AND MID-2007. FOLLOWING FDA APPROVAL, THE COMPANIES PLAN TO

CO-PROMOTE GABOXADOL IN THE UNITED STATES. LUNDBECK WILL RECEIVE A SHARE OF

GABOXADOL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGREED TO ACQUIRE

ATON PHARMA, INC. (ATON), A PRIVATELY HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSING ON

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR CANCER AND OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES.

CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITION WILL CONSIST OF UPFRONT AND CONTINGENT

PAYMENTS BASED UPON THE REGULATORY FILING, AND APPROVAL AND SALES OF PRODUCTS.

ATONS CLINICAL PIPELINE OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS REPRESENTS A CLASS

OF ANTI-TUMOR AGENTS WITH POTENTIAL FOR EFFICACY BASED ON A NOVEL MECHANISM OF

ACTION. ATONS LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE, KNOWN AS SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC

ACID, HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED IN PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS AND IS CURRENTLY

IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION OF ATON IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2004.

THE CHART BELOW REFLECTS THE COMPANYS RESEARCH PIPELINE AS OF MARCH 1,

2004. CANDIDATES SHOWN IN PHASE III INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. CANDIDATES

SHOWN IN PHASE I AND II INCLUDE THE MOST ADVANCED COMPOUND WITH A SPECIFIC

MECHANISM IN A GIVEN THERAPEUTIC AREA. BACK-UP COMPOUNDS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR

PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT, ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS IN THE SAME THERAPEUTIC AREAS AND

ADDITIONAL LINE EXTENSIONS OR FORMULATIONS FOR IN-LINE PRODUCTS ARE NOT SHOWN.

PRECLINICAL AREAS SHOWN ARE THOSE WHERE THE COMPANY HAS INITIATED GOOD

LABORATORY PRACTICES (GLP) STUDIES IN COMPOUNDS WITH MECHANISMS DISTINCT FROM

THOSE IN PHASE I AND II. THE COMPANYS PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO

FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL MEDICINES TO ADDRESS LARGE, UNMET MEDICAL

NEEDS.

THESE OTHER MOLECULES IS NOT CERTAIN.

IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS DISCONTINUING ITS

PHASE III CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR ITS SUBSTANCE P ANTAGONIST

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, MK-0869, FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION. THE PHASE

III CLINICAL PROGRAM WAS HALTED BECAUSE THE COMPOUND FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE

EFFICACY FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO ITS

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAMS.

ALSO IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS DISCONTINUING ITS

PHASE III CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR ITS INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT,

MK-0767, FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES. THE COMPANY WAS

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEVELOPING MK-0767 IN COLLABORATION WITH KYORIN PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. THE

CLINICAL PROGRAM WAS HALTED BECAUSE RECENT FINDINGS IN THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM

SAFETY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IDENTIFIED A RARE FORM OF MALIGNANT TUMORS IN MICE.

THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF THESE FINDINGS IN HUMANS IS UNKNOWN. THE COMPANY IS

CONTINUING ITS COMMITMENT TO DIABETES RESEARCH AND IS CURRENTLY STUDYING A

DP-IV INHIBITOR FOR DIABETES. THE COMPANY PLANS TO ENTER PHASE III CLINICAL

TRIALS WITH THIS INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

ON FEBRUARY 21, 2003, BANYU ANNOUNCED A CHANGE OF TIMING WITH RESPECT TO

THE FILING IN JAPAN OF AN NDA FOR ROFECOXIB (

VIOXX

). IN ITS PRESS RELEASE,

BANYU STATED THAT AFTER REVIEWING CLINICAL DATA ACCUMULATED TO DATE, AND AT THE

RECOMMENDATION OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL SAFETY AND RESEARCH, BANYU

HAS AGREED TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL STUDIES IN JAPANESE PATIENTS TO FURTHER

SUPPORT THE NDA FILING. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, THE NDA FILING WHICH WAS

ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO TAKE PLACE BY THE END OF MARCH 2003 HAS BEEN DELAYED.

BANYU FURTHER STATED THAT IT WILL CONDUCT THE ADDITIONAL STUDIES AS APPROPRIATE

IN SUPPORT OF FILING THE PRODUCT.

ON DECEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN NDA TO THE FDA FOR

ARCOXIA.

THE COMPANYS NDA SEEKS INDICATIONS FOR

ARCOXIA

FOR THE TREATMENT OF

OSTEOARTHRITIS, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, ACUTE PAIN,

DYSMENORRHEA, ACUTE GOUTY ARTHRITIS AND ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (A PAINFUL

CONDITION OF THE SPINE). AS OF JANUARY 30, 2004,

ARCOXIA

HAS BEEN LAUNCHED IN

41 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

THE FDA HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT THE FDA CONSIDERS JANUARY 13, 2004 THE

EFFECTIVE SUBMISSION DATE FOR THE NDA BECAUSE FISCAL YEAR 2003 FEES FOR A

DIFFERENT MEDICINE WERE NOT RECEIVED BY DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE FDA HAS

INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT UNLESS THE COMPANY IS OTHERWISE NOTIFIED, THE NDA

WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR FILING ON MARCH 12, 2004.

IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE EUROPEAN UNIONS COMMITTEE FOR PROPRIETARY MEDICINAL

PRODUCTS CONCLUDED ITS COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE COX-2 SELECTIVE INHIBITOR

CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES

VIOXX

AND

ARCOXIA

, AND CONFIRMED THAT THE MEDICINES HAVE

A POSITIVE BALANCE OF BENEFITS AND RISKS. THE FRENCH TRANSPARENCY COMMISSION,

WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE RECOMMENDING DRUG REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS IN

FRANCE, AFTER REVIEW HAS RETAINED ITS ASSESSMENT THAT

VIOXX

PROVIDES A MODEST

LEVEL OF IMPROVEMENT RELATIVE TO NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS IN TERMS

OF SAFETY.

AT THE END OF 2003, THE COMPANY HAD 63,200 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE, WITH

33,200 EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO. APPROXIMATELY 25%

OF WORLDWIDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY ARE REPRESENTED BY VARIOUS COLLECTIVE

BARGAINING GROUPS.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY ACCELERATED ITS EFFORTS TO FUNDAMENTALLY LOWER ITS

COST STRUCTURE THROUGH COMPANY-WIDE INITIATIVES. IN OCTOBER 2003, THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED THE REDUCTION OF 4,400 POSITIONS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED

IN 2004. WHEN COMPLETE, THE COST REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE ANNUAL

SAVINGS OF PAYROLL AND BENEFITS COSTS OF $250.0 TO $300.0 MILLION STARTING IN 2005.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS

WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN 2003, THE COMPANY

INCURRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $41.8 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION FACILITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL

CONTAMINATION RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES.

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $31.3

12

MILLION

IN 2003,

AND ARE ESTIMATED AT $87.0 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2008. THESE

AMOUNTS DO NOT CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER PARTIES.

THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE

COSTS, AND IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS WHICH ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN ACCRUED.

ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN

EXCESS OF THOSE PROVIDED SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL

RESOURCES.

GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY MANAGED ON A PRODUCTS BASIS WITH

ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT: THE MERCK PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT WHICH INCLUDES

PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH JOINT VENTURES. MERCK

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC AND PREVENTIVE AGENTS, SOLD BY

PRESCRIPTION, FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF HUMAN DISORDERS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE CONDUCTED PRIMARILY

THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES. SALES WORLDWIDE BY SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES WERE 41% OF SALES IN 2003, AND 39% AND 37% IN 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ABROAD.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT REGARD THESE RISKS AS A DETERRENT TO FURTHER EXPANSION OF

ITS OPERATIONS ABROAD. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CLOSELY REVIEWS ITS METHODS OF

OPERATIONS AND ADOPTS STRATEGIES RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPANDING ITS OPERATIONS IN

COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, EASTERN EUROPE AND

ASIA PACIFIC WHERE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE

MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO EARN FAIR RETURNS. BUSINESS IN THESE

DEVELOPING AREAS, WHILE SOMETIMES LESS STABLE, OFFERS IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES

FOR GROWTH OVER TIME.

COMPANYS BUSINESS IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE TO PAGES 48 (BEGINNING WITH THE

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

THE COMPANYS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN WHITEHOUSE STATION, NEW

JERSEY. THE COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED THROUGH DIVISIONAL

HEADQUARTERS LOCATED IN UPPER GWYNEDD AND WEST POINT, PENNSYLVANIA. PRINCIPAL

RESEARCH FACILITIES FOR HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE LOCATED IN RAHWAY, NEW JERSEY

AND WEST POINT. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS PRODUCTION FACILITIES FOR HUMAN HEALTH

PRODUCTS AT NINE LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO. BRANCH

WAREHOUSES PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY OWNS OR HAS AN INTEREST IN MANUFACTURING

PLANTS OR OTHER PROPERTIES IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, SINGAPORE,

SOUTH AFRICA,

AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND ASIA.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2003 WERE $1,915.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH $2,128.1

MILLION FOR 2002. IN THE UNITED STATES, THESE AMOUNTED TO $1,307.8 MILLION FOR

2003 AND $1,565.2 MILLION FOR 2002. ABROAD, SUCH EXPENDITURES AMOUNTED TO

$608.1 MILLION FOR 2003 AND $562.9 MILLION FOR 2002.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OWN THEIR PRINCIPAL FACILITIES AND

MANUFACTURING PLANTS UNDER TITLES WHICH THEY CONSIDER TO BE SATISFACTORY. THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THAT ITS PROPERTIES ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION AND THAT

ITS MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED. PLANTS FOR THE

MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS ARE SUITABLE FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSES AND HAVE

CAPACITIES AND PROJECTED CAPACITIES ADEQUATE FOR CURRENT AND PROJECTED NEEDS

FOR EXISTING COMPANY PRODUCTS. SOME CAPACITY OF THE PLANTS IS BEING CONVERTED,

WITH ANY NEEDED MODIFICATION, TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF NEWLY INTRODUCED AND

FUTURE PRODUCTS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF A

NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY,

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS

SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS.

BEGINNING IN 1993, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A NUMBER OF ANTITRUST SUITS,

CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE CERTIFIED AS CLASS ACTIONS, INSTITUTED BY MOST OF THE

NATIONS RETAIL PHARMACIES AND CONSUMERS IN SEVERAL STATES, ALLEGING ANTITRUST

VIOLATIONS. IN 1994, THESE ACTIONS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE PENDING IN STATE COURTS,

WERE CONSOLIDATED FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN CHICAGO,

ILLINOIS. IN 1996, THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL OTHER DEFENDANTS SETTLED THE

FEDERAL CLASS ACTION, WHICH REPRESENTED THE SINGLE LARGEST GROUP OF CLAIMS.

SINCE THAT TIME, THE COMPANY HAS SETTLED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING

CASES ON SATISFACTORY TERMS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY CONSPIRACY AND

NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING WAS MADE NOR WAS INCLUDED IN ANY SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE FEW

REMAINING CASES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, THESE PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT

ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMPANY AND OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

INVESTIGATION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE GOVERNMENT SERVED A SUBPOENA ON THE

COMPANY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO COMPANY MARKETING AND SALES

ACTIVITIES. THE SUBPOENA SEEKS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME INFORMATION AS THE

GOVERNMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT. THE COMPANY WILL BE WORKING WITH THE

GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO THIS SUBPOENA AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL

REQUESTS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND (CID)

FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS. THE CID SEEKS THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES

RELATING TO TEXAS. THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH THE TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERALS

OFFICE TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO THE CID.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING LITIGATION

ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE

PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE SOMETIMES USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC

AND PRIVATE SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON

MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORDERED THE TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO

FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE CONSOLIDATED

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO

INCLUDE SOME WHICH, LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR

PENDING CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS

THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED THE COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION

CASE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE COMPANY AS A

DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND THIRTY OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS REMAIN

DEFENDANTS IN THREE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT IN

MASSACHUSETTS FILED BY THE NEW YORK COUNTIES OF SUFFOLK, ROCKLAND AND

WESTCHESTER. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND IS

VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2003, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

NOTIFIED THE FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO

INTERVENE IN A PENDING FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT CASE THAT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL

IN DECEMBER 1999 AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER UNSEALING THE

COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS FILED BY A PHYSICIAN IN LOUISIANA, AND ORDERED THAT THE

COMPLAINT BE SERVED. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANYS DISCOUNTING OF

PEPCID

IN CERTAIN LOUISIANA HOSPITALS LED TO INCREASES IN COSTS TO MEDICAID.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE COMPLAINT IS WITHOUT MERIT AND WILL VIGOROUSLY

DEFEND AGAINST IT.

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWSUITS INVOLVING NUMEROUS INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, AS WELL

AS SOME PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS, HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

. SOME OF THE LAWSUITS ALSO NAME AS A DEFENDANT PFIZER INC.,

WHICH MARKETS A COMPETING PRODUCT. CERTAIN OF THE LAWSUITS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS

REGARDING GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING, CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS AND KIDNEY DAMAGE.

THE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED IN FEDERAL COURTS AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF STATE

COURTS. WHILE CASES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE PROCEEDING SEPARATELY, THE

ACTIONS FILED IN THE STATE COURTS OF CALIFORNIA AND NEW JERSEY HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO A SINGLE JUDGE IN EACH STATE FOR COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS. THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS

MAY GO TO TRIAL IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2004. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTIES AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN ON THE OUTCOME OF ANY GIVEN TRIAL.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED BY SEVERAL

INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN

DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA NAMING AS DEFENDANTS THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT OR

FORMER OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY, AND ALLEGING THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND

MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANYS DRUG

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF THE

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. THE PLAINTIFFS REQUEST CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF

PURCHASERS OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN MAY 22, 1999 AND OCTOBER 22,

2003, AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF SUIT,

INCLUDING ATTORNEY FEES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT

MERIT AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY IN CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

OF 1987 IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A

VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING VACCINATED WITH VARIOUS BIVALENT

VACCINES FOR MEASLES AND RUBELLA AND/OR TRIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES, MUMPS

AND RUBELLA, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS

M-M-R

II. OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

HAVE ALSO BEEN SUED. THE CLAIMANTS ALLEGE VARIOUS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES,

INCLUDING AUTISM, WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, EPILEPSY,

DIABETES, ENCEPHALITIS, ENCEPHALOPATHY AND CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME. IN

CONNECTION WITH THOSE CLAIMS, EIGHT LEAD CASES HAD BEEN SELECTED FOR A TRIAL

WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE IN APRIL 2004: TWO AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND

SIX AGAINST OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THE TRIAL OF THE EIGHT CASES IS

INITIALLY LIMITED TO ISSUES OF CAUSATION AND DEFECT ON THE CONDITIONS OF

AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDERS, WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE. IN

EARLY SEPTEMBER 2003, THE LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSION ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION TO

WITHDRAW PUBLIC FUNDING OF THE LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE CLAIMANTS. THIS

DECISION WAS CONFIRMED ON APPEAL BY THE FUNDING REVIEW COMMITTEE ON SEPTEMBER

30, 2003. THE APRIL 2004 TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN VACATED AND THE CLAIMS STAYED

PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A FEBRUARY 2004 HEARING ON THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE

FUNDING WITHDRAWAL DECISION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE

WITHOUT MERIT AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE UNITED

STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (I.E., HEPATITIS B VACCINE AND

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZA TYPE B VACCINE) THAT

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN VACCINES. OTHER DEFENDANTS

INCLUDE VACCINE MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING

THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL AND

OTHER INJURIES AS A RESULT OF HAVING THIMEROSAL INTRODUCED INTO THEIR

DEVELOPING BODIES. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING MANY OF THESE

CASES EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND THAT THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY

COMPENSATION PROGRAM (NVICP) PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING

A CIVIL ACTION SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR

VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE UNITED STATES

COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS. A NUMBER OF SIMILAR CASES (

M-M-R

II ALONE AND/OR

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES) HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

FEDERAL CLAIMS UNDER THE NVICP FOR A DETERMINATION FIRST ON GENERAL CAUSATION

ISSUES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT

AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM IN THE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH IT IS A

PARTY.

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FILE

ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS (ANDAS) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET

GENERIC FORMS OF COMPANY PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS

OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED

ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

FOSAMAX

,

PRILOSEC

AND

VIOXX

PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS (AND

ASTRAZENECAS IN THE CASE OF

PRILOSEC)

PATENTS CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. THE

GENERIC COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT,

INVALIDITY AND UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. GENERIC MANUFACTURERS HAVE

RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A GENERIC FORM OF

PRILOSEC

. THE COMPANY HAS

FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS

FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE AND ROFECOXIB, AND ASTRAZENECA AND THE COMPANY HAVE

FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS

FOR GENERIC OMEPRAZOLE. SIMILAR PATENT CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT

BELIEVES ARE VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO

MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY

LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

A TRIAL IN THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO THE ALENDRONATE DAILY PRODUCT

CONCLUDED IN NOVEMBER 2001. IN NOVEMBER 2002, A DECISION WAS ISSUED BY THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE FINDING THE COMPANYS PATENT VALID AND

INFRINGED. ON OCTOBER 30, 2003, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL

CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE VALIDITY AND INFRINGEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BASIC U.S.

PATENT COVERING THE USE OF ALENDRONATE IN ANY FORM. A REQUEST FOR REHEARING

WAS DENIED. A TRIAL IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING THE ALENDRONATE WEEKLY

PRODUCT WAS HELD IN MARCH 2003. ON AUGUST 28, 2003, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN

DELAWARE, UPHELD THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS U.S. PATENT COVERING THE WEEKLY

ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. AS A RESULT OF THE COURTS DECISION, THE PATENT

IS VALID AND INFRINGED BY TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.S (TEVA) ABBREVIATED

NEW DRUG APPLICATION FILING. THE COURTS DECISION HAS BEEN APPEALED BY TEVA.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES HELD THAT

PATENTS OF THE COMPANY PROTECTING THE ALENDRONATE DAILY AND WEEKLY PRODUCTS

WERE INVALID IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. ON NOVEMBER 6, 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS

OF ENGLAND AND WALES AFFIRMED THE RULING BY THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FOR

ENGLAND AND WALES. PROTECTION AGAINST GENERIC COMPANIES REFERENCING THE

COMPANYS DATA FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM MAY BE AVAILABLE

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW WHICH GRANT A PERIOD OF EXCLUSIVITY TO THE

ORIGINAL SUBMITTER OF SUCH DATA. A GENERIC COMPANY HAS SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW

OF A DECISION BY THE LICENSING AUTHORITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT IT CANNOT

RELY UPON THE COMPANYS WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DATA TO SEEK APPROVAL OF A GENERIC

ALENDRONATE 70 MG PRODUCT UNTIL TEN YEARS AFTER APPROVAL OF THE COMPANYS

WEEKLY ALENDRONATE PRODUCT (WHICH WAS GRANTED IN 2000). THE COMPANY HAS BEEN

SERVED AS AN INTERESTED PARTY AND INTENDS TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PROTECT

ITS RIGHTS.

IN THE CASE OF OMEPRAZOLE, THE TRIAL COURT IN THE UNITED STATES RENDERED

AN OPINION IN OCTOBER 2002 UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS AND

ASTRAZENECAS PATENTS COVERING THE STABILIZED FORMULATION OF OMEPRAZOLE AND

RULING THAT ONE DEFENDANTS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT DID NOT INFRINGE THOSE PATENTS.

THE OTHER THREE DEFENDANTS PRODUCTS WERE FOUND TO INFRINGE THE FORMULATION

PATENTS. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

AFFIRMED THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT. WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OTHER

GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCTS, NO TRIAL DATE HAS YET BEEN SET.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE CASE OF ROFECOXIB, AN ANDA HAS BEEN FILED INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS OF

NON-INFRINGEMENT, INVALIDITY AND UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE COMPANYS ROFECOXIB

PATENTS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT

LAWSUIT IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF DELAWARE IN AUGUST 2003. TRIAL HAS BEEN SET

FOR OCTOBER 2005.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A

NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, WHICH HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED BEFORE

A SINGLE JUDGE AND IN A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION, BOTH OF WHICH INVOLVE

CLAIMS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS REVENUE RECOGNITION PRACTICE FOR RETAIL

COPAYMENTS PAID BY INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM MEDCO HEALTH PROVIDES PHARMACEUTICAL

BENEFITS. THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS AMENDED TO ADD CLAIMS AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN OF THEIR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS RELATING

TO REBATES RECEIVED BY MEDCO HEALTH AND MEDCO HEALTHS INDEPENDENT STATUS. THE

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS AMENDED TO ADD ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP AS A

DEFENDANT AND TO ADD CERTAIN NEW ALLEGATIONS, WHICH RELATE TO CLAIMS THAT

CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY BY FAILING TO

PREVENT THE CONDUCT AT ISSUE IN THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED GRUER CASES, DISCUSSED

BELOW, THE ANTITRUST CLAIMS PENDING IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, AND

THE

QUI TAM

ACTIONS IN WHICH THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE EASTERN

DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA HAS INTERVENED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH. THE COMPLAINT

SEEKS MONETARY DAMAGES FROM THOSE COMPANY DIRECTORS WHO ARE DEFENDANTS IN THE

LAWSUIT IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT AS WELL AS INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF. AS

PART OF THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR A

PORTION OF POTENTIAL DAMAGES OR SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS PAID, IF ANY, IN CONNECTION

WITH THIS LITIGATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT

MERIT AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH AGREED

TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS, A SERIES OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS

OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). THE COMPANY, MEDCO

HEALTH AND CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A NUMBER OF

PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS

FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF

SUCH PLANS, HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE PROPOSED CLASS SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN

AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES (THE GRUER CASES) FILED AGAINST

MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND

MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A TOTAL OF $42.5 MILLION, AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS

AGREED TO MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TO CONTINUE CERTAIN SPECIFIED

BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS

INTENDED TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS

FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME SINCE

DECEMBER 17, 1994. IN 2003, THE COURT PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT

AND HAS HELD A HEARING TO HEAR OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT FROM CLASS MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES. CURRENTLY, CERTAIN CLASS MEMBER

PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE

COURT HAS NOT YET APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT OR DETERMINED THE NUMBER OF CLASS

MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT,

IF APPROVED. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL ONLY IF AND WHEN THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTS FINAL APPROVAL AND ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE

COMPANY AGREED TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT

COST AND DISTRACTION OF PROTRACTED LITIGATION.

THE GRUER CASES, WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT MANAGERS, ALLEGED THAT MEDCO HEALTH WAS AN ERISA

FIDUCIARY AND THAT THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY-IN-INTEREST WITHIN THE MEANING

OF ERISA. THE PLAINTIFFS ASSERTED THAT THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH HAD

BREACHED DUTIES AND ENGAGED IN PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS AS A RESULT OF FILLING

PRESCRIPTIONS WITH THE COMPANYS DRUGS TO INCREASE THE COMPANYS MARKET SHARE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE PLAINTIFFS DEMANDED THAT MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY

DISGORGE ANY UNLAWFULLY OBTAINED PROFITS AND OTHER RELIEF.

IN ADDITION, AMONG THE CASES CONSOLIDATED IN NEW YORK, ONE PLAINTIFF HAS

ALSO ALLEGED, BASED ON ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AS THE GRUER

CASES, THAT MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY HAVE VIOLATED FEDERAL AND STATE

RACKETEERING LAWS. A DIFFERENT PLAINTIFF, SEEKING TO REPRESENT CALIFORNIA

CITIZENS, HAS ALLEGED THAT MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY HAVE VIOLATED

CALIFORNIA UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. AN ATTORNEY FOR ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS HAS

INDICATED THAT IT MAY ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH, THE COMPANY AND

OTHERS TO ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE SHERMAN ACT, THE CLAYTON ACT AND VARIOUS

STATE ANTITRUST LAWS BASED ON ALLEGED CONSPIRACIES TO SUPPRESS PRICE

COMPETITION AND UNLAWFUL COMBINATIONS ALLEGEDLY RESULTING IN HIGHER

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING THREE

PARAGRAPHS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE CASES, WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED BY

MEDCO HEALTH, ARE WITHOUT MERIT.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

(VADEQ) ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION TO THE COMPANYS ELKTON, VIRGINIA

FACILITY FOR AIR PERMIT LIMIT EXCEEDANCES REPORTED BY THE FACILITY AS A RESULT

OF PERFORMANCE TESTING OF A PROCESS TRAIN. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN

DISCUSSIONS WITH VADEQ AND BELIEVES THAT ITS DISCUSSIONS WILL RESULT IN CAPITAL

IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER WITH MONETARY SANCTIONS WHICH WILL BE IMMATERIAL BUT WILL

EXCEED $100,000.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY

KNOWN AS SUPERFUND AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS

SEEK TO REQUIRE THE OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES,

TRANSPORTERS OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR, TO REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT FOR

CLEANUP COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN

ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE

GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE

CLEANUP COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF CLEANUP COSTS

AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE

PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES

GREATLY FROM SITE TO SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE

MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED.

WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS

BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF

THE COMPANY, SUCH PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY

WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS

TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH

AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP

COSTS FROM INSURERS, FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT LIABILITY

AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE PENDING.

WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS OR THE

PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL SUCH

PROCEEDINGS ARE EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF

THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, FEDERAL OR STATE REGULATORS SEEK

INFORMATION ABOUT PRACTICES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. WHILE IT IS NOT

FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT SUCH INQUIRIES TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
