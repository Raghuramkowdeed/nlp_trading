BROAD RANGE OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL

HEALTH. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY MANAGED ON

A PRODUCTS BASIS AND ARE COMPRISED OF TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

OVERVIEW

 DURING 2007, MERCK BEGAN REALIZING

BENEFITS FROM ITS MULTI-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN DESIGNED TO

REENGINEER THE WAY THE COMPANY DEVELOPS AND DISTRIBUTES

MEDICINES AND VACCINES WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY IS BENEFITING FROM

THE EVOLUTION OF A NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL DESIGNED TO ALIGN THE

COMPANYS PRODUCT RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING

EFFORTS UTILIZING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES AND BROADENING ITS

ENGAGEMENT WITH CUSTOMERS, PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTIFIC LEADERS TO

GET NEEDED MEDICINES AND VACCINES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT

PIPELINE AND TO PATIENTS SOONER. THE COMPANY IS ALSO WORKING TO

BUILD A SUSTAINABLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ADVANTAGE BY

LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGIES TO FACILITATE DRUG DISCOVERY AND

DEVELOPMENT AND HAS SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT

CYCLE-TIME.

THE PROGRESS OF THESE EFFORTS IS DEMONSTRATED IN PART BY THE

COMPANYS REVENUE GROWTH IN 2007, WHICH REFLECTED THE

CONTINUED MARKET PENETRATION AND GLOBAL ROLLOUT OF

GARDASIL

[HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS QUADRIVALENT (TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND

18) VACCINE, RECOMBINANT]

,

A VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT

CERVICAL CANCER, PRE-CANCEROUS AND LOW-GRADE LESIONS, VULVAR AND

VAGINAL PRE-CANCERS, AND GENITAL WARTS CAUSED BY HUMAN

PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND 18;

JANUVIA

(SITAGLIPTIN PHOSPHATE)

,

A MEDICINE THAT

ENHANCES A NATURAL BODY SYSTEM TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL IN

PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES; AND

ROTATEQ

(ROTAVIRUS

VACCINE LIVE, ORAL, PENTAVALENT), A PEDIATRIC VACCINE TO HELP

PREVENT ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN,

COUPLED WITH THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF SEVERAL IN-LINE PRODUCTS.

THE GROWTH IN THESE PRODUCTS HAS MORE THAN OFFSET 2007 REVENUE

DECLINES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2006 LOSS OF U.S. MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUED THE ADVANCEMENT OF DRUG

CANDIDATES THROUGH ITS PIPELINE. DURING 2007, THE U.S. FOOD

AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE FDA) APPROVED BOTH

JANUMET

(SITAGLIPTIN PHOSPHATE AND METFORMIN

HYDROCHLORIDE), AN ORAL ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC AGENT THAT COMBINES

JANUVIA

WITH METFORMIN IN A SINGLE TABLET TO ADDRESS ALL

THREE KEY DEFECTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND

ISENTRESS

(RALTEGRAVIR)

,

A

FIRST-IN-CLASS

INTEGRASE INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN

TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS. IN ADDITION, ON JANUARY 25,

2008, THE FDA APPROVED

EMEND

(FOSAPREPITANT DIMEGLUMINE)

FOR INJECTION, AN INTRAVENOUS THERAPY FOR THE PREVENTION OF

CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING (CINV).

ALSO, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE FDA WILL TAKE ACTION IN 2008

ON THE NEW DRUG APPLICATION (NDA) FOR

CORDAPTIVE

, THE PROPOSED TRADEMARK FOR MK-0524A, AN

EXTENDED-RELEASE (ER) NIACIN COMBINED WITH

LAROPIPRANT, A NOVEL FLUSHING PATHWAY INHIBITOR, FOR CHOLESTEROL

MANAGEMENT. FURTHER, THE COMPANY MADE A SUPPLEMENTAL FILING WITH

THE FDA IN JANUARY 2008 FOR

GARDASIL

, FOR AN EXPANDED

INDICATION FOR WOMEN THROUGH AGE 45, AND ANTICIPATES MAKING

A SUPPLEMENTAL FILING FOR

ISENTRESS

LATER IN 2008, FOR AN

EXPANDED INDICATION FOR USE IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN CANDIDATES IN PHASE III

DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATES MAKING NDA FILINGS WITH RESPECT TO

TWO OF THE CANDIDATES IN 2008: MK-0524B, SIMVASTATIN

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMBINED WITH LAROPIPRANT AND ER NIACIN, AND MK-0364,

TARANABANT, AN INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF

OBESITY. THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE

MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BELOW.

AS PART OF IMPLEMENTING THE NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL, THE COMPANY IS

REENGINEERING ITS CORE BUSINESS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH THE

GOAL OF REDUCING ASPECTS OF ITS COST BASE AND REALIZING GROSS

MARGIN IMPROVEMENT. THE REENGINEERING INCLUDES THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING COST SAVINGS

INITIATIVES. THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN 2005 WAS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. THE SCOPE OF THIS INITIAL PHASE INCLUDED THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK

MANUFACTURING DIVISION OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, FOCUSING ON

ESTABLISHING LEAN SUPPLY CHAINS, LEVERAGING LOW-COST EXTERNAL

MANUFACTURING AND CONSOLIDATING OUR MANUFACTURING PLANT NETWORK.

AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THROUGH JANUARY 2008, MERCK HAD CLOSED,

SOLD OR CEASED OPERATIONS AT FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES AND TWO

PRECLINICAL SITES AND ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 7,200 POSITIONS

COMPANY-WIDE (COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS AND THE

ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS). THE COMPANY,

HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES AS THE BUSINESS

REQUIRES. THE PRETAX COSTS OF THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM SINCE

INCEPTION THROUGH THE END OF 2007 WERE $2.1 BILLION, OF

WHICH APPROXIMATELY 70% ARE NON-CASH, RELATING PRIMARILY TO

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION FOR THOSE FACILITIES SCHEDULED FOR

CLOSURE AND APPROXIMATELY 30% REPRESENT SEPARATION AND OTHER

RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS. THESE COSTS WERE

$810.1 MILLION IN 2007 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$100 MILLION TO $300 MILLION IN 2008, AT WHICH TIME

THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM RELATING TO THE

MANUFACTURING STRATEGY IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE.

MERCK CONTINUES TO EXPECT THE INITIAL PHASE OF ITS COST

REDUCTION PROGRAM, COMBINED WITH COST SAVINGS THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE IN ITS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, WILL YIELD CUMULATIVE PRETAX

SAVINGS OF $4.5 TO $5.0 BILLION FROM 2006 THROUGH 2010.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT

COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PLAINTIFFS

STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS

COUNSEL IN STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND

FEDERAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC

STROKE (IS) CLAIMS ALREADY FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY

IN THE UNITED STATES. IF CERTAIN PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS UNDER

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE MET (OR WAIVED), THE COMPANY WILL

PAY AN AGGREGATE FIXED AMOUNT OF $4.85 BILLION INTO TWO

FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS CONSISTING OF $4.0 BILLION FOR

QUALIFYING MI CLAIMS AND $850 MILLION FOR QUALIFYING IS

CLAIMS THAT ENTER INTO THE RESOLUTION PROCESS (THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM). AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF

$4.85 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $455 MILLION RELATING

TO INSURANCE PROCEEDS WHICH THE COMPANY WAS AWARDED (OR AGREED

TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENTS) IN THE PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED ARBITRATION WITH THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE CARRIERS RELATING TO COVERAGE FOR

COSTS INCURRED IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION.

THESE ITEMS ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

ALSO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

PRETAX CHARGE OF $671 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ANTICIPATED RESOLUTION OF INVESTIGATIONS OF CIVIL CLAIMS BY

FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES RELATING TO CERTAIN PAST MARKETING

AND SELLING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND

SAMPLES. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS RESOLVING THE INVESTIGATIONS. THIS ITEM IS

DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS) ASSUMING DILUTION

FOR 2007 WERE $1.49 PER SHARE INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE

U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT CHARGE, COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, THE CHARGE

RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN CIVIL GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS AND THE GAIN FROM AN INSURANCE ARBITRATION AWARD

RELATED TO

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION COVERAGE,

WHICH COLLECTIVELY REDUCED EPS BY $1.71 PER SHARE. IN ADDITION,

EPS IN 2007 REFLECTS AN ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO THE

ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA, INC. (NOVACARDIA),

ADDITIONAL RESERVES ESTABLISHED SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS FOR

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF

GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS AND PRODUCT DIVESTITURES, AS WELL AS A

NET GAIN ON THE SETTLEMENTS OF CERTAIN PATENT DISPUTES. ALL OF

THESE ITEMS ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN THE NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

U.S. PRODUCT APPROVALS

 ON MARCH 30,

2007, THE FDA APPROVED

JANUMET

, MERCKS ORAL

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC AGENT THAT COMBINES

JANUVIA

WITH

METFORMIN IN A SINGLE TABLET TO ADDRESS ALL THREE KEY DEFECTS OF

TYPE 2 DIABETES.

JANUMET

HAS BEEN APPROVED, AS AN ADJUNCT

TO DIET AND EXERCISE, TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR (GLUCOSE) CONTROL

IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES WHO ARE NOT ADEQUATELY

CONTROLLED ON METFORMIN OR SITAGLIPTIN ALONE, OR IN PATIENTS

ALREADY BEING TREATED WITH THE COMBINATION OF SITAGLIPTIN AND

METFORMIN.

ON OCTOBER 12, 2007, THE FDA GRANTED

ISENTRESS

ACCELERATED APPROVAL FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER

ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN

TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED ADULT PATIENTS WHO HAVE EVIDENCE OF VIRAL

REPLICATION AND HIV-1 STRAINS RESISTANT TO MULTIPLE

ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS.

ISENTRESS

IS THE FIRST MEDICINE TO

BE APPROVED IN A NEW CLASS OF ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS CALLED

INTEGRASE INHIBITORS.

ISENTRESS

WORKS BY INHIBITING THE

INSERTION OF HIV DNA INTO HUMAN DNA BY THE INTEGRASE ENZYME.

INHIBITING INTEGRASE FROM PERFORMING THIS ESSENTIAL FUNCTION

LIMITS THE ABILITY OF THE VIRUS TO REPLICATE AND INFECT NEW

CELLS. THE FDAS DECISION WAS BASED ON A 24-WEEK ANALYSIS

OF CLINICAL TRIALS IN WHICH

ISENTRESS,

IN COMBINATION

WITH OPTIMIZED BACKGROUND THERAPY IN TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED

PATIENTS, PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN HIV RNA VIRAL LOAD

AND INCREASES IN CD4 CELL COUNTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED 48 WEEK DATA THAT DEMONSTRATED

ISENTRESS

,

IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER ANTI-HIV MEDICINES, MAINTAINED

SIGNIFICANT HIV-1 VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AND INCREASED CD4 CELL

COUNTS THROUGH 48 WEEKS OF THERAPY COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN

COMBINATION WITH ANTI-HIV MEDICINES, IN TWO PHASE III

STUDIES OF TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS FAILING ANTIRETROVIRAL

THERAPIES. PATIENTS IN THE STUDIES HAD HIV RESISTANT TO AT LEAST

ONE DRUG IN EACH OF THREE CLASSES OF ORAL ANTIRETROVIRAL

MEDICINES. BY THE END OF 2007, THE MEDICINE WAS APPROVED FOR USE

IN THE EU, CANADA AND MEXICO. MERCK IS ALSO CONDUCTING

PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS OF

ISENTRESS

IN THE

TREATMENT-NAÏVE (PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED) HIV POPULATION.

POTENT ANTIRETROVIRAL ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH NO

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SERUM LIPIDS AT WEEK 48 AND

ISENTRESS

WAS GENERALLY WELL TOLERATED IN PATIENTS. THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL FILING WITH THE FDA FOR THE

TREATMENT-NAÏVE INDICATION IN 2008.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE FDA APPROVED

EMEND

FOR

INJECTION, 115 MG, FOR THE PREVENTION OF CINV.

EMEND

FOR INJECTION PROVIDES A NEW OPTION FOR DAY ONE ORAL

EMEND

(125 MG) AS PART OF THE RECOMMENDED

THREE-DAY

REGIMEN THAT DELIVERS FIVE DAYS OF PROTECTION FROM NAUSEA AND

VOMITING. PRIOR TO THE FDA DECISION, THE EUROPEAN UNION

(EU) ON JANUARY 11, 2008 GRANTED MARKETING

APPROVAL FOR

EMEND

FOR INJECTION, KNOWN AS

IVEMEND

IN THE EU, AN ACTION THAT APPLIES TO ALL 27 EU MEMBER

COUNTRIES AS WELL AS NORWAY AND ICELAND.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MERCK ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY

WORLDWIDE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE

PAIN MEDICATION. THE COMPANYS DECISION, WHICH WAS

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, WAS BASED ON NEW THREE-YEAR DATA FROM A

PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL,

APPROVE (ADENOMATOUS POLYP PREVENTION ON

VIOXX

).

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD

ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT)

WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE

PLAINTIFFS STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA

STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC STROKE

(IS) CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED

STATES. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED

CLAIMS, WAS SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH

THREE OF THE FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE

THAN 95 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY TO

U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI OR

IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, IF, BY MARCH 1, 2008

(SUBJECT TO EXTENSION), PLAINTIFFS ENROLL IN THE RESOLUTION

PROCESS (THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM) AT LEAST

85 PERCENT OF EACH OF ALL CURRENTLY PENDING AND TOLLED

(I) MI CLAIMS, (II) IS CLAIMS, (III) ELIGIBLE MI

AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH INVOLVE DEATH, AND

(IV) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS WHICH TOGETHER ALLEGE MORE

THAN 12 MONTHS OF USE, MERCK WILL PAY AN AGGREGATE OF

$4.85 BILLION INTO TWO FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS

CONSISTING OF $4.0 BILLION FOR QUALIFYING MI CLAIMS AND

$850 MILLION FOR QUALIFYING IS CLAIMS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS

THAT THE PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS WILL BE MET; HOWEVER, IF THEY

ARE NOT, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO WAIVE THE CONDITIONS

OR TERMINATE THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

ACQUISITIONS

 ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2007,

MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA, A PRIVATELY HELD

CLINICAL-STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE. THIS ACQUISITION ADDED ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418),

NOVACARDIAS INVESTIGATIONAL PHASE III COMPOUND FOR

ACUTE HEART FAILURE, TO MERCKS PIPELINE.

JOINT VENTURES

 THE COMPANY HAS A NUMBER OF

JOINT VENTURES RELATING TO ITS PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINES

SEGMENTS.

PHARMACEUTICAL

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE

SEPARATE EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE

UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. IN

DECEMBER 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD,

EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN OCTOBER 2002,

ZETIA (

EZETIMIBE)

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), THE

FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS

LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JULY 2004,

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), A

COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR,

WAS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH SELL

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

THROUGH THEIR JOINT VENTURE COMPANY, MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PHARMACEUTICALS (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP). ON

JANUARY 14, 2008, THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE (EFFECT OF COMBINATION

EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE

ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA) TRIAL. THE MSP PARTNERSHIP SUBMITTED AN

ABSTRACT ON THE ENHANCE TRIAL FOR PRESENTATION AT THE AMERICAN

COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY MEETING IN MARCH 2008 AND WAS NOTIFIED OF

ITS ACCEPTANCE BY THE COLLEGE. ENHANCE WAS A SURROGATE ENDPOINT

TRIAL CONDUCTED IN 720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE CONDITION THAT AFFECTS

APPROXIMATELY 0.2% OF THE POPULATION. ALL ANALYSES WERE

CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORIGINAL STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

PLAN. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS THE MEAN CHANGE IN THE

INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS MEASURED AT THREE SITES IN THE CAROTID

ARTERIES (THE RIGHT AND LEFT COMMON CAROTID, INTERNAL CAROTID

AND CAROTID BULB) BETWEEN PATIENTS TREATED WITH

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN

10/80 MG

VERSUS PATIENTS TREATED WITH SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE OVER A

TWO YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT.

THERE WAS ALSO NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE TREATMENT GROUPS FOR EACH OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT, INCLUDING THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. KEY SECONDARY

IMAGING ENDPOINTS SHOWED NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

TREATMENT GROUPS. THE OVERALL INCIDENCE RATES OF

TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OR

ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION WERE GENERALLY SIMILAR

BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS. BOTH MEDICINES WERE GENERALLY WELL

TOLERATED. OVERALL, THE SAFETY PROFILES OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN

AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE WERE SIMILAR AND GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH

THEIR PRODUCT LABELS. IN THE TRIAL, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE IN LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL)

CHOLESTEROL LOWERING SEEN BETWEEN THE TREATMENT

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GROUPS  58% LDL CHOLESTEROL LOWERING AT

24 MONTHS ON EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AS COMPARED TO 41% AT

24 MONTHS ON SIMVASTATIN ALONE. THIS SURROGATE ENDPOINT

STUDY WAS NOT POWERED NOR DESIGNED TO ASSESS CARDIOVASCULAR

CLINICAL EVENT OUTCOMES. THE MSP PARTNERSHIP IS CURRENTLY

CONDUCTING THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL, A LARGE CLINICAL CARDIOVASCULAR

OUTCOMES TRIAL COMPARING

VYTORIN

(EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN)

AND SIMVASTATIN AND INCLUDING MORE THAN 10,000 PATIENTS.

VYTORIN

CONTAINS TWO MEDICINES: EZETIMIBE AND

SIMVASTATIN.

VYTORIN

HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE HEART

ATTACKS OR STROKES MORE THAN SIMVASTATIN ALONE.

DURING DECEMBER 2007 AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2008, THE

COMPANY AND ITS JOINT-VENTURE PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, RECEIVED

SEVERAL JOINT LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND

COMMERCE AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND

INVESTIGATIONS, AND ONE LETTER FROM THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS

INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES

RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE COMPANIES AND THE MSP PARTNERSHIP

EACH RECEIVED TWO SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS.

MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE ALSO EACH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE OFFICE OF THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED

FEBRUARY 1, 2008 REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE

MARKETING AND SALE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND THE

TIMING OF DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH

SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, SINCE

MID-JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING

COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN EQUALLY

OWNED JOINT VENTURE THAT DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF

ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC

, THE FIRST IN A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS

KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF

ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA RESTRUCTURED THE JOINT VENTURE

WHEREBY THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN THE JOINT

VENTURE, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED

KBIS OPERATING ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE

PARTNERSHIP), IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A

LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED ASTRAZENECA

LP, BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH

KBI RETAINED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY EARNS CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP

RETURNS AS WELL AS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND

FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS. THE PARTNERSHIP RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY

RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, VARIABLE

RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA,

INC. PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED PARTNERSHIP GAAP EARNINGS.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, ASTRA PURCHASED AN OPTION TO BUY THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTED

ASTRA AN OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION) TO BUY THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI, AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES

OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

IN APRIL 1999, ASTRA MERGED WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC, FORMING

ASTRAZENECA AB (ASTRAZENECA). AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPANYS RELINQUISHMENT OF

RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING

U.S. PATENTS AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID

$967.4 MILLION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE MERGER ALSO TRIGGERS A PARTIAL

REDEMPTION OF THE COMPANYS LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN

2008. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, ASTRAZENECAS

OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) TO BUY THE COMPANYS

INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS IS EXERCISABLE IN 2010 AND THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRAZENECA TO PURCHASE SUCH

INTEREST IN 2008. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ADVISED AZLP

THAT IT WILL NOT EXERCISE THE ASSET OPTION. IN ADDITION, THE

SHARES OPTION IS EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS

PURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS. THE

EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION BY ASTRA IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR IN THE

YEAR 2017 OR IF COMBINED ANNUAL SALES OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL

BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG AS

ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 HAS BEEN EXERCISED. THE

EXERCISE PRICE IS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT

THE TIME OF EXERCISE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

TRUE-UP

MECHANISMS.

IN 1989, THE COMPANY FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH

JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO DEVELOP AND MARKET A BROAD RANGE

OF NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS 50%

OWNED JOINT VENTURE ALSO INCLUDES CANADA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIGNIFICANT JOINT VENTURE PRODUCTS ARE

PEPCID AC

(FAMOTIDINE), AN OVER-THE-COUNTER FORM OF THE COMPANYS

ULCER MEDICATION

PEPCID

(FAMOTIDINE), AS WELL AS

PEPCID COMPLETE,

AN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT WHICH

COMBINES THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION WITH ANTACIDS

(CALCIUM CARBONATE AND MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE).

VACCINES

IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW

SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.) FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET HUMAN

VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE THEN EXISTING EU

AND THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY AND SANOFI

PASTEUR CONTRIBUTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEIR EUROPEAN VACCINE

BUSINESSES FOR EQUAL SHARES IN THE JOINT VENTURE, KNOWN AS

PASTEUR MÉRIEUX MSD, S.N.C. (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR MSD,

S.N.C.). THE JOINT VENTURE MAINTAINS A PRESENCE, DIRECTLY OR

THROUGH AFFILIATES OR BRANCHES IN BELGIUM, ITALY, GERMANY,

SPAIN, FRANCE, AUSTRIA, IRELAND, SWEDEN, PORTUGAL, THE

NETHERLANDS, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THROUGH

DISTRIBUTORS IN THE REST OF ITS TERRITORY.

OTHER

IN 1997, THE COMPANY AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW

SANOFI-AVENTIS S.A.) COMBINED THEIR RESPECTIVE ANIMAL HEALTH AND

POULTRY GENETICS BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED

(MERIAL), A FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY,

WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH

PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS

AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE

OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL SPECIES.

COMPETITION

 THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY

REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT

CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

SUCH COMPETITION INVOLVES AN INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO MARKET THESE INNOVATIONS

EFFECTIVELY. WITH ITS LONG-STANDING EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANY IS WELL PREPARED TO COMPETE IN THE

SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MEET COMPETITION INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL, FLEXIBILITY TO MEET

CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS, AN EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND A

STRONG TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVE IN

ACQUIRING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND

LICENSES AND HAS BEEN REFINING ITS SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS

TO FURTHER ADDRESS CHANGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS. TO ENHANCE ITS

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE EXTERNAL

ALLIANCES, FROM EARLY-STAGE TO LATE-STAGE PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES,

INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES AND TARGETED ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES BY COMPETITORS MAY

RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS AND PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS, EVEN FOR

PRODUCTS PROTECTED BY PATENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBER OF

COMPOUNDS AVAILABLE TO TREAT DISEASES TYPICALLY INCREASES OVER

TIME AND HAS RESULTED IN SLOWING THE GROWTH IN SALES OF CERTAIN

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS,

ALLOWS, ENCOURAGES OR, IN A FEW INSTANCES, IN THE ABSENCE OF

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN, MANDATES

THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS (THOSE CONTAINING THE

SAME ACTIVE CHEMICAL AS AN INNOVATORS PRODUCT) RATHER THAN

BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS. GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER

PRESSURES TOWARD THE DISPENSING OF GENERIC PRODUCTS HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY PATENTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR,

WHICH LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE U.S. IN 2006 AND

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES THEREAFTER.

FOSAMAX

LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN

THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008.

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL

LOSE MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2008.

AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT

DECLINES IN U.S.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES.

DISTRIBUTION

 THE COMPANY SELLS ITS HUMAN

HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND

RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS,

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. HUMAN HEALTH

VACCINES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO PHYSICIANS, WHOLESALERS,

PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THE

COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE

EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS

IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE

ORGANIZATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RAW MATERIALS

 RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE

PURCHASED WORLDWIDE AND ARE NORMALLY AVAILABLE IN QUANTITIES

ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL

AND VACCINES SEGMENTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND INVESTIGATION

 THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL REGULATION BY

REGIONAL, COUNTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. OF PARTICULAR

IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ADMINISTERS

REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY,

EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. IN 1997, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

MODERNIZATION ACT (THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT) WAS

PASSED AND WAS THE CULMINATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE

REFORM EFFORT DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE REGULATORY PROCEDURES

WITHIN THE FDA AND TO IMPROVE THE REGULATION OF DRUGS, MEDICAL

DEVICES AND FOOD. THE LEGISLATION WAS PRINCIPALLY DESIGNED TO

ENSURE THE TIMELY AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS AND

BIOLOGICS BY EXPEDITING THE PREMARKET REVIEW PROCESS FOR NEW

PRODUCTS. A KEY PROVISION OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE

RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT OF 1992,

WHICH PERMITS THE CONTINUED COLLECTION OF USER FEES FROM

PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO AUGMENT FDA RESOURCES

EARMARKED FOR THE REVIEW OF HUMAN DRUG APPLICATIONS. THIS HELPS

PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PROMPT APPROVAL OF

SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NEW DRUGS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS

BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER

2003. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING

ACCESS TO MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE

PRESERVING MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

INNOVATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES AND BY ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES.

THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED, AND MAY CONSIDER AGAIN,

PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENTS ROLE IN

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

FOR MANY YEARS, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER

FEDERAL AND STATE OVERSIGHT WITH THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR NEW

DRUGS, DRUG SAFETY, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, DRUG PURCHASING

AND REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND FORMULARIES VARIOUSLY UNDER

REVIEW. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW DRUGS

TO THE MARKET, IN THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. ONE TYPE OF

FEDERAL INITIATIVE TO CONTAIN FEDERAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING IS

THE PROSPECTIVE OR CAPITATED PAYMENT SYSTEM, FIRST

IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE

REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS. SUCH A SYSTEM ESTABLISHES IN ADVANCE

A FLAT RATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE PATIENTS

FOR WHOM THE PAYOR IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. THIS TYPE OF PAYMENT

SYSTEM AND OTHER COST CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS ARE NOW WIDELY USED BY

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYORS AND HAVE CAUSED HOSPITALS, HEALTH

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY TO

BE MORE COST-CONSCIOUS IN THEIR TREATMENT DECISIONS, INCLUDING

DECISIONS REGARDING THE MEDICINES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR

PATIENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO WORK WITH PRIVATE AND FEDERAL

EMPLOYERS TO SLOW INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. FURTHER, THE

COMPANYS EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN

HELP SAVE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF THE

COMPANYS MEDICINES AND HAVE HELPED OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF

INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

ALSO, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED METHODS TO

DIRECTLY REDUCE THE COST OF DRUGS AND VACCINES FOR WHICH THEY

PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PAY

SPECIFIED REBATES FOR MEDICINES REIMBURSED BY MEDICAID, TO

PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR OUTPATIENT MEDICINES PURCHASED BY CERTAIN

PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ENTITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATE

SHARE HOSPITALS (HOSPITALS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA), AND

TO PROVIDE MINIMUM DISCOUNTS OF 24% OFF OF A DEFINED

NON-FEDERAL AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR PURCHASES

BY CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

INITIATIVES IN SOME STATES SEEK REBATES BEYOND THE MINIMUM

REQUIRED BY MEDICAID LEGISLATION, IN SOME CASES FOR PATIENTS

BEYOND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. UNDER THE FEDERAL

VACCINES FOR CHILDREN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM, THE U.S. CENTERS

FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) FUNDS AND

PURCHASES RECOMMENDED PEDIATRIC VACCINES AT A PUBLIC SECTOR

PRICE FOR THE IMMUNIZATION OF MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE, UNINSURED,

NATIVE AMERICAN AND CERTAIN UNDERINSURED CHILDREN. THE COMPANY

WAS AWARDED A CDC CONTRACT IN APRIL 2007 WHICH IS IN EFFECT

UNTIL MARCH 2008 FOR THE SUPPLY OF PEDIATRIC VACCINES FOR THE

VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006,

PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID WHO ARE ALSO MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES (65 YEARS AND OLDER OR DISABLED) LEFT THE

STATE-ADMINISTERED MEDICAID SYSTEM TO BE COVERED BY THE NEW

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ENCOUNTERS SIMILAR

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE

IT DOES BUSINESS. THERE, TOO, THE PRIMARY THRUST OF GOVERNMENTAL

INQUIRY AND ACTION IS TOWARD DETERMINING DRUG SAFETY AND

EFFECTIVENESS, OFTEN WITH MECHANISMS FOR CONTROLLING THE PRICES

OF OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE PROFITS OF

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES. THE EU HAS ADOPTED DIRECTIVES

CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION, LABELING, ADVERTISING, WHOLESALE

DISTRIBUTION AND APPROVAL FOR MARKETING OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

FOR HUMAN USE. THE COMPANYS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE

ALREADY CONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE DIRECTIVES;

CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, RECOGNIZING THE

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY, ARE

WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE

CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING MARKET DEREGULATION.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS CONDUCTING A PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR

INQUIRY INVOLVING A NUMBER OF COMPANIES CONCERNING COMPETITION

AND THE INTRODUCTION OF INNOVATIVE AND GENERIC MEDICINES. AS

PART OF ITS INQUIRY, THE COMPANYS OFFICES IN GERMANY WERE

INSPECTED BY THE AUTHORITIES BEGINNING ON JANUARY 15, 2008.

THE COMMISSION HAS NOT ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES HAVE ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL PRACTICES. THE COMPANY

IS COOPERATING WITH THE COMMISSION IN THIS SECTOR INQUIRY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN MAY 2007 THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL

ISSUED A COMPULSORY LICENSE FOR

STOCRIN

, WHICH MAKES IT

POSSIBLE FOR

STOCRIN

TO BE PRODUCED BY A GENERIC

MANUFACTURER DESPITE THE COMPANYS PATENT PROTECTION ON

STOCRIN

. IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND

STATED THAT IT HAD ISSUED A COMPULSORY LICENSE FOR

STOCRIN

, DESPITE THE COMPANYS PATENT PROTECTION ON

STOCRIN

, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND CONTENDS MAKES

IT POSSIBLE FOR

STOCRIN

TO BE PRODUCED BY A GENERIC

MANUFACTURER. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO EXPLORING

MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF BRAZIL

AND THAILAND.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND IS, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE

ACTIONS. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

COMPANY ON ITS OWN MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT

RECALLS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS GLOBALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

 PATENT

PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH

PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS.

PATENTS MAY COVER PRODUCTS

PER SE

, PHARMACEUTICAL

FORMULATIONS, PROCESSES FOR OR INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE USES OF PRODUCTS. PROTECTION FOR

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTENDS FOR VARYING PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE LEGAL LIFE OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE

PROTECTION AFFORDED, WHICH MAY ALSO VARY FROM COUNTRY TO

COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT AND ITS SCOPE OF

COVERAGE.

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB (BMS),

UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE FROM THE COMPANY, SELLS SUSTIVA IN

THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE

COMPANY MARKETS

STOCRIN

IN OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. THE BASIC PATENT FOR

AGGRASTAT

(TIROFIBAN

HYDROCHLORIDE) IN THE UNITED STATES WAS DIVESTED WITH THE

PRODUCT IN 2003. THE COMPANY RETAINS BASIC PATENTS FOR

AGGRASTAT

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT INCLUDES A PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY

PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INDICATIONS OF NEW OR

CURRENTLY MARKETED DRUGS IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON PEDIATRIC

STUDIES ARE COMPLETED BY THE APPLICANT. THESE EXCLUSIVITY

PROVISIONS WERE RE-AUTHORIZED BY THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE

ACT PASSED IN SEPTEMBER 2007. CURRENT U.S. PATENT LAW

PROVIDES ADDITIONAL PATENT TERM UNDER PATENT TERM RESTORATION

FOR PERIODS WHEN THE PATENTED PRODUCT WAS UNDER REGULATORY

REVIEW BEFORE THE FDA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO

THE COMPANYS PATENTS, SEE PATENT LITIGATION

BELOW.

WHILE THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT NORMALLY RESULTS IN A

LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR THE COVERED PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCT, COMMERCIAL BENEFITS MAY CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED FROM.

(I) LATER-GRANTED PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES

RELATED TO THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF SUCH PRODUCT; (II) PATENTS RELATING TO

THE USE OF SUCH PRODUCT; (III) PATENTS RELATING TO NOVEL

COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS; AND (IV) IN THE UNITED

STATES, MARKET EXCLUSIVITY THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER FEDERAL

LAW. THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRATION ON PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON MANY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE NATURE

OF THE MARKET AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT, THE GROWTH

OF THE MARKET, THE COMPLEXITIES AND ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS FOR

MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF THE PRODUCT AND THE

REQUIREMENTS OF NEW DRUG PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG

AND COSMETIC ACT OR SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES.

ADDITIONS TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES

AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH ALL RELEVANT LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS

INCREASING PATENT LIFE. SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INCREASES IN

PATENT LIFE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A GENERAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF, INCENTIVES FOR AND USE

OF GENERIC PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LAWS ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

COUNTRIES THROUGH REFORM OF PATENT AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES.

WORLDWIDE, ALL OF THE COMPANYS IMPORTANT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD

UNDER TRADEMARKS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME

COUNTRIES AS LONG AS USED; IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS LONG AS

REGISTERED. REGISTRATION IS FOR FIXED TERMS AND CAN BE RENEWED

INDEFINITELY.

ROYALTIES RECEIVED DURING 2007 ON PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES

AND OTHER RIGHTS AMOUNTED TO $156.4 MILLION. THE COMPANY

ALSO PAID ROYALTIES AMOUNTING TO $1.326 BILLION IN 2007

UNDER PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES IT HOLDS.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE INTRODUCTION

OF NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH A

STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY

11,700 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THE COMPANYS RESEARCH

ACTIVITIES. EXPENDITURES FOR THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WERE $4.9 BILLION IN 2007,

$4.8 BILLION IN 2006 AND $3.8 BILLION IN 2005. THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ONGOING COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH OVER A

BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT IN

SUPPORT OF NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL

AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MERCKS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS DESIGNED TO

INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS BY

PRIORITIZING THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESOURCES ON DISEASE AREAS SUCH AS ATHEROSCLEROSIS,

HYPERTENSION, DIABETES AND OBESITY, NOVEL VACCINES,

NEURODEGENERATIVE AND PSYCHIATRIC DISEASES AND TARGETED ONCOLOGY

THERAPIES. THESE THERAPEUTIC AREAS WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN BASED

ON A SET OF CRITERIA INCLUDING UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, SCIENTIFIC

OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. WITHIN THESE THERAPEUTIC

AREAS, MERCK WILL COMMIT RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE RESEARCH BREADTH

AND DEPTH AND TO DEVELOP

BEST-IN-CLASS

TARGETED AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT ARE VALUED HIGHLY BY

PATIENTS, PAYERS AND PHYSICIANS.

THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MAKE FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN OTHER AREAS OF

IMPORTANT UNMET MEDICAL NEED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL

CONTINUE TO PURSUE APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS, INDUSTRY PRACTICE

AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST FOREIGN

COUNTRIES PROVIDE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVENESS AND

SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THROUGH PRECLINICAL TESTS AND

CONTROLLED CLINICAL EVALUATION. BEFORE A NEW DRUG MAY BE

MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES, RECORDED DATA ON PRECLINICAL AND

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ARE INCLUDED IN THE NDA OR THE BIOLOGICS

LICENSE APPLICATION TO THE FDA FOR THE REQUIRED APPROVAL. THE

DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COVERING SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN THE

UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

ONCE THE COMPANYS SCIENTISTS DISCOVER A NEW COMPOUND THAT

THEY BELIEVE HAS PROMISE TO TREAT A MEDICAL CONDITION, THE

COMPANY COMMENCES PRECLINICAL TESTING WITH THAT COMPOUND.

PRECLINICAL TESTING INCLUDES LABORATORY TESTING AND ANIMAL

SAFETY STUDIES TO GATHER DATA ON CHEMISTRY, PHARMACOLOGY AND

TOXICOLOGY. PENDING ACCEPTABLE PRECLINICAL DATA, THE COMPANY

WILL INITIATE CLINICAL TESTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ESTABLISHED

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE CLINICAL TESTING BEGINS WITH PHASE

I STUDIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ASSESS SAFETY, TOLERABILITY,

PHARMACOKINETICS, AND PRELIMINARY PHARMACODYNAMIC ACTIVITY OF

THE COMPOUND IN HUMANS. IF FAVORABLE, ADDITIONAL, LARGER

PHASE II STUDIES ARE INITIATED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF

THE COMPOUND IN THE AFFECTED POPULATION, DEFINE APPROPRIATE

DOSING FOR THE COMPOUND, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS

THAT COULD LIMIT THE COMPOUNDS USEFULNESS. IF DATA FROM

THE PHASE II TRIALS ARE SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY COMMENCES

LARGE-SCALE PHASE III TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE COMPOUNDS

EFFICACY AND SAFETY. UPON COMPLETION OF THOSE TRIALS, IF

SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY SUBMITS REGULATORY FILINGS WITH THE

APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD TO HAVE THE

PRODUCT CANDIDATE APPROVED FOR MARKETING. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT A COMPOUND THAT IS THE RESULT OF ANY PARTICULAR

PROGRAM WILL OBTAIN THE REGULATORY APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR IT TO

BE MARKETED.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA REVIEW PROCESS BEGINS ONCE A

COMPLETE NDA IS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED BY THE FDA. PURSUANT TO

THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT, THE FDA REVIEW PERIOD

TARGETS FOR NDAS OR SUPPLEMENTAL NDAS IS EITHER SIX MONTHS, FOR

PRIORITY REVIEW, OR TEN MONTHS, FOR A STANDARD REVIEW. WITHIN

60 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF AN NDA, THE FDA DETERMINES IF THE

APPLICATION IS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE TO PERMIT A SUBSTANTIVE

REVIEW. THE FDA ALSO ASSESSES, AT THAT TIME, WHETHER THE

APPLICATION WILL BE GRANTED A PRIORITY REVIEW OR STANDARD

REVIEW. ONCE THE REVIEW TIMELINES ARE DEFINED, THE FDA WILL ACT

UPON THE APPLICATION WITHIN THOSE TIMELINES, UNLESS A MAJOR

AMENDMENT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED (EITHER AT THE COMPANYS OWN

INITIATIVE OR THE FDAS REQUEST) TO THE PENDING

APPLICATION. IF THIS OCCURS, THE FDA MAY EXTEND THE REVIEW

PERIOD TO ALLOW FOR REVIEW OF THE NEW INFORMATION, BUT BY NO

MORE THAN 180 DAYS. EXTENSIONS TO THE REVIEW PERIOD ARE

COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY. THE FDA CAN ACT ON AN APPLICATION

BY ISSUING AN APPROVAL LETTER, A NON-APPROVABLE LETTER, OR AN

APPROVABLE LETTER.

THE COMPANY HAS ONE DRUG CANDIDATE CURRENTLY UNDER FDA REVIEW.

IN AUGUST 2007, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW THE NDA FOR

CORDAPTIVE

, THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND

CONTAINING MERCKS OWN ER NIACIN AND LAROPIPRANT, A NOVEL

FLUSHING PATHWAY INHIBITOR DESIGNED TO REDUCE FLUSHING OFTEN

ASSOCIATED WITH NIACIN TREATMENT. MERCK ANTICIPATES FDA ACTION

IN APRIL 2008. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MOVING FORWARD AS PLANNED

WITH FILINGS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING TWO NDAS WITH THE FDA IN 2008.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA FOR MK-0524B, A DRUG

CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES THE NOVEL APPROACH TO RAISING

HDL-CHOLESTEROL AND LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES FROM ER NIACIN

COMBINED WITH LAROPIPRANT WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF

SIMVASTATIN IN ONE COMBINATION PRODUCT. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE

COMPANY PRESENTED RESULTS OF A STUDY AT THE AMERICAN HEART

ASSOCIATION 2007 SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS WHICH DEMONSTRATE ER

NIACIN/LAROPIPRANT (

CORDAPTIVE)

COADMINISTERED WITH

SIMVASTATIN HAD SIGNIFICANT ADDITIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING LDL-C,

INCREASING HDL-C AND REDUCING TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS IN A

PHASE III STUDY WITH PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA OR MIXED DYSLIPIDEMIA. IN THE STUDY, 2 G

(TWO 1-GRAM TABLETS) OF

CORDAPTIVE

COADMINISTERED WITH

SIMVASTATIN (POOLED ACROSS 20 MG OR 40 MG DOSES)

REDUCED LDL-C BY 48%, INCREASED HDL-C BY 28%, AND REDUCED

TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS BY 33% FOLLOWING 12 WEEKS OF TREATMENT.

THE PRIMARY STUDY ENDPOINT WAS LDL-C REDUCTION; SECONDARY

ENDPOINTS INCLUDED INCREASED HDL-C, TRIGLYCERIDE REDUCTION AND

EFFECTS ON OTHER LIPOPROTEINS. A 1 G TABLET OF

CORDAPTIVE

CONTAINS 1 G OF MERCK-DEVELOPED ER NIACIN AND 20 MG OF

LAROPIPRANT.

THE COMPANY ALSO ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA FOR MK-0364,

TARANABANT, A HIGHLY SELECTIVE CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR INVERSE

AGONIST THAT IN EARLY CLINICAL STUDIES HAS DEMONSTRATED WEIGHT

LOSS VERSUS PLACEBO. TARANABANT WAS GENERALLY WELL-TOLERATED,

HOWEVER, AS REPORTED WITH ANOTHER CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR INVERSE

AGONIST, SOME DOSE-DEPENDENT PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS WERE

OBSERVED. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THE INITIATION OF A

TARGETED PHASE III PROGRAM IN 2006.

MERCK CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN PRODUCTS IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT

(INCLUDING MK-0524B AND MK-0364 DISCUSSED ABOVE).

MK-0974, AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE

RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, UTILIZES A NEW MECHANISM FOR THE TREATMENT

OF MIGRAINES THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY AT LEAST COMPARABLE

TO TRIPTANS IN EARLY CLINICAL STUDIES. IN JUNE 2007, CLINICAL

RESULTS FROM A PHASE II STUDY WERE PRESENTED FOR THE FIRST

TIME AT THE AMERICAN HEADACHE SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING WHICH

SHOWED THAT MK-0974 SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MIGRAINE PAIN RELIEF

TWO HOURS AFTER DOSING COMPARED TO PLACEBO, AND THE RELIEF WAS

SUSTAINED THROUGH 24 HOURS. MK-0974 WAS GENERALLY WELL

TOLERATED IN THE STUDY. IN ADDITION TO THE MEASURE OF MIGRAINE

PAIN, MK-0974 PROVIDED RELIEF OF MIGRAINE-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS,

INCLUDING NAUSEA AND SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT AND SOUND, AND

IMPROVED FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY TWO HOURS POST DOSE, AS WELL AS

REDUCED PATIENTS NEED FOR RESCUE MEDICATION. THE DRUG

CANDIDATE ENTERED PHASE III DEVELOPMENT DURING 2007. THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA IN 2009.

MK-7418, ROLOFYLLINE, IS A PHASE III INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG

BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE HEART FAILURE.

PHASE III PILOT STUDY PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATED THAT

ROLOFYLLINE WAS GENERALLY WELL TOLERATED AND THAT TREATMENT

RESULTED IN A GREATER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WITH IMPROVED

DYSPNEA, FEWER PATIENTS WITH WORSENING HEART FAILURE AND GREATER

WEIGHT LOSS COMPARED TO PLACEBO. THESE BENEFITS WERE ACHIEVED

WHILE PRESERVING RENAL FUNCTION COMPARED TO PROGRESSIVE

WORSENING OF RENAL FUNCTION IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH PLACEBO.

MERCK ACQUIRED THE DRUG CANDIDATE AS PART OF THE 2007

ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA AND ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE

FDA IN 2009.

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MK-8669, DEFOROLIMUS, IS A NOVEL MTOR (MAMMALIAN TARGET OF

RAPAMYCIN) INHIBITOR BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF

CANCER. THE DRUG CANDIDATE IS BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED AND

COMMERCIALIZED WITH ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. UNDER AN

AGREEMENT REACHED IN MID-2007. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN

NDA FOR A METASTATIC SARCOMA INDICATION IN 2010.

A NOVEL INVESTIGATIONAL HEPATITIS B VACCINE, V270, CURRENTLY IS

BEING EVALUATED IN A PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL IN ADULTS AND

IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING DIALYSIS TREATMENT. MERCK IS JOINTLY

DEVELOPING V270 WITH DYNAVAX TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

(DYNAVAX) UNDER AN AGREEMENT REACHED IN LATE 2007.

MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA IN 2010 FOR ADULTS.

MK-0822, ODANACATIB, IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL HIGHLY SELECTIVE

INHIBITOR OF CATHEPSIN K ENZYME, WHICH IS BEING EVALUATED FOR

THE TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS. THE CATHEPSIN K ENZYME IS

BELIEVED TO PLAY A ROLE IN BOTH OSTEOCLASTIC BONE RESORPTION AND

IN DEGRADING THE PROTEIN COMPONENT OF BONE. THE INHIBITION OF

THE CATHEPSIN K ENZYME BY THE INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND

ODANACATIB IS A MECHANISM OF ACTION DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF

CURRENTLY APPROVED TREATMENTS SUCH AS BISPHOSPHONATES. IN

SEPTEMBER 2007, TWELVE MONTH RESULTS FROM A PHASE IIB STUDY WITH

ODANACATIB DEMONSTRATED DOSE-DEPENDENT INCREASES IN BONE MINERAL

DENSITY (BMD) AT KEY FRACTURE SITES, AND REDUCED

BONE TURNOVER COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH

LOW BMD WHEN GIVEN AT DOSES OF 10, 25 OR 50 MG. THESE

FINDINGS WERE PRESENTED AT THE 29TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE

AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH. BMD REFLECTS THE

AMOUNT OF MINERALIZED BONE TISSUE IN A CERTAIN VOLUME OF BONE,

AND CORRELATES WITH THE STRENGTH OF BONES AND WITH THEIR

RESISTANCE TO FRACTURE. A BMD TEST IS USED TO MEASURE BONE

DENSITY AND TO HELP DETERMINE FRACTURE RISK. THE PHASE III

PROGRAM BEGAN IN MID-2007. MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH

THE FDA IN 2012.

ADDITIONALLY, IN DECEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT PLANS

TO INITIATE A SEQUENCED PHASE III PROGRAM IN 2008 FOR

MK-0859, ANACETRAPIB, ITS INVESTIGATIONAL SELECTIVE CHOLESTERYL

ESTER TRANSFER PROTEIN (CETP) INHIBITOR, TO OBTAIN

ADDITIONAL CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN PATIENTS BEFORE INITIATING AN

OUTCOMES STUDY. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY PRESENTED RESULTS

FROM A PHASE IIB STUDY DEMONSTRATING THAT MK-0859 SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCED LDL-C AND APOLIPOPROTEIN B AND INCREASED HDL-C AND

APOLIPOPROTEIN

A-1

BOTH AS

MONOTHERAPY AND IN COMBINATION WITH ATORVASTATIN 20 MG

COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIA. ANACETRAPIB

PRODUCED THESE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON LIPIDS WITH NO OBSERVED BLOOD

PRESSURE CHANGES. CETP INHIBITORS WORK BY INHIBITING CETP, A

PLASMA PROTEIN THAT FACILITATES THE TRANSPORT OF CHOLESTERYL

ESTERS AND TRIGLYCERIDES BETWEEN THE LIPOPROTEINS.

THE COMPANYS CLINICAL PIPELINE INCLUDES CANDIDATES IN

MULTIPLE DISEASE AREAS, INCLUDING ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CANCER, HEART

FAILURE, HYPERTENSION, INFECTIOUS DISEASES, MIGRAINE,

NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, PSYCHIATRIC DISEASES, OPHTHALMIC

DISEASES, PAIN, AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE. THE COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS

ITS INTERNAL RESEARCH WITH AN AGGRESSIVE LICENSING AND EXTERNAL

ALLIANCE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF

COLLABORATIONS FROM EARLY RESEARCH TO LATE-STAGE COMPOUNDS, AS

WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY COMPLETED 55 TRANSACTIONS

IN 2007, INCLUDING TARGETED ACQUISITIONS, RESEARCH

COLLABORATIONS, PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS, AND

TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC

CATEGORIES.

IN JULY 2007, MERCK AND ARIAD ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD ENTERED

INTO A GLOBAL COLLABORATION TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

DEFOROLIMUS (MK-8669), ARIADS NOVEL MTOR INHIBITOR, FOR

USE IN CANCER.

IN NOVEMBER 2007, DYNAVAX AND MERCK ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL LICENSE

AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENT TO JOINTLY DEVELOP V270,

WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN A MULTI-CENTER

PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL INVOLVING ADULTS AND IN PATIENTS

ON DIALYSIS.

ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2007, GTX, INC. (GTX) AND MERCK

ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

AND GLOBAL STRATEGIC COLLABORATION FOR SELECTIVE ANDROGEN

RECEPTOR MODULATORS (SARMS), A NEW CLASS OF DRUGS

WITH THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT AGE-RELATED MUSCLE LOSS (SARCOPENIA)

AS WELL AS OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. THIS COLLABORATION

INCLUDES GTXS LEAD SARM CANDIDATE, OSTARINE (MK-2866),

WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN A PHASE II CLINICAL

TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF MUSCLE LOSS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER,

AND ESTABLISHES A BROAD SARM COLLABORATION UNDER WHICH GTX AND

MERCK WILL POOL THEIR PROGRAMS AND PARTNER TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP,

AND COMMERCIALIZE CURRENT AS WELL AS FUTURE SARM MOLECULES.

AT THE END OF 2007, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY

59,800 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 31,700

EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO.

APPROXIMATELY 20% OF WORLDWIDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY ARE

REPRESENTED BY VARIOUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS.

AS PART OF A COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER 2003

AND COMPLETED AT THE END OF 2004, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED 5,100

POSITIONS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN 2005 WITH

900 POSITIONS BEING ELIMINATED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2005.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST PHASE OF A

GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. THE INITIAL STEPS INCLUDED

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK

MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER,

MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AS PART OF THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT EXPECTED TO ELIMINATE

APPROXIMATELY 7,000 POSITIONS IN MANUFACTURING AND OTHER

DIVISIONS WORLDWIDE BY THE END OF 2008. ABOUT HALF OF THE

POSITION REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE UNITED STATES,

WITH THE REMAINDER IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, THERE HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 7,200 POSITIONS ELIMINATED

THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY SINCE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM

(APPROXIMATELY 2,400 OF WHICH WERE ELIMINATED DURING 2007

COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF

CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS). THE COMPANY, HOWEVER,

CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES AS THE BUSINESS REQUIRES. MERCK

PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO SELL OR CLOSE FIVE OF ITS

31 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WORLDWIDE AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES

AND TO REDUCE OPERATIONS AT A NUMBER OF OTHER SITES. THROUGH THE

END OF 2007, FOUR OF THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES HAD BEEN

CLOSED, SOLD, OR HAD CEASED OPERATIONS, AND THE TWO PRECLINICAL

SITES WERE CLOSED. THE REMAINING FACILITY WAS SOLD IN JANUARY

2008. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO SOLD CERTAIN OTHER FACILITIES AND

RELATED ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN

2007, THE COMPANY INCURRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY

$9.3 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FACILITIES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES.

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE

$19.5 MILLION IN 2007, $12.6 MILLION IN 2006, AND ARE

ESTIMATED AT $69.1 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2008 THROUGH 2011.

THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM OTHER

PARTIES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND

PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND, IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE

LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS WHICH ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND TOTALED

$109.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. ALTHOUGH IT IS

NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF REMEDIATION,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY POSSIBLE

EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE LIABILITIES

ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $54.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE.

MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE EXPENDITURES SHOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES

FOR ANY YEAR.

GEOGRAPHIC

AREA INFORMATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE

CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES. SALES WORLDWIDE BY

SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE 39% OF SALES IN

2007, 39% OF SALES IN 2006 AND 42% OF SALES IN 2005.

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AND OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ABROAD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REGARD

THESE RISKS AS A DETERRENT TO FURTHER EXPANSION OF ITS

OPERATIONS ABROAD. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CLOSELY REVIEWS ITS

METHODS OF OPERATIONS AND ADOPTS STRATEGIES RESPONSIVE TO

CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPANDING ITS OPERATIONS

IN COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA,

EASTERN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC WHERE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT

POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE

COMPANY TO EARN FAIR RETURNS. BUSINESS IN THESE DEVELOPING

AREAS, WHILE SOMETIMES LESS STABLE, OFFERS IMPORTANT

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH OVER TIME.

THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION, FROM THE

MARKET WORLDWIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY

26,500 PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY

47,275 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING

FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX,

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 262 PURPORTED CLASS

ACTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF

VIOXX.

(ALL OF THESE SUITS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS.) AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007,

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT

COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PLAINTIFFS

STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS

COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE

COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MYOCARDIAL

INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC STROKE (IS)

CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS

SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE

FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE THAN

95 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

APPLIES ONLY TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE

THAT THEIR MI OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, IF, BY MARCH 1, 2008

(SUBJECT TO EXTENSION), PLAINTIFFS ENROLL IN THE RESOLUTION

PROCESS (THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM) AT LEAST

85 PERCENT OF EACH OF ALL CURRENTLY PENDING AND TOLLED

(I) MI CLAIMS, (II) IS CLAIMS, (III) ELIGIBLE MI

AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH INVOLVE DEATH, AND

(IV) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS WHICH TOGETHER ALLEGE MORE

THAN 12 MONTHS OF USE, MERCK WILL PAY AN AGGREGATE OF

$4.85 BILLION INTO TWO FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS

CONSISTING OF $4.0 BILLION FOR QUALIFYING MI CLAIMS AND

$850 MILLION FOR QUALIFYING IS CLAIMS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS

THAT THE PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS WILL BE MET; HOWEVER, IF THEY

ARE NOT, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO WAIVE THE CONDITIONS

OR TERMINATE THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

CLAIMS OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REMAIN PENDING

IN THE NEW JERSEY COURT, AND COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A

LARGE NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS HAS THREATENED TO FILE

NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL SUCH ACTIONS. ACTIVITY IN THE PENDING CASES

IS CURRENTLY STAYED.

THERE ARE ALSO PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL

PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND CLAIMING EITHER

REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS OR AN ENTITLEMENT TO

MEDICAL MONITORING. ALL OF THESE CASES ARE AT EARLY PROCEDURAL

STAGES, AND NO CLASS HAS BEEN CERTIFIED. IN NEW JERSEY, THE

TRIAL COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT IN THE CASE OF SINCLAIR, A

PURPORTED STATEWIDE MEDICAL MONITORING CLASS. THE APPELLATE

DIVISION REVERSED THE DISMISSAL, AND THE ISSUE IS NOW ON APPEAL

TO THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT. THAT COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON

OCTOBER 22, 2007.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS HAVE

BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY

MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN

VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND

FORMER EMPLOYEES,

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).

(ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS.) IN ADDITION, SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE

SUITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FILED AND DISMISSED ARE NOW ON APPEAL

AND SEVERAL SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED DEMANDS WITH THE COMPANY

ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD MEMBERS AND COMPANY OFFICERS.

(ALL OF THESE SUITS AND DEMANDS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH

THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

ERISA

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS.)

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN

VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE SUITS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN SUED BY SEVEN STATES

AND TWO COUNTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS RELATING TO

VIOXX

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANY

CONCERNING

VIOXX.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS

ISSUED A SUBPOENA REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS

BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL

FROM THIRTY-ONE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE

CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS SALES AND

MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH

AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. (ALL OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.) THE COMPANY CAN NOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER, THEY COULD

RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

TO DATE, IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION,

JURIES HAVE DECIDED IN MERCKS FAVOR 12 TIMES AND IN

PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FIVE TIMES. ONE MERCK VERDICT WAS SET

ASIDE BY THE COURT AND HAS NOT BEEN RETRIED. ANOTHER MERCK

VERDICT WAS SET ASIDE AND RETRIED, LEADING TO ONE OF THE FIVE

PLAINTIFF VERDICTS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO UNRESOLVED MISTRIALS.

WITH RESPECT TO THE FIVE PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK

ALREADY HAS FILED AN APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF

THOSE CASES, AND IN ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE

OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION IS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

THE OUTCOMES OF THESE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS

SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED TO INDICATE ANY TREND OR WHAT OUTCOME

MAY BE LIKELY IN FUTURE

VIOXX

TRIALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2008. A TRIAL IN

THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2008, BUT THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE

COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY SPENT $616 MILLION, INCLUDING

$200 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN THE AGGREGATE IN

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS

(COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$210 MILLION AND IN THE THIRD QUARTER IT RECORDED ANOTHER

CHARGE OF $70 MILLION, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR

ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION FROM $858 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

TO $522 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN ADDITION, AS

NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF

$4.85 BILLION EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO

THE QUALIFYING CLAIMANTS IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THUS, THE

COMPANYS TOTAL RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $5.372 BILLION (THE



VIOXX

RESERVE). THE

VIOXX

RESERVE IS

BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2009.

THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY ADDITIONAL

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN CONNECTION

WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS AND

THE COMPANY HAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO THE COURSE THE

PROCEEDINGS WILL TAKE. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF

PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE

ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES,

THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS,

AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR

RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT

INCLUDED IN THE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES

FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING IN THE PAYMENT OF

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

IN EXCESS OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND, WHEN THAT OCCURS,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE

MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS

PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAVE

RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION

FROM LOWER PRICE GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR

ONE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO A RAPID

LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED GENERIC VERSIONS

OF THAT DRUG BECOME AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT

CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPANYS SALES, THE LOSS

OF PATENT PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOSAMAX

LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN

FEBRUARY 2008.

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE MARKETING

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2008. AS A RESULT OF

THESE EVENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

U.S.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES.

U.S. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WERE

$2.0 BILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN 2007. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE SODIUM

PRODUCTS IN SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA

AND GERMANY.

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT

SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND THE

COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS; IN CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST

PATENT PROTECTION.

LIKE OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS

EACH YEAR. DECLINES IN SALES OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

MEAN THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE

SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

NEW PRODUCTS WHICH IT DEVELOPS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND

PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH LICENSE OR

ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMPANY COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL

EFFORT, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES, AND THROUGH VARIOUS

COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THE COMPANY MUST MAKE ONGOING, SUBSTANTIAL

EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFORTS IT IS

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN A COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT. THE

COMPANY MUST ALSO COMMIT SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS, FUNDS AND OTHER

RESOURCES TO RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGH QUALITY SCIENTISTS

AND OTHER PERSONNEL WITH PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPERTISE.

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, SEE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ABOVE. EACH PHASE OF

TESTING IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A

SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER SERIOUS

OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE

COMPANY MAY ABANDON A PRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY. SOME OF THE RISKS

ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND MAY YIELD

DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL

SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ITS

INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A

NEW DRUG; OR SALES OF A NEW PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

THE COMPANY CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF

ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL BE LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT

WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE COMPOUNDS,

PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE

LAUNCHED, WILL BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND

SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING

PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER ITS SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS

PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

,

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING PRODUCTS

OR

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

ISSUES CONCERNING

VYTORIN

AND THE ENHANCE CLINICAL

TRIAL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH SELL

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

THROUGH THEIR JOINT VENTURE COMPANY, MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PHARMACEUTICALS (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP). ON

JANUARY 14, 2008, THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE (EFFECT OF COMBINATION

EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE

ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA) TRIAL. ENHANCE WAS A SURROGATE ENDPOINT

TRIAL CONDUCTED IN 720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE CONDITION THAT AFFECTS

APPROXIMATELY 0.2% OF THE POPULATION. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS

THE MEAN CHANGE IN THE INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS MEASURED AT THREE

SITES IN THE CAROTID ARTERIES (THE RIGHT AND LEFT COMMON

CAROTID, INTERNAL CAROTID AND CAROTID BULB) BETWEEN PATIENTS

TREATED WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN

10/80 MG

VERSUS PATIENTS TREATED WITH SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE OVER A

TWO YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT.

THERE WAS ALSO NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE TREATMENT GROUPS FOR EACH OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT, INCLUDING THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY.

DURING DECEMBER 2007 AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2008, THE

COMPANY AND ITS JOINT-VENTURE PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, RECEIVED

SEVERAL JOINT LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND

COMMERCE AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND

INVESTIGATIONS, AND ONE LETTER FROM THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS

INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES

RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE COMPANIES AND THE MSP PARTNERSHIP

EACH RECEIVED TWO SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS.

MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE ALSO EACH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE OFFICE OF THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED

FEBRUARY 1, 2008, REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE

MARKETING AND SALE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND THE

TIMING OF DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH

SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, SINCE

MID-JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING

COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE ENHANCE CLINICAL

TRIAL RESULTS IN A PRESS RELEASE ON JANUARY 14, 2008. TO

DATE, SALES OF BOTH PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN BELOW THE

COMPANYS PRIOR EXPECTATIONS. IN ADDITION, WHOLESALERS IN

THE U.S. HAVE MODERATED THEIR PURCHASES OF BOTH PRODUCTS TO

REDUCE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS.

THESE ISSUES CONCERNING THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

IF SALES OF SUCH PRODUCTS ARE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH

FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS

COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION,

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS OR THE CONSUMER FRAUD LITIGATION CONCERNING THE

SALE AND PROMOTION OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS THE COMPANY OBTAINS AND

MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL

TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING ITS

PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE FDA IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY, AS

IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL,

SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO IS

PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY

CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL

DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, TO DELAY OR WITHHOLD

REGISTRATION AND MARKETING APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE PRODUCT

WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT

WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND

UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE

OBTAINED, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS

TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE APPROVAL

IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL,

SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, OR ITS FAILURE TO

MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM

SELLING THE NEW PRODUCTS IN THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS

OBTAINED, IF EVER. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE

REVENUES FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT

DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS

PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS

WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN

HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN

MARKETS. PATENTS COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED

NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SEEKS

PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS

WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND WHERE MEANINGFUL

PATENT PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS

PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES OR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE

OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT

APPLICATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TO

DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN

PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO ITS PATENTS OR

INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS ITS IMPORTANT PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION BELOW. IN

PARTICULAR, MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS

FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS

(ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY NORMALLY

RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS PATENT, INCLUDING BY FILING

LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT LITIGATION AND

OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS ARE COSTLY AND

UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE THE COMPANY OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES, THIRD PARTY PATENTS

MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING AND SELLING A PRODUCT IN

A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN

PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO

DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE

PRODUCTS BECOMING AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST SALES UNLESS

AND UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY

SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC

PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM

LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS

PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN

SOME COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN

IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICAL

PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO

LEGISLATION WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS

PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE

EMERGENCE OF GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED

PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES, REDUCING THE COMPANYS

SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR

THE COMPANYS DRUGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION, PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR

LEGISLATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND RAPID APPROVAL OF

GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED INTO LAW COULD

WORSEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION MAY INCREASE AS NEW

PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE SAFER OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR

MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION,

THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE SOLD

AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

AS A RESULT, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE

POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY FACES PRICING PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO ITS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICE

PRESSURES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN THE

UNITED STATES. THESE INCLUDE (I) PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE

GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASERS AND

(II) U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, INCLUDING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003

ACT).

THE 2003 ACT INCLUDED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR

INDIVIDUALS WHICH FIRST WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1,

2006. THE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE

ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD RESULT IN FURTHER

PRICING PRESSURES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PRICING PRESSURES TO

INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS IN THE

MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS INHERENT IN

MANUFACTURING ITS PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY ITS VACCINES, SUCH AS

(I) FAILURE OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS VENDORS OR

SUPPLIERS TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES

AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

GUIDELINES THAT COULD LEAD TO MANUFACTURING SHUTDOWNS, PRODUCT

SHORTAGES AND DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING;

(II) CONSTRUCTION DELAYS RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW

FACILITIES OR THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING FACILITIES, INCLUDING

THOSE INTENDED TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS; AND (III) OTHER MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION

PROBLEMS INCLUDING CHANGES IN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION SITES AND

LIMITS TO MANUFACTURING CAPACITY DUE TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

CHANGES IN TYPES OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED, OR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS

THAT COULD IMPACT CONTINUOUS SUPPLY. MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES

CAN RESULT IN PRODUCT SHORTAGES, LEADING TO LOST SALES.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CAN DEVELOP UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR

EFFICACY CONCERNS.

UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR EFFICACY CONCERNS CAN ARISE WITH RESPECT TO

MARKETED PRODUCTS, WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED,

LEADING TO PRODUCT RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS, OR DECLINING SALES, AS

WELL AS PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER FRAUD

AND/OR

OTHER

CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY HAS NO PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR PRODUCTS

FIRST SOLD AFTER AUGUST 1, 2004.

AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE

HAS BECOME LESS AVAILABLE WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS

DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF OBTAINING PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS

AVAILABLE AND AS SUCH, HAS NO INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT

LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY

FOR PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD AFTER THAT DATE.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS.

ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, PRICING, SALES,

LITIGATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND AGENCY REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION

REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN

IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS

SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS,

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WILL, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS,

PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN

ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY

TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO

ADDRESS THE COMPANYS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT POTENTIAL, AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH

STATEMENT AND SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF OTHER RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE

NOT. NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL

FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ASSUME

THE OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. THE

COMPANY CAUTIONS YOU NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.



SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX

, INCLUDING

WHETHER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WILL BE CONSUMMATED.



COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AS THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION.



INCREASED BRAND COMPETITION IN THERAPEUTIC AREAS

IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.



THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A DRUG

CANDIDATE CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE

LATE-STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY

APPROVAL. NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING IN

DEVELOPMENT BUT FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR

SAFETY CONCERNS, THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN NECESSARY REGULATORY

APPROVALS, THE DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE

AND/OR

THE

INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF

OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE

DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.



PRICING PRESSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD,

INCLUDING RULES AND PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS, JUDICIAL

DECISIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM, PHARMACEUTICAL

REIMBURSEMENT AND PRICING IN GENERAL.



CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT

THEREOF AFFECTING THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.



EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO MARKETED PRODUCTS,

WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED, LEADING TO PRODUCT

RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS OR DECLINING SALES.



LEGAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, ANTITRUST

LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING TAX

DISPUTES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND PATENT DISPUTES WITH

BRANDED AND GENERIC COMPETITORS, ANY OF WHICH COULD PRECLUDE

COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING PRODUCTS.



LOST MARKET OPPORTUNITY RESULTING FROM DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTIES

IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS OF THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.



INCREASED FOCUS ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO THE TAXATION OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS.



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS PROMULGATED BY

STANDARD-SETTING OR REGULATORY BODIES, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD AND THE SEC, THAT ARE ADVERSE TO THE

COMPANY.



ECONOMIC FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL,

INCLUDING CHANGES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE USE OF

BY NON-NEW JERSEY CITIZENS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT APPLIED TO

INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT FILED LAWSUITS AND MAY OR MAY NOT

EVENTUALLY FILE LAWSUITS AND ONLY TO THOSE CLAIMANTS WHO SEEK TO

TOLL CLAIMS ALLEGING INJURIES RESULTING FROM A THROMBOTIC

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENT THAT RESULTS IN A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

(MI) OR ISCHEMIC STROKE (IS). THE

TOLLING AGREEMENT PROVIDED COUNSEL ADDITIONAL TIME TO EVALUATE

POTENTIAL CLAIMS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT REQUIRED ANY TOLLED

CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN FEDERAL COURT. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, APPROXIMATELY 13,230 CLAIMANTS HAD ENTERED INTO TOLLING

AGREEMENTS. THE PARTIES AGREED THAT APRIL 9, 2007 WAS THE

DEADLINE FOR FILING TOLLING AGREEMENTS AND NO ADDITIONAL TOLLING

AGREEMENTS ARE BEING ACCEPTED.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH

THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC

OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA

STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI

AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS

SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE

FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE THAN

95 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY TO

U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI OR

IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE ENTIRE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ACCOMPANYING

EXHIBITS, MAY BE FOUND AT

TEXTUAL REFERENCE AND DOES NOT INTEND IT TO BE AN ACTIVE LINK TO

ITS WEBSITE NOR DOES IT INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE INFORMATION

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE MET, WHICH CONDITIONS MAY BE WAIVED BY

MERCK, MERCK WILL PAY A FIXED AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF

$4.85 BILLION INTO TWO FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS THAT

ENTER INTO THE RESOLUTION PROCESS (THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM). INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WILL BE EXAMINED BY

ADMINISTRATORS OF THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM TO DETERMINE

QUALIFICATION BASED ON OBJECTIVE, DOCUMENTED FACTS PROVIDED BY

CLAIMANTS, INCLUDING RECORDS SUFFICIENT FOR A SCIENTIFIC

EVALUATION OF INDEPENDENT RISK FACTORS. THE CONDITIONS IN THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRE CLAIMANTS TO PASS THREE GATES.

AN INJURY GATE REQUIRING OBJECTIVE, MEDICAL PROOF OF AN MI OR IS

(EACH AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT), A DURATION GATE

BASED ON DOCUMENTED RECEIPT OF AT LEAST 30

VIOXX

PILLS,

AND A PROXIMITY GATE REQUIRING RECEIPT OF PILLS IN SUFFICIENT

NUMBER AND PROXIMITY TO THE EVENT TO SUPPORT A PRESUMPTION OF

INGESTION OF

VIOXX

WITHIN 14 DAYS BEFORE THE CLAIMED

INJURY.

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT MERCK DOES NOT ADMIT

CAUSATION OR FAULT. MERCKS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WILL BE TRIGGERED ONLY IF, AMONG OTHER

CONDITIONS, (1) LAW FIRMS ON THE FEDERAL AND STATE PSCS AND

FIRMS THAT HAVE TRIED CASES IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS ELECT

TO RECOMMEND ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM TO 100 PERCENT OF

THEIR CLIENTS WHO ALLEGE EITHER MI OR IS AND (2) BY

MARCH 1, 2008 (SUBJECT TO EXTENSION), PLAINTIFFS ENROLL IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AT LEAST 85 PERCENT OF EACH OF ALL

CURRENTLY PENDING AND TOLLED (I) MI CLAIMS, (II) IS

CLAIMS, (III) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH

INVOLVE DEATH, AND (IV) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER

WHICH ALLEGE MORE THAN 12 MONTHS OF USE. THE COMPANY HAS

THE RIGHT TO WAIVE THESE PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL CREATE SEPARATE FUNDS

IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.0 BILLION FOR MI CLAIMS AND

$850 MILLION FOR IS CLAIMS. ONCE TRIGGERED, MERCKS

TOTAL PAYMENT FOR BOTH FUNDS OF $4.85 BILLION IS A FIXED

AMOUNT TO BE ALLOCATED AMONG QUALIFYING CLAIMANTS BASED ON THEIR

INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION. WHILE AT THIS TIME THE EXACT NUMBER OF

CLAIMANTS COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS UNKNOWN, THE

TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT IS FIXED. PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUAL QUALIFYING

CLAIMANTS COULD BEGIN AS EARLY AS AUGUST 2008 AND THEN WILL BE

PAID OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. MERCK RETAINS ITS RIGHT TO TERMINATE

THIS PROCESS WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT TO ANY CLAIMANT, AND TO DEFEND

EACH CLAIM INDIVIDUALLY AT TRIAL IF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED

PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE NOT MET.

AFTER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 9,

2007, JUDGES IN THE FEDERAL MDL, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS AND NEW

JERSEY STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS ENTERED A SERIES OF ORDERS.

THE ORDERS: (1) TEMPORARILY STAYED THEIR RESPECTIVE

LITIGATIONS; (2) REQUIRED PLAINTIFFS TO REGISTER THEIR

CLAIMS BY JANUARY 15, 2008; (3) REQUIRE PLAINTIFFS

WITH CASES PENDING AS OF NOVEMBER 9, 2007 TO PRESERVE AND

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT WERE TRIED PRIOR TO

THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH THE RESULTS OF TRIALS AND CERTAIN

SIGNIFICANT RULINGS THAT OCCURRED IN OR AFTER THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS.

ON OCTOBER 5, 2007, THE JURY IN KOZIC V. MERCK, A CASE

TRIED IN STATE COURT IN TAMPA, FLORIDA FOUND UNANIMOUSLY IN

FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS, REJECTING A CLAIM THAT THE COMPANY

WAS LIABLE FOR PLAINTIFFS HEART ATTACK. IN DECEMBER 2007,

PLAINTIFF FILED AN APPEAL BUT AGREED TO AN ORDER STAYING ALL

OTHER POST-TRIAL ACTIVITY PENDING HIS ENTRY INTO THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM.

ON JANUARY 18, 2007, JUDGE VICTORIA CHANEY DECLARED A

MISTRIAL IN A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL OF TWO CASES, APPELL V.

MERCK AND ARRIGALE V. MERCK, WHICH HAD COMMENCED ON

OCTOBER 31, 2006 IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT IN LOS ANGELES,

AFTER THE JURY INDICATED THAT IT COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT.

JUDGE CHANEY HAD RESCHEDULED THE RE-TRIAL OF THE COMBINED TRIAL

OF APPELL AND ARRIGALE FOR JANUARY 8, 2008, BUT BOTH OF

THESE CASES ARE NOW STAYED.

IN APRIL 2006, IN A TRIAL INVOLVING TWO PLAINTIFFS, THOMAS CONA

AND JOHN MCDARBY, IN SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, LAW DIVISION,

ATLANTIC COUNTY, THE JURY RETURNED A SPLIT VERDICT. THE JURY

DETERMINED THAT

VIOXX

DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO

THE HEART ATTACK OF MR. CONA, BUT DID SUBSTANTIALLY

CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEART ATTACK OF MR. MCDARBY. THE JURY

ALSO CONCLUDED THAT, IN EACH CASE, MERCK VIOLATED NEW

JERSEYS CONSUMER FRAUD STATUTE, WHICH ALLOWS PLAINTIFFS TO

RECEIVE THEIR EXPENSES FOR PURCHASING THE DRUG, TREBLED, AS WELL

AS REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES. THE JURY AWARDED

$4.5 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO MR. MCDARBY

AND HIS WIFE, WHO ALSO WAS A PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE, AS WELL AS

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $9 MILLION. ON JUNE 8, 2007, JUDGE

HIGBEE DENIED MERCKS MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. ON

JUNE 15, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE AWARDED APPROXIMATELY

$4 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN ATTORNEYS FEES AND

COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE JUDGMENTS IN BOTH CASES AND

THE APPELLATE DIVISION HELD ORAL ARGUMENT ON BOTH CASES ON

JANUARY 16, 2008.

ON MARCH 27, 2007, A JURY FOUND FOR MERCK ON ALL COUNTS IN

SCHWALLER V. MERCK, WHICH WAS TRIED IN STATE COURT IN

MADISON COUNTY, ILLINOIS. THE PLAINTIFF MOVED FOR A NEW TRIAL ON

MAY 25, 2007. THE PLAINTIFF FILED A SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION FOR

A NEW TRIAL ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2007. ON DECEMBER 11,

2007, JUDGE STACK SIGNED A CONSENT ORDER STAYING ALL POST-TRIAL

ACTIVITY IN THE CASE UNTIL MARCH 2008.

ON DECEMBER 15, 2006, THE JURY IN ALBRIGHT V. MERCK, A CASE

TRIED IN STATE COURT IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT

FOR MERCK ON ALL COUNTS. PLAINTIFF APPEALED IN JULY 2007 TO THE

ALABAMA SUPREME COURT, BUT IN DECEMBER 2007, PLAINTIFF AGREED TO

STAY HIS APPEAL PENDING HIS ENTRY INTO THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

ON APRIL 19, 2007, JUDGE RANDY WILSON, WHO PRESIDES OVER

THE TEXAS

VIOXX

COORDINATED PROCEEDING, DISMISSED THE

FAILURE TO WARN CLAIM OF PLAINTIFF RUBY LEDBETTER, WHOSE CASE

WAS SCHEDULED TO BE TRIED ON MAY 14, 2007. JUDGE WILSON

RELIED ON A TEXAS STATUTE ENACTED IN 2003 THAT PROVIDES THAT

THERE CAN BE NO FAILURE TO WARN REGARDING A PRESCRIPTION

MEDICINE IF THE MEDICINE IS DISTRIBUTED WITH FDA-APPROVED

LABELING. THERE IS AN EXCEPTION IN THE STATUTE IF REQUIRED,

MATERIAL, AND RELEVANT INFORMATION WAS WITHHELD FROM THE FDA

THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO A DIFFERENT DECISION REGARDING THE

APPROVED LABELING, BUT JUDGE WILSON FOUND THAT THE EXCEPTION IS

PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW UNLESS THE FDA FINDS THAT SUCH

INFORMATION WAS WITHHELD. JUDGE WILSON IS CURRENTLY PRESIDING

OVER APPROXIMATELY 1,000

VIOXX

SUITS IN TEXAS IN WHICH A

PRINCIPAL ALLEGATION IS FAILURE TO WARN. JUDGE WILSON CERTIFIED

THE DECISION FOR AN EXPEDITED APPEAL TO THE TEXAS COURT OF CIVIL

APPEALS. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THE DECISION. ON

OCTOBER 11, 2007, MERCK FILED A MOTION TO ABATE THE HEARING

OF THE APPEAL UNTIL AFTER THE U.S. SUPREME COURTS

DECISION IN WARNER LAMBERT V. KENT, WHICH IS TO BE DECIDED

IN 2008. ON OCTOBER 25, 2007, THE TEXAS COURT OF

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPEALS DENIED MERCKS MOTION TO ABATE. THE PARTIES ARE

CURRENTLY BRIEFING THE APPEAL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ORAL ARGUMENT

TO BE SET SOMETIME IN THE SPRING OF 2008.

IN JULY 2006, IN DOHERTY V. MERCK, IN SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW

JERSEY, LAW DIVISION, ATLANTIC COUNTY, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT

IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY ON ALL COUNTS. THE JURY REJECTED A CLAIM

BY THE PLAINTIFF THAT HER NEARLY THREE YEARS OF

VIOXX

USE

CAUSED HER HEART ATTACK. THE JURY ALSO FOUND IN MERCKS

FAVOR ON THE PLAINTIFFS CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIM. PLAINTIFF

FILED A MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL IN AUGUST 2006. ON

DECEMBER 21, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE DENIED PLAINTIFFS

MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN LIGHT OF

PLAINTIFFS EXPRESSED INTENTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL, HERMANS V. MERCK AND THE RETRIAL OF

HUMESTON V. MERCK, BEGAN ON JANUARY 17, 2007, IN THE

COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE

HIGBEE. HUMESTON V. MERCK WAS FIRST TRIED IN 2005,

RESULTING IN A JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF MERCK ON

NOVEMBER 3, 2005. HOWEVER, ON AUGUST 17, 2006, JUDGE

HIGBEE SET ASIDE THE NOVEMBER 2005 JURY VERDICT AND ORDERED A

NEW TRIAL ON THE GROUNDS OF NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE.

THE HERMANS/HUMESTON TRIAL WAS SEPARATED INTO TWO PHASES: A

GENERAL PHASE REGARDING MERCKS CONDUCT AND A

PLAINTIFF-SPECIFIC PHASE. ON MARCH 2, 2007, THE JURY FOUND

FOR MERCK IN THE GENERAL PHASE ON THE HERMANS FAILURE TO WARN

CLAIM, AND THE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIM WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SUBMITTED

TO JUDGE HIGBEE FOR DECISION. ON MARCH 12, 2007, THE JURY

FOUND FOR PLAINTIFFS IN THE HUMESTON CASE, AWARDING COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES TO MR. HUMESTON IN THE AMOUNT OF $18 MILLION

AND TO MRS. HUMESTON IN THE AMOUNT OF $2 MILLION. THE

JURY ALSO AWARDED $27.5 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. MERCK

HAS MOVED FOR A JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT, A NEW

TRIAL, OR REDUCTION OF THE AWARD. THESE AND OTHER POST-TRIAL

MOTIONS ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. ON DECEMBER 11, 2007, THE

COURT DISMISSED THE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN

HERMANS.

ON JULY 31, 2007, THE NEW JERSEY APPELLATE DIVISION

UNANIMOUSLY UPHELD JUDGE HIGBEES DISMISSAL OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY RESIDENTS OF THE

UNITED KINGDOM. PLAINTIFFS HAD ASKED THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME

COURT TO REVIEW THE DECISION. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2007, THE NEW

JERSEY SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO REVIEW THE DECISION.

MERCK VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

FROM THE MARKET ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. MOST STATES HAVE STATUTES OF

LIMITATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS OF NO MORE THAN THREE

YEARS, WHICH REQUIRE THAT CLAIMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS LEARNED OR COULD HAVE

LEARNED OF THEIR POTENTIAL CAUSE OF ACTION. AS A RESULT, SOME

MAY VIEW SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AS A SIGNIFICANT DEADLINE FOR

FILING

VIOXX

CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, HOWEVER,

THAT THE LAW REGARDING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS CAN BE COMPLEX

AND VARIABLE, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND APPLICABLE LAW. SOME

STATES HAVE LONGER STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS. THERE ARE ALSO

ARGUMENTS THAT THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS BEGAN RUNNING BEFORE

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE HIGBEE

AND FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FALLON HAVE ISSUED ORDERS IN

CASES FROM NEW JERSEY AND EIGHT OTHER JURISDICTIONS RULING THAT

THE STATUTORY PERIOD FOR MAKING

VIOXX

PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS HAS PASSED. JUDGE HIGBEES ORDER WAS ISSUED ON

OCTOBER 15, 2007 AND JUDGE FALLONS WAS ISSUED ON

NOVEMBER 8, 2007.

OTHER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 29, 2005, A NEW JERSEY

STATE TRIAL COURT CERTIFIED A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS (SUCH AS UNIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS) THAT PAID IN

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE

VIOXX

USED BY THEIR PLAN MEMBERS

OR INSUREDS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE SOUGHT RECOVERY OF

CERTAIN

VIOXX

PURCHASE COSTS (PLUS PENALTIES) BASED ON

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE PURPORTED CLASS MEMBERS PAID MORE FOR

VIOXX

THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY KNOWN OF THE

PRODUCTS ALLEGED RISKS. ON MARCH 31, 2006, THE NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, AFFIRMED THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE CERTIFICATION OF A NATIONWIDE CLASS

ACTION OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, FINDING THAT THE SUIT DOES NOT

MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CLASS ACTION. CLAIMS OF CERTAIN

INDIVIDUAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REMAIN PENDING IN THE NEW JERSEY

COURT, AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS HAS THREATENED TO FILE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL SUCH ACTIONS.

ACTIVITY IN THE PENDING CASES IS CURRENTLY STAYED.

THERE ARE ALSO PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL

PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND CLAIMING EITHER

REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS OR AN ENTITLEMENT TO

MEDICAL MONITORING. ALL OF THESE CASES ARE AT EARLY PROCEDURAL

STAGES, AND NO CLASS HAS BEEN CERTIFIED. IN NEW JERSEY, THE

TRIAL COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT IN THE CASE OF SINCLAIR, A

PURPORTED STATEWIDE MEDICAL MONITORING CLASS. THE APPELLATE

DIVISION REVERSED THE DISMISSAL, AND THE ISSUE IS NOW ON APPEAL

TO THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT. THAT COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON

OCTOBER 22, 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

OF SEVEN STATES, AND THE CITY OF NEW YORK. A COLORADO TAXPAYER

HAS ALSO FILED A DERIVATIVE SUIT, ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF

COLORADO, NAMING THE COMPANY. THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE

COMPANY MISREPRESENTED THE SAFETY OF

VIOXX

AND SEEK

(I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED OR

REIMBURSED BY THE STATE AND ITS AGENCIES;

(II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE STATE AND ITS

AGENCIES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS

LAW THEORIES;

AND/OR

(IV) REMEDIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE STATUTORY THEORIES,

INCLUDING STATE CONSUMER FRAUD

AND/OR

PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED IN TWO OTHER

LAWSUITS CONTAINING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS FILED BY GOVERNMENTAL

ENTITIES SEEKING THE REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED MEDICAID

EXPENDITURES FOR

VIOXX

. THOSE LAWSUITS ARE (1) A

CLASS ACTION FILED BY SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA ON

BEHALF OF ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED CALIFORNIA COUNTIES, AND

(2) AN ACTION FILED BY ERIE COUNTY, NEW YORK. WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF THE CASE FILED BY TEXAS (WHICH REMAINS IN TEXAS

STATE COURT AND IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN SEPTEMBER

2008) AND THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ERIE COUNTY

CASES (WHICH ARE PENDING TRANSFER), THE REST OF THE ACTIONS

DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE FEDERAL

MDL AND HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY TO DATE.

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED BY THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION

(THE JPML) TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R.

CHESLER FOR INCLUSION IN A NATIONWIDE MDL (THE SHAREHOLDER

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTION, WHICH REQUESTED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF PURCHASERS OF

COMPANY STOCK BETWEEN MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29,

2004, ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF

SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

1934, AND SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS

OF SUIT, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO

ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE ACT AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES

OF MERCK STOCK AND UNDER SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS BASED ON

STATEMENTS IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES

FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERCK STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN, A

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN. ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE

CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS

DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT.

IN OCTOBER 2005, A DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER

GOVERNING THE SHAREHOLDER MDL, THE CASE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE

SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, WAS

CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS.

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PENSION FUNDS

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 3, 2007. IN SEPTEMBER 2007,

THE DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT RATHER THAN

RESPONDING TO DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS. IN ADDITION IN

2007, SIX NEW COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW

JERSEY ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALSO

ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS

VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS. DEFENDANTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THESE

COMPLAINTS UNTIL AFTER THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUES A DECISION ON

THE SECURITIES LAWSUIT CURRENTLY ON APPEAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 15, 2005, A COMPLAINT

WAS FILED IN OREGON STATE COURT BY THE STATE OF OREGON THROUGH

THE OREGON STATE TREASURER ON BEHALF OF THE OREGON PUBLIC

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUND AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT

AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS UNDER OREGON SECURITIES LAW. A

TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR OCTOBER 2008.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL

AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). ON MAY 5,

2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS

AND DENIED PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR

COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, ARGUING THAT JUDGE CHESLER ERRED

IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITH

MATERIALS ACQUIRED DURING DISCOVERY. ON JULY 18, 2007, THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED

THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION ON THE GROUNDS THAT JUDGE

CHESLER SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED PLAINTIFFS TO MAKE USE OF THE

DISCOVERY MATERIAL TO TRY TO ESTABLISH DEMAND FUTILITY, AND

REMANDED THE CASE FOR THE DISTRICT COURTS CONSIDERATION OF

WHETHER, EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WOULD STILL BE FUTILE.

PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REQUEST FOR

LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2007. THAT MOTION IS

PENDING.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE



VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS)

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED

FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE LAWSUITS MAKE

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. ON JULY 11, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER

GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. IN OCTOBER 2007, PLAINTIFFS MOVED

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

PARTICIPANTS IN AND BENEFICIARIES OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AT ANY TIME BETWEEN OCTOBER 1,

1998 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND WHOSE PLAN ACCOUNTS

INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN THE MERCK COMMON STOCK FUND

AND/OR

MERCK

COMMON STOCK. THAT MOTION IS PENDING.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO

INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON THE COMPANYS

BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN,

FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER

INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH

RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN S. MARTIN, JR. OF

DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ALLEGATIONS SET FORTH

IN THE DEMAND. JUDGE MARTINS REPORT WAS MADE PUBLIC IN

SEPTEMBER 2006. BASED ON THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES

RECOMMENDATION MADE AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE MARTIN

REPORT AND THE IMPACT THAT DERIVATIVE LITIGATION WOULD HAVE ON

THE COMPANY, THE BOARD REJECTED THE DEMAND. ON OCTOBER 11,

2007, THE SHAREHOLDERS FILED A LAWSUIT IN STATE COURT IN

ATLANTIC COUNTY, NJ AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER EXECUTIVES AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE BOARDS

REJECTION OF THEIR DEMAND WAS UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPER, AND

THAT THE DEFENDANTS BREACHED VARIOUS DUTIES TO THE COMPANY IN

ALLOWING

VIOXX

TO BE MARKETED.

INTERNATIONAL

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LITIGATION

RELATING TO

VIOXX

IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS) IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS

CANADA, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, AND ISRAEL.

ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS

BASED ON MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER SOURCES, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$630 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURANCE. THIS INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS AND POTENTIAL DAMAGE AMOUNTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS

WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND LOSSES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS

INSURERS (WHICH PROVIDE EXCESS INSURANCE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE

TO ALL OF THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) HAD COMMENCED AN

ARBITRATION SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO CANCEL THOSE

POLICIES, TO VOID ALL OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THOSE POLICIES

AND TO RAISE OTHER COVERAGE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE

TRIBUNAL IN THE ARBITRATION RULED IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR

ORDERING THE UPPER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES. THE COMPANY RECORDED A

$455 MILLION GAIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS A RESULT OF

CERTAIN OTHER SETTLEMENTS AND THE TRIBUNALS DECISION. IN

ADDITION, PRIOR TO RECORDING THE GAIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2007, AS A RESULT OF SETTLEMENTS WITH, AND PAYMENTS MADE BY,

CERTAIN OF ITS INSURERS, THE COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED

INSURANCE PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION. THE

COMPANY STILL HAS CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RESOLVED AGAINST

LOWER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR AMOUNTS

PAID IN CONNECTION WITH

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS.

AS A RESULT OF SETTLEMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE, THE

COMPANY WILL NOT RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LIMITS DISCUSSED

IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION. THE RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS

AGAINST LOWER LEVEL INSURERS WILL ALSO AFFECT THE TOTAL AMOUNT

OF INSURANCE THAT IS RECOVERED FOR THESE CLAIMS. OTHER THAN THE

REMAINING COVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION FROM THE

LOWER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS, THE COMPANY HAS NO ADDITIONAL

INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS.

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE COVERAGE

APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF

APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS FIDUCIARY AND

OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WITH STATED

UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF

THE ARBITRATION, ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS

SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE, IF NEEDED, UNDER UPPER-LEVEL EXCESS

POLICIES THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE

DISPUTES WITH THE INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS AND

THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL DISPUTES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY

RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE

LESS THAN THE STATED UPPER LIMITS.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS

ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN

INFORMAL INQUIRY CONCERNING

VIOXX.

ON JANUARY 28,

2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE SEC

ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION. ALSO, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE

DOJ) REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY

CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS (THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN

POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL DISPOSITIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF

CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CID) FROM A GROUP OF

ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 31 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA WHO ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANY VIOLATED

STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN RESPONDING

TO THE CIDS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006

FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS

AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON

CALIFORNIAS MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL

AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE

TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS

TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT

DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO

APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER

SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE

COORDINATION OF

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MORE THAN 95 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY

TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI

OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT OF ENTERING

INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX

CHARGE OF $4.85 BILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIXED

AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO PLAINTIFFS QUALIFYING FOR PAYMENT

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED THROUGHOUT 2008. A

TRIAL IN THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2008, BUT

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS,

INCLUDING FOR THOSE CASES IN WHICH VERDICTS OR JUDGMENTS HAVE

BEEN ENTERED AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND ARE NOW IN POST-VERDICT

PROCEEDINGS OR ON APPEAL. IN EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE

THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN SUCH CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD A

RESERVE OF $685 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. DURING 2006, THE

COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND

RECORDED ADDITIONAL CHARGES OF $673 MILLION. THUS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD A RESERVE OF

$858 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $616 MILLION

IN THE AGGREGATE, IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO

(I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THIRD QUARTER OF

2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF $210 MILLION AND

$70 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY

FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. IN INCREASING THE RESERVE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERED

THE SAME FACTORS THAT IT CONSIDERED WHEN IT PREVIOUSLY

ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY

$200 MILLION IN

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WHICH

RESULTED IN A RESERVE OF $522 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. AFTER ENTERING INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT,

THE COMPANY REVIEWED ITS RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND ALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION OF

ITS RESERVE TO MERCKS ANTICIPATED FUTURE COSTS TO

ADMINISTER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE RESERVE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF

THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT WILL BE CONSUMMATED, BUT THAT CERTAIN LAWSUITS WILL

CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT

AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS

AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND

TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EVENTS

SUCH AS SCHEDULED TRIALS, THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT

2008 AND 2009, AND THE INHERENT INABILITY TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOMES OF SUCH TRIALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS NOT PARTICIPATING IN OR NOT

ELIGIBLE FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, LIMIT THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS LEGAL COSTS BEYOND 2009.

TOGETHER WITH THE $4.85 BILLION RESERVED FOR THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE ESTABLISHED FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS

APPROXIMATELY $5.372 BILLION (THE 

VIOXX

RESERVE).

WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL NEED TO

INCREASE THE RESERVE EVERY QUARTER, IT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE ITS RESERVES

FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO

SO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY 403 CASES, WHICH INCLUDE

APPROXIMATELY 911 PLAINTIFF GROUPS HAD BEEN FILED AND WERE

PENDING AGAINST MERCK IN EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT,

INCLUDING 7 CASES WHICH SEEK CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS WELL

AS DAMAGES AND MEDICAL MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED

OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE

DENTAL PROCEDURES SUCH AS TOOTH EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS,

AND/OR

DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX.

ON AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS NATIONWIDE

SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION (THE 

FOSAMAX

MDL) FOR COORDINATED

PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL HAS BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE JOHN KEENAN IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AS A RESULT OF THE

JPML ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 350 OF THE CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE

KEENAN. JUDGE KEENAN HAS ISSUED A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER SETTING

FORTH A SCHEDULE GOVERNING THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSES

PRIMARILY UPON RESOLVING THE CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS

IN 2007 AND COMPLETING FACT DISCOVERY IN AN INITIAL GROUP OF 25

CASES BY AUGUST 1, 2008. BRIEFING AND ARGUMENT ON

PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS FOR CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL MONITORING

CLASSES WERE COMPLETED IN 2007 AND JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER

DENYING THE MOTIONS ON JANUARY 3, 2008. ON JANUARY 28,

2008, JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED A FURTHER ORDER DISMISSING WITH

PREJUDICE ALL CLASS CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE FIRST FOUR CLASS

ACTION LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST MERCK THAT SOUGHT PERSONAL INJURY

DAMAGES

AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING RELIEF ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS. DISCOVERY IS

ONGOING IN BOTH THE

FOSAMAX

MDL LITIGATION AS WELL AS IN

VARIOUS STATE COURT CASES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND AGAINST

THESE LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A REMAINING

RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF

THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST

THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, THE COMPANY

IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND 2009. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO

THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING

LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE

SOMETIMES USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE

TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO

FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS

PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND

ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH,

LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING

CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED THE

COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE

COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE

COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR

COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURT BROUGHT

INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

FORTY OF THE COUNTY CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE COMPANY

WAS DISMISSED FROM THE SUFFOLK COUNTY CASE, WHICH WAS THE FIRST

OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE FILED. IN ADDITION, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY WAS A DEFENDANT IN STATE

CASES BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF ELEVEN STATES, ALL OF

WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2003, THE DOJ NOTIFIED THE

FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO

INTERVENE AT THAT TIME IN A PENDING FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT

CASE THAT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL IN DECEMBER 1999 AGAINST THE

COMPANY. THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER UNSEALING THE COMPLAINT,

WHICH WAS FILED BY A PHYSICIAN IN LOUISIANA, AND ORDERED THAT

THE COMPLAINT BE SERVED. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH ALLEGED THAT THE

COMPANYS DISCOUNTING OF

PEPCID

IN CERTAIN LOUISIANA

HOSPITALS LED TO INCREASES IN COSTS TO MEDICAID, WAS DISMISSED.

AN

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL AND THE CASE HAS BEEN

ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED BY THE COURT UNTIL THE SEAL IS LIFTED.

THE STATE OF LOUISIANA HAS FILED ITS OWN AMENDED COMPLAINT,

INCORPORATING THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED AMENDED

COMPLAINT. AS PART OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE SEAL IN THIS CASE WAS LIFTED

AND THE CASES WERE DISMISSED.

IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A QUI TAM LAWSUIT UNDER

THE NEVADA FALSE CLAIMS ACT. THE SUIT, IN WHICH THE NEVADA

ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS INTERVENED, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY

INAPPROPRIATELY OFFERED NOMINAL PRICING AND OTHER MARKETING AND

PRICING INDUCEMENTS TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND ALSO FAILED TO

COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MEDICAID BEST PRICE SCHEME

RELATED TO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION WAS DENIED BY THE DISTRICT COURT.

THIS MATTER HAS ALSO BEEN DISMISSED AS PART OF THE RESOLUTION OF

THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS.

DURING DECEMBER 2007 AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2008, THE

COMPANY AND ITS JOINT-VENTURE PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, RECEIVED

SEVERAL JOINT LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND

COMMERCE AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND

INVESTIGATIONS, AND ONE LETTER FROM THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS

INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES

RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE COMPANIES AND THE MSP PARTNERSHIP

EACH RECEIVED TWO SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS.

MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE ALSO EACH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE OFFICE OF THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED

FEBRUARY 1, 2008 REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE

MARKETING AND SALE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND THE

TIMING OF DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH

SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, SINCE

MID-JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING

COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR THE CONSUMER FRAUD LITIGATION COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVED A SUBPOENA

FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND SAMPLES. THE COMPANY HAD ALSO

REPORTED THAT IT HAS RECEIVED A CID FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

TEXAS REGARDING THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING

ACTIVITIES RELATING TO TEXAS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED ANOTHER CID FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS

ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS

MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO TEXAS, INCLUDING

WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF ITS NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND

SAMPLES. IN APRIL 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE

OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN

CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS

INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,

MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA. IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

LETTER REQUEST FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION

OF THE COMPANYS PRICING OF

PEPCID.

ON FEBRUARY 7, 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED

INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO SETTLE FEDERAL AND STATE

CIVIL CASES ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE MEDICAID REBATE STATUTE,

AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE FALSE CLAIMS ACTS IN CONNECTION

WITH CERTAIN NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND SALES AND MARKETING

ACTIVITIES BETWEEN 1994 AND 2001. TO RESOLVE THESE MATTERS, THE

COMPANY AGREED TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $649 MILLION, PLUS

INTEREST AND REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES TO THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT, 49 STATES PARTICIPATING IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM

AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, THE

COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $671 MILLION IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ANTICIPATED RESOLUTION OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS. EACH OF THE INVESTIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE

PRECEDING PARAGRAPH HAS BEEN RESOLVED AS PART OF THESE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE AROSE OUT OF CIVIL ACTIONS FILED

UNDER SEAL IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURTS LOCATED IN PHILADELPHIA

AND NEW ORLEANS. BOTH ACTIONS CONTAINED ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING

PAST PRICING PROGRAMS. THE PHILADELPHIA SETTLEMENT RELATES TO

PAST PROGRAMS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OFFERED HOSPITALS

SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED PRICES ON CERTAIN MEDICATIONS,

INCLUDING

MEVACOR

,

VIOXX

AND

ZOCOR

. IN THE

PHILADELPHIA MATTER, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY

IMPROPERLY EXCLUDED CERTAIN DISCOUNTS  THOSE WHICH

WERE NOMINAL IN AMOUNT  FROM

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITS BEST PRICE REPORTED TO MEDICAID UNDER THE MEDICAID REBATE

AGREEMENT. THE PHILADELPHIA ACTION ALSO RELATED TO CERTAIN

MARKETING AND SALES PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BETWEEN 1997 AND 2001.

THE PHILADELPHIA SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTS FOR $399 MILLION PLUS

INTEREST OF THE TOTAL SETTLEMENT AMOUNT.

THE NEW ORLEANS SETTLEMENT RESOLVES A CIVIL ACTION CONTAINING

ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING PRICING DISCOUNTS OFFERED TO HOSPITALS FOR

PEPCID

. THE ORIGINAL PRICING PROGRAM, KNOWN AS THE FLEX

PROGRAM, WAS LAUNCHED IN 1994 AND CONTINUED TO OPERATE AS THE

FLEX-NP PROGRAM UNTIL ITS TERMINATION IN APRIL 2001. THE NEW

ORLEANS SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTS FOR $250 MILLION PLUS INTEREST

OF THE TOTAL SETTLEMENT AMOUNT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THESE SETTLEMENTS, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A

CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

HUMAN SERVICES, WHICH INCORPORATES THE COMPANYS EXISTING,

COMPREHENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GOVERNING ITS PHARMACEUTICAL

SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

DOJ ADVISING IT OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CIVIL COMPLAINT BROUGHT

UNDER THE QUI TAM PROVISIONS OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT ALLEGING

THAT THE COMPANY VIOLATED CERTAIN RULES RELATED TO ITS

CALCULATIONS OF BEST PRICE AND OTHER FEDERAL PRICING BENCHMARK

CALCULATIONS, CERTAIN OF WHICH MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

MEDICAID REBATE OBLIGATION. DOJ HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT

DOES NOT INTEND TO INTERVENE IN THIS ACTION AND HAS CLOSED ITS

INVESTIGATION. THE LAWSUIT HAS NOW BEEN DISMISSED.

THE COMPANY HAS COOPERATED WITH ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. IN

ADDITION TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS, FROM TIME TO TIME, OTHER

FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN REGULATORS OR AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK

INFORMATION ABOUT PRACTICES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY OR

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN INQUIRIES OTHER THAN

THE INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION. IT IS NOT FEASIBLE

TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH INQUIRIES.

VACCINE

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY IN CLAIMS

BROUGHT UNDER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1987 IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, WHICH ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A

VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING VACCINATED WITH

VARIOUS BIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES AND RUBELLA

AND/OR

TRIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS

M-M-R

II. THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AUTISM,

WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, EPILEPSY,

ENCEPHALITIS, ENCEPHALOPATHY, GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME AND

TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. ALL OF THE REMAINING CASES HAVE BEEN

DISCONTINUED OR STRUCK OUT BY THE COURT AND THE GROUP LITIGATION

HAS CONCLUDED. THERE ARE NO CLAIMS OUTSTANDING AGAINST MERCK. AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS ALSO A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL

AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE

UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G., HEPATITIS B

VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN

VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING

PEDIATRIC VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FALL OF 2001.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 234

ACTIVE THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS WITH APPROXIMATELY 425

PLAINTIFFS. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE MANUFACTURERS

WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS

MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL

INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC

VACCINES. THERE ARE NO CASES CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL. THE

COMPANY WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE

EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS

PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE

VACCINE ACT). THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON

FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR

VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE

VACCINE COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING

A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE PETITIONER

MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN

VACCINE COURT AND THEN TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A

CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT

TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE

COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE

PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 900 CASES

PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES

AND/OR

THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. NOT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALL OF THE THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE

VACCINE COURT PROCEEDING ARE COMPANY VACCINES. THE COMPANY IS

THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE DOMESTICALLY. IN

JUNE 2007, THE SPECIAL MASTERS PRESIDING OVER THE VACCINE COURT

PROCEEDINGS HELD A TWO AND A HALF WEEK HEARING IN WHICH BOTH

PETITIONERS AND THE GOVERNMENT PRESENTED EVIDENCE ON THE ISSUE

OF WHETHER THE COMBINATION OF

M-M-R

II VACCINE AND

THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES CAN CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS AND

WHETHER IT DID CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER IN THE PETITIONER

IN THAT CASE. TWO SHORTER ADDITIONAL EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS OF

THAT TYPE ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE WERE HELD IN THE FALL OF 2007.

RULINGS IN THESE THREE CASES ARE EXPECTED IN 2008. ACCORDING TO

THE VACCINE COURT, IT EXPECTS TO HOLD EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN

SIX ADDITIONAL SO-CALLED TEST CASES BY SEPTEMBER

2008, ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES, OR

THE

M-M-R

- II VACCINE ALONE, CAN CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM

DISORDERS, AND DID CAUSE SUCH DISORDERS IN THOSE SIX

PETITIONERS. THE VACCINE COURT HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO

USE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THESE TEST CASE HEARINGS TO GUIDE

THE ADJUDICATION OF THE REMAINING AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER CASES.

PATENT

LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS FILE ANDAS WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC

FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

FOSAMAX,

PROPECIA, PRILOSEC, NEXIUM, SINGULAIR, TRUSOPT, COSOPT

AND

PRIMAXIN

PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS

(AND ASTRAZENECAS IN THE CASE OF

AN ANDA HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE

UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT IN FEDERAL

COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC EZETIMIBE

(

ZETIA

). SIMILAR PATENT CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND

ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT

BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR

THESE PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A

GENERIC COMPANY INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ZETIA

AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS

THAT ARE LISTED FOR

COMPANY LLC. ON MARCH 22, 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MSP

SINGAPORE COMPANY LLC FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST

GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC., USA AND ITS PARENT CORPORATION

(GLENMARK). THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA

ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

LETTER FROM RANBAXY LABORATORIES LTD. (RANBAXY)

STATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC

VERSION OF MERCKS

PRIMAXIN

. IN APRIL 2007, THE

AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENT THAT IS LISTED

FOR

SINGULAIR

. ON APRIL 2, 2007, THE COMPANY FILED A

PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTION AGAINST TEVA. THE LAWSUIT

AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF TEVAS ANDA FOR

30 MONTHS OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY,

WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN

WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE

COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005.

BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY

2008.

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY IN

THE

37

UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2008. AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN U.S.

SALES.

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A

DECISION REFUSING TO BAR THE APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON

THE GROUNDS THAT MERCKS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS

LIKELY INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC

ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA IN JUNE 2005. IN JULY 2005,

MERCK WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX CORP.

(APOTEX) SEEKING DAMAGES FOR LOST SALES OF GENERIC

WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DUE TO THE PATENT PROCEEDING.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY APPEALED

A DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT

OFFICE (EPO) THAT REVOKED THE COMPANYS PATENT

IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

ALENDRONATE. ON MARCH 14, 2006, THE BOARD OF APPEAL OF THE

EPO UPHELD THE DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION REVOKING THE

PATENT. ON MARCH 28, 2007, THE EPO ISSUED ANOTHER PATENT IN

EUROPE TO THE COMPANY THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION

OF ALENDRONATE. UNDER ITS TERMS, THIS NEW PATENT IS EFFECTIVE

UNTIL JULY 2018. OPPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE EPO AGAINST

THIS PATENT. ADDITIONALLY, MERCK HAS BROUGHT PATENT INFRINGEMENT

SUITS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN JURISDICTIONS BASED UPON THIS PATENT.

MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE USE OF ALENDRONATE HAS

BEEN CHALLENGED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED ADVERSE DECISIONS IN GERMANY, HOLLAND AND THE UNITED

KINGDOM. THE DECISION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS UPHELD ON

APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE DECISIONS IN GERMANY AND

HOLLAND.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JAPAN AFTER A

PROCEEDING WAS FILED CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE

COMPANYS JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY

ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE, THE PATENT OFFICE INVALIDATED THE

PATENT. THE DECISION IS UNDER APPEAL.

ON JANUARY 18, 2006, THE COMPANY SUED HI-TECH PHARMACAL

CO., INC. (HI-TECH) OF AMITYVILLE, NEW YORK FOR

PATENT INFRINGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO HI-TECHS APPLICATION TO

THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC VERSION OF MERCKS

OPHTHALMIC DRUGS

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

, WHICH ARE

USED TO TREAT ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH

OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA OR OCULAR HYPERTENSION. IN THE LAWSUIT,

MERCK SUED TO ENFORCE A PATENT COVERING AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT

DORZOLAMIDE, WHICH IS PRESENT IN BOTH

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT,

AND THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT IN

MERCKS FAVOR WHICH WAS UPHELD ON APPEAL. THE PATENT

COVERING DORZOLAMIDE PROVIDES EXCLUSIVITY FOR

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008 (INCLUDING SIX MONTHS OF

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY). AFTER SUCH TIME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN U.S. SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS. MERCK

HAS ELECTED NOT TO ENFORCE TWO OTHER U.S. PATENTS LISTED

WITH THE FDA WHICH COVER THE COMBINATION OF DORZOLAMIDE AND

TIMOLOL, THE TWO ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN

COSOPT.

IN THE CASE OF OMEPRAZOLE, ON MAY 31, 2007, THE TRIAL COURT

ISSUED A DECISION WITH RESPECT TO FOUR GENERIC COMPANIES SELLING

GENERIC OMEPRAZOLE. THE COURT FOUND THAT THE IMPAX LABORATORIES

INC. AND APOTEX PRODUCTS INFRINGED ASTRAZENECAS

FORMULATION PATENTS, WHILE PRODUCTS MADE BY MYLAN LABORATORIES

AND LEK PHARMACEUTICAL AND CHEMICAL CO., D.D. DID NOT INFRINGE.

THE COMPANIES FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED WERE ORDERED OFF THE

MARKET UNTIL OCTOBER 20, 2007, WHICH WAS THE EXPIRATION OF

THE PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD.

THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT

RANBAXY HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA

CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005, THE COMPANY AND

ASTRAZENECA SUED RANBAXY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN

NEW JERSEY. ACCORDINGLY, FDA APPROVAL OF RANBAXYS ANDA IS

STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS UNTIL APRIL 2008 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE

COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE COMPANY

AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN JANUARY 2006 THAT IVAX

PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED BY TEVA, HAD FILED

AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS

PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. ON

MARCH 8, 2006, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA SUED TEVA IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDINGLY, FDA

APPROVAL OF TEVAS ANDA IS STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS UNTIL

SEPTEMBER 2008 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY,

WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. IN JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY AND

ASTRAZENECA SUED DR. REDDYS IN THE DISTRICT COURT IN

NEW JERSEY BASED ON DR. REDDYS FILING OF AN ANDA FOR

ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. ACCORDINGLY, FDA APPROVAL OF

DR. REDDYS ANDA IS STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS UNTIL

JULY 2010 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER

MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

AND COMPANY (DU PONT). THE COMPANY AND DU PONT HAVE

FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS COMPANIES

IN PORTUGAL, SPAIN, NORWAY AND AUSTRIA.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, THE

COMPANY RESOLVED CERTAIN PATENT DISPUTES WHICH RESULTED IN A NET

GAIN TO THE COMPANY.

OTHER

LITIGATION

IN NOVEMBER 2005, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE COMPANYS BOARD ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY HAD

SUSTAINED DAMAGES THROUGH THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF ITS

CHANGE IN CONTROL SEPARATION BENEFITS PLAN (THE CIC

PLAN) IN NOVEMBER 2004. THE SHAREHOLDER MADE A DEMAND ON

THE BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE BOARDS CURRENT

OR FORMER MEMBERS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY

WITH RESPECT TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CIC PLAN. IN RESPONSE TO

THAT DEMAND LETTER, THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD

DETERMINED AT THE NOVEMBER 22, 2005 BOARD MEETING THAT THE

BOARD WOULD TAKE THE SHAREHOLDERS REQUEST UNDER

CONSIDERATION. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD, THE

SHAREHOLDER WAS ADVISED THAT THE BOARD HAD DETERMINED NOT TO

TAKE LEGAL ACTION.

IN FEBRUARY 2008, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMANDING THAT THE

BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO

RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY TO RESOLVE THE

GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 20, 2004, THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY GRANTED A

MOTION BY THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO

HEALTH) AND CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO DISMISS A

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION INVOLVING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS REVENUE RECOGNITION PRACTICE FOR RETAIL

CO-PAYMENTS PAID BY INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM MEDCO HEALTH PROVIDES

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER ALLEGATIONS. THE

COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE

DECISION. ON DECEMBER 15, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT UPHELD MOST OF THE DISTRICT

COURTS DECISION DISMISSING THE SUIT, AND SENT THE ISSUE OF

WHETHER THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROPERLY REFUSED

THE SHAREHOLDER DEMAND RELATING TO THE COMPANYS TREATMENT

OF RETAIL CO-PAYMENTS BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR

RECONSIDERATION UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL STANDARD. PLAINTIFFS

MOVED TO REMAND THEIR ACTION TO STATE COURT ON AUGUST 18,

2006, AND THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THAT MOTION ON

FEBRUARY 1, 2007. THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS

PENDING BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, CHANCERY

DIVISION, HUNTERDON COUNTY. ALL OF THE REMAINING ISSUES WERE

DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE IN FAVOR OF MEDCO HEALTH, MERCK AND THE

INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ON JULY 31, 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH,

THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION

BASIS, A SERIES OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA (THE

GRUER CASES). THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A

NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS,

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY AGREED TO

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT COST

AND DISTRACTION OF PROLONGED LITIGATION. THE PROPOSED CLASS

SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES

FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A

TOTAL OF $42.5 MILLION, AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO

MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TO CONTINUE CERTAIN

SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE

FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE

SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO

HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME SINCE

DECEMBER 17, 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD HEARINGS TO HEAR

OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND

APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE

NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL ONLY

IF AND WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. CERTAIN CLASS MEMBER

PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH PLANS AND TWO

INDIVIDUALS REMAIN PENDING IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES HAVE ASSERTED CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS

WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR

SIMILAR TO THE CLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS

MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES. THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH ARE

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES.

THREE NOTICES OF APPEAL WERE FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT HEARD

ORAL ARGUMENT IN MAY 2005. ON DECEMBER 8, 2005, THE

APPELLATE COURT ISSUED A DECISION VACATING THE DISTRICT

COURTS JUDGMENT AND REMANDING THE

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASES TO THE DISTRICT COURT TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT COURT TO

RESOLVE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. A HEARING WAS HELD TO

ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006. THE DISTRICT

COURT ISSUED A RULING ON AUGUST 10, 2006 RESOLVING SUCH

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES IN FAVOR OF THE SETTLING PLAINTIFFS. THE

CLASS MEMBERS AND THE OTHER PARTY THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEALED

THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT RENEWED THEIR APPEALS. ON

OCTOBER 4, 2007, THE RENEWED APPEALS WERE AFFIRMED IN PART

AND VACATED IN PART BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS. THE APPEALS

COURT REMANDED THE CLASS SETTLEMENT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN

THE DISTRICT COURT.

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS

DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING TWO PARAGRAPHS. THESE CASES ARE BEING

DEFENDED BY MEDCO HEALTH.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY,

WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS

ITEM, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE

EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR

WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED IN THIS ITEM.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE

OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS

OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE

GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY

TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP

COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF

CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE

RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE

COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO

SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN

DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES

OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, SUCH

PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH

WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND

PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY

REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM

FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

MERCK HAS ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE (THE DECREE)

WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT

OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE PENNSYLVANIA FISH AND BOAT

COMMISSION RESOLVING THE GOVERNMENTS CLAIMS ASSERTED IN AN

ENFORCEMENT ACTION, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND COMMONWEALTH OF

PENNSYLVANIA V. MERCK & CO., INC., IN RESPONSE TO

THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF 25 GALLONS OF

POTASSIUM THIOCYANATE FROM THE SITE IN JUNE 2006 THAT RESULTED

IN A FISH KILL IN THE WISSAHICKON CREEK AS WELL AS THE DISCHARGE

OF MATERIALS ON AUGUST 8, 9, AND 16, 2006 THAT CAUSED

FOAMING IN THE CREEK. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE DECREE, MERCK

WILL PAY CIVIL PENALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.575 MILLION;

FUND SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS IN THE AMOUNT OF

$9 MILLION; AND IMPLEMENT

ON-SITE

REMEDIAL MEASURES IN THE AMOUNT OF $10 MILLION. A MOTION TO

ENTER THE DECREE IS PENDING WITH THE COURT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2007,

APPROXIMATELY 1,400 PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT

AGAINST MERCK AND 12 OTHER DEFENDANTS IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE

CLEAN WATER ACT, THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT, AS

WELL AS NEGLIGENCE AND NUISANCE. THE SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR

DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUE, MEDICAL MONITORING AND OTHER

ALLEGED REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH

GROUNDWATER AND SOIL CONTAMINATION FOUND AT THE SITE OF A FORMER

MERCK SUBSIDIARY IN MERCED, CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST THESE CLAIMS.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

DESCRIPTION

OF MERCKS BUSINESS

MERCK IS A GLOBAL RESEARCH-DRIVEN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT

DISCOVERS, DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY MANAGED ON A PRODUCTS

BASIS AND ARE COMPRISED OF TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND THE VACCINES SEGMENT. THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT INCLUDES HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.

THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC AND PREVENTIVE AGENTS,

SOLD BY PRESCRIPTION, FOR THE TREATMENT OF HUMAN DISORDERS.

MERCK SELLS THESE HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY

TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONS. THE VACCINES SEGMENT INCLUDES HUMAN HEALTH VACCINE

PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE.

THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF PREVENTATIVE PEDIATRIC, ADOLESCENT AND

ADULT VACCINES, PRIMARILY ADMINISTERED AT PHYSICIAN OFFICES.

MERCK SELLS THESE HUMAN HEALTH VACCINES PRIMARILY TO PHYSICIANS,

WHOLESALERS, PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THE

COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE

EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF ITS PHARMACEUTICAL AND

VACCINE PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE

PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

OVERVIEW

DURING 2007, MERCK BEGAN REALIZING BENEFITS FROM ITS MULTI-YEAR

STRATEGIC PLAN DESIGNED TO REENGINEER THE WAY THE COMPANY

DEVELOPS AND DISTRIBUTES MEDICINES AND VACCINES WORLDWIDE. THE

COMPANY IS BENEFITING FROM THE EVOLUTION OF A NEW COMMERCIAL

MODEL DESIGNED TO ALIGN THE COMPANYS PRODUCT RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING EFFORTS UTILIZING THE LATEST

TECHNOLOGIES AND BROADENING ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH CUSTOMERS,

PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTIFIC LEADERS TO GET NEEDED MEDICINES AND

VACCINES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AND TO PATIENTS

SOONER. THE COMPANY IS ALSO WORKING TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ADVANTAGE BY LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGIES TO

FACILITATE DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT AND HAS SUCCESSFULLY

REDUCED CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT CYCLE-TIME.

THE PROGRESS OF THESE EFFORTS IS DEMONSTRATED IN PART BY THE

COMPANYS REVENUE GROWTH IN 2007, WHICH REFLECTED THE

CONTINUED MARKET PENETRATION AND GLOBAL ROLLOUT OF

GARDASIL,

A VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT CERVICAL CANCER, PRE-CANCEROUS AND

LOW-GRADE LESIONS, VULVAR AND VAGINAL PRE-CANCERS, AND GENITAL

WARTS CAUSED BY HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) TYPES 6,

11, 16 AND 18;

JANUVIA,

A MEDICINE THAT ENHANCES A

NATURAL BODY SYSTEM TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL IN PATIENTS

WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES; AND

ROTATEQ

, A PEDIATRIC VACCINE TO

HELP PREVENT ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN,

COUPLED WITH THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF SEVERAL IN-LINE PRODUCTS.

THIS GROWTH HAS MORE THAN OFFSET 2007 REVENUE DECLINES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2006 LOSS OF U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUED THE ADVANCEMENT OF DRUG

CANDIDATES THROUGH ITS PIPELINE. DURING 2007, THE U.S. FOOD

AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE FDA) APPROVED BOTH

JANUMET

, AN ORAL ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC AGENT THAT COMBINES

SITAGLIPTIN (

JANUVIA

) WITH METFORMIN IN A SINGLE TABLET

TO ADDRESS ALL THREE KEY DEFECTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND

ISENTRESS,

A

FIRST-IN-CLASS

INTEGRASE INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN

TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS. IN ADDITION, ON JANUARY 25,

2008, THE FDA APPROVED

EMEND

FOR INJECTION, AN

INTRAVENOUS THERAPY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED

NAUSEA AND VOMITING (CINV). ALSO, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES THE FDA WILL TAKE ACTION IN 2008 ON THE NEW DRUG

APPLICATION (NDA) FOR

CORDAPTIVE

, THE

PROPOSED TRADEMARK FOR MK-0524A, AN EXTENDED-RELEASE

(ER) NIACIN COMBINED WITH LAROPIPRANT, A NOVEL

FLUSHING PATHWAY INHIBITOR, FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT. FURTHER,

THE COMPANY MADE A SUPPLEMENTAL FILING WITH THE FDA IN JANUARY

2008 FOR

GARDASIL

, FOR AN EXPANDED INDICATION FOR WOMEN

THROUGH AGE 45, AND ANTICIPATES MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL

FILING FOR

ISENTRESS

LATER IN 2008, FOR AN EXPANDED

INDICATION FOR USE IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN CANDIDATES IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT AND

ANTICIPATES MAKING NDA FILINGS WITH RESPECT TO TWO OF THE

CANDIDATES IN 2008: MK-0524B, SIMVASTATIN COMBINED WITH

LAROPIPRANT AND ER NIACIN, AND MK-0364, TARANABANT, AN

INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY.

AS PART OF IMPLEMENTING THE NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL, THE COMPANY IS

REENGINEERING ITS CORE BUSINESS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH THE

GOAL OF REDUCING ASPECTS OF ITS COST BASE AND REALIZING GROSS

MARGIN IMPROVEMENT. THE REENGINEERING INCLUDES THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING COST SAVINGS

INITIATIVES. THE INITIAL

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PHASE OF THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN 2005 WAS

DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE

EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS. THE SCOPE OF THIS

INITIAL PHASE INCLUDED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY

STRATEGY BY THE MERCK MANUFACTURING DIVISION OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERIOD, FOCUSING ON ESTABLISHING LEAN SUPPLY CHAINS, LEVERAGING

LOW-COST EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING AND CONSOLIDATING OUR

MANUFACTURING PLANT NETWORK. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THROUGH

JANUARY 2008, MERCK HAD CLOSED, SOLD OR CEASED OPERATIONS AT

FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES AND

ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 7,200 POSITIONS COMPANY-WIDE (COMPRISED

OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS AND THE ELIMINATION OF

CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS). THE COMPANY, HOWEVER,

CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES AS THE BUSINESS REQUIRES. THE

PRETAX COSTS OF THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM SINCE INCEPTION

THROUGH THE END OF 2007 WERE $2.1 BILLION, OF WHICH

APPROXIMATELY 70% ARE NON-CASH, RELATING PRIMARILY TO

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION FOR THOSE FACILITIES SCHEDULED FOR

CLOSURE AND APPROXIMATELY 30% REPRESENT SEPARATION AND OTHER

RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS. THESE COSTS WERE

$810.1 MILLION IN 2007 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$100 MILLION TO $300 MILLION IN 2008, AT WHICH TIME

THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM RELATING TO THE

MANUFACTURING STRATEGY IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE.

MERCK CONTINUES TO EXPECT THE INITIAL PHASE OF ITS COST

REDUCTION PROGRAM, COMBINED WITH COST SAVINGS THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE IN ITS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, WILL YIELD CUMULATIVE PRETAX

SAVINGS OF $4.5 TO $5.0 BILLION FROM 2006 THROUGH 2010.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT

COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PLAINTIFFS

STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS

COUNSEL IN STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND

FEDERAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC

STROKE (IS) CLAIMS ALREADY FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY

IN THE UNITED STATES. IF CERTAIN PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS UNDER

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE MET (OR WAIVED), THE COMPANY WILL

PAY AN AGGREGATE FIXED AMOUNT OF $4.85 BILLION INTO TWO

FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS CONSISTING OF $4.0 BILLION FOR

QUALIFYING MI CLAIMS AND $850 MILLION FOR QUALIFYING IS

CLAIMS THAT ENTER INTO THE RESOLUTION PROCESS (THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM). AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF

$4.85 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $455 MILLION RELATING

TO INSURANCE PROCEEDS WHICH THE COMPANY WAS AWARDED (OR AGREED

TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENTS) IN THE PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED ARBITRATION WITH THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE CARRIERS RELATING TO COVERAGE FOR

COSTS INCURRED IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION.

SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION.

ALSO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

PRETAX CHARGE OF $671 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ANTICIPATED RESOLUTION OF INVESTIGATIONS OF CIVIL CLAIMS BY

FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES RELATING TO CERTAIN PAST MARKETING

AND SELLING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND

SAMPLES. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS RESOLVING THE INVESTIGATIONS. SEE

NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS) ASSUMING DILUTION

FOR 2007 WERE $1.49 PER SHARE INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE

U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT CHARGE, COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, THE CHARGE

RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN CIVIL GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS AND THE GAIN FROM AN INSURANCE ARBITRATION AWARD

RELATED TO

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION COVERAGE,

WHICH COLLECTIVELY REDUCED EPS BY $1.71 PER SHARE. IN ADDITION,

EPS IN 2007 REFLECTS AN ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO THE

ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA, INC. (NOVACARDIA),

ADDITIONAL RESERVES ESTABLISHED SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS FOR

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF

GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS AND PRODUCT DIVESTITURES, AS WELL AS A

NET GAIN ON THE SETTLEMENTS OF CERTAIN PATENT DISPUTES. ALL OF

THESE ITEMS ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN THE NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMPETITION

AND THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT

THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS ARE

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS

TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE

ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS

BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER

2003. PRESCRIPTION

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DRUG COVERAGE BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THIS LEGISLATION

SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO

MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE PRESERVING

MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION. AT THE

SAME TIME, THE LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG

COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND BY

ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES. THE

U.S. CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED, AND MAY CONSIDER AGAIN,

PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENTS ROLE IN

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

IN ADDRESSING COST-CONTAINMENT PRESSURE, THE COMPANY HAS MADE A

CONTINUING EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP

SAVE COSTS IN OVERALL PATIENT HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION, PRICING

FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE COMPANYS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO HAS

ENCOURAGED GROWING USE OF ITS MEDICINES AND MITIGATED THE

EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IN DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS ENCUMBERED

BY GOVERNMENT COST-CONTAINMENT ACTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS WORKED

IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PAYERS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO ALLOCATE SCARCE

RESOURCES TO OPTIMIZE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES, LIMITING THE

POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON SALES

GROWTH AND ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE MEDICINES AND VACCINES, AND TO

SUPPORT THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO

BENEFIT PATIENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO IS WORKING WITH GOVERNMENTS

IN MANY EMERGING MARKETS IN EASTERN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA AND

ASIA TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO INCREASE THEIR INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH

AND THEREBY IMPROVE THEIR CITIZENS ACCESS TO MEDICINES.

WITHIN EUROPE, EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION (EC) HAVE RECOGNIZED THE ECONOMIC

IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE

VALUE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT, THEY ARE

WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE

CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING MARKET DEREGULATION.

IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE RELATED POLICY DEBATE, THE EC LAUNCHED

THE HIGH LEVEL PHARMACEUTICAL FORUM (HLPF) AT

THE END OF 2005. THIS INITIATIVE AIMS AT IMPROVING THE PROSPECTS

OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN EUROPE AND THUS

THE HEALTH PROSPECTS OF ALL PATIENTS WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM

INNOVATIVE THERAPIES. THROUGH AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE AMONG ALL

STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (FROM PAYERS TO

PATIENTS), THIS INITIATIVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO TACKLE KEY POLICY

ISSUES IN EUROPE: (I) PROMOTING GREATER PRICING FLEXIBILITY

FOR MEDICINES; (II) ENSURING THAT HEALTH AUTHORITIES APPLY

BEST PRACTICES FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS

OF MEDICINES; AND (III) IMPROVING GREATER ACCESS TO

INFORMATION ON MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS IN EUROPE. THE COMPANY HAS

BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE EC AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN

ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME FOR THE HLPF THAT WOULD

HELP EUROPEAN PATIENTS GAIN GREATER AND QUICKER ACCESS TO ITS

MEDICINES.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND

ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. THE

AFRICAN COMPREHENSIVE HIV/AIDS PARTNERSHIPS IN BOTSWANA, A

PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA, THE

BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION AND THE MERCK COMPANY

FOUNDATION/MERCK & CO., INC., IS SUPPORTING

BOTSWANAS RESPONSE TO HIV/AIDS THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE AND

SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO HIV PREVENTION, CARE, TREATMENT AND

SUPPORT. IN MAY 2005, THE COMPANY INITIATED A PARTNERSHIP WITH

THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA (FOCUSED INITIALLY IN

SICHUAN PROVINCE) TO HELP STRENGTHEN CHINAS RESPONSE TO

THE HIV EPIDEMIC.

TO FURTHER CATALYZE ACCESS TO HIV MEDICINES IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES, UNDER PRICE REDUCTION GUIDELINES THAT THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED IN 2001, MERCK MAKES NO PROFIT ON THE SALE OF ITS

CURRENT HIV/AIDS MEDICINES IN THE WORLDS POOREST COUNTRIES

AND THOSE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC, AND OFFERS ITS HIV/AIDS

MEDICINES AT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PRICES TO MEDIUM-INCOME

COUNTRIES. IN FEBRUARY 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGAIN

REDUCED THE PRICE OF

STOCRIN

IN THE LEAST DEVELOPED

COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD AND THOSE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. BY

THE END OF 2007, MORE THAN 720,000 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV

AND AIDS IN 81 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES WERE

ESTIMATED TO BE ON TREATMENT WITH ANTIRETROVIRAL REGIMENS

CONTAINING

CRIXIVAN, STOCRIN

OR ATRIPLA. THROUGH THESE

AND OTHER ACTIONS, MERCK IS WORKING INDEPENDENTLY AND WITH

PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS ALIKE TO FOCUS ON THE

MOST CRITICAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO MEDICINES IN THE DEVELOPING

WORLD: THE NEED FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCING, INCREASED

INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN

EDUCATION, TRAINING AND HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY IN

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN MAY 2007 THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL

ISSUED A COMPULSORY LICENSE FOR

STOCRIN

, WHICH MAKES IT

POSSIBLE FOR

STOCRIN

TO BE PRODUCED BY A GENERIC

MANUFACTURER DESPITE THE COMPANYS PATENT PROTECTION ON

STOCRIN

. IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND

STATED THAT IT HAD ISSUED A COMPULSORY LICENSE FOR

STOCRIN

, DESPITE THE COMPANYS PATENT PROTECTION ON

STOCRIN

, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND CONTENDS MAKES

IT POSSIBLE FOR

STOCRIN

TO BE PRODUCED BY A GENERIC

MANUFACTURER. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO EXPLORING

MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF BRAZIL

AND THAILAND.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS GLOBALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RECENTLY ENACTED

LAWS IN A MAJORITY OF U.S. STATES REQUIRING SECURITY BREACH

NOTIFICATION.

ALTHOUGH NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE AND OTHER

LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND ADVOCACY INITIATIVES, THE COMPANY IS

WELL POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING HEALTH CARE

ENVIRONMENT AND MARKET FORCES.

AS PATENTS ON CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS EXPIRE,

MERCK HAS ENTERED INTO, AND MAY CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO,

AUTHORIZED GENERIC AGREEMENTS WHICH REDUCE ON A SHORT-TERM

LIMITED BASIS, THE IMPACT OF POST-PATENT EXPIRY SALES EROSION

WHEN THESE MEDICINES BECOME AVAILABLE IN GENERIC FORM.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLDWIDE TREND TOWARD

COST-CONTAINMENT WILL CONTINUE, RESULTING IN ONGOING PRESSURES

ON HEALTH CARE BUDGETS. AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SUCCESSFULLY

LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS, CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH CARE DEBATES AND

MONITOR REFORMS, ITS NEW PRODUCTS, POLICIES AND STRATEGIES

SHOULD ENABLE IT TO MAINTAIN A STRONG POSITION IN THE CHANGING

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

ACQUISITIONS

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA

FOR $366.4 MILLION WHICH WAS PAID THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF

MERCK COMMON STOCK. NOVACARDIA IS A CLINICAL-STAGE

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THIS

ACQUISITION ADDED ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418), NOVACARDIAS

INVESTIGATIONAL PHASE III COMPOUND FOR ACUTE HEART FAILURE,

TO MERCKS PIPELINE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $325.1 MILLION FOR

ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH ROLOFYLLINE AS AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN

ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE CHARGE

WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH

RESPECT TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ROLOFYLLINE IS NOT EXPECTED

TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES.

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA

THERAPEUTICS, INC. (SIRNA) FOR APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION. SIRNA IS A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS A

LEADER IN DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES BASED ON RNA

INTERFERENCE (RNAI) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE. IN CONNECTION WITH

THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$466.2 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH

SIRNAS COMPOUNDS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, WHICH

RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS FOR BOTH THE HEPATITIS

B AND HEPATITIS C VIRUSES, WHICH ARE IN PRECLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS LICENSING AGREEMENTS HELD BY SIRNA. THE

CHARGE WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY

WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS NOT

EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE MERCKS ABILITY TO USE RNAI TECHNOLOGY TO TURN OFF

A TARGETED GENE IN A HUMAN CELL, POTENTIALLY RENDERING

INOPERATIVE A GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIGGERING A SPECIFIC DISEASE.

IN JUNE 2006, MERCK ACQUIRED GLYCOFI, INC.

(GLYCOFI), A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY

THAT IS A LEADER IN THE FIELD OF YEAST GLYCOENGINEERING, WHICH

IS THE ADDITION OF SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE MODIFICATIONS TO THE

PROTEINS IN YEAST, AND OPTIMIZATION OF BIOLOGIC DRUG MOLECULES,

FOR $373 MILLION IN CASH ($400 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE

NET OF $25 MILLION OF SHARES ALREADY OWNED AND NET

TRANSACTION COSTS). THE COMPANY RECORDED A $296.3 MILLION

CHARGE FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION

WHICH WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. IN MAY 2006, MERCK

ACQUIRED ABMAXIS, INC. (ABMAXIS), A PRIVATELY-HELD

BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY DEDICATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND

OPTIMIZATION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN

THERAPEUTICS AND DIAGNOSTICS, FOR $80 MILLION IN CASH.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO AN

INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATING TO ABMAXIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM.

WHILE EACH OF THE ACQUISITIONS HAS INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC

MERITS, THE COMBINATION OF THE GLYCOFI AND ABMAXIS PLATFORMS IS

POTENTIALLY SYNERGISTIC, GIVING MERCK THE ABILITY TO OPERATE

ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODY DISCOVERY,

DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION.

SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE ACQUISITIONS.

SALES

WORLDWIDE SALES TOTALED $24.2 BILLION FOR 2007, AN INCREASE

OF 7%, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A 4% VOLUME INCREASE, A 2%

FAVORABLE EFFECT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND A LESS THAN 1%

FAVORABLE EFFECT FROM PRICE CHANGES. SALES PERFORMANCE OVER 2006

REFLECTS STRONG GROWTH OF THE COMPANYS VACCINES, INCLUDING

GARDASIL

, A VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT CERVICAL CANCER,

PRE-CANCEROUS AND LOW-GRADE LESIONS, VULVAR AND VAGINAL

PRE-CANCERS, AND GENITAL WARTS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND

18,

VARIVAX

ROTATEQ

, A VACCINE TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST ROTAVIRUS

GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN, AND

ZOSTAVAX

, A

VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT SHINGLES (HERPES ZOSTER). ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO SALES GROWTH WAS STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

SINGULAIR

, A MEDICINE INDICATED FOR THE CHRONIC TREATMENT

OF ASTHMA AND THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS,

HIGHER SALES OF

JANUVIA

AND SALES OF

JANUMET

FOR

THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, AS WELL AS INCREASED SALES OF

COZAAR/HYZAAR

FOR HYPERTENSION

AND/OR

ZOCOR

, THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR MODIFYING

CHOLESTEROL, AND

PROSCAR

, A UROLOGY PRODUCT FOR THE

TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC BENIGN PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT.

MERCKS U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR

BOTH EXPIRED IN JUNE 2006. ALSO OFFSETTING SALES

GROWTH IN 2007 WERE LOWER REVENUES FROM THE COMPANYS

RELATIONSHIP WITH ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP) AND LOWER

SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

FOR THE

TREATMENT AND, IN THE CASE OF

FOSAMAX,

PREVENTION OF

OSTEOPOROSIS.

DOMESTIC SALES INCREASED 7% OVER 2006, WHILE FOREIGN SALES ALSO

GREW 7%. FOREIGN SALES REPRESENTED 39% OF TOTAL SALES IN 2007.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN SALES GROWTH REFLECTS THE STRONG

PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANYS VACCINES AND GROWTH IN

SINGULAIR

. IN ADDITION, DOMESTIC SALES IN PARTICULAR

BENEFITED FROM HIGHER SALES OF

JANUVIA

. THESE INCREASES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSS OF

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOREIGN SALES WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY CONTINUED GENERIC EROSION RELATED TO

FOSAMAX

PRODUCTS.

WORLDWIDE SALES FOR 2006 INCREASED 3% IN TOTAL OVER 2005

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH OF

SINGULAIR

AND

VACCINES, AS WELL AS HIGHER REVENUES FROM THE COMPANYS

RELATIONSHIP WITH AZLP AND INCREASED SALES OF

COZAAR/HYZAAR

. IN ADDITION, SALES IN 2006 REFLECTED

CERTAIN SUPPLY SALES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ARRANGEMENT

WITH DR. REDDYS LABORATORIES

(DR. REDDYS) FOR THE SALE OF GENERIC

SIMVASTATIN. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

SALES OF

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR

. FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

PRICE CHANGES HAD VIRTUALLY NO IMPACT ON SALES GROWTH IN 2006.

FOREIGN SALES REPRESENTED 39% OF TOTAL SALES FOR 2006.

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE CONTINUING IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF

U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN JUNE 2006.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH

DR. REDDYS THAT AUTHORIZED THE SALE OF GENERIC

SIMVASTATIN. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WAS

REIMBURSED ON A COST-PLUS BASIS BY DR. REDDYS FOR

(DPP-4) INHIBITOR APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR

USE IN THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, WERE

$667.5 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED WITH $42.9 MILLION IN

2006.

JANUVIA

WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA IN OCTOBER 2006 AND

BY THE EC IN MARCH 2007. DPP-4 INHIBITORS REPRESENT A NEW CLASS

OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS THAT IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL IN

PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES BY ENHANCING A NATURAL BODY SYSTEM

CALLED THE INCRETIN SYSTEM. BY THE END OF 2007,

JANUVIA

WAS APPROVED IN 69 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, HAD BEEN

LAUNCHED IN MORE THAN 40 OF THOSE AND WAS UNDER REVIEW IN MORE

THAN A DOZEN OTHERS. SINCE THE OCTOBER 2006 U.S. APPROVAL,

MANAGED CARE FORMULARIES HAVE MADE

JANUVIA

WIDELY

AVAILABLE.

IN OCTOBER 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE FDA APPROVED EXPANDED

LABELING FOR

JANUVIA

. THE NEW REGIMENS WITH

JANUVIA

DESCRIBED IN THE UPDATED LABELING INCLUDE, AS AN ADJUNCT TO

DIET AND EXERCISE, INITIAL THERAPY IN COMBINATION WITH

METFORMIN; ADD-ON THERAPY TO A SULFONYLUREA (GLIMEPIRIDE) WHEN

THE SINGLE AGENT ALONE DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE GLYCEMIC

CONTROL; AND ADD-ON THERAPY TO THE COMBINATION OF A SULFONYLUREA

(GLIMEPIRIDE) AND METFORMIN WHEN DUAL THERAPY DOES NOT PROVIDE

ADEQUATE GLYCEMIC CONTROL.

IN MARCH 2007, THE FDA APPROVED

JANUMET

, MERCKS

ORAL ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC AGENT THAT COMBINES

JANUVIA

WITH

METFORMIN IN A SINGLE TABLET TO ADDRESS ALL THREE KEY DEFECTS OF

TYPE 2 DIABETES.

JANUMET

HAS BEEN APPROVED, AS AN ADJUNCT

TO DIET AND EXERCISE, TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL IN ADULT

PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES WHO ARE NOT ADEQUATELY CONTROLLED

ON METFORMIN OR SITAGLIPTIN ALONE, OR IN PATIENTS ALREADY BEING

TREATED WITH THE COMBINATION OF SITAGLIPTIN AND METFORMIN. BY

THE END OF 2007,

JANUMET

WAS APPROVED IN SEVEN COUNTRIES.

THE COMPANY IS SEEKING THE NECESSARY APPROVALS TO MAKE THE

MEDICINE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE

WORLD. GLOBAL SALES FOR

JANUMET

WERE $86.4 MILLION

IN 2007.

IN OCTOBER 2007, THE FDA GRANTED

ISENTRESS

(RALTEGRAVIR,

PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS MK-0518) ACCELERATED APPROVAL FOR USE IN

COMBINATION WITH OTHER ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT

OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED ADULT PATIENTS WHO

HAVE EVIDENCE OF VIRAL REPLICATION AND HIV-1 STRAINS RESISTANT

TO MULTIPLE ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS.

ISENTRESS

IS THE FIRST

MEDICINE TO BE APPROVED IN A NEW CLASS OF ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS

CALLED INTEGRASE INHIBITORS.

ISENTRESS

WORKS BY

INHIBITING THE INSERTION OF HIV DNA INTO HUMAN DNA BY THE

INTEGRASE ENZYME. INHIBITING INTEGRASE FROM PERFORMING THIS

ESSENTIAL FUNCTION LIMITS THE ABILITY OF THE VIRUS TO REPLICATE

AND INFECT NEW CELLS. THE FDAS DECISION WAS BASED ON A

24-WEEK ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL TRIALS IN WHICH

ISENTRESS,

IN COMBINATION WITH OPTIMIZED BACKGROUND THERAPY IN

TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS, PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS

IN HIV RNA VIRAL LOAD AND INCREASES IN CD4 CELL COUNTS. IN

FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED 48 WEEK DATA THAT

DEMONSTRATED

ISENTRESS

, IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER

ANTI-HIV MEDICINES, MAINTAINED SIGNIFICANT HIV-1 VIRAL LOAD

SUPPRESSION AND INCREASED CD4 CELL COUNTS THROUGH 48 WEEKS

OF THERAPY COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN COMBINATION WITH ANTI-HIV

MEDICINES, IN TWO PHASE III STUDIES OF

TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS FAILING ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPIES.

PATIENTS IN THE STUDIES HAD HIV RESISTANT TO AT LEAST ONE DRUG

IN EACH OF THREE CLASSES OF ORAL ANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICINES. BY

THE END OF 2007, THE MEDICINE WAS APPROVED FOR USE IN THE EU,

CANADA AND MEXICO. MERCK IS ALSO CONDUCTING PHASE III

CLINICAL TRIALS OF

ISENTRESS

IN THE TREATMENT-NAÏVE

(PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED) HIV POPULATION. POTENT ANTIRETROVIRAL

ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

SERUM LIPIDS AT WEEK 48 AND

ISENTRESS

WAS GENERALLY WELL

TOLERATED IN PATIENTS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES MAKING A

SUPPLEMENTAL FILING WITH FDA FOR THE TREATMENT-NAÏVE

INDICATION IN 2008. SALES FOR

ISENTRESS

WERE

$41.3 MILLION IN 2007.

OTHER PRODUCTS EXPERIENCING GROWTH IN 2007 INCLUDE

IN APRIL 2007, THE FDA ISSUED A NON-APPROVABLE LETTER IN

RESPONSE TO THE COMPANYS NDA FOR

ARCOXIA

(ETORICOXIB) FOR THE SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT OF

OSTEOARTHRITIS.

ARCOXIA

HAD BEEN UNDER REVIEW BY THE FDA

AS AN INVESTIGATIONAL SELECTIVE COX-2 INHIBITOR SINCE THE NDA

WAS SUBMITTED IN DECEMBER 2003 FOR A 60 MG ONCE-DAILY DOSE

ALONG WITH REVIEW OF A SEPARATE RELATED NDA FOR A 30 MG

ONCE-DAILY DOSE SUBMITTED IN APRIL 2004. IN THE NON-APPROVABLE

LETTER, THE FDA INDICATED THAT MERCK WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL DATA IN SUPPORT OF THE

BENEFIT-TO-RISK

PROFILE FOR THE PROPOSED DOSES OF

ARCOXIA

IN ORDER TO

GAIN APPROVAL. MERCK CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE

WITH REGARD TO A POTENTIAL PATH FORWARD IN THE UNITED STATES.

ARCOXIA

IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN 65 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE,

LATIN AMERICA, THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND MIDDLE EAST/NORTHERN

AFRICA. MERCK WILL CONTINUE TO MARKET

ARCOXIA

OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, WHERE IT HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR A BROAD RANGE OF

INDICATIONS, INCLUDING OSTEOARTHRITIS.

IN NOVEMBER 2007, MERCK AND GLAXOSMITHKLINE (GSK)

ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR

OVER-THE-COUNTER

NON-APPROVABLE LETTER FROM THE FDA TO ITS NDA SEEKING APPROVAL

FOR

OVER-THE-COUNTER

MEVACOR

. THE FDA INDICATED IN ITS LETTER THAT IT WOULD

REQUIRE A REVISED LABEL AND ADDITIONAL DATA FROM MERCK IN ORDER

TO GAIN MARKETING APPROVAL. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FDAS

NON-APPROVABLE LETTER, THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE AGREEMENT WITH

GSK.

VACCINES

SEGMENT REVENUES

SALES OF THE VACCINES SEGMENT WERE $3.8 BILLION IN 2007,

$1.7 BILLION IN 2006 AND $984.2 MILLION IN 2005. THE

INCREASES IN 2007 AND 2006 ARE THE RESULT OF NEW PRODUCT

LAUNCHES IN THE LATTER PART OF 2006 AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF

IN-LINE VACCINES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF VACCINES INCLUDES

TOTAL VACCINES SALES, OF WHICH THE VAST MAJORITY ARE INCLUDED IN

THE VACCINES SEGMENT AND THE REMAINDER, REPRESENTING CERTAIN

RESULTS OF WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES.

TOTAL VACCINE SALES AS RECORDED BY MERCK IN 2007 (INCLUDING THE

$3.8 BILLION REFLECTED IN THE VACCINES SEGMENT AND THE

$440.6 MILLION REFLECTED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT)

WERE $4.3 BILLION COMPARED WITH $1.9 BILLION IN 2006

AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2005. GROWTH IN VACCINES WAS LED BY

GARDASIL,

AS WELL AS BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

VARIVAX

,

ROTATEQ

AND

ZOSTAVAX.

TOTAL SALES AS RECORDED BY MERCK FOR

GARDASIL

WERE

$1.5 BILLION IN 2007, WHICH INCLUDED INITIAL PURCHASES BY

MANY STATES THROUGH THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL

AND PREVENTION (CDC) VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM,

COMPARED WITH $234.8 MILLION IN 2006.

GARDASIL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MARCH 2007, THE CDC ADOPTED THE UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION OF

ITS ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES

(ACIP) FOR THE USE OF

GARDASIL

. IN JUNE 2006,

THE ACIP VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO RECOMMEND THAT GIRLS AND WOMEN 11

TO 26 YEARS OLD BE VACCINATED WITH

GARDASIL

. THE

ACIP RECOMMENDED THAT 9- AND

10-YEAR-OLD

FEMALES BE VACCINATED WITH

GARDASIL

AT THE DISCRETION OF

THEIR PHYSICIANS. THE VACCINATION GUIDELINES, PUBLISHED IN THE

CDCS

MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT,

FINALIZE THE PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS ISSUED BY THE ACIP.

IN MAY 2007, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW A SUPPLEMENTAL

BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION (SBLA) FOR

GARDASIL

WHICH INCLUDES DATA ON PROTECTION AGAINST VAGINAL AND VULVAR

CANCER CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 16 AND 18 AND DATA ON IMMUNE MEMORY.

ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN, ACHIEVED

WORLDWIDE SALES AS RECORDED BY MERCK OF $524.7 MILLION IN

2007 COMPARED WITH $163.4 MILLION IN 2006. THE FDA APPROVED

ROTATEQ

IN FEBRUARY 2006. BY THE END OF 2007,

ROTATEQ

WAS APPROVED IN 70 COUNTRIES AND WAS LAUNCHED IN

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRESCRIBING

INFORMATION FOR

ROTATEQ

NOW INCLUDES DATA SHOWING THAT

ROTATEQ

REDUCED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

VISITS CAUSED BY THE G9P1A[8] ROTAVIRUS SEROTYPE BY 100% (ZERO

CASES WERE SEEN IN THOSE WHO RECEIVED

COMPARED

WITH 14 CASES IN PLACEBO RECIPIENTS). THESE DATA ARE FROM A

POST-HOC ANALYSIS OF HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION DATA FROM MORE THAN

68,000 INFANTS IN THE ROTAVIRUS EFFICACY AND SAFETY TRIAL

(REST), ONE OF THE LARGEST PRE-LICENSURE VACCINE CLINICAL TRIALS

EVER CONDUCTED.

IN JULY 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT BOTH

GARDASIL

AND

ROTATEQ

HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY ALL 55

U.S.-BASED

IMMUNIZATION PROJECTS OF THE CDC VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM.

THE VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM PROVIDES VACCINES TO CHILDREN

WHO ARE MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE, UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED (WHEN SEEN AT

A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER OR RURAL HEALTH CLINIC), OR

NATIVE AMERICAN.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN WORKING TO RESOLVE

AN ISSUE RELATED TO THE BULK MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THE

COMPANYS VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS

(VZV)-CONTAINING VACCINES. MANUFACTURING OF BULK

VARICELLA HAS RESUMED, HOWEVER PRODUCT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE

UNTIL THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN FULLY VALIDATED AND APPROVED BY THE

APPLICABLE REGULATORY AGENCIES. THIS SITUATION DOES NOT AFFECT

THE QUALITY OF ANY OF MERCKS VZV-CONTAINING VACCINES

CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET, ANY LOTS OF VACCINE IN INVENTORY THAT

ARE READY FOR RELEASE TO THE MARKET OR ANY VACCINES WHICH WILL

BE FILLED AND FINISHED FROM EXISTING VZV BULK.

PROQUAD

,

THE COMPANYS COMBINATION VACCINE THAT PROTECTS AGAINST

MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBELLA AND CHICKENPOX, ONE OF THE

VZV-CONTAINING VACCINES, IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR

ORDERING; HOWEVER, ORDERS HAVE BEEN TRANSITIONED, AS

APPROPRIATE, TO

M-M-R

II AND

VARIVAX

. TOTAL SALES

AS RECORDED BY MERCK FOR

PROQUAD

WERE $264.4 MILLION

FOR 2007 COMPARED WITH $234.8 MILLION IN 2006. MERCKS

SALES OF

VARIVAX

, THE COMPANYS VACCINE FOR THE

PREVENTION OF CHICKENPOX (VARICELLA), WERE $854.9 MILLION

IN 2007 COMPARED WITH $327.9 MILLION IN 2006 AS THE

ACIPS JUNE 2006 SECOND-DOSE RECOMMENDATION CONTINUED TO BE

IMPLEMENTED.

VARIVAX

IS THE ONLY VACCINE AVAILABLE IN THE

UNITED STATES TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST CHICKENPOX.

SALES OF

ZOSTAVAX,

THE COMPANYS VACCINE TO HELP

PREVENT SHINGLES (HERPES ZOSTER) RECORDED BY MERCK WERE

$236.0 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED WITH $38.6 MILLION IN

2006.

ZOSTAVAX

WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA AS WELL AS BY

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN AUSTRALIA AND THE EU IN MAY 2006. THE

VACCINE IS THE FIRST AND ONLY MEDICAL OPTION FOR THE PREVENTION

OF SHINGLES.

IN DECEMBER 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD INITIATED A

VOLUNTARY RECALL OF 11 LOTS OF ITS

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE

TYPE B VACCINE,

PEDVAXHIB

[HAEMOPHILUS B CONJUGATE

VACCINE (MENINGOCOCCAL PROTEIN CONJUGATE)],

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND TWO LOTS OF ITS COMBINATION

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE

TYPE B/ HEPATITIS B VACCINE,

COMVAX

[HAEMOPHILUS B

CONJUGATE (MENINGOCOCCAL PROTEIN CONJUGATE) AND HEPATITIS B

(RECOMBINANT) VACCINE]. THE RECALL WAS SPECIFIC TO THESE 13 LOTS

AND DID NOT AFFECT ANY OTHER VACCINES MANUFACTURED BY MERCK.

MERCK CONDUCTED THE RECALL BECAUSE IT COULD NOT ASSURE STERILITY

OF THESE SPECIFIC VACCINE LOTS. THE POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION OF

THESE SPECIFIC LOTS WAS IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE COMPANYS

STANDARD EVALUATION OF ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. STERILITY

TESTS OF THE VACCINE LOTS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS RECALL

HAVE NOT FOUND ANY CONTAMINATION IN THE VACCINE. THE EFFICACY OF

THE VACCINE WAS NOT AFFECTED. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECALL

WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

MERCK TEMPORARILY STOPPED ACCEPTING ORDERS FOR PEDIATRIC AND

ADULT VIAL FORMULATIONS OF

VAQTA,

A VACCINE AGAINST

HEPATITIS A, ON OCTOBER 1, 2007 IN THE UNITED STATES. MERCK

WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEPT ORDERS FOR THE ADULT FORMULATION OF

VAQTA

IN PRE-FILLED SYRINGES UNTIL SUPPLIES ARE DEPLETED.

THIS SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF MANUFACTURING CHANGES WHICH

REQUIRE REGULATORY REVIEW AND APPROVAL PRIOR TO PRODUCT

DISTRIBUTION. UNTIL THE MANUFACTURING CHANGES ARE APPROVED, THE

AVAILABILITY OF BOTH PEDIATRIC AND ADULT FORMULATIONS OF

VAQTA

WILL BE AFFECTED. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS THE PEDIATRIC FORMULATION OF

VAQTA

WILL BE

AVAILABLE AGAIN EARLY IN THIRD QUARTER 2008. THE ADULT

FORMULATION OF

VAQTA

IN VIALS IS EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE

AGAIN IN FOURTH QUARTER 2008. OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE

IMPACT OF THIS SITUATION WILL VARY DEPENDING ON INVENTORY LEVELS

AND THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN EACH MARKET. THIS SITUATION

DOES NOT IN ANY WAY IMPACT THE QUALITY OR SAFETY OF

VAQTA

AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET. SALES OF

VAQTA

RECORDED BY

MERCK WERE $148.5 MILLION IN 2007.

MATERIALS

AND PRODUCTION

IN 2007, MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE

TO AN INCREASE IN SALES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER COSTS RELATED TO THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. IN

2007, $483.1 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING COSTS COMPRISED OF

$460.6 MILLION OF ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ASSOCIATED WITH

THE PLANNED SALE OR CLOSURE OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND $22.5 MILLION OF ASSET

$736.4 MILLION IN 2006 REPRESENTING $707.3 MILLION OF

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND $29.1 MILLION OF ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS. (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.) THE IMPACT FROM INFLATION ON MATERIALS AND

PRODUCTION COSTS IN 2007 WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

IN 2006, MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS INCREASED 17% COMPARED

WITH A 3% INCREASE IN SALES PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING COSTS. MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS IN 2006 ALSO

INCLUDED STOCK OPTION EXPENSE OF $23.8 MILLION, AS A RESULT

OF THE ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) STATEMENT NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT

(FAS 123R) (SEE NOTE 12 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). ADDITIONALLY, MATERIALS AND

PRODUCTION COSTS FOR 2006 INCLUDED A 1% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM

INFLATION.

GROSS MARGIN WAS 74.6% IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 73.5% IN 2006 AND

76.6% IN 2005. THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES NOTED ABOVE HAD AN

UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF 2.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2007,

3.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2006 AND 0.8 PERCENTAGE

27 EU MEMBER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS NORWAY AND ICELAND.

IN AUGUST 2007, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW THE NDA FOR

CORDAPTIVE

(THE PROPOSED TRADEMARK FOR MK-0524A, ER

NIACIN/LAROPIPRANT).

CORDAPTIVE

IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL

COMPOUND CONTAINING MERCKS OWN ER NIACIN AND LAROPIPRANT,

A NOVEL FLUSHING PATHWAY INHIBITOR DESIGNED TO REDUCE FLUSHING

OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NIACIN TREATMENT. NIACIN IS WIDELY

RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE LIPID-MODIFYING THERAPY; HOWEVER,

TREATMENT HAS BEEN LIMITED AS A RESULT OF THE FLUSHING SIDE

EFFECT. DATA INCLUDED IN THE APPLICATION SUPPORT THE PROPOSED

USE OF

CORDAPTIVE

, EITHER ALONE OR WITH A STATIN, AS

ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY TO DIET FOR THE TREATMENT OF ELEVATED

LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (LDL-C OR

BAD CHOLESTEROL), LOW HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN

CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C OR GOOD CHOLESTEROL)

AND ELEVATED TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS. ALL ARE CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED

WITH INCREASED RISK OF HEART DISEASE.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED PHASE III CLINICAL

STUDY RESULTS IN WHICH

CORDAPTIVE

REDUCED LDL-C LEVELS,

INCREASED HDL-C LEVELS AND REDUCED TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS COMPARED

TO PLACEBO. PATIENTS TREATED WITH

CORDAPTIVE

ALSO

REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FLUSHING COMPARED TO THOSE PATIENTS

TREATED WITH ER NIACIN ALONE.

CORDAPTIVE

WAS ADMINISTERED

AS 1- AND 2- GRAM DOSES ALONE OR ADDED TO ONGOING STATIN THERAPY

IN PATIENTS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIA. ACROSS WEEKS 12 TO 24 OF THE

STUDY, 2 GRAMS (TWO 1-GRAM TABLETS) OF

CORDAPTIVE

PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT PERCENT CHANGES FROM BASELINE IN LDL-C

LEVELS (-18%), HDL-C LEVELS (20%) AND TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS (-26%)

RELATIVE TO PLACEBO. IN ADDITION, PATIENTS TREATED WITH

CORDAPTIVE

REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FLUSHING BOTH AT

THE INITIATION OF THERAPY AND DURING MAINTENANCE THERAPY,

COMPARED TO PATIENTS ON ER NIACIN ALONE. MERCK ANTICIPATES FDA

ACTION IN APRIL 2008. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MOVING FORWARD WITH

FILINGS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN DRUG CANDIDATES IN

PHASE III DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATES MAKING NDA FILINGS

WITH RESPECT TO TWO OF THE CANDIDATES IN 2008.

MK-0524B IS A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES THE NOVEL APPROACH TO

RAISING HDL-C AND LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES FROM ER NIACIN COMBINED

WITH LAROPIPRANT WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF SIMVASTATIN IN ONE

COMBINATION PRODUCT. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY PRESENTED

RESULTS OF A STUDY AT THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION 2007

SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS WHICH DEMONSTRATE ER NIACIN/LAROPIPRANT

(

CORDAPTIVE)

COADMINISTERED WITH SIMVASTATIN HAD

SIGNIFICANT ADDITIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING LDL-C, INCREASING HDL-C

AND REDUCING TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS IN A PHASE III STUDY WITH

PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA OR MIXED

DYSLIPIDEMIA. IN THE STUDY, 2 G (TWO 1-GRAM TABLETS) OF

CORDAPTIVE

COADMINISTERED WITH SIMVASTATIN (POOLED ACROSS

20 MG OR 40 MG DOSES) REDUCED LDL-C BY 48%, INCREASED

HDL-C BY 28%, AND REDUCED TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS BY 33% FOLLOWING

12 WEEKS OF TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY STUDY ENDPOINT WAS LDL-C

REDUCTION; SECONDARY ENDPOINTS INCLUDED INCREASED HDL-C,

TRIGLYCERIDE REDUCTION AND EFFECTS ON OTHER LIPOPROTEINS. A 1 G

TABLET OF

CORDAPTIVE

CONTAINS 1 G OF MERCK-DEVELOPED ER

NIACIN AND 20 MG OF LAROPIPRANT, A NOVEL FLUSHING PATHWAY

INHIBITOR THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FLUSHING ASSOCIATED

WITH NIACIN. THE COMPANY PLANS TO FILE MK-0524B WITH THE FDA IN

2008.

MK-0364, TARANABANT, IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL HIGHLY SELECTIVE

CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR INVERSE AGONIST THAT IN EARLY CLINICAL

STUDIES HAS DEMONSTRATED DOSE-RELATED WEIGHT LOSS VERSUS

PLACEBO. TARANABANT WAS GENERALLY WELL-TOLERATED, HOWEVER, AS

REPORTED WITH ANOTHER CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR INVERSE AGONIST,

SOME DOSE-DEPENDENT PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED.

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THE INITIATION OF A TARGETED

PHASE III PROGRAM IN 2006. MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA

IN 2008.

MK-0974, AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE

RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, UTILIZES A NEW MECHANISM FOR THE TREATMENT

OF MIGRAINES THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY AT LEAST COMPARABLE

TO TRIPTANS IN EARLY CLINICAL STUDIES. IN JUNE 2007, CLINICAL

RESULTS FROM A PHASE II STUDY WERE PRESENTED FOR THE FIRST

TIME AT THE AMERICAN HEADACHE SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING WHICH

SHOWED THAT MK-0974 SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MIGRAINE PAIN RELIEF

TWO HOURS AFTER DOSING COMPARED TO PLACEBO, AND THE RELIEF WAS

SUSTAINED THROUGH 24 HOURS. MK-0974 WAS GENERALLY WELL

TOLERATED IN THE STUDY. IN ADDITION TO THE MEASURE OF MIGRAINE

PAIN, MK-0974 PROVIDED RELIEF OF MIGRAINE-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS,

INCLUDING NAUSEA AND SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT AND SOUND, AND

IMPROVED FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY TWO HOURS POST DOSE, AS WELL AS

REDUCED PATIENTS NEED FOR RESCUE MEDICATION. THE DRUG

CANDIDATE ENTERED PHASE III DEVELOPMENT DURING 2007. THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING THE NDA FOR MK-0974 IN 2009.

MK-7418, ROLOFYLLINE, IS A PHASE III INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG

BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE HEART FAILURE.

PHASE III PILOT STUDY PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATED THAT

ROLOFYLLINE WAS GENERALLY WELL TOLERATED AND THAT TREATMENT

RESULTED IN A GREATER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WITH IMPROVED

DYSPNEA, FEWER PATIENTS WITH WORSENING HEART FAILURE AND GREATER

WEIGHT LOSS COMPARED TO PLACEBO. THESE BENEFITS WERE ACHIEVED

WHILE PRESERVING RENAL FUNCTION COMPARED TO PROGRESSIVE

WORSENING OF RENAL FUNCTION IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH PLACEBO.

MERCK ACQUIRED THE DRUG CANDIDATE AS PART OF THE 2007

ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA AND ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE

FDA IN 2009.

MK-8669, DEFOROLIMUS, IS A NOVEL MTOR (MAMMALIAN TARGET OF

RAPAMYCIN) INHIBITOR BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF

CANCER. THE DRUG CANDIDATE IS BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED AND

COMMERCIALIZED WITH ARIAD UNDER AN AGREEMENT REACHED IN MID-2007

(AS DISCUSSED BELOW). THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA FOR

A METASTATIC SARCOMA INDICATION IN 2010.

A NOVEL INVESTIGATIONAL HEPATITIS B VACCINE, V270, CURRENTLY IS

BEING EVALUATED IN A PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL IN ADULTS AND

IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING DIALYSIS TREATMENT. MERCK IS JOINTLY

DEVELOPING V270 WITH DYNAVAX TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

(DYNAVAX) UNDER AN AGREEMENT REACHED IN LATE 2007

(AS DISCUSSED BELOW). MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA IN 2010

FOR ADULTS.

MK-0822, ODANACATIB, IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL HIGHLY SELECTIVE

INHIBITOR OF THE CATHEPSIN K ENZYME, WHICH IS BEING EVALUATED

FOR THE TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS. THE CATHEPSIN K ENZYME IS

BELIEVED TO PLAY A ROLE IN BOTH OSTEOCLASTIC BONE RESORPTION AND

IN DEGRADING THE PROTEIN COMPONENT OF BONE. THE INHIBITION OF

THE CATHEPSIN K ENZYME BY THE INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND

ODANACATIB IS A MECHANISM OF ACTION DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF

CURRENTLY APPROVED TREATMENTS SUCH AS BISPHOSPHONATES. IN

SEPTEMBER 2007, TWELVE MONTH RESULTS FROM A PHASE IIB STUDY WITH

ODANACATIB DEMONSTRATED DOSE-DEPENDENT INCREASES IN BONE MINERAL

DENSITY (BMD) AT KEY FRACTURE SITES, AND REDUCED

BONE TURNOVER COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH

LOW BMD WHEN GIVEN AT DOSES OF 10,

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

25 OR 50 MG. THESE FINDINGS WERE PRESENTED AT THE

29TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR BONE AND

MINERAL RESEARCH. BMD REFLECTS THE AMOUNT OF MINERALIZED BONE

TISSUE IN A CERTAIN VOLUME OF BONE, AND CORRELATES WITH THE

STRENGTH OF BONES AND WITH THEIR RESISTANCE TO FRACTURE. A BMD

TEST IS USED TO MEASURE BONE DENSITY AND TO HELP DETERMINE

FRACTURE RISK. THE PHASE III PROGRAM BEGAN IN MID-2007.

MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN 2012.

ADDITIONALLY, IN DECEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT PLANS

TO INITIATE A SEQUENCED PHASE III PROGRAM IN 2008 FOR

MK-0859, ANACETRAPIB, ITS INVESTIGATIONAL SELECTIVE CHOLESTERYL

ESTER TRANSFER PROTEIN (CETP) INHIBITOR, TO OBTAIN

ADDITIONAL CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN PATIENTS BEFORE INITIATING AN

OUTCOMES STUDY. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY PRESENTED RESULTS

FROM A PHASE IIB STUDY DEMONSTRATING THAT MK-0859 SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCED LDL-C AND APOLIPOPROTEIN B AND INCREASED HDL-C AND

APOLIPOPROTEIN

A-1

BOTH AS

MONOTHERAPY AND IN COMBINATION WITH ATORVASTATIN 20 MG

COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIA. ANACETRAPIB

PRODUCED THESE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON LIPIDS WITH NO OBSERVED BLOOD

PRESSURE CHANGES. CETP INHIBITORS WORK BY INHIBITING CETP, A

PLASMA PROTEIN THAT FACILITATES THE TRANSPORT OF CHOLESTERYL

ESTERS AND TRIGLYCERIDES BETWEEN THE LIPOPROTEINS.

IN MARCH 2007, MERCK AND H. LUNDBECK A/S (LUNDBECK)

ANNOUNCED THE DISCONTINUATION OF THEIR JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

FOR GABOXADOL, AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW MEDICINE FOR THE TREATMENT

OF INSOMNIA THAT WAS IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT. DATA FROM

COMPLETED CLINICAL STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT THE OVERALL CLINICAL

PROFILE FOR GABOXADOL IN INSOMNIA DOES NOT SUPPORT FURTHER

DEVELOPMENT. AS A RESULT OF THIS INFORMATION, MERCK AND LUNDBECK

WILL NOT FILE AN NDA FOR GABOXADOL FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA

WITH THE FDA, OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES WORLDWIDE, AND HAVE

TERMINATED ONGOING CLINICAL STUDIES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT VACCINATION IN A

PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTIGATIONAL HIV VACCINE (V520) WAS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE

VACCINE WAS NOT EFFECTIVE. THE TRIAL, CALLED STEP, WAS

CO-SPONSORED BY MERCK, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHS

NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGIES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES

(NIAID) AND THE HIV VACCINE TRIALS NETWORK. THE

INDEPENDENT DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB) FOR

STEP RECOMMENDED DISCONTINUATION BECAUSE THE STEP TRIAL WOULD

NOT MEET ITS EFFICACY ENDPOINTS. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE NIAID

ANNOUNCED THAT A SEPARATE DSMB FOR A SECOND CLINICAL TRIAL BEING

CONDUCTED IN SOUTH AFRICA OF THE SAME VACCINE CANDIDATE

RECOMMENDED THAT VACCINATION AND ENROLLMENT IN THE SOUTH AFRICA

TRIAL BE PERMANENTLY DISCONTINUED. THE SOUTH AFRICA DSMB ALSO

RECOMMENDED THAT VOLUNTEERS IN THAT TRIAL BE TOLD WHETHER THEY

RECEIVED THE VACCINE OR PLACEBO, BE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO

RETURN TO STUDY SITES FOR PROTOCOL-RELATED TESTS, AND BE

COUNSELED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE

VACCINE MIGHT HAVE AN INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HIV

INFECTIONS. DETAILED ANALYSES OF THE AVAILABLE DATA ARE BEING

CONDUCTED, INCLUDING ANALYSES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IF THERE MAY

BE AN INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HIV INFECTION AMONG THOSE

VOLUNTEERS WHO RECEIVED THE VACCINE. THE VACCINE ITSELF DOES NOT

CAUSE HIV INFECTION.

IN AUGUST 2006, MERCK AND GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.

(GILEAD) ESTABLISHED AN AGREEMENT FOR THE

DISTRIBUTION OF ATRIPLA IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AROUND THE

WORLD. ATRIPLA CONTAINS 600 MG OF EFAVIRENZ, A

NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITOR, 200 MG OF

EMTRICITABINE AND 300 MG OF TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE,

BOTH NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS. EFAVIRENZ IS

MARKETED BY MERCK UNDER THE TRADENAME

STOCRIN

IN ALL

TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND CERTAIN

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (WHERE IT IS COMMERCIALIZED BY BRISTOL MYERS

SQUIBB UNDER THE TRADENAME SUSTIVA). EMTRICITABINE AND TENOFOVIR

DISOPROXIL FUMARATE ARE COMMERCIALIZED BY GILEAD UNDER THE

TRADENAMES EMTRIVA AND VIREAD, RESPECTIVELY. ATRIPLA WAS

APPROVED IN THE EU IN 2007.

MERCK CONTINUES TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON AUGMENTING ITS INTERNAL

EFFORTS BY CAPITALIZING ON GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, RANGING FROM

TARGETED ACQUISITIONS TO RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, PRECLINICAL

AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS THAT WILL

DRIVE BOTH NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. THE COMPANY COMPLETED

55 TRANSACTIONS IN 2007 ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC

CATEGORIES, AS WELL AS EARLY-STAGE TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS.

MERCK IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES, AND IS

ACTIVELY MONITORING THE LANDSCAPE FOR A RANGE OF TARGETED

ACQUISITIONS THAT MEET THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC CRITERIA.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR INCLUDE.

IN JULY 2007, MERCK AND ARIAD ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD ENTERED

INTO A GLOBAL COLLABORATION TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

DEFOROLIMUS (MK-8669), ARIADS NOVEL MTOR INHIBITOR, FOR

USE IN CANCER. EACH PARTY WILL FUND 50% OF THE COST OF

GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OF MK-8669, EXCEPT THAT MERCK WILL

FUND 100% OF THE COST OF

EX-U.S. DEVELOPMENT

THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIALIZATION OF

MK-8669 OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT IS

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOT CURRENTLY PART OF THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THE AGREEMENT

PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL PAYMENT OF $75 MILLION TO ARIAD,

WHICH THE COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE,

UP TO $452 MILLION MORE IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO ARIAD

BASED ON THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF MK-8669 IN MULTIPLE

CANCER INDICATIONS (INCLUDING $13.5 MILLION PAID FOR THE

INITIATION OF THE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL IN METASTATIC

SARCOMAS AND $114.5 MILLION TO BE PAID FOR THE INITIATION

OF OTHER PHASE II AND PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS), UP

TO AN ADDITIONAL $200 MILLION BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT OF

SIGNIFICANT SALES THRESHOLDS, AT LEAST $200 MILLION IN

ESTIMATED CONTRIBUTIONS BY MERCK TO GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT, UP TO

$200 MILLION IN INTEREST-BEARING REPAYABLE DEVELOPMENT-COST

ADVANCES FROM MERCK TO COVER A PORTION OF ARIADS SHARE OF

GLOBAL-DEVELOPMENT COSTS (AFTER ARIAD HAS PAID $150 MILLION

IN GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS), AND POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL RETURNS

FROM PROFIT SHARING IN THE U.S. OR ROYALTIES PAID BY MERCK

OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN THE U.S., ARIAD WILL DISTRIBUTE AND

SELL MK-8669 FOR ALL CANCER INDICATIONS, AND ARIAD AND MERCK

WILL CO-PROMOTE AND WILL EACH RECEIVE 50% OF THE INCOME FROM

SUCH SALES. OUTSIDE THE U.S., MERCK WILL DISTRIBUTE, SELL AND

PROMOTE MK-8669; MERCK WILL PAY ARIAD TIERED DOUBLE-DIGIT

ROYALTIES ON END-MARKET SALES OF MK-8669.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

NOVACARDIA, A PRIVATELY HELD CLINICAL-STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL

COMPANY FOCUSED ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THIS ACQUISITION

ADDED ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418), NOVACARDIAS INVESTIGATIONAL

PHASE III COMPOUND FOR ACUTE HEART FAILURE, TO MERCKS

PIPELINE. MERCK ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF

NOVACARDIA FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $366.4 MILLION

(INCLUDING $16.4 MILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS ON HAND AT

CLOSING), WHICH WAS PAID THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF

7.3 MILLION SHARES OF MERCK COMMON STOCK TO THE FORMER

NOVACARDIA SHAREHOLDERS BASED ON MERCKS AVERAGE CLOSING

STOCK PRICE FOR THE FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO CLOSING OF THE

ACQUISITION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $325.1 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH

ASSOCIATED WITH ROLOFYLLINE AS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE,

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED (SEE ACQUISITIONS

ABOVE).

IN NOVEMBER 2007, MERCK AND DYNAVAX ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL LICENSE

AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENT TO JOINTLY DEVELOP V270,

A NOVEL INVESTIGATIONAL HEPATITIS B VACCINE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

BEING EVALUATED IN A MULTI-CENTER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL

INVOLVING ADULTS AND IN PATIENTS ON DIALYSIS. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE AGREEMENT, MERCK RECEIVES WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO

V270, WILL FUND FUTURE VACCINE DEVELOPMENT, AND BE RESPONSIBLE

FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. DYNAVAX RECEIVED AN INITIAL PAYMENT OF

$31.5 MILLION, WHICH THE COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE UP TO

$105 MILLION IN DEVELOPMENT AND SALES MILESTONE PAYMENTS,

AND DOUBLE-DIGIT TIERED ROYALTIES ON GLOBAL SALES OF V270.

ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2007, MERCK AND GTX, INC. (GTX)

ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR

A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL STRATEGIC COLLABORATION

FOR SELECTIVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS (SARMS),

A NEW CLASS OF DRUGS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT AGE-RELATED

MUSCLE LOSS (SARCOPENIA) AS WELL AS OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL

CONDITIONS. THIS COLLABORATION INCLUDES GTXS LEAD SARM

CANDIDATE, OSTARINE

(MK-2866),

WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN A PHASE II CLINICAL

TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF MUSCLE LOSS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER,

AND ESTABLISHES A BROAD SARM COLLABORATION UNDER WHICH GTX AND

MERCK WILL POOL THEIR PROGRAMS AND PARTNER TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP,

AND COMMERCIALIZE CURRENT AS WELL AS FUTURE SARM MOLECULES. AS

PART OF THIS GLOBAL AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL

FUTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND, IF

APPROVED, COMMERCIALIZATION OF OSTARINE AND OTHER

INVESTIGATIONAL SARMS RESULTING FROM THE COLLABORATION. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENT AND RELATED STOCK

PURCHASE AGREEMENT, GTX AND MERCK WILL COMBINE THEIR RESPECTIVE

SARM RESEARCH PROGRAMS. GTX RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF

$40 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED BY MERCK AS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND WILL ALSO RECEIVE $15 MILLION IN

RESEARCH REIMBURSEMENTS TO BE PAID OVER THE INITIAL THREE YEARS

OF THE COLLABORATION. IN ADDITION, MERCK MADE AN INVESTMENT OF

$30 MILLION IN GTX COMMON STOCK. GTX WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE

TO RECEIVE UP TO $422 MILLION IN FUTURE MILESTONE PAYMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF A DRUG CANDIDATE

IF MULTIPLE INDICATIONS RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. ADDITIONAL

MILESTONES MAY BE RECEIVED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF

OTHER COLLABORATION DRUG CANDIDATES. GTX WILL RECEIVE ROYALTIES

ON ANY RESULTING WORLDWIDE PRODUCT REVENUE.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL

AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MERCKS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS DESIGNED TO

INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS BY

PRIORITIZING THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESOURCES ON DISEASE AREAS SUCH AS ATHEROSCLEROSIS,

HYPERTENSION, DIABETES AND OBESITY, NOVEL VACCINES;

NEURODEGENERATIVE AND PSYCHIATRIC DISEASES AND TARGETED ONCOLOGY

ACQUISITIONS WHICH WILL COMPLEMENT THE COMPANYS STRONG

INTERNAL RESEARCH CAPABILITIES. A CHART REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS CURRENT RESEARCH PIPELINE AS OF FEBRUARY 15,

2008 IS SET FORTH IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

ON JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 123R (SEE

NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

FAS 123R REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES BE

EXPENSED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON THE

GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS. PRIOR TO ADOPTING

FAS 123R, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD WHICH MEASURES SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE MARKET PRICE OF

THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT EXCEEDS THE EXERCISE PRICE. THE

COMPANY ELECTED THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD FOR

ADOPTING FAS 123R, AND THEREFORE, PRIOR PERIODS WERE NOT

RESTATED. UNDER THIS METHOD, THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 123R

APPLIED TO ALL AWARDS GRANTED OR MODIFIED AFTER JANUARY 1,

2006. TOTAL PRETAX SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS

$330.2 MILLION IN 2007, $312.5 MILLION IN 2006 AND

$48.0 MILLION IN 2005. IN ADDITION, THE UNRECOGNIZED

EXPENSE OF AWARDS THAT HAD NOT YET VESTED AT THE DATE OF

ADOPTION ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME IN THE PERIODS AFTER THE

DATE OF ADOPTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WAS

$402.8 MILLION OF TOTAL PRETAX UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE RELATED TO NONVESTED STOCK OPTION, RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT

AND PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARDS WHICH WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER

A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF 2.0 YEARS. FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS ARE UNALLOCATED

EXPENSES.

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PARTNERSHIP

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) (COLLECTIVELY, THE

PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE

EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE

UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. THESE

AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR EQUAL SHARING OF DEVELOPMENT

COSTS AND FOR CO-PROMOTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS BY EACH COMPANY.

IN 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WERE

EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING

JAPAN. IN 2002, EZETIMIBE, THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES

AS

ZETIA

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES). IN 2004, A COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

WAS APPROVED

IN THE UNITED STATES AS

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES).

THE CHOLESTEROL AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE SHARING OF OPERATING

INCOME GENERATED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL

PARTNERSHIP (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP) BASED UPON

PERCENTAGES THAT VARY BY PRODUCT, SALES LEVEL AND COUNTRY. IN

THE U.S. MARKET, THE PARTNERS SHARE PROFITS ON

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

SALES EQUALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

FIRST $300 MILLION OF ANNUAL

ZETIA

SALES, ON WHICH

SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVES A GREATER SHARE OF PROFITS. OPERATING

INCOME INCLUDES EXPENSES THAT THE PARTNERS HAVE CONTRACTUALLY

AGREED TO SHARE, SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANUFACTURING COSTS,

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED PROMOTION COSTS (INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

ADVERTISING AND DIRECT AND IDENTIFIABLE

OUT-OF-POCKET

PROMOTION) AND OTHER AGREED UPON COSTS FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES

SUCH AS ON-GOING CLINICAL RESEARCH, MARKET SUPPORT, MARKET

RESEARCH, MARKET EXPANSION, AS WELL AS A SPECIALTY SALES FORCE

AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUPPORT

OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP BUT NOT SHARED BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, SUCH

AS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (INCLUDING CERTAIN

SALES FORCE COSTS), AS WELL AS CERTAIN MANUFACTURING COSTS, ARE

NOT INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES. HOWEVER, THESE

COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY SHARED

EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR EARNED MILESTONES.

INCREASED 25% IN 2007 AND 38% IN 2006.

ON JANUARY 14, 2008, THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THE

PRIMARY ENDPOINT AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE (EFFECT OF

COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN

ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA) TRIAL. THE MSP

PARTNERSHIP

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBMITTED AN ABSTRACT ON THE ENHANCE TRIAL FOR PRESENTATION AT

THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY MEETING IN MARCH 2008 AND WAS

NOTIFIED OF ITS ACCEPTANCE BY THE COLLEGE. ENHANCE WAS A

SURROGATE ENDPOINT TRIAL CONDUCTED IN 720 PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE CONDITION

THAT AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 0.2% OF THE POPULATION. ALL ANALYSES

WERE CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORIGINAL STATISTICAL

ANALYSIS PLAN. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS THE MEAN CHANGE IN THE

INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS MEASURED AT THREE SITES IN THE CAROTID

ARTERIES (THE RIGHT AND LEFT COMMON CAROTID, INTERNAL CAROTID

AND CAROTID BULB) BETWEEN PATIENTS TREATED WITH

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG VERSUS PATIENTS TREATED WITH

SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS

NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS

ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT. THERE WAS ALSO NO STATISTICALLY

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TREATMENT GROUPS FOR EACH OF

THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT, INCLUDING THE COMMON

CAROTID ARTERY. KEY SECONDARY IMAGING ENDPOINTS SHOWED NO

STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS. THE OVERALL

INCIDENCE RATES OF TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS, SERIOUS

ADVERSE EVENTS OR ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION WERE

GENERALLY SIMILAR BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS. BOTH MEDICINES WERE

GENERALLY WELL TOLERATED. OVERALL, THE SAFETY PROFILES OF

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE WERE SIMILAR AND

GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PRODUCT LABELS. IN THE TRIAL,

THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN

(LDL) CHOLESTEROL LOWERING SEEN BETWEEN THE

TREATMENT GROUPS  58% LDL CHOLESTEROL LOWERING AT

24 MONTHS ON EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AS COMPARED TO 41% AT

24 MONTHS ON SIMVASTATIN ALONE. THIS SURROGATE ENDPOINT

STUDY WAS NOT POWERED NOR DESIGNED TO ASSESS CARDIOVASCULAR

CLINICAL EVENT OUTCOMES. THE MSP PARTNERSHIP IS CURRENTLY

CONDUCTING THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL, A LARGE CLINICAL CARDIOVASCULAR

OUTCOMES TRIAL COMPARING

VYTORIN

(EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN)

AND SIMVASTATIN AND INCLUDING MORE THAN 10,000 PATIENTS.

VYTORIN

CONTAINS TWO MEDICINES: EZETIMIBE AND

SIMVASTATIN.

VYTORIN

HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE HEART

ATTACKS OR STROKES MORE THAN SIMVASTATIN ALONE.

DURING DECEMBER 2007 AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2008, THE

COMPANY AND ITS JOINT-VENTURE PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, RECEIVED

SEVERAL JOINT LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND

COMMERCE AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND

INVESTIGATIONS, AND ONE LETTER FROM THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS

INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES

RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE COMPANIES AND THE MSP PARTNERSHIP

EACH RECEIVED TWO SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS.

MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE ALSO EACH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE OFFICE OF THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED

FEBRUARY 1, 2008, REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE

MARKETING AND SALE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND THE

TIMING OF DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH

SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, SINCE

MID-JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING

COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE ENHANCE CLINICAL

TRIAL RESULTS IN THE PRESS RELEASE ON JANUARY 14, 2008. TO

DATE, SALES OF BOTH PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN BELOW THE

COMPANYS PRIOR EXPECTATIONS. IN ADDITION, WHOLESALERS IN

THE U.S. HAVE MODERATED THEIR PURCHASES OF BOTH PRODUCTS TO

REDUCE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS.

THE RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE JOINT

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE

PARTNERS OF A ONCE-DAILY, FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING

THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE.

MONTELUKAST SODIUM, A LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IS SOLD

BY MERCK AS

SINGULAIR

AND LORATADINE, AN ANTIHISTAMINE,

IS SOLD BY SCHERING-PLOUGH AS CLARITIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

INDICATED FOR THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS. IN

AUGUST 2007, THE PARTNERS ANNOUNCED THAT THE NEW DRUG

APPLICATION FILING FOR MONTELUKAST SODIUM/LORATADINE HAD BEEN

ACCEPTED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR

STANDARD REVIEW. THE PARTNERS ARE SEEKING U.S. MARKETING

APPROVAL OF THE MEDICINE FOR TREATMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS

SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WHO WANT RELIEF FROM NASAL CONGESTION. THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES FDA ACTION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008.

THE RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE MSP

PARTNERSHIP ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES. MERCK

RECOGNIZED EQUITY INCOME OF $1,830.8 MILLION IN 2007,

$1,218.6 MILLION IN 2006 AND $570.4 MILLION IN 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ARE INCLUDED IN

ITEM 15. (A)(2) FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULES BELOW.

ASTRAZENECA

LP

IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN

EQUALLY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE THAT DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF

ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC

, THE FIRST IN A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS

KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF

ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA RESTRUCTURED THE JOINT VENTURE

WHEREBY THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN THE JOINT

VENTURE, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED

KBIS OPERATING ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE

PARTNERSHIP), IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A

LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED ASTRAZENECA

LP (AZLP) UPON ASTRAS 1999 MERGER WITH ZENECA

GROUP PLC (THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER), BECAME THE

EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED

RIGHTS.

MERCK EARNS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE

KBI PRODUCTS AND SUCH REVENUE WAS $1.7 BILLION,

$1.8 BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM,

AS

WELL AS

PRILOSEC

. IN ADDITION, MERCK EARNS CERTAIN

PARTNERSHIP RETURNS, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES. SUCH RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR

IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART,

UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND A

PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING MERCKS SHARE OF

UNDISTRIBUTED AZLP GAAP EARNINGS. THESE RETURNS AGGREGATED

$820.1 MILLION, $783.7 MILLION AND $833.5 MILLION

IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER

TRIGGERS A PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF MERCKS LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN 2008. UPON THIS REDEMPTION, AZLP WILL

DISTRIBUTE TO KBI AN AMOUNT BASED PRIMARILY ON A MULTIPLE OF

MERCKS AVERAGE ANNUAL VARIABLE RETURNS DERIVED FROM SALES

OF THE FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS FOR THE THREE YEARS PRIOR

TO THE REDEMPTION (THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED

VALUE).

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS DEFERRED INCOME,

ASTRA PURCHASED AN OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) TO BUY

MERCKS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE

GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

(THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS). THE ASSET OPTION IS

EXERCISABLE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010 AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL

TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 OF PROJECTED

FUTURE PRETAX REVENUE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FROM THE

NON-PPI PRODUCTS (THE APPRAISED VALUE). MERCK ALSO

HAD THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008

AT THE APPRAISED VALUE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ADVISED

AZLP THAT IT WILL NOT EXERCISE THE ASSET OPTION. IN ADDITION, IN

1998 THE COMPANY GRANTED ASTRA AN OPTION TO BUY MERCKS

COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI, AND, THEREFORE, MERCKS

INTEREST IN

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

, EXERCISABLE TWO

YEARS AFTER ASTRAS PURCHASE OF MERCKS INTEREST IN

THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS. THE EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION BY ASTRA IS

ALSO PROVIDED FOR IN THE YEAR 2017 OR IF COMBINED ANNUAL SALES

OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN

EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG AS ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 HAS

BEEN EXERCISED. THE EXERCISE PRICE IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT

VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE, SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN

TRUE-UP

MECHANISMS.

ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER, IN EXCHANGE FOR

MERCKS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA PRODUCTS

WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT THE TIME OF THE

MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4 MILLION (THE ADVANCE

PAYMENT), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION (THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT) IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IN 2008 OF

THE ASTRA PRODUCT RIGHTS RETAINED BY THE COMPANY. ACCORDINGLY,

RECOGNITION OF THIS CONTINGENT INCOME HAS BEEN DEFERRED UNTIL

THE REALIZABLE AMOUNT IS DETERMINABLE IN 2008. IN 2007, THE

COMPANY RECLASSIFIED THIS AMOUNT TO ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT

LIABILITIES FROM NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES AS THIS

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION WILL OCCUR BEFORE THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2008.

THE SUM OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE, THE

APPRAISED VALUE AND THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT IS GUARANTEED TO BE A MINIMUM OF $4.7 BILLION.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE AND

PAYMENT OF THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT WILL OCCUR IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008 AND SUCH AMOUNTS ARE

ANTICIPATED TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE

$4.7 BILLION. THESE PAYMENTS WILL RESULT IN A PRETAX GAIN

ESTIMATED TO BE $2.1 BILLION TO

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$2.3 BILLION. ASTRAZENECAS PURCHASE OF MERCKS

INTEREST IN THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS IS CONTINGENT UPON THE EXERCISE

OF ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 AND, THEREFORE, PAYMENT OF

THE APPRAISED VALUE MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.

MERIAL

LIMITED

IN 1997, MERCK AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW SANOFI-AVENTIS

S.A.) COMBINED THEIR ANIMAL HEALTH AND POULTRY GENETICS

BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A

FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE

JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A

COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $1.0 BILLION IN 2007,

$980.2 MILLION IN 2006 AND $1.4 BILLION IN 2005.

EXPENDITURES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE $788.0 MILLION IN

2007, $714.7 MILLION IN 2006 AND $938.7 MILLION IN

2005. EXPENDITURES DURING 2007 INCLUDED $372.7 MILLION FOR

PRODUCTION FACILITIES, $226.2 MILLION FOR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES, $9.3 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

PROJECTS, AND $402.8 MILLION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, SAFETY AND

GENERAL SITE PROJECTS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 40% REPRESENTS

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS RELATED TO A MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO

TREASURY STOCK PURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE TOTAL OF WORLDWIDE CASH AND

INVESTMENTS WAS $15.4 BILLION, INCLUDING $8.2 BILLION

OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND

$7.2 BILLION OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET THE

OPERATING REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY. THE RATIOS OF TOTAL DEBT

TO TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS

TO TOTAL DEBT REFLECT THE STRENGTH OF THE COMPANYS

OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO COVER ITS

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIFTING ITS MIX OF INVESTMENTS

FROM SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF

WORKING CAPITAL IN LINE WITH HISTORICAL LEVELS RELATIVE TO THE

LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN 2005, TO ENABLE EXECUTION OF

THE AJCA REPATRIATION, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS MIX OF

INVESTMENTS FROM LONG-TERM TO SHORT-TERM, RESULTING IN A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005. THE AJCA CREATED TEMPORARY INCENTIVES THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2005 FOR U.S. MULTINATIONALS TO

REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

AJCA, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED $15.9 BILLION DURING 2005. AS

A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCOME TAX CHARGE OF

$766.5 MILLION IN TAXES ON INCOME IN 2005 RELATED TO THIS

REPATRIATION, $185 MILLION OF WHICH WAS PAID IN 2005 AND

THE REMAINDER OF WHICH WAS PAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION OF

THE AJCA REPATRIATION WAS INVESTED IN FULLY COLLATERALIZED

OVERNIGHT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. IN EARLY 2006, THE COMPANY

BEGAN REINVESTING ITS REPURCHASE AGREEMENT BALANCES INTO OTHER

INVESTMENTS.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT UNDER THE

U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, IF PARTICIPATION

CONDITIONS ARE MET OR WAIVED, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE PAYMENTS OF

UP TO APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION PURSUANT TO THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. ALSO, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES MAKING

PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $671 MILLION RELATED TO THE

RESOLUTION OF INVESTIGATIONS OF CIVIL CLAIMS BY FEDERAL AND

STATE AUTHORITIES RELATING TO CERTAIN PAST MARKETING AND SELLING

ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY WILL RECEIVE PAYMENTS IN THE FIRST HALF

OF 2008 FOR CERTAIN AZLP-RELATED ACTIVITIES AS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCUSSED ABOVE IN SELECTED JOINT VENTURE AND AFFILIATE

INFORMATION. DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH AMOUNTS ARE ANTICIPATED

TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE $4.7 BILLION

MINIMUM.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE IRS HAS COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION

OF THE COMPANYS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1993 TO 2001. AS

A RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION, THE COMPANY MADE AN AGGREGATE

PAYMENT OF $2.79 BILLION IN FEBRUARY 2007. THIS PAYMENT WAS

OFFSET BY (I) A TAX REFUND OF $165 MILLION RECEIVED IN

2007 FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID FOR THESE MATTERS AND

(II) A FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY

$360 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT,

RESULTING IN A NET CASH COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION IN 2007. THE IMPACT FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO

2001 FOR ITEMS REVIEWED AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION WAS INCLUDED

IN THE PAYMENT ALTHOUGH THOSE YEARS REMAIN OPEN IN ALL OTHER

RESPECTS. THE CLOSING OF THE IRS EXAMINATION DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

2007 AS THESE AMOUNTS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MERCKS CANADIAN TAX RETURNS FOR

THE YEARS 1998 THROUGH 2004 ARE BEING EXAMINED BY THE CANADA

REVENUE AGENCY (CRA). IN OCTOBER 2006, THE CRA

ISSUED THE COMPANY A NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT CONTAINING

ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS,

WHICH RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CANADIAN AND PROVINCIAL TAX DUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS

INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY $810 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS).

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2007, THE CRA PROPOSED ADDITIONAL

ADJUSTMENTS FOR 1999 RELATING TO ANOTHER INTERCOMPANY PRICING

MATTER. THE ADJUSTMENTS WOULD INCREASE CANADIAN TAX DUE BY

APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS

$21 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) OF INTEREST. IT IS POSSIBLE

THAT THE CRA WILL PROPOSE SIMILAR ADJUSTMENTS FOR LATER YEARS.

THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE CRA AND

BELIEVES THEY ARE WITHOUT MERIT. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTEST

THE ASSESSMENT THROUGH THE CRA APPEALS PROCESS AND THE COURTS IF

NECESSARY. IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS, DURING 2007,

THE COMPANY PLEDGED COLLATERAL TO TWO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

ONE OF WHICH PROVIDED A GUARANTEE TO THE CRA AND THE OTHER TO

THE QUEBEC MINISTRY OF REVENUE REPRESENTING A PORTION OF THE TAX

AND INTEREST ASSESSED. THE COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN OTHER

ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE

COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THESE MATTERS.

WHILE THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS MAY RESULT IN LIABILITIES

HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RESERVES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, AN

UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE

QUARTER IN WHICH AN ADJUSTMENT IS RECORDED OR TAX IS DUE.

IN JULY 2007, THE CRA NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT IT IS IN THE

PROCESS OF PROPOSING A PENALTY OF $160 MILLION

(U.S. DOLLARS) IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2006 NOTICE. THE

PENALTY IS FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON A TIMELY BASIS.

THE COMPANY VIGOROUSLY DISAGREES WITH THE PENALTY AND FEELS IT

IS INAPPLICABLE AND THAT APPROPRIATE INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED ON

A TIMELY BASIS. THE COMPANY IS PURSUING ALL APPROPRIATE REMEDIES

TO AVOID HAVING THE PENALTY ASSESSED AND WAS NOTIFIED IN EARLY

AUGUST 2007 THAT THE CRA IS HOLDING THE IMPOSITION OF A PENALTY

IN ABEYANCE PENDING A REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS SUBMISSIONS

AS TO THE INAPPLICABILITY OF A PENALTY.

THE IRS RECENTLY BEGAN ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS

2002 TO 2005 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS

STATE AND FOREIGN TAX EXAMINATIONS ARE IN PROGRESS. TAX YEARS

THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS

INCLUDE GERMANY FROM 1999, ITALY AND JAPAN FROM 2000 AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM FROM 2002.

A CURRENT LIABILITY. DUE TO THE HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS OF LIABILITIES FOR

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BEYOND ONE YEAR, A REASONABLE ESTIMATE

OF THE PERIOD OF CASH SETTLEMENT FOR YEARS BEYOND 2008 CAN NOT

BE MADE.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GOODS AND SERVICES

THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING AND INCLUDE OBLIGATIONS

FOR MINIMUM INVENTORY CONTRACTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

ADVERTISING. AMOUNTS REFLECTED FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OBLIGATIONS DO NOT INCLUDE CONTINGENT MILESTONE PAYMENTS. LOANS

PAYABLE AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ALSO REFLECTS

$331.7 MILLION OF LONG-DATED NOTES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

REPAYMENT AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

REQUIRED FUNDING OBLIGATIONS FOR 2008 RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE CAPACITY OF ITS

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) TO ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES

BY AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE

COMPANY ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF 4.75% TEN-YEAR NOTES UNDER

THE SHELF. IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ISSUED

$500 MILLION OF 5.75% TWENTY-YEAR NOTES AND

$250 MILLION OF 5.125% FIVE-YEAR NOTES UNDER THE SHELF. THE

REMAINING CAPACITY UNDER THE COMPANYS SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT IS APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION.

IN APRIL 2007, THE COMPANY EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF ITS

$1.5 BILLION,

5-YEAR

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FROM APRIL 2011 TO APRIL 2012. THE

FACILITY PROVIDES BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR THE COMPANYS

COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING FACILITY AND IS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE

PURPOSES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DRAWN FUNDING FROM THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY

MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE AND STANDARD &

POORS ARE AA3 WITH A DEVELOPING OUTLOOK AND AA- WITH A

STABLE OUTLOOK, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RATINGS CONTINUE TO ALLOW

ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND FLEXIBILITY IN OBTAINING FUNDS

ON COMPETITIVE TERMS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A

CONSERVATIVE FINANCIAL PROFILE. TOTAL CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF

$15.4 BILLION EXCEEDS THE SUM OF LOANS PAYABLE AND

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $5.7 BILLION. WE PLACE OUR CASH AND

INVESTMENTS IN INSTRUMENTS THAT MEET HIGH CREDIT QUALITY

STANDARDS, AS SPECIFIED IN OUR INVESTMENT POLICY GUIDELINES.

THESE GUIDELINES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY

ONE ISSUER. DESPITE THIS STRONG FINANCIAL PROFILE, CERTAIN

CONTINGENT EVENTS, IF REALIZED, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY

AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING UNCONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES THAT PROVIDE FINANCING OR POTENTIALLY EXPOSE THE

COMPANY TO UNRECORDED FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.

IN JULY 2002, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED PURCHASES OVER

TIME OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF MERCK SHARES. TOTAL TREASURY

STOCK PURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN 2007 WAS

$1.4 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

$5.1 BILLION REMAINS UNDER THE 2002 STOCK REPURCHASE

AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY THE MERCK BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

WHILE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. MERCK RELIES ON SUSTAINED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM

FOREIGN SOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THE EXTENT

THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CASH FLOWS IS DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF A

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND

RESEARCH AND OTHER DOLLAR-BASED STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AT A

CONSISTENT LEVEL MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO

PROTECT AGAINST VOLATILITY OF FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS

AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR LONGER-TERM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TO DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, PRIMARILY

THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE

COMPANY WILL PARTIALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED THIRD-PARTY SALES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER ITS PLANNING CYCLE, TYPICALLY NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL LAYER IN

HEDGES OVER TIME, INCREASING THE PORTION OF SALES HEDGED AS IT

GETS CLOSER TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUCH THAT

IT IS PROBABLE THE HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. THE PORTION OF

SALES HEDGED IS BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF COST-BENEFIT PROFILES

THAT CONSIDER NATURAL OFFSETTING EXPOSURES, REVENUE AND EXCHANGE

RATE VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, AND THE COST OF HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS. THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES ARE A SPECIFIED

COMPONENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF SIMILARLY DENOMINATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY-BASED SALES TRANSACTIONS, EACH OF WHICH RESPONDS TO THE

HEDGED RISK IN THE SAME MANNER. MERCK MANAGES ITS ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY

PUT OPTIONS, WHICH PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A RIGHT, BUT NOT AN

OBLIGATION, TO SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT A

PREDETERMINED PRICE. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS

RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, TOTAL

CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS FULLY OFFSET THE DECLINE

IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED

FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENS, THE OPTIONS VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO, BUT THE

COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE

ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. WHILE A WEAKER

U.S. DOLLAR WOULD RESULT IN A NET BENEFIT, THE MARKET VALUE

OF THE COMPANYS HEDGES WOULD HAVE DECLINED BY

$69.5 MILLION AND $38.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FROM A

UNIFORM 10% WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. THE MARKET VALUE WAS DETERMINED

USING A FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION PRICING MODEL AND HOLDING ALL

FACTORS EXCEPT EXCHANGE RATES CONSTANT. BECAUSE MERCK

PRINCIPALLY USES PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS, A UNIFORM

WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL YIELD THE LARGEST OVERALL

POTENTIAL LOSS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS. THE

SENSITIVITY MEASUREMENT ASSUMES THAT A CHANGE IN ONE FOREIGN

CURRENCY RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WOULD NOT AFFECT OTHER

FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH

NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A 10%

THRESHOLD REFLECTS REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN

MERCKS MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF CASH FLOWS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS FROM THE EFFECTS OF

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEIR

CONVERSION TO U.S. DOLLARS. MERCK PRINCIPALLY UTILIZES

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO BUY AND

SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

AND ECONOMICALLY OFFSET THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS DERIVED

FROM THE NET ASSETS. MERCK ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS TO

FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES DENOMINATED IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRY CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE

YEN. FOR EXPOSURES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CURRENCIES, THE COMPANY

WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ON A MORE LIMITED BASIS AND

ONLY WHEN IT IS DEEMED ECONOMICAL TO DO SO BASED ON A

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

EXPOSURE, THE VOLATILITY OF THE EXCHANGE RATE AND THE COST OF

THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MINIMIZE THE

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE ON MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY

MANAGING OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND NET ASSET POSITIONS AT THE

LOCAL LEVEL. THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO CHANGES IN THE VALUE

OF THE U.S. DOLLAR ON FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

DERIVATIVES, INVESTMENTS AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

INDICATED THAT IF THE U.S. DOLLAR UNIFORMLY WEAKENED BY 10%

AGAINST ALL CURRENCY EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, INCOME BEFORE TAXES WOULD HAVE

DECLINED BY $24.6 MILLION AND $32.7 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MERCK IS IN A NET SHORT POSITION RELATIVE TO ITS MAJOR FOREIGN

CURRENCIES AFTER CONSIDERATION OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, A UNIFORM

WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL YIELD THE LARGEST OVERALL

POTENTIAL NET LOSS IN EARNINGS DUE TO EXCHANGE. THIS MEASUREMENT

ASSUMES THAT A CHANGE IN ONE FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR WOULD NOT AFFECT OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES

RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN

NATURE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN MERCKS MAJOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE

CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

IN ADDITION TO THE REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY MAY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONTRACTS ON CERTAIN INVESTING AND BORROWING TRANSACTIONS TO

MANAGE ITS NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND TO REDUCE

ITS OVERALL COST OF BORROWING. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE

LEVERAGED SWAPS AND, IN GENERAL, DOES NOT LEVERAGE ANY OF ITS

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD PUT PRINCIPAL CAPITAL AT RISK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY TO SEVEN

PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE

NOTES. THERE WERE TWO SWAPS MATURING IN 2011 WITH NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF $125 MILLION EACH; ONE SWAP MATURING IN 2013

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION AND FOUR SWAPS

MATURING IN 2015 WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $250 MILLION

EACH. THE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS

TO FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS. IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2008, THE

COMPANY TERMINATED THE FOUR INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $250 MILLION EACH, WHICH EFFECTIVELY

CONVERTED ITS 4.75% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE 2015 TO VARIABLE RATE

DEBT. AS A RESULT OF THE SWAP TERMINATIONS, THE COMPANY RECEIVED

$96.2 MILLION IN CASH, EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST WHICH WAS

NOT MATERIAL. THE CORRESPONDING GAINS RELATED TO THE BASIS

ADJUSTMENT OF THE DEBT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATED SWAP

CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN DEFERRED AND WILL BE AMORTIZED AS A

REDUCTION OF INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE

NOTES. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS

OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, THE MARKET VALUES OF

WHICH ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES. THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS MEDIUM- TO

LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS IS MODESTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES

IN U.S. INTEREST RATES. CHANGES IN MEDIUM- TO LONG-TERM

U.S. INTEREST RATES HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS, WHICH

GENERALLY HAVE LONGER MATURITIES. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO

MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS, DEBT AND RELATED SWAP CONTRACTS FROM

A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006

WOULD HAVE POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE NET AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS BY $62.1 MILLION AND $111.0 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 WOULD HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

THE NET AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE BY $114.6 MILLION AND

$171.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS DEBT WAS DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS

REFLECTING ONE PERCENTAGE POINT SHIFTS IN THE APPROPRIATE YIELD

CURVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS WAS

DETERMINED USING A COMBINATION OF PRICING AND DURATION MODELS.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER MATTERS

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS

THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING SUCH ITEMS AS

PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, DEPRECIABLE AND

AMORTIZABLE LIVES, RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN

PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR

CONTINGENCIES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER RESERVES,

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS,

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ASSUMPTIONS, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN

CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS, IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AND INVESTMENTS, AND TAXES ON INCOME. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY

INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES. APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES

RESULT IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

REVENUES FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND

RISK OF LOSS PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. DUE TO CHANGES IN TERMS AND

CONDITIONS FOR DOMESTIC PHARMACEUTICAL SALES IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2007, REVENUES FOR THESE PRODUCTS, PREVIOUSLY

RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, WERE RECOGNIZED AT TIME OF

DELIVERY CONSISTENT WITH MANY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND VACCINE

SALES. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REVENUE IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2007 AS A

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULT OF THESE CHANGES. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ALSO REQUIRES

REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COLLECTION OF SALES PROCEEDS AND

COMPLETION OF ALL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. DOMESTICALLY, SALES

DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS AS DIRECT DISCOUNTS AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE

OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALE PURCHASER, KNOWN

AS CHARGEBACKS, OR INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF REBATES.

ADDITIONALLY, SALES ARE GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF

RETURN UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF

PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, WHICH ARE

ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

THE PROVISION FOR AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS COVERS

CHARGEBACKS AND REBATES. CHARGEBACKS ARE DISCOUNTS THAT OCCUR

WHEN A CONTRACTED CUSTOMER PURCHASES DIRECTLY THROUGH AN

INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALE PURCHASER. THE CONTRACTED CUSTOMER

GENERALLY PURCHASES PRODUCT AT ITS CONTRACTED PRICE PLUS A

MARK-UP

FROM

THE WHOLESALER. THE WHOLESALER, IN TURN, CHARGES THE COMPANY

BACK FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE INITIALLY PAID BY THE

WHOLESALER AND THE CONTRACT PRICE PAID TO THE WHOLESALER BY THE

CUSTOMER. THE PROVISION FOR CHARGEBACKS IS BASED ON EXPECTED

SELL-THROUGH LEVELS BY THE COMPANYS WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS TO

CONTRACTED CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS ESTIMATED WHOLESALER INVENTORY

LEVELS. REBATES ARE AMOUNTS OWED BASED UPON DEFINITIVE

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH PRIVATE SECTOR

AND PUBLIC SECTOR (MEDICAID AND MEDICARE

PART D) BENEFIT PROVIDERS, AFTER THE FINAL DISPENSING

OF THE PRODUCT BY A PHARMACY TO A BENEFIT PLAN PARTICIPANT. THE

PROVISION IS BASED ON EXPECTED PAYMENTS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY

PATIENT USAGE AND CONTRACT PERFORMANCE BY THE BENEFIT PROVIDER

CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY ASSUMES A

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT MOVEMENT OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR

PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING ITS AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNT

ACCRUAL. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL CUSTOMER

SEGMENT MIX, ADJUSTED FOR OTHER KNOWN EVENTS, IN ORDER TO

ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PROVISION. AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR AGGREGATE

INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS ARE EVALUATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS

THROUGH COMPARISON OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE WHOLESALERS

AND OTHER CUSTOMERS TO THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED. ADJUSTMENTS ARE

RECORDED WHEN TRENDS OR SIGNIFICANT EVENTS INDICATE THAT A

CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED PROVISION IS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS PROVISION FOR AGGREGATE

INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS

TO ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER

DISCOUNT PROVISION IN 2007, 2006 OR 2005.

SUMMARIZED INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN THE AGGREGATE INDIRECT

LIABILITIES WERE $82.5 MILLION AND $616.9 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND $60.4 MILLION

AND $696.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RETURNS POLICY THAT ALLOWS ITS CUSTOMERS

TO RETURN PRODUCT WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD PRIOR TO AND

SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXPIRATION DATE (GENERALLY, SIX MONTHS BEFORE

AND TWELVE MONTHS AFTER PRODUCT EXPIRATION). THE ESTIMATE OF THE

PROVISION FOR RETURNS IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH

ACTUAL RETURNS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS FACTORS SUCH

AS LEVELS OF INVENTORY IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, PRODUCT

DATING AND EXPIRATION PERIOD, WHETHER PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

DISCONTINUED, ENTRANCE IN THE MARKET OF ADDITIONAL GENERIC

COMPETITION, CHANGES IN FORMULARIES OR LAUNCH OF

OVER-THE-COUNTER

PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS. THE PRODUCT RETURNS PROVISION, AS WELL

AS ACTUAL RETURNS, WERE LESS THAN 1.0% OF NET SALES IN 2007,

2006 AND 2005.

THROUGH ITS DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH U.S. WHOLESALERS, THE

COMPANY ENCOURAGES WHOLESALERS TO ALIGN PURCHASES WITH

UNDERLYING DEMAND AND MAINTAIN INVENTORIES WITHIN SPECIFIED

LEVELS. THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM ALLOW THE WHOLESALERS TO EARN

FEES UPON PROVIDING VISIBILITY INTO THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS AS

WELL AS BY ACHIEVING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS, SUCH AS,

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, REDUCING SHORTAGE

CLAIMS AND

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REDUCING PRODUCT RETURNS. INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE

WHOLESALER DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM INCLUDES ITEMS SUCH AS SALES

TRENDS, INVENTORY ON-HAND, ON-ORDER QUANTITY AND PRODUCT RETURNS.

WHOLESALERS GENERALLY PROVIDE ONLY THE ABOVE MENTIONED DATA TO

THE COMPANY, AS THERE IS NO REGULATORY REQUIREMENT TO REPORT LOT

LEVEL INFORMATION TO MANUFACTURERS, WHICH IS THE LEVEL OF

INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE REMAINING SHELF LIFE AND

ORIGINAL SALE DATE OF INVENTORY. GIVEN CURRENT WHOLESALER

INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN A MONTH, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT COLLECTION OF ORDER LOT INFORMATION ACROSS

ALL WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE LIMITED USE IN ESTIMATING

SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS.

INVENTORIES

PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR

PRODUCT LAUNCHES SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT INITIAL MARKET DEMAND.

TYPICALLY, CAPITALIZATION OF SUCH INVENTORY DOES NOT BEGIN UNTIL

THE RELATED PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE IN PHASE III CLINICAL

TRIALS AND ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF

REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE STATUS OF EACH

RESPECTIVE PRODUCT WITHIN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT DISCLOSE SPECIFIC TIMING

FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC

RISKS OR CONTINGENCIES OTHER THAN THE NORMAL REGULATORY APPROVAL

PROCESS OR IF THERE ARE ANY SPECIFIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING

THE RESEARCH PROCESS RELATING TO SAFETY, EFFICACY,

MANUFACTURING, MARKETING OR LABELING, THE RELATED INVENTORY

WOULD GENERALLY NOT BE CAPITALIZED. EXPIRY DATES OF THE

INVENTORY ARE IMPACTED BY THE STAGE OF COMPLETION. THE COMPANY

MANAGES THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY AT EACH STAGE TO OPTIMIZE THE

SHELF LIFE OF THE INVENTORY IN RELATION TO ANTICIPATED MARKET

DEMAND IN ORDER TO AVOID PRODUCT EXPIRY ISSUES. FOR INVENTORIES

THAT ARE CAPITALIZED, ANTICIPATED FUTURE SALES AND SHELF LIVES

SUPPORT THE REALIZATION OF THE INVENTORY VALUE AS THE INVENTORY

SHELF LIFE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET INITIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH

REQUIREMENTS. INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT

LAUNCHES CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT.

CONTINGENCIES

AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS

WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS. (SEE

NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.) THE

COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY

AS ASSESSMENTS CHANGE OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, A PORTION OF THE

OVERALL ACCRUAL IS ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED AND CONSIDERS SUCH

FACTORS AS PAST EXPERIENCE, NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND

ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. INDIVIDUALLY

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LOSSES ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD A RESERVE

OF $685 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION (AS DEFINED BELOW).

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND RECORDED ADDITIONAL CHARGES OF

$673 MILLION. ACCORDINGLY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE COMPANY HAD A RESERVE OF $858 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS

FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. DURING 2007, THE COMPANY SPENT $616 MILLION

IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO

(I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THIRD QUARTER

OF 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF $210 MILLION AND

$70 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY

FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. IN INCREASING THE RESERVE, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERED THE SAME FACTORS THAT IT CONSIDERED WHEN IT

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE

COMMITTEE OF THE PLAINTIFFS STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE

FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS

REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW

JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE

STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE

UNITED STATES. IF CERTAIN PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS UNDER THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE MET (OR WAIVED), MERCK WILL PAY A

FIXED AGGREGATE AMOUNT INTO TWO FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS THAT

ENTER INTO THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. AS A RESULT OF ENTERING INTO

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE

OF $4.85 BILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIXED AGGREGATE

AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO PLAINTIFFS QUALIFYING FOR PAYMENT UNDER THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY

SPENT APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION IN

VIOXX

LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS WHICH RESULTED

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN A RESERVE OF $522 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 FOR

ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. AFTER ENTERING INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT,

THE COMPANY REVIEWED ITS RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND ALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION OF

ITS RESERVE TO MERCKS ANTICIPATED FUTURE COSTS TO

ADMINISTER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE RESERVE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF

THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT WILL BE CONSUMMATED, BUT THAT CERTAIN LAWSUITS WILL

CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT

AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS

AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND

TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EVENTS

SUCH AS SCHEDULED TRIALS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT

2008 AND 2009, AND THE INHERENT INABILITY TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOMES OF SUCH TRIALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS NOT PARTICIPATING IN OR

NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, LIMIT THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS LEGAL COSTS

BEYOND 2009. TOGETHER WITH THE $4.85 BILLION RESERVED FOR

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE

ESTABLISHED FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.372 BILLION.

WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL NEED TO

INCREASE THE RESERVE EVERY QUARTER, IT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE ITS RESERVES

FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO

SO.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED THROUGHOUT 2008. A

TRIAL IN THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2008, BUT

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS,

INCLUDING FOR THOSE CASES IN WHICH VERDICTS OR JUDGMENTS HAVE

BEEN ENTERED AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND ARE NOW IN POST-VERDICT

PROCEEDINGS OR ON APPEAL. IN EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE

THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN SUCH CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A REMAINING

RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF

THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION; THE NUMBER OF CASES

BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION,

THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE END OF

2009. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY

POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. WHEN A LEGITIMATE CLAIM FOR CONTRIBUTION

IS ASSERTED, A LIABILITY IS INITIALLY ACCRUED BASED UPON THE

ESTIMATED TRANSACTION COSTS TO MANAGE THE SITE. ACCRUALS ARE

ADJUSTED AS FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND RELATED COST ASSESSMENTS OF

REMEDIAL TECHNIQUES ARE COMPLETED, AND AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) WHO MAY

BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE IS

DETERMINED.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES

AND TAKES AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE

COSTS. A WORLDWIDE SURVEY WAS INITIALLY PERFORMED TO ASSESS ALL

SITES FOR POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL

ACTIVITIES. WHERE

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION WAS WARRANTED,

SUCH INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED, PROVIDING A BETTER EVALUATION

OF THE NEED FOR REMEDIAL ACTION. WHERE SUCH NEED WAS IDENTIFIED,

REMEDIAL ACTION WAS THEN INITIATED. ESTIMATES OF THE EXTENT OF

CONTAMINATION AT EACH SITE WERE INITIALLY MADE AT THE

PRE-INVESTIGATION STAGE AND LIABILITIES FOR THE POTENTIAL COST

OF REMEDIATION WERE ACCRUED AT THAT TIME. AS MORE DEFINITIVE

INFORMATION BECAME AVAILABLE DURING THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATIONS

AND/OR

REMEDIAL EFFORTS AT EACH SITE, ESTIMATES WERE REFINED AND

ACCRUALS WERE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. THESE ESTIMATES AND RELATED

ACCRUALS CONTINUE TO BE REFINED ANNUALLY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE

$19.5 MILLION IN 2007, AND ARE ESTIMATED AT

$69.1 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2008 THROUGH 2012. IN

MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN

ACCRUED AND TOTALED $109.6 MILLION AND $129.0 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND DECEMBER 31, 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT

CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM OTHER PARTIES AND WILL BE

PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE

SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE NEXT

15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY

POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE

LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $54.0 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE. MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION COST RELATING TO SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN NET INCOME USING A FAIR-VALUE

MEASUREMENT METHOD, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 123R, WHICH IT

ADOPTED ON JANUARY 1, 2006. FAS 123R REQUIRES ALL

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE

BASED ON FAIR VALUE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE

AWARDS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

SHARE-BASED AWARDS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL

WHICH USES BOTH HISTORICAL AND CURRENT MARKET DATA TO ESTIMATE

THE FAIR VALUE. THIS METHOD INCORPORATES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS

SUCH AS THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY,

EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD AND EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTIONS.

PENSIONS

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST TOTALED

$489.3 MILLION IN 2007 AND $563.7 MILLION IN 2006.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN INFORMATION FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS CALCULATED USING ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING A DISCOUNT RATE FOR PLAN BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND AN EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS.

THE COMPANY REASSESSES ITS BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS ON A REGULAR

BASIS. FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS EVALUATED ANNUALLY AND MODIFIED TO

REFLECT THE PREVAILING MARKET RATE AT DECEMBER 31 OF A PORTFOLIO

OF HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE

THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS NEEDED TO PAY THE BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS THEY COME DUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS DISCOUNT RATE TO 6.50% FROM 6.00% FOR

ITS U.S. PENSION PLANS AND ITS U.S. OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE RATE OF

RETURN TO BE EARNED ON PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PERIOD THE BENEFITS

INCLUDED IN THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION ARE TO BE PAID. IN DEVELOPING

THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM

COMPOUND ANNUALIZED RETURNS OF HISTORICAL MARKET DATA AS WELL AS

ACTUAL RETURNS ON THE COMPANYS PLAN ASSETS AND APPLIES

ADJUSTMENTS THAT REFLECT MORE RECENT CAPITAL MARKET EXPERIENCE.

USING THIS REFERENCE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DEVELOPS

FORWARD-LOOKING RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH ASSET CATEGORY AND

A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR A

TARGETED PORTFOLIO ALLOCATED ACROSS THESE INVESTMENT CATEGORIES.

THE EXPECTED PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE REFLECTS THE CONTRIBUTION OF

ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE. AS A RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS,

FOR 2008, THE COMPANYS EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN OF 8.75%

REMAINED UNCHANGED FROM 2007 FOR ITS U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

THE TARGET INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF THE COMPANYS

U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IS

ALLOCATED 45% TO 60% IN U.S. EQUITIES, 20% TO 30% IN

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, 15% TO 25% IN FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS,

AND UP TO 8% IN CASH AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE PORTFOLIOS

EQUITY WEIGHTING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE PLANS BENEFIT OBLIGATION. THE

EXPECTED ANNUAL STANDARD DEVIATION OF RETURNS OF THE TARGET

PORTFOLIO, WHICH APPROXIMATES 13%, REFLECTS BOTH THE EQUITY

ALLOCATION AND THE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS AMONG THE ASSET

CLASSES IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO INVESTS.

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT. A REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE OF PLUS

(MINUS) 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION,

WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE AN ESTIMATED

$42.4 MILLION FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE) IMPACT ON ITS

U.S. NET PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. A

REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE OF PLUS (MINUS) 25 BASIS POINTS

IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, WITH OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE AN ESTIMATED

$13.7 MILLION FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE) IMPACT ON ITS

U.S. NET PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAVE A MINIMUM PENSION FUNDING

REQUIREMENT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE DURING 2008. THE

PRECEDING HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED

RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS WOULD NOT IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

NET LOSS AMOUNTS, WHICH REFLECT EXPERIENCE DIFFERENTIALS

PRIMARILY RELATING TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPECTED AND ACTUAL

RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. EXPECTED RETURNS ARE

BASED ON A CALCULATED MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. UNDER THIS

METHODOLOGY, ASSET GAINS/LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTUAL RETURNS

THAT DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTED RETURNS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS RATABLY OVER A

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. ALSO, NET LOSS AMOUNTS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN THRESHOLDS ARE

AMORTIZED INTO NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST

OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

AMORTIZATION OF NET LOSSES FOR THE COMPANYS

U.S. PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST BY

APPROXIMATELY $68 MILLION ANNUALLY FROM 2008 THROUGH 2012.

ACQUISITIONS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE PURCHASE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. ANY EXCESS OF THE

PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ACQUIRED COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WHICH HAS NOT

COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE ACQUISITION WILL

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WOULD NOT BE

RECORDED. THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING

ACQUIRED RESEARCH, IS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND ACCORDINGLY, FOR SIGNIFICANT ITEMS, THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY OBTAINS ASSISTANCE FROM THIRD PARTY VALUATION

SPECIALISTS. AMOUNTS ARE ALLOCATED TO ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND

EXPENSED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION IF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY

HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTS.

FOR PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH

PROCESS THAT HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES, THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND AMORTIZES THEM OVER AN

APPROPRIATE USEFUL LIFE. THE VALUATIONS AND USEFUL LIFE

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE NEAR THE

ACQUISITION DATE AND ARE BASED ON EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT ARE DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT. THE JUDGMENTS MADE IN

DETERMINING ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED

AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AS WELL AS ASSET LIVES, CAN MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING ACQUIRED RESEARCH, THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY USES THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE

BASED ON EACH PROJECTS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS. FUTURE CASH

FLOWS ARE PREDOMINATELY BASED ON A NET INCOME FORECAST OF EACH

PROJECT, CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL PRICING, MARGINS AND EXPENSE

LEVELS OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS. REVENUES ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON

RELEVANT MARKET SIZE AND GROWTH FACTORS, EXPECTED INDUSTRY

TRENDS, INDIVIDUAL PROJECT LIFE CYCLES, AND THE LIFE OF EACH

RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERLYING PATENT, IF ANY. EXPECTED

REVENUES ARE THEN ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF TECHNICAL AND

MARKETING SUCCESS AND THE RESULTING CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED AT

A RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE.

IMPAIRMENTS

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY ASSESSES CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MAKES

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN EVALUATING

THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES WHETHER CURRENT FACTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ITS

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED ARE RECOVERABLE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPAIRMENTS OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

. IF SUCH

CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DETERMINED TO EXIST, AN ESTIMATE OF THE

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THESE ASSETS, OR APPROPRIATE

ASSET GROUPINGS, IS COMPARED TO THE CARRYING VALUE TO DETERMINE

WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE ASSET IS DETERMINED TO BE

IMPAIRED, THE LOSS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE AND ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF QUOTED

MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY WILL ESTIMATE ITS

FAIR VALUE USING A DISCOUNTED VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS APPROACH.

THE COMPANY TESTS ITS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

USING A FAIR VALUE BASED TEST. GOODWILL

REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF ACQUISITION COSTS OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED AND IS ASSIGNED TO

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE COMPANYS SEGMENTS. OTHER

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES ARE RECORDED AT COST. WHEN EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVIEW, THE COMPANY WILL ASSESS

RECOVERABILITY FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS OF OTHER INTANGIBLES USING

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM THE LOWEST APPROPRIATE

ASSET GROUPINGS, GENERALLY THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL. IMPAIRMENTS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING RESULTS TO THE EXTENT THAT CARRYING

VALUES EXCEED FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE NET

PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS.

IMPAIRMENTS

OF INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON THE

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT BELOW THE CARRYING VALUE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENTS OF ITS INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE DURATION AND

EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST AND THE

COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENTS.

TAXES ON

INCOME

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON PRETAX INCOME,

STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN

THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. AN

ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR A YEAR IS APPLIED TO THE

COMPANYS QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS. IN THE EVENT THAT

THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNUSUAL OR ONE-TIME ITEM RECOGNIZED, OR

EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED, IN THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY

OPERATING RESULTS, THE TAX ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT ITEM WOULD BE

SEPARATELY CALCULATED AND RECORDED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE

UNUSUAL OR ONE-TIME ITEM. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RESOLUTION

OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS TO BE SUCH ITEMS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT

IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE COMPANYS TAX PROVISION AND

IN EVALUATING ITS TAX POSITIONS. THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

OF A TAX POSITION IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST JUDGMENT

GIVEN THE FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE

REPORTING DATE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB INTERPRETATION

NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 109,

WHICH MERCK ADOPTED ON JANUARY 1, 2008,

THE COMPANY EVALUATES TAX POSITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

BENEFITS OF TAX POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX

POSITION. FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF

BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE LARGEST

AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING

REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PORTION

OF THE BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THRESHOLD IS NOT MET IN THE PERIOD FOR WHICH A TAX

POSITION IS TAKEN, THE COMPANY MAY SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZE THE

BENEFIT OF THAT TAX POSITION IF THE TAX MATTER IS EFFECTIVELY

SETTLED, THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRES, OR IF THE MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD IS MET IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD. (SEE

NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE TAX RETURN

AT DIFFERENT TIMES THAN THE ITEMS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. TIMING DIFFERENCES CREATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GENERALLY REPRESENT ITEMS THAT

CAN BE USED AS A TAX DEDUCTION OR CREDIT IN THE TAX RETURN IN

FUTURE YEARS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY RECORDED THE TAX

BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES

VALUATION ALLOWANCES FOR ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN THE AMOUNT

OF EXPECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IS NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE

USE OF THE DEDUCTION OR CREDIT. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES

GENERALLY REPRESENT TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR WHICH PAYMENT HAS BEEN DEFERRED OR EXPENSE FOR

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY TAKEN A DEDUCTION ON THE TAX

RETURN, BUT HAS NOT YET RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE AJCA CREATED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE

FOR U.S. MULTINATIONALS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME

EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2002. IN CONNECTION WITH THE AJCA, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED

$15.9 BILLION DURING 2005 (SEE NOTE 15 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AS A RESULT OF

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIS REPATRIATION, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCOME TAX CHARGE OF

$766.5 MILLION IN TAXES ON INCOME IN 2005 RELATED TO THIS

REPATRIATION. THIS CHARGE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

$100 MILLION BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH A DECISION TO

IMPLEMENT CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

CHANGED ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ACCUMULATED

EARNINGS EARNED SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2002. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, FOREIGN EARNINGS OF $17.2 BILLION

HAVE BEEN RETAINED INDEFINITELY BY SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES FOR

REINVESTMENT. NO PROVISION WILL BE MADE FOR INCOME TAXES THAT

WOULD BE PAYABLE UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH EARNINGS AND IT

IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE RELATED

UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITY.

RECENTLY

ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157), WHICH

CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK

FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS. FAS 157 WAS ORIGINALLY EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2008. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED STAFF

POSITION (FSP)

157-2

THAT

DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FAS 157 FOR ONE YEAR FOR

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

NON-RECURRING BASIS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 157 AND

FSP 157-2

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT

NO. FAS 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  INCLUDING AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115

(FAS 159)

,

WHICH IS EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2008. FAS 159 PERMITS COMPANIES TO CHOOSE

TO MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT

FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR WHICH THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED ARE REPORTED IN EARNINGS AT

EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING DATE. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF

FAS 159 ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED THE CONSENSUS REACHED BY THE

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ON ISSUE

NO. 07-3,

ACCOUNTING FOR ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES

RECEIVED FOR USE IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

(ISSUE

07-3),

WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008 AND IS APPLIED

PROSPECTIVELY FOR NEW CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO ON OR AFTER THE

EFFECTIVE DATE. ISSUE

07-3

ADDRESSES NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES

THAT WILL BE USED OR RENDERED FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ISSUE

07-3

WILL

REQUIRE THESE PAYMENTS BE DEFERRED AND CAPITALIZED AND

RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE AS THE RELATED GOODS ARE DELIVERED OR

THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF

ISSUE

07-3

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENTS NO. 141R,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(FAS 141R), AND

NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ARB

NO. 51

(FAS 160). FAS 141R

EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS

UNDER WHICH CONTROL OF A BUSINESS IS OBTAINED. AMONG OTHER

THINGS, FAS 141R REQUIRES THAT CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AS

WELL AS CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, THAT ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT BE CAPITALIZED AND RECORDED AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND ALSO REQUIRES TRANSACTION COSTS AND

COSTS TO RESTRUCTURE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY BE EXPENSED.

FAS 160 REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS BE RECORDED AS EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. FAS 141R AND FAS 160 ARE BOTH EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF

THESE STANDARDS ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

NATURE OF

OPERATIONS

MERCK IS A GLOBAL RESEARCH-DRIVEN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT

DISCOVERS, DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY MANAGED ON A PRODUCTS

BASIS AND ARE COMPRISED OF TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND THE VACCINES SEGMENT. THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT INCLUDES HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.

THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC AND PREVENTIVE AGENTS,

SOLD BY PRESCRIPTION, FOR THE TREATMENT OF HUMAN DISORDERS.

MERCK SELLS THESE HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY

TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT

PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

2.

SUMMARY

OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ALL

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS

MAINTAINED. CONTROLLING INTEREST IS DETERMINED BY MAJORITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST AND THE ABSENCE OF SUBSTANTIVE THIRD-PARTY

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS OR, IN THE CASE OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES, BY MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO EXPECTED LOSSES, RESIDUAL

RETURNS OR BOTH. FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE MERCK

OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100%, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS

INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN

AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT

NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST, SUCH AS INTERESTS IN ENTITIES OWNED

EQUALLY BY THE COMPANY AND A THIRD PARTY THAT ARE UNDER SHARED

CONTROL, ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

THE

U.S. DOLLAR IS THE COMPANYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

CASH EQUIVALENTS 

CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE

COMPRISED OF CERTAIN HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

INVENTORIES 

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DOMESTIC

INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF

LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) COST OR MARKET FOR BOTH BOOK AND

TAX PURPOSES. FOREIGN INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES CONSIST

OF CURRENTLY MARKETED PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN PRODUCTS AWAITING

REGULATORY APPROVAL. IN EVALUATING THE RECOVERABILITY OF

INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABILITY THAT REVENUE WILL BE OBTAINED

FROM THE FUTURE SALE OF THE RELATED INVENTORY TOGETHER WITH THE

STATUS OF THE PRODUCT WITHIN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS.

INVESTMENTS 

INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, TO

THE EXTENT NOT HEDGED, REPORTED NET OF TAX IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI). INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY,

CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS INTENT, ARE REPORTED AT COST.

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE CHARGED TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET,

FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE

IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF ITS INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING

THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST

AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

REVENUES FROM SALES OF

PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS PASSES TO

THE CUSTOMER. DUE TO CHANGES IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR

DOMESTIC PHARMACEUTICAL SALES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007,

REVENUES FOR THESE PRODUCTS, PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME

OF SHIPMENT, WERE RECOGNIZED AT TIME OF DELIVERY, CONSISTENT

WITH MANY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND VACCINE SALES. THERE WAS NO

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REVENUE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007 AS A

RESULT OF THESE CHANGES. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ALSO REQUIRES

REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COLLECTION OF SALES PROCEEDS AND

COMPLETION OF ALL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. DOMESTICALLY, SALES

DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO CUSTOMERS AS DIRECT DISCOUNTS AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE

OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALE PURCHASER, KNOWN

AS CHARGEBACKS, OR INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF REBATES.

ADDITIONALLY, SALES ARE GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF

RETURN UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF

PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, WHICH ARE

ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF SALE. ACCRUALS FOR CHARGEBACKS ARE

REFLECTED AS A DIRECT REDUCTION TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND

ACCRUALS FOR REBATES ARE RECORDED AS ACCRUED EXPENSES. THE

ACCRUED BALANCES RELATIVE TO THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

WERE $82.5 MILLION AND $616.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND $60.4 MILLION AND

$696.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF VACCINES TO THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PLACEMENT INTO STOCKPILES RELATED TO THE

PEDIATRIC VACCINE STOCKPILE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) INTERPRETATION

,

COMMISSION GUIDANCE REGARDING ACCOUNTING FOR SALES OF VACCINES

AND BIOTERROR COUNTERMEASURES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR

PLACEMENT INTO THE PEDIATRIC VACCINE STOCKPILE OR THE STRATEGIC

NATIONAL STOCKPILE.

DEPRECIATION 

DEPRECIATION IS PROVIDED OVER

THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. FOR TAX PURPOSES, ACCELERATED METHODS ARE

USED. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO

50 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, AND FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS FOR

MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND OFFICE FURNISHINGS.

SOFTWARE CAPITALIZATION 

THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING

OR DEVELOPING INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIRECT

COSTS OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES, AND PAYROLL COSTS FOR EMPLOYEES

DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN ACCORDANCE

WITH STATEMENT OF POSITION

98-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR

OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE

. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ARE

INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND AMORTIZED OVER A

PERIOD RANGING FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS, BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSET

IS SUBSTANTIALLY READY FOR USE. COSTS INCURRED DURING THE

PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE AND POST-IMPLEMENTATION STAGE, AS WELL

AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING COSTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY

$200 MILLION OF UNAMORTIZED CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

RELATED TO A MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO STANDARDIZE ITS

INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

ACQUISITIONS 

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) STATEMENT NO. 141,

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

LIABILITIES ASSUMED BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AT

THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE

OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS

RECORDED AS GOODWILL. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ACQUIRED

COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WHICH HAS NOT COMMENCED

ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE ACQUISITION WILL BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WOULD NOT BE

RECORDED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 4,

APPLICABILITY OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 2 TO BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PURCHASE METHOD

, THE

COMPANY ALLOCATES AMOUNTS TO ACQUIRED RESEARCH WHICH ARE

EXPENSED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION IF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY

HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTS.

FOR PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH

PROCESS THAT HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES, THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND AMORTIZES THEM OVER AN

APPROPRIATE USEFUL LIFE. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS OF THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES 

GOODWILL

REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF ACQUISITION COSTS OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED. GOODWILL IS ASSIGNED TO

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE COMPANYS SEGMENTS AND EVALUATED

FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, USING A FAIR VALUE

BASED TEST. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES ARE RECORDED AT COST AND

ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS (SEE NOTE 7).

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVIEW, THE COMPANY WILL

ASSESS RECOVERABILITY FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS OF OTHER

INTANGIBLES USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM THE

LOWEST APPROPRIATE ASSET GROUPINGS, GENERALLY THE SUBSIDIARY

LEVEL. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING RESULTS TO THE

EXTENT THAT CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS

DETERMINED BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT IS EXPENSED AS INCURRED. UPFRONT AND MILESTONE

PAYMENTS MADE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS PRIOR TO REGULATORY

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPROVAL ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PAYMENTS MADE TO THIRD

PARTIES SUBSEQUENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE CAPITALIZED AND

AMORTIZED OVER THE SHORTER OF THE REMAINING LICENSE OR PRODUCT

PATENT LIFE.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STATEMENT

NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R) (SEE NOTE 12).

FAS 123R REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES,

INCLUDING GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, TO BE EXPENSED OVER THE

REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF

THE AWARDS AND REQUIRES THAT THE UNVESTED PORTION OF ALL

OUTSTANDING AWARDS UPON ADOPTION BE RECOGNIZED USING THE SAME

FAIR VALUE AND ATTRIBUTION METHODOLOGIES PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED

UNDER FASB STATEMENT NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

. THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION

METHOD. PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION WAS RECOGNIZED USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD,

WHICH MEASURES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS THE AMOUNT AT

WHICH THE MARKET PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT EXCEEDS

THE EXERCISE PRICE. ACCORDINGLY, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS

RECOGNIZED FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

OTHER THAN FOR ITS PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS, RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS AND OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN EQUITY METHOD

INVESTEES.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS 

THE COMPANY RECORDS

INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR

CONTINGENCIES.

TAXES ON INCOME 

DEFERRED TAXES ARE RECOGNIZED

FOR THE FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND

RATES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES TAX POSITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

THE BENEFITS OF TAX POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX

POSITION. FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF

BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE LARGEST

AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING

REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PORTION

OF THE BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

USE OF ESTIMATES 

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP) AND,

ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE

USED IN DETERMINING SUCH ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS

AND RETURNS, DEPRECIABLE AND AMORTIZABLE LIVES, RECOVERABILITY

OF INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES,

AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR CONTINGENCIES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

AND OTHER RESERVES, PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN

CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS, IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AND INVESTMENTS, AND TAXES ON INCOME. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY

INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAS 157 CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES

A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE

DISCLOSURES ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. FAS 157 WAS

ORIGINALLY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE

FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITION (FSP)

157-2,

THAT

DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FAS 157 FOR ONE YEAR FOR

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

NON-RECURRING BASIS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 157 AND

FSP 157-2

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

FAS 159, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, PERMITS

COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED ARE

REPORTED IN EARNINGS AT EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING DATE. THE

EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 159 ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO

BE MATERIAL.

EITF ISSUE

WHICH

IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008 AND IS APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY

FOR NEW CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE,

ADDRESSES NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ISSUE

WILL

REQUIRE THESE PAYMENTS BE DEFERRED AND CAPITALIZED AND

RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE AS THE RELATED GOODS ARE DELIVERED OR

THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF

ISSUE

07-3

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

FAS 141R EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING TO ALL

TRANSACTIONS UNDER WHICH CONTROL OF A BUSINESS IS OBTAINED.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, FAS 141R REQUIRES THAT CONTINGENT

CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, THAT ACQUIRED

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BE CAPITALIZED AND RECORDED

AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND ALSO REQUIRES

TRANSACTION COSTS AND COSTS TO RESTRUCTURE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY

BE EXPENSED. FAS 160 REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS BE RECORDED AS EQUITY IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAS 141R AND

FAS 160 ARE BOTH EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009. THE

COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF THESE STANDARDS ON ITS

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RESTRUCTURING

GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE INITIAL PHASE OF A

GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. THE INITIAL STEPS INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH

IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND

CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, MERCK ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SELL OR CLOSE

FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES BY THE END OF

2008. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO SOLD OR CLOSED CERTAIN OTHER

FACILITIES AND SOLD RELATED ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THE PRETAX COSTS OF THIS RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM WERE $810.1 MILLION IN 2007, $935.5 MILLION IN

2006, $401.2 MILLION IN 2005 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION TO $300 MILLION IN 2008.

THROUGH THE END OF 2008, WHEN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE,

THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION TO $2.4 BILLION.

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH,

RELATING PRIMARILY TO ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION FOR THOSE

FACILITIES SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE

GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE

COMPANY HAS RECORDED TOTAL PRETAX ACCUMULATED COSTS OF

$2.1 BILLION AND ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 7,200 POSITIONS,

COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS AND THE ELIMINATION OF

CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS. THE COMPANY, HOWEVER,

CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES AS THE BUSINESS REQUIRES. FOR

SEGMENT REPORTING, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES ARE UNALLOCATED

EXPENSES.

SEPARATION COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS, AS WELL AS THOSE HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS WHICH WERE

PROBABLE AND COULD BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. APPROXIMATELY 2,400

POSITIONS, 3,700 POSITIONS AND 1,100 POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED

IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THESE POSITION

ELIMINATIONS ARE COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AND

THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS.

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE FIVE

MERCK-OWNED MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND THE TWO PRECLINICAL

SITES TO BE SOLD OR CLOSED IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE COSTS AND

CONSOLIDATE THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH

FACILITIES. THROUGH THE END OF 2007, FOUR OF THE MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES HAD BEEN CLOSED, SOLD OR HAD CEASED OPERATIONS AND

THE TWO PRECLINICAL SITES WERE CLOSED. THE REMAINING FACILITY

WAS SOLD IN JANUARY 2008. ALL OF THE SITES CONTINUED TO OPERATE

UP THROUGH THE RESPECTIVE CLOSURE DATES, AND SINCE FUTURE CASH

FLOWS WERE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE RESPECTIVE BOOK VALUES,

MERCK WAS REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION OF THE SITE ASSETS

RATHER THAN WRITE THEM OFF IMMEDIATELY. THE SITE ASSETS INCLUDE

MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.

OTHER ACTIVITY IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005 INCLUDES

$39.4 MILLION, $25.0 MILLION AND $111.2 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN FIXED

ASSETS THAT WERE NO LONGER TO BE USED IN THE BUSINESS AS A

RESULT OF THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND WERE THEREFORE WRITTEN

OFF. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER ACTIVITY INCLUDES $18.9 MILLION,

$34.2 MILLION AND $23.0 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO CURTAILMENT, SETTLEMENT AND

TERMINATION CHARGES ON THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (SEE NOTE 13). OTHER ACTIVITY

ALSO INCLUDES SHUT-DOWN COSTS, AND IN 2006, PRETAX GAINS OF

$40.7 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SALES OF FACILITIES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

OTHER

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS

AS PART OF A COST-REDUCTION PROGRAM COMPLETED IN 2005, THE

COMPANY ELIMINATED 900 POSITIONS AND RECORDED RESTRUCTURING

COSTS OF $116.8 MILLION IN 2005, OF WHICH

$91.5 MILLION RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE BENEFITS AND

$25.3 MILLION RELATED TO CURTAILMENT, SETTLEMENT AND

TERMINATION CHARGES ON THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (SEE NOTE 13).

THE COMPANY INCURRED ADDITIONAL ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS

OF $103.1 MILLION RECORDED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE DURING 2005, WHICH REDUCED THE ASSETS OF THIS RESEARCH

CENTER DOWN TO THEIR NET REALIZABLE VALUES. SUBSEQUENT TO

DECEMBER 31, 2005, NO FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WAS

PERFORMED AT THIS SITE.

RESEARCH

COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS

MERCK CONTINUES ITS STRATEGY OF ESTABLISHING STRONG EXTERNAL

ALLIANCES TO COMPLEMENT ITS SUBSTANTIAL INTERNAL RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS,

LICENSING PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS AND TECHNOLOGY

TRANSFERS TO DRIVE BOTH NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. DURING 2007,

MERCK SIGNED 55 SUCH AGREEMENTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2007, MERCK AND GTX, INC. (GTX)

ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR

A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL STRATEGIC COLLABORATION

FOR SELECTIVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS (SARMS),

A NEW CLASS OF DRUGS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT AGE-RELATED

MUSCLE LOSS (SARCOPENIA) AS WELL AS OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL

CONDITIONS. THIS COLLABORATION INCLUDES GTXS LEAD SARM

CANDIDATE, OSTARINE

(MK-2866),

WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN A PHASE II CLINICAL

TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF MUSCLE LOSS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER,

AND ESTABLISHES A BROAD SARM COLLABORATION UNDER WHICH GTX AND

MERCK WILL POOL THEIR PROGRAMS AND PARTNER TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP,

AND COMMERCIALIZE CURRENT AS WELL AS FUTURE SARM MOLECULES. AS

PART OF THIS GLOBAL AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL

FUTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND, IF

APPROVED, COMMERCIALIZATION OF OSTARINE AND OTHER

INVESTIGATIONAL SARMS RESULTING FROM THE COLLABORATION. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENT AND RELATED STOCK

PURCHASE AGREEMENT, GTX AND MERCK WILL COMBINE THEIR RESPECTIVE

SARM RESEARCH PROGRAMS. GTX RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF

$40 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED BY MERCK AS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND WILL ALSO RECEIVE $15 MILLION IN

RESEARCH REIMBURSEMENTS TO BE PAID OVER THE INITIAL THREE YEARS

OF THE COLLABORATION. IN ADDITION, MERCK MADE AN INVESTMENT OF

$30 MILLION IN GTX COMMON STOCK. GTX WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE

TO RECEIVE UP TO $422 MILLION IN FUTURE MILESTONE PAYMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF A DRUG CANDIDATE

IF MULTIPLE INDICATIONS RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. ADDITIONAL

MILESTONES MAY BE RECEIVED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF

OTHER COLLABORATION DRUG CANDIDATES. GTX WILL RECEIVE ROYALTIES

ON ANY RESULTING WORLDWIDE PRODUCT REVENUE.

ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2007, MERCK AND DYNAVAX TECHNOLOGIES

CORPORATION (DYNAVAX) ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL LICENSE AND

DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENT TO JOINTLY DEVELOP V270, A

NOVEL INVESTIGATIONAL HEPATITIS B

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VACCINE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN A MULTI-CENTER

PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL INVOLVING ADULTS AND IN PATIENTS

ON DIALYSIS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MERCK RECEIVES

WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO V270, WILL FUND FUTURE VACCINE

DEVELOPMENT, AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. DYNAVAX

RECEIVED AN INITIAL PAYMENT OF $31.5 MILLION, WHICH THE

COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND WILL

BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE UP TO $105 MILLION IN DEVELOPMENT

AND SALES MILESTONE PAYMENTS, AND DOUBLE-DIGIT TIERED ROYALTIES

ON GLOBAL SALES OF V270.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

NOVACARDIA, INC. (NOVACARDIA), A PRIVATELY HELD

CLINICAL-STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE. THIS ACQUISITION ADDED ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418),

NOVACARDIAS INVESTIGATIONAL PHASE III COMPOUND FOR

ACUTE HEART FAILURE, TO MERCKS PIPELINE. MERCK ACQUIRED

ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF NOVACARDIA FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE

PRICE OF $366.4 MILLION (INCLUDING $16.4 MILLION OF

CASH AND INVESTMENTS ON HAND AT CLOSING), WHICH WAS PAID THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF 7.3 MILLION SHARES OF MERCK COMMON STOCK TO

THE FORMER NOVACARDIA SHAREHOLDERS BASED ON MERCKS AVERAGE

CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO CLOSING OF THE

ACQUISITION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $325.1 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH

ASSOCIATED WITH ROLOFYLLINE AS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE,

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE CHARGE, WHICH IS NOT

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, WAS RECORDED IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE PRESENT

VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM THIS

TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF ITS TECHNICAL AND

MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING AN INCOME APPROACH REFLECTING AN

APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 22.0%. THE ONGOING

ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ROLOFYLLINE

IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THE REMAINING PURCHASE PRICE WAS

ALLOCATED TO CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF $16.4 MILLION, A

DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATING TO A NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD

OF $23.9 MILLION AND OTHER NET ASSETS OF $1.0 MILLION.

BECAUSE NOVACARDIA WAS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT

COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED.

NOVACARDIAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

IN JULY 2007, MERCK AND ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

(ARIAD) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO A

GLOBAL COLLABORATION TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

DEFOROLIMUS (MK-8669), ARIADS NOVEL MTOR INHIBITOR, FOR

USE IN CANCER. EACH PARTY WILL FUND 50% OF THE COST OF

GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OF MK-8669, EXCEPT THAT MERCK WILL

FUND 100% OF THE COST OF EX-U.S. DEVELOPMENT THAT IS

SPECIFIC TO THE DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIALIZATION OF MK-8669

OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY PART OF THE GLOBAL

DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL PAYMENT

OF $75 MILLION TO ARIAD, WHICH THE COMPANY RECORDED AS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, UP TO $452 MILLION MORE

IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO ARIAD BASED ON THE SUCCESSFUL

DEVELOPMENT OF MK-8669 IN MULTIPLE CANCER INDICATIONS (INCLUDING

$13.5 MILLION PAID FOR THE INITIATION OF THE PHASE III

CLINICAL TRIAL IN METASTATIC SARCOMAS AND $114.5 MILLION TO

BE PAID FOR THE INITIATION OF OTHER PHASE II AND

PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS), UP TO AN ADDITIONAL

$200 MILLION BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT SALES

THRESHOLDS, AT LEAST $200 MILLION IN ESTIMATED

CONTRIBUTIONS BY MERCK TO GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT, UP TO

$200 MILLION IN INTEREST-BEARING REPAYABLE DEVELOPMENT-COST

ADVANCES FROM MERCK TO COVER A PORTION OF ARIADS SHARE OF

GLOBAL-DEVELOPMENT COSTS (AFTER ARIAD HAS PAID $150 MILLION

IN GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS), AND POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL RETURNS

FROM PROFIT SHARING IN THE U.S. OR ROYALTIES PAID BY MERCK

OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN THE U.S., ARIAD WILL DISTRIBUTE AND

SELL MK-8669 FOR ALL CANCER INDICATIONS, AND ARIAD AND MERCK

WILL CO-PROMOTE AND WILL EACH RECEIVE 50% OF THE INCOME FROM

SUCH SALES. OUTSIDE THE U.S., MERCK WILL DISTRIBUTE, SELL AND

PROMOTE MK-8669; MERCK WILL PAY ARIAD TIERED DOUBLE-DIGIT

ROYALTIES ON END-MARKET SALES OF MK-8669.

ON DECEMBER 29, 2006, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

SIRNA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (SIRNA) FOR $13 PER SHARE

IN CASH, FOR A TOTAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION,

WHICH INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF ALL OUTSTANDING SIRNA SHARES,

WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS. THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF

$1.1 BILLION WAS PAID ON JANUARY 3, 2007, AND

ACCORDINGLY, IS REFLECTED AS A LIABILITY WITHIN ACCRUED AND

OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. SIRNA WAS A

PUBLICLY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS A LEADER IN

DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES BASED ON RNA INTERFERENCE

(RNAI) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER

THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE. RNAI-BASED THERAPEUTICS SELECTIVELY

CATALYZE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RNA TRANSCRIBED FROM AN

INDIVIDUAL GENE. THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE MERCKS ABILITY TO USE RNAI TECHNOLOGY TO TURN OFF

A TARGETED GENE IN A HUMAN CELL, POTENTIALLY RENDERING

INOPERATIVE A GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIGGERING A SPECIFIC

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISEASE. THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

,

IN WHICH THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM SIRNA AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION

WERE RECORDED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES AS OF THE

ACQUISITION DATE IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE EXCESS OF THE

PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED NET ASSETS

WAS RECORDED AS GOODWILL OF $369.2 MILLION. THE GOODWILL

WAS FULLY ALLOCATED TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND IS NOT

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. ALSO, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE

OF $466.2 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH

SIRNAS COMPOUNDS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, FOR WHICH,

AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN

ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE ACQUIRED

RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS FOR

BOTH THE HEPATITIS B AND HEPATITIS C VIRUSES, WHICH WERE

AND CURRENTLY REMAIN IN PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS

LICENSING AGREEMENTS HELD BY SIRNA. THE CHARGE, WHICH IS NOT

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, WAS RECORDED IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE PRESENT

VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES

RESULTING FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF

ITS TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING AN INCOME APPROACH

REFLECTING APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES OF 27.0% TO

30.0%. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE

COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THE

ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALSO RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET OF $357.8 MILLION AND A

RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $146.3 MILLION, AS WELL

AS OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  NET OF

$89.3 MILLION. THE INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATES TO SIRNAS

DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND HAS ALTERNATIVE FUTURE

USES. THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A SEVEN YEAR

USEFUL LIFE. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRED

BECAUSE SIRNAS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE NOT

SIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS. THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON DECEMBER 29, 2006, AND

ACCORDINGLY, SIRNAS OPERATING RESULTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2007.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF ITS EXISTING

STRATEGIC COLLABORATION WITH FOXHOLLOW TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

(FOXHOLLOW) FOR ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE ANALYSIS AND

ACQUIRED A STAKE IN FOXHOLLOW. THE EXISTING STRATEGIC

COLLABORATION, ENTERED INTO IN 2005, PROVIDED FOR FOXHOLLOW TO

RECEIVE AN UPFRONT PAYMENT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDITIONAL

PAYMENTS IF THE COLLABORATION CONTINUED. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

EXPANDED COLLABORATION AGREEMENT, PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO FOXHOLLOW

OVER FOUR YEARS IN EXCHANGE FOR FOXHOLLOWS AGREEMENT TO

COLLABORATE EXCLUSIVELY WITH MERCK IN SPECIFIED DISEASE AREAS.

MERCK IS ALSO PROVIDING FUNDING TO FOXHOLLOW OVER THE FIRST

THREE YEARS OF THE FOUR YEAR COLLABORATION PROGRAM TERM, FOR

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TO BE CONDUCTED BY FOXHOLLOW UNDER

MERCKS DIRECTION. FOXHOLLOW WILL RECEIVE MILESTONE

PAYMENTS ON SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG PRODUCTS OR

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS UTILIZING RESULTS FROM THE COLLABORATION, AS

WELL AS ROYALTIES. IN OCTOBER 2007, EV3 INC. (EV3),

A GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY FOCUSED ON CATHETER-BASED

TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT OF VASCULAR DISEASES

AND DISORDERS, MERGED WITH FOXHOLLOW, AT WHICH TIME FOXHOLLOW

BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EV3. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

MERGER, THE COMPANYS SHARES OF FOXHOLLOW WERE CONVERTED

INTO SHARES OF EV3 COMMON STOCK. THE INVESTMENT IN EV3 IS

RECORDED AS A COST METHOD INVESTMENT IN THE DECEMBER 31,

2007 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY

OF GLYCOFI, INC. (GLYCOFI) FOR APPROXIMATELY

$373 MILLION IN CASH ($400 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE NET

OF $25 MILLION IN SHARES ALREADY OWNED AND NET TRANSACTION

COSTS). GLYCOFI WAS A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT

IS A LEADER IN THE FIELD OF YEAST GLYCOENGINEERING, WHICH IS THE

ADDITION OF SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROTEINS

IN YEAST, AND OPTIMIZATION OF BIOLOGIC DRUG MOLECULES.

GLYCOFIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

GLYCOPROTEIN, AS WELL AS THE OPTIMIZATION OF A GLYCOPROTEIN

TARGET. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED

A CHARGE OF $296.3 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED

WITH GLYCOFIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO BE USED IN THE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, FOR WHICH, AT THE ACQUISITION

DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THIS CHARGE IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE

FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE TECHNOLOGY IS CURRENTLY BEING UTILIZED IN

MERCKS PIPELINE OF BIOLOGICS. THE CHARGE WAS RECORDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON

THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF NEW PRODUCT

CANDIDATES RESULTING FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR THE

PROBABILITY OF ITS TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING AN

INCOME APPROACH REFLECTING THE APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED

DISCOUNT RATE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A $99.4 MILLION

INTANGIBLE ASSET ($57.6 MILLION NET OF DEFERRED TAXES)

RELATED TO GLYCOFIS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE USED

IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND HAS

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES. THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER A FIVE YEAR USEFUL LIFE. THE REMAINING NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED IN THIS TRANSACTION WERE NOT MATERIAL. BECAUSE GLYCOFI

WAS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS

PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR

AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS

COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED.

GLYCOFIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE EQUITY OF ABMAXIS,

INC. (ABMAXIS) FOR APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION IN

CASH. ABMAXIS WAS A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

DEDICATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND OPTIMIZATION OF MONOCLONAL

ANTIBODY (MAB) PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN THERAPEUTICS AND

DIAGNOSTICS. ABMAXIS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A BREAKTHROUGH

ANTIBODY ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, ABMAXIS

IN-SILICO

IMMUNIZATION, WHICH HAS ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES TO THE

COMPANY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL OR ENGINEERING RISKS

AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION,

THE COMPANY ALLOCATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO

ABMAXIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND RECORDED AN INTANGIBLE

ASSET OF $135.3 MILLION ($78.5 MILLION NET OF DEFERRED

TAXES). THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A FIVE YEAR

USEFUL LIFE. THE REMAINING NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THIS

TRANSACTION WERE NOT MATERIAL. BECAUSE ABMAXIS WAS A DEVELOPMENT

STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL

OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION

OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE,

GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED. ABMAXIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE.

ALSO IN 2006, MERCK AND IDERA PHARMACEUTICALS

(IDERA) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD FORMED A BROAD

COLLABORATION TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

IDERAS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR AGONISTS FOR USE IN COMBINATION

WITH MERCKS THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC VACCINES UNDER

DEVELOPMENT FOR ONCOLOGY, INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND

ALZHEIMERS DISEASE. ADDITIONALLY IN 2006, MERCK AND

AMBRILIA BIOPHARMA INC. (AMBRILIA), A

BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE THERAPEUTICS IN

THE FIELDS OF CANCER AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, ANNOUNCED THEY

ENTERED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSING AGREEMENT GRANTING MERCK THE

WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO AMBRILIAS HIV/AIDS PROTEASE INHIBITOR

PROGRAM. ALSO IN 2006, NEUROMED PHARMACEUTICALS LTD. AND MERCK

SIGNED A RESEARCH COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT TO

RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE NOVEL COMPOUNDS FOR THE

TREATMENT OF PAIN AND OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.

IN 2005, AGENSYS, INC. (AGENSYS), A CANCER

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY, AND MERCK ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A

GLOBAL ALLIANCE TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE AGS-PSCA,

AGENSYS FULLY HUMAN MAB TO PROSTATE STEM CELL ANTIGEN.

ALSO IN 2005, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH GERON

CORPORATION TO DEVELOP A CANCER VACCINE AGAINST TELOMERASE, AN

ENZYME, ACTIVE IN MOST CANCER CELLS THAT MAINTAINS TELOMERE

LENGTH AT THE ENDS OF CHROMOSOMES, WHICH ALLOWS THE CANCER TO

GROW AND METASTASIZE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

WHILE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. MERCK RELIES ON SUSTAINED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM

FOREIGN SOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THE EXTENT

THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CASH FLOWS IS DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF A

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND

RESEARCH AND OTHER DOLLAR-BASED STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AT A

CONSISTENT LEVEL MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO

PROTECT AGAINST VOLATILITY OF FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS

AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR LONGER-TERM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TO DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, PRIMARILY

THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE

COMPANY WILL PARTIALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED THIRD-PARTY SALES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER ITS PLANNING CYCLE, TYPICALLY NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL LAYER IN

HEDGES OVER TIME, INCREASING THE PORTION OF SALES HEDGED AS IT

GETS CLOSER TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUCH THAT

IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. THE

PORTION OF SALES HEDGED IS BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF COST-BENEFIT

PROFILES THAT CONSIDER NATURAL OFFSETTING EXPOSURES, REVENUE AND

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, AND THE COST OF

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES ARE A

SPECIFIED COMPONENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF SIMILARLY DENOMINATED

FOREIGN CURRENCY-BASED SALES TRANSACTIONS, EACH OF WHICH

RESPONDS TO THE HEDGED RISK IN THE SAME MANNER. MERCK MANAGES

ITS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH PURCHASED

LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS, WHICH PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A

RIGHT, BUT NOT AN OBLIGATION, TO SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE

FUTURE AT A PREDETERMINED PRICE. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED

SALES, TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS FULLY

OFFSET THE DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH

FLOWS OF THE HEDGED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE

U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS, THE OPTIONS VALUE REDUCES TO

ZERO, BUT THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF

THE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.

THE DESIGNATED HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON TOTAL CHANGES IN

THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ENTIRE FAIR VALUE

CHANGE IN THE OPTIONS IS DEFERRED IN AOCI AND RECLASSIFIED INTO

SALES WHEN THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE

HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS

IS

DE MINIMIS

. THE FAIR VALUES OF PURCHASED CURRENCY

OPTIONS ARE REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OR OTHER ASSETS. THE

CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS FROM THE EFFECTS OF

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEIR

CONVERSION TO U.S. DOLLARS. MERCK PRINCIPALLY UTILIZES

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO BUY AND

SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

AND ECONOMICALLY OFFSET THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS DERIVED

FROM THE NET ASSETS. MERCK ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS TO

FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES DENOMINATED IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRY CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE

YEN. FOR EXPOSURES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CURRENCIES, THE COMPANY

WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ON A MORE LIMITED BASIS, AND

ONLY WHEN IT IS DEEMED ECONOMICAL TO DO SO BASED ON A

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

EXPOSURE, THE VOLATILITY OF THE EXCHANGE RATE AND THE COST OF

THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MINIMIZE THE

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE ON MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY

MANAGING OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND NET ASSET POSITIONS AT THE

LOCAL LEVEL.

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

REMEASURED AT SPOT RATES IN EFFECT ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

WITH THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SPOT RATES REPORTED IN OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. THE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED

AS HEDGES AND ARE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH OTHER (INCOME)

EXPENSE, NET. ACCORDINGLY, FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

CONTRACTS HELP MITIGATE THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE

REMEASURED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE

SPOT-FORWARD DIFFERENCES. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT

DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS, WHICH TYPICALLY

HAVE AVERAGE MATURITIES AT INCEPTION OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR.

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

SECURITIES DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN SPOT RATES ARE OFFSET IN OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, BY THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

CONTRACTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPOT RATE FLUCTUATIONS. HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL DURING 2007, 2006 OR 2005.

CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTS FAIR VALUE DUE TO SPOT-FORWARD

DIFFERENCES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DESIGNATED HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

AND RECOGNIZED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. THESE AMOUNTS

WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007,

2006 OR 2005.

THE FAIR VALUES OF FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED IN

THE FOLLOWING FOUR BALANCE SHEET LINE ITEMS: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

(CURRENT PORTION OF GAIN POSITION), OTHER ASSETS (NON-CURRENT

PORTION OF GAIN POSITION), ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

(CURRENT PORTION OF LOSS POSITION), OR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND

NONCURRENT LIABILITIES (NON-CURRENT PORTION OF LOSS POSITION).

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ON CERTAIN

INVESTING AND BORROWING TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE ITS NET EXPOSURE

TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND TO REDUCE ITS OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE LEVERAGED SWAPS AND, IN

GENERAL, DOES NOT LEVERAGE ANY OF ITS INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT

WOULD PUT PRINCIPAL CAPITAL AT RISK.

96

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY TO SEVEN

PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE

NOTES. THERE ARE TWO SWAPS MATURING IN 2011 WITH NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF $125 MILLION EACH; ONE SWAP MATURING IN 2013

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION AND FOUR SWAPS

MATURING IN 2015 WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $250 MILLION

EACH. THE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS

TO FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE

NOTES ARE FULLY OFFSET IN INTEREST EXPENSE BY THE FAIR VALUE

CHANGES IN THE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE

CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OTHER ASSETS,

ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, OR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

AND NONCURRENT LIABILITIES. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS

ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

PHARMACEUTICALS COMPANY.

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) (COLLECTIVELY THE

PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE

EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE

99

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. THESE

AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR EQUAL SHARING OF DEVELOPMENT

COSTS AND FOR CO-PROMOTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS BY EACH COMPANY.

IN 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WERE

EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING

JAPAN. IN 2002, EZETIMIBE, THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES

AS

ZETIA

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES). IN 2004, A COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

, WAS APPROVED

IN THE UNITED STATES AS

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES).

THE CHOLESTEROL AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE SHARING OF OPERATING

INCOME GENERATED BY THE

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

CHOLESTEROL PARTNERSHIP (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP) BASED

UPON PERCENTAGES THAT VARY BY PRODUCT, SALES LEVEL AND COUNTRY.

IN THE U.S. MARKET, THE PARTNERS SHARE PROFITS ON

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

SALES EQUALLY, WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST $300 MILLION OF ANNUAL

ZETIA

SALES ON WHICH SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVES A GREATER SHARE OF

PROFITS. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES EXPENSES THAT THE PARTNERS

HAVE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO SHARE, SUCH AS A PORTION OF

MANUFACTURING COSTS, SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED PROMOTION COSTS

(INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

ADVERTISING AND DIRECT AND IDENTIFIABLE

OUT-OF-POCKET

PROMOTION) AND OTHER AGREED UPON COSTS FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES

SUCH AS ON-GOING CLINICAL RESEARCH, MARKET SUPPORT, MARKET

RESEARCH, MARKET EXPANSION, AS WELL AS A SPECIALTY SALES FORCE

AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUPPORT

OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP BUT NOT SHARED BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, SUCH

AS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (INCLUDING CERTAIN

SALES FORCE COSTS), AS WELL AS CERTAIN MANUFACTURING COSTS, ARE

NOT INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES. HOWEVER, THESE

COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY SHARED

EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR EARNED MILESTONES.

SEE NOTE 10 FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION

INVOLVING THE MSP PARTNERSHIP AND THE PARTNERS RELATED TO THE

SALE AND PROMOTION OF

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN.

THE RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE JOINT

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE

PARTNERS OF A ONCE-DAILY, FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING

THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE.

MONTELUKAST SODIUM, A LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IS SOLD

BY MERCK AS

SINGULAIR

AND LORATADINE, AN ANTIHISTAMINE,

IS SOLD BY SCHERING-PLOUGH AS CLARITIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

INDICATED FOR THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS. IN

AUGUST 2007, THE PARTNERS ANNOUNCED THAT THE NEW DRUG

APPLICATION FILING FOR MONTELUKAST SODIUM/LORATADINE HAD BEEN

ACCEPTED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

(FDA) FOR STANDARD REVIEW. THE PARTNERS ARE SEEKING

U.S. MARKETING APPROVAL OF THE MEDICINE FOR TREATMENT OF

ALLERGIC RHINITIS SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WHO WANT RELIEF FROM

NASAL CONGESTION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASTRAZENECA

LP

IN 1982, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRAS PRODUCTS

UNDER A ROYALTY-BEARING LICENSE. IN 1993, THE COMPANYS

TOTAL SALES OF ASTRA PRODUCTS REACHED A LEVEL THAT TRIGGERED THE

FIRST STEP IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT VENTURE BUSINESS

CARRIED ON BY ASTRA MERCK INC. (AMI), IN WHICH MERCK

AND ASTRA EACH OWNED A 50% SHARE. THIS JOINT VENTURE, FORMED IN

1994, DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW

PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING

PRILOSEC,

THE FIRST OF A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM

THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, MERCK AND ASTRA COMPLETED THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE

OWNERSHIP AND OPERATIONS OF THE JOINT VENTURE WHEREBY THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN AMI, RENAMED KBI INC.

(KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED KBIS OPERATING ASSETS

TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS

L.P. (THE PARTNERSHIP), IN EXCHANGE FOR A 1% LIMITED

PARTNER INTEREST. ASTRA CONTRIBUTED THE NET ASSETS OF ITS WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ASTRA USA, INC., TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN

EXCHANGE FOR A 99% GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP,

RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP) UPON ASTRAS 1999

MERGER WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC (THE ASTRAZENECA

MERGER), BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS

FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS.

WHILE MAINTAINING A 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN AZLP, MERCK

HAS CONSENT AND PROTECTIVE RIGHTS INTENDED TO PRESERVE ITS

BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

POWER OF THE GENERAL PARTNER TO MAKE CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS OR

DISPOSITIONS. FURTHERMORE, IN LIMITED EVENTS OF DEFAULT,

ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WILL BE GRANTED TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING

POWERS TO DIRECT THE ACTIONS OF, OR REMOVE AND REPLACE, THE

PARTNERSHIPS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER. MERCK EARNS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT

AND FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS AND SUCH REVENUE WAS $1.7 BILLION,

$1.8 BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM,

AS

WELL AS

PRILOSEC

. IN ADDITION, MERCK EARNS CERTAIN

PARTNERSHIP RETURNS WHICH ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES AS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. SUCH RETURNS INCLUDE

A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT,

VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER

ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING

MERCKS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED AZLP GAAP EARNINGS. THE

ASTRAZENECA MERGER TRIGGERS A PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF MERCKS

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN 2008. UPON THIS REDEMPTION, AZLP

WILL DISTRIBUTE TO KBI AN AMOUNT BASED PRIMARILY ON A MULTIPLE

OF MERCKS AVERAGE ANNUAL VARIABLE RETURNS DERIVED FROM

SALES OF THE FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS FOR THE THREE YEARS

PRIOR TO THE REDEMPTION (THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF

AGREED VALUE).

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS DEFERRED INCOME,

ASTRA PURCHASED AN OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) TO BUY

MERCKS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE

GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

(THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS). THE ASSET OPTION IS

EXERCISABLE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010 AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL

TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 OF PROJECTED

FUTURE PRETAX REVENUE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FROM THE KBI

PRODUCTS (THE APPRAISED VALUE). MERCK ALSO HAD THE

RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008 AT THE

APPRAISED VALUE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ADVISED AZLP THAT

IT WILL NOT EXERCISE THE ASSET OPTION. IN ADDITION, IN 1998 THE

COMPANY GRANTED ASTRA AN OPTION TO BUY MERCKS COMMON STOCK

INTEREST IN KBI, AND, THEREFORE, MERCKS INTEREST IN

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

, EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER

ASTRAS PURCHASE OF MERCKS INTEREST IN THE NON-PPI

PRODUCTS. THE EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION BY ASTRA IS ALSO PROVIDED

FOR IN THE YEAR 2017 OR IF COMBINED ANNUAL SALES OF THE TWO

PRODUCTS FALL BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE,

ONLY SO LONG AS ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 HAS BEEN

EXERCISED. THE EXERCISE PRICE IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE

OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

TRUE-UP

MECHANISMS.

THE 1999 ASTRAZENECA MERGER CONSTITUTED A TRIGGER EVENT UNDER

THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN

EXCHANGE FOR MERCKS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE

ASTRA PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT

THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4 MILLION (THE

ADVANCE PAYMENT), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BY THE

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION (THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT) IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IN

2008 OF THE ASTRA PRODUCT RIGHTS RETAINED BY THE COMPANY.

ACCORDINGLY, RECOGNITION OF THIS CONTINGENT INCOME HAS BEEN

DEFERRED UNTIL THE REALIZABLE AMOUNT IS DETERMINABLE IN 2008. IN

2007, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED THIS AMOUNT TO ACCRUED AND OTHER

CURRENT LIABILITIES FROM NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES AS THIS

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION WILL OCCUR BEFORE THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2008.

101

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS,

BECAUSE A TRIGGER EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE SUM OF THE LIMITED

PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE, THE APPRAISED VALUE AND THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT IS GUARANTEED TO BE A MINIMUM OF $4.7 BILLION.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE AND

PAYMENT OF THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT WILL OCCUR IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008 AND SUCH AMOUNTS ARE

ANTICIPATED TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE

$4.7 BILLION. THESE PAYMENTS WILL RESULT IN A PRETAX GAIN

ESTIMATED TO BE $2.1 BILLION TO $2.3 BILLION.

ASTRAZENECAS PURCHASE OF MERCKS INTEREST IN THE

NON-PPI PRODUCTS IS CONTINGENT UPON THE EXERCISE OF

ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 AND, THEREFORE, PAYMENT OF THE

APPRAISED VALUE MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING OF AMI, THE COMPANY

ASSUMED A $2.4 BILLION PAR VALUE PREFERRED STOCK OBLIGATION

WITH A DIVIDEND RATE OF 5% PER ANNUM, WHICH IS CARRIED BY KBI

AND INCLUDED IN MINORITY INTERESTS. WHILE A SMALL PORTION OF THE

PREFERRED STOCK CARRIED BY KBI IS CONVERTIBLE INTO KBI COMMON

SHARES, NONE OF THE PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES AND, THEREFORE, THEY ARE NOT

INCLUDED AS COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE FOR PURPOSES OF COMPUTING

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION (SEE NOTE 16).

MERIAL

LIMITED

IN 1997, MERCK AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW SANOFI-AVENTIS

S.A.) COMBINED THEIR ANIMAL HEALTH AND POULTRY GENETICS

BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A

FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE

JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A

COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE

THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL

SPECIES. MERIAL SALES WERE $2.4 BILLION FOR 2007,

$2.2 BILLION FOR 2006 AND $2.0 BILLION FOR 2005.

SANOFI

PASTEUR MSD

IN 1994, MERCK AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW SANOFI

PASTEUR S.A.) ESTABLISHED AN EQUALLY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE TO

MARKET VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT

OF COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN EUROPE. JOINT

VENTURE VACCINE SALES WERE $1.4 BILLION FOR 2007,

$913.9 MILLION FOR 2006 AND $865.1 MILLION FOR 2005.

JOHNSON &

JOHNSON°MERCK CONSUMER PHARMACEUTICALS COMPANY

IN 1989, MERCK FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH JOHNSON &

JOHNSON TO DEVELOP AND MARKET A BROAD RANGE OF NONPRESCRIPTION

MEDICINES FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS 50% OWNED VENTURE WAS

EXPANDED INTO EUROPE IN 1993 AND INTO CANADA IN 1996. IN 2004,

CONTINGENCIES

AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS

WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS. THE

COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY

AS ASSESSMENTS

103

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGE OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. FOR PRODUCT

LIABILITY CLAIMS, A PORTION OF THE OVERALL ACCRUAL IS

ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED AND CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS PAST

EXPERIENCE, NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS

INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT

CONTINGENT LOSSES ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN

CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

THE COMPANYS DECISION TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE IS

DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING COST AND AVAILABILITY,

EXISTING AT THE TIME SUCH DECISIONS ARE MADE. AS A RESULT OF A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE HAS BECOME LESS

AVAILABLE WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE

COMPANY HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST

OF OBTAINING PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY

BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS AVAILABLE AND AS SUCH, HAS NO

INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE

AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD

AFTER THAT DATE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS

INSURANCE NEEDS AND THE COSTS, AVAILABILITY AND BENEFITS OF

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, INDIVIDUAL AND PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY

AND/OR

ECONOMIC LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASE OR USE OF

VIOXX

. ALL SUCH ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT ARE

COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA

(THE MDL) BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE ELDON E. FALLON. A

NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS FILED IN STATE COURT ARE COORDINATED IN

SEPARATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS IN STATE COURTS IN NEW JERSEY,

CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, AND THE COUNTIES OF PHILADELPHIA,

PENNSYLVANIA AND WASHOE AND CLARK COUNTIES, NEVADA. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN SERVED OR WAS AWARE

THAT IT HAD BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 26,500

LAWSUITS, WHICH INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 47,275 PLAINTIFF GROUPS,

ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

, AND IN APPROXIMATELY 262 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES

AND/OR

ECONOMIC LOSS. (ALL OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH

APPROXIMATELY 15,575 LAWSUITS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 15,575

PLAINTIFF GROUPS ARE INCLUDED IN A COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE CAROL E. HIGBEE.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CLAIMS OF OVER 6,350 PLAINTIFFS HAD BEEN

DISMISSED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. OF THESE, THERE HAVE

BEEN OVER 1,850 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED WITH

PREJUDICE (I.E., THEY CANNOT BE BROUGHT AGAIN) EITHER BY

PLAINTIFFS THEMSELVES OR BY THE COURTS. OVER 4,500 ADDITIONAL

PLAINTIFFS HAVE HAD THEIR CLAIMS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE

(I.E., SUBJECT TO THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, THEY

CAN BE BROUGHT AGAIN).

MERCK ENTERED INTO A TOLLING AGREEMENT (THE TOLLING

AGREEMENT) WITH THE MDL PLAINTIFFS STEERING

COMMITTEE (PSC) THAT ESTABLISHED A PROCEDURE TO HALT

THE RUNNING OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS (TOLLING) AS TO

CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

BY NON-NEW JERSEY CITIZENS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT

APPLIED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT FILED LAWSUITS AND MAY OR

MAY NOT EVENTUALLY FILE LAWSUITS AND ONLY TO THOSE CLAIMANTS WHO

SEEK TO TOLL CLAIMS ALLEGING INJURIES RESULTING FROM A

THROMBOTIC CARDIOVASCULAR EVENT THAT RESULTS IN A MYOCARDIAL

INFARCTION (MI) OR ISCHEMIC STROKE (IS).

THE TOLLING AGREEMENT PROVIDED COUNSEL ADDITIONAL TIME TO

EVALUATE POTENTIAL CLAIMS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT REQUIRED ANY

TOLLED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN FEDERAL COURT. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY 13,230 CLAIMANTS HAD

ENTERED INTO TOLLING AGREEMENTS. THE PARTIES AGREED THAT

APRIL 9, 2007 WAS THE DEADLINE FOR FILING TOLLING

AGREEMENTS AND NO ADDITIONAL TOLLING AGREEMENTS ARE BEING

ACCEPTED.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH

THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC

OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA

STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI

AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS

SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE

FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE THAN

95 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION (AS DEFINED BELOW). THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

APPLIES ONLY TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE

THAT THEIR MI OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES.

104

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF CERTAIN PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS UNDER THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT ARE MET, WHICH CONDITIONS MAY BE WAIVED BY MERCK,

MERCK WILL PAY A FIXED AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $4.85 BILLION

INTO TWO FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS THAT ENTER INTO THE

RESOLUTION PROCESS (THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM).

INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WILL BE EXAMINED BY ADMINISTRATORS OF THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM TO DETERMINE QUALIFICATION BASED ON

OBJECTIVE, DOCUMENTED FACTS PROVIDED BY CLAIMANTS, INCLUDING

RECORDS SUFFICIENT FOR A SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF INDEPENDENT

RISK FACTORS. THE CONDITIONS IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ALSO

REQUIRE CLAIMANTS TO PASS THREE GATES: AN INJURY GATE REQUIRING

OBJECTIVE, MEDICAL PROOF OF AN MI OR IS (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT), A DURATION GATE BASED ON DOCUMENTED

RECEIPT OF AT LEAST 30

VIOXX

PILLS, AND A PROXIMITY GATE

REQUIRING RECEIPT OF PILLS IN SUFFICIENT NUMBER AND PROXIMITY TO

THE EVENT TO SUPPORT A PRESUMPTION OF INGESTION OF

VIOXX

WITHIN 14 DAYS BEFORE THE CLAIMED INJURY.

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT MERCK DOES NOT ADMIT

CAUSATION OR FAULT. MERCKS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WILL BE TRIGGERED ONLY IF, AMONG OTHER

CONDITIONS, (1) LAW FIRMS ON THE FEDERAL AND STATE PSCS AND

FIRMS THAT HAVE TRIED CASES IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS ELECT

TO RECOMMEND ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM TO 100 PERCENT OF

THEIR CLIENTS WHO ALLEGE EITHER MI OR IS AND (2) BY

MARCH 1, 2008 (SUBJECT TO EXTENSION), PLAINTIFFS ENROLL IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AT LEAST 85 PERCENT OF EACH OF ALL

CURRENTLY PENDING AND TOLLED (I) MI CLAIMS, (II) IS

CLAIMS, (III) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH

INVOLVE DEATH, AND (IV) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER

WHICH ALLEGE MORE THAN 12 MONTHS OF USE. THE COMPANY HAS

THE RIGHT TO WAIVE THESE PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL CREATE SEPARATE FUNDS

IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.0 BILLION FOR MI CLAIMS AND

$850 MILLION FOR IS CLAIMS. ONCE TRIGGERED, MERCKS

TOTAL PAYMENT FOR BOTH FUNDS OF $4.85 BILLION IS A FIXED

AMOUNT TO BE ALLOCATED AMONG QUALIFYING CLAIMANTS BASED ON THEIR

INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION. WHILE AT THIS TIME THE EXACT NUMBER OF

CLAIMANTS COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS UNKNOWN, THE

TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT IS FIXED. PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUAL QUALIFYING

CLAIMANTS COULD BEGIN AS EARLY AS AUGUST 2008 AND THEN WILL BE

PAID OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. MERCK RETAINS ITS RIGHT TO TERMINATE

THIS PROCESS WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT TO ANY CLAIMANT, AND TO DEFEND

EACH CLAIM INDIVIDUALLY AT TRIAL IF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED

PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE NOT MET.

AFTER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 9,

2007, JUDGES IN THE FEDERAL MDL, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS AND NEW

JERSEY STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS ENTERED A SERIES OF ORDERS.

THE ORDERS: (1) TEMPORARILY STAYED THEIR RESPECTIVE

LITIGATIONS; (2) REQUIRED PLAINTIFFS TO REGISTER THEIR

CLAIMS BY JANUARY 15, 2008; (3) REQUIRE PLAINTIFFS

WITH CASES PENDING AS OF NOVEMBER 9, 2007 TO PRESERVE AND

PRODUCE RECORDS AND SERVE EXPERT REPORTS; AND (4) REQUIRE

PLAINTIFFS WHO FILE THEREAFTER TO MAKE SIMILAR PRODUCTIONS ON AN

ACCELERATED SCHEDULE. THE CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA COORDINATED

PROCEEDING WAS ALSO GENERALLY STAYED.

AS OF FEBRUARY 26, 2008, MORE THAN 57,000 PLAINTIFFS HAD

SUBMITTED REGISTRATION MATERIALS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 47,000

PLAINTIFFS WHO ALLEGE AN MI OR IS. IN ADDITION, AS OF

FEBRUARY 26, 2008, MORE THAN 33,000 CLAIMANTS HAVE STARTED

SUBMITTING ENROLLMENT MATERIALS. THE REGISTRATION AND ENROLLMENT

MATERIALS CURRENTLY ARE BEING EVALUATED FOR ELIGIBILITY,

ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS. THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR CONTINUES TO

RECEIVE NEW MATERIALS FROM PLAINTIFFS.

THE COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THE OUTCOMES OF SEVERAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT WERE TRIED PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 (SEE CHART BELOW).

THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH THE RESULTS OF TRIALS AND CERTAIN

SIGNIFICANT RULINGS THAT OCCURRED IN OR AFTER THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS.

ON OCTOBER 5, 2007, THE JURY IN KOZIC V. MERCK, A CASE

TRIED IN STATE COURT IN TAMPA, FLORIDA FOUND UNANIMOUSLY IN

FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS, REJECTING A CLAIM THAT THE COMPANY

WAS LIABLE FOR PLAINTIFFS HEART ATTACK. IN DECEMBER 2007,

PLAINTIFF FILED AN APPEAL BUT AGREED TO AN ORDER STAYING ALL

OTHER POST-TRIAL ACTIVITY PENDING HIS ENTRY INTO THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM.

ON JANUARY 18, 2007, JUDGE VICTORIA CHANEY DECLARED A

MISTRIAL IN A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL OF TWO CASES, APPELL V.

MERCK AND ARRIGALE V. MERCK, WHICH HAD COMMENCED ON

OCTOBER 31, 2006 IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT IN LOS ANGELES,

AFTER THE JURY INDICATED THAT IT COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT.

JUDGE CHANEY HAD RESCHEDULED THE RE-TRIAL OF THE COMBINED TRIAL

OF APPELL AND ARRIGALE FOR JANUARY 8, 2008, BUT BOTH OF

THESE CASES ARE NOW STAYED.

IN APRIL 2006, IN A TRIAL INVOLVING TWO PLAINTIFFS, THOMAS CONA

AND JOHN MCDARBY, IN SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, LAW DIVISION,

ATLANTIC COUNTY, THE JURY RETURNED A SPLIT VERDICT. THE JURY

DETERMINED THAT

VIOXX

DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO

THE HEART ATTACK OF MR. CONA, BUT DID SUBSTANTIALLY

CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEART ATTACK OF

105

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MR. MCDARBY. THE JURY ALSO CONCLUDED THAT, IN EACH CASE,

MERCK VIOLATED NEW JERSEYS CONSUMER FRAUD STATUTE, WHICH

ALLOWS PLAINTIFFS TO RECEIVE THEIR EXPENSES FOR PURCHASING THE

DRUG, TREBLED, AS WELL AS REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES. THE

JURY AWARDED $4.5 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO

MR. MCDARBY AND HIS WIFE, WHO ALSO WAS A PLAINTIFF IN THAT

CASE, AS WELL AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $9 MILLION. ON

JUNE 8, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE DENIED MERCKS MOTION FOR A

NEW TRIAL. ON JUNE 15, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE AWARDED

APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN

ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE

JUDGMENTS IN BOTH CASES AND THE APPELLATE DIVISION HELD ORAL

ARGUMENT ON BOTH CASES ON JANUARY 16, 2008.

ON MARCH 27, 2007, A JURY FOUND FOR MERCK ON ALL COUNTS IN

SCHWALLER V. MERCK, WHICH WAS TRIED IN STATE COURT IN

MADISON COUNTY, ILLINOIS. THE PLAINTIFF MOVED FOR A NEW TRIAL ON

MAY 25, 2007. THE PLAINTIFF FILED A SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION FOR

A NEW TRIAL ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2007. ON DECEMBER 11,

2007, JUDGE STACK SIGNED A CONSENT ORDER STAYING ALL POST-TRIAL

ACTIVITY IN THE CASE UNTIL MARCH 2008.

ON DECEMBER 15, 2006, THE JURY IN ALBRIGHT V. MERCK, A

CASE TRIED IN STATE COURT IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, RETURNED A

VERDICT FOR MERCK ON ALL COUNTS. PLAINTIFF APPEALED IN JULY 2007

TO THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT, BUT IN DECEMBER 2007, PLAINTIFF

AGREED TO STAY HIS APPEAL PENDING HIS ENTRY INTO THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM.

ON APRIL 19, 2007, JUDGE RANDY WILSON, WHO PRESIDES OVER

THE TEXAS

VIOXX

COORDINATED PROCEEDING, DISMISSED THE

FAILURE TO WARN CLAIM OF PLAINTIFF RUBY LEDBETTER, WHOSE CASE

WAS SCHEDULED TO BE TRIED ON MAY 14, 2007. JUDGE WILSON

RELIED ON A TEXAS STATUTE ENACTED IN 2003 THAT PROVIDES THAT

THERE CAN BE NO FAILURE TO WARN REGARDING A PRESCRIPTION

MEDICINE IF THE MEDICINE IS DISTRIBUTED WITH FDA-APPROVED

LABELING. THERE IS AN EXCEPTION IN THE STATUTE IF REQUIRED,

MATERIAL, AND RELEVANT INFORMATION WAS WITHHELD FROM THE FDA

THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO A DIFFERENT DECISION REGARDING THE

APPROVED LABELING, BUT JUDGE WILSON FOUND THAT THE EXCEPTION IS

PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW UNLESS THE FDA FINDS THAT SUCH

INFORMATION WAS WITHHELD. JUDGE WILSON IS CURRENTLY PRESIDING

OVER APPROXIMATELY 1,000

VIOXX

SUITS IN TEXAS IN WHICH A

PRINCIPAL ALLEGATION IS FAILURE TO WARN. JUDGE WILSON CERTIFIED

THE DECISION FOR AN EXPEDITED APPEAL TO THE TEXAS COURT OF CIVIL

APPEALS. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THE DECISION. ON

OCTOBER 11, 2007, MERCK FILED A MOTION TO ABATE THE HEARING

OF THE APPEAL UNTIL AFTER THE U.S. SUPREME COURTS

DECISION IN WARNER LAMBERT V. KENT, WHICH IS TO BE DECIDED

IN 2008. ON OCTOBER 25, 2007, THE TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS

DENIED MERCKS MOTION TO ABATE. THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY

BRIEFING THE APPEAL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ORAL ARGUMENT TO BE SET

SOMETIME IN THE SPRING OF 2008.

IN JULY 2006, IN DOHERTY V. MERCK, IN SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW

JERSEY, LAW DIVISION, ATLANTIC COUNTY, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT

IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY ON ALL COUNTS. THE JURY REJECTED A CLAIM

BY THE PLAINTIFF THAT HER NEARLY THREE YEARS OF

VIOXX

USE

CAUSED HER HEART ATTACK. THE JURY ALSO FOUND IN MERCKS

FAVOR ON THE PLAINTIFFS CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIM. PLAINTIFF

FILED A MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL IN AUGUST 2006. ON

DECEMBER 21, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE DENIED PLAINTIFFS

MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN LIGHT OF

PLAINTIFFS EXPRESSED INTENTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL, HERMANS V. MERCK AND THE RETRIAL OF

HUMESTON V. MERCK, BEGAN ON JANUARY 17, 2007, IN THE

COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE

HIGBEE. HUMESTON V. MERCK WAS FIRST TRIED IN 2005,

RESULTING IN A JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF MERCK ON

NOVEMBER 3, 2005. HOWEVER, ON AUGUST 17, 2006, JUDGE

HIGBEE SET ASIDE THE NOVEMBER 2005 JURY VERDICT AND ORDERED A

NEW TRIAL ON THE GROUNDS OF NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE.

THE HERMANS/HUMESTON TRIAL WAS SEPARATED INTO TWO PHASES: A

GENERAL PHASE REGARDING MERCKS CONDUCT AND A

PLAINTIFF-SPECIFIC PHASE. ON MARCH 2, 2007, THE JURY FOUND

FOR MERCK IN THE GENERAL PHASE ON THE HERMANS FAILURE TO WARN

CLAIM, AND THE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIM WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SUBMITTED

TO JUDGE HIGBEE FOR DECISION. ON MARCH 12, 2007, THE JURY

FOUND FOR PLAINTIFFS IN THE HUMESTON CASE, AWARDING COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES TO MR. HUMESTON IN THE AMOUNT OF $18 MILLION

AND TO MRS. HUMESTON IN THE AMOUNT OF $2 MILLION. THE

JURY ALSO AWARDED $27.5 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. MERCK

HAS MOVED FOR A JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT, A NEW

TRIAL, OR REDUCTION OF THE AWARD. THESE AND OTHER POST-TRIAL

MOTIONS ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. ON DECEMBER 11, 2007, THE

COURT DISMISSED THE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN

HERMANS.

ON JULY 31, 2007, THE NEW JERSEY APPELLATE DIVISION

UNANIMOUSLY UPHELD JUDGE HIGBEES DISMISSAL OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY RESIDENTS OF THE

UNITED KINGDOM. PLAINTIFFS HAD ASKED THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME

COURT TO REVIEW THE DECISION. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2007, THE NEW

JERSEY SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO REVIEW THE DECISION.

106

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MERCK VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

FROM THE MARKET ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. MOST STATES HAVE STATUTES OF

LIMITATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS OF NO MORE THAN THREE

YEARS, WHICH REQUIRE THAT CLAIMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS LEARNED OR COULD HAVE

LEARNED OF THEIR POTENTIAL CAUSE OF ACTION. AS A RESULT, SOME

MAY VIEW SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AS A SIGNIFICANT DEADLINE FOR

FILING

VIOXX

CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, HOWEVER,

THAT THE LAW REGARDING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS CAN BE COMPLEX

AND VARIABLE, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND APPLICABLE LAW. SOME

STATES HAVE LONGER STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS. THERE ARE ALSO

ARGUMENTS THAT THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS BEGAN RUNNING BEFORE

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE HIGBEE

AND FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FALLON HAVE ISSUED ORDERS IN

CASES FROM NEW JERSEY AND EIGHT OTHER JURISDICTIONS RULING THAT

THE STATUTORY PERIOD FOR MAKING

VIOXX

PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS HAS PASSED. JUDGE HIGBEES ORDER WAS ISSUED ON

OCTOBER 15, 2007 AND JUDGE FALLONS WAS ISSUED ON

NOVEMBER 8, 2007.

THE FOLLOWING CHART SETS FORTH THE RESULTS OF ALL

U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS TO DATE. JURIES

HAVE NOW DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY 12 TIMES AND IN

PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FIVE TIMES. ONE MERCK VERDICT WAS SET

ASIDE BY THE COURT AND HAS NOT BEEN RETRIED. ANOTHER MERCK

VERDICT WAS SET ASIDE AND RETRIED, LEADING TO ONE OF THE FIVE

PLAINTIFF VERDICTS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO UNRESOLVED MISTRIALS.

WITH RESPECT TO THE FIVE PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK HAS

FILED AN APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE

CASES, AND IN ONE OF THOSE FIVE, A FEDERAL JUDGE REDUCED THE

OTHER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 29, 2005, A NEW JERSEY

STATE TRIAL COURT CERTIFIED A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS (SUCH AS UNIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS) THAT PAID IN

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE

VIOXX

USED BY THEIR PLAN MEMBERS

OR INSUREDS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE SOUGHT RECOVERY OF

CERTAIN

VIOXX

PURCHASE COSTS (PLUS PENALTIES) BASED ON

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE PURPORTED CLASS MEMBERS PAID MORE FOR

VIOXX

THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY KNOWN OF THE

PRODUCTS ALLEGED RISKS. ON MARCH 31, 2006, THE NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, AFFIRMED THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE CERTIFICATION OF A NATIONWIDE CLASS

ACTION OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, FINDING THAT THE SUIT DOES NOT

MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CLASS ACTION. CLAIMS OF CERTAIN

INDIVIDUAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REMAIN PENDING IN THE NEW JERSEY

COURT, AND COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF

THIRD-PARTY PAYORS HAS THREATENED TO FILE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL

SUCH ACTIONS. ACTIVITY IN THE PENDING CASES IS CURRENTLY STAYED.

THERE ARE ALSO PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL

PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND CLAIMING EITHER

REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS OR AN ENTITLEMENT TO

MEDICAL MONITORING. ALL OF THESE CASES ARE AT EARLY PROCEDURAL

STAGES, AND NO CLASS HAS BEEN CERTIFIED. IN NEW JERSEY, THE

TRIAL COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT IN THE CASE OF SINCLAIR, A

PURPORTED STATEWIDE MEDICAL MONITORING CLASS. THE APPELLATE

DIVISION REVERSED THE DISMISSAL, AND THE ISSUE IS NOW ON APPEAL

TO THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT. THAT COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON

OCTOBER 22, 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

OF SEVEN STATES, AND THE CITY OF NEW YORK. A COLORADO TAXPAYER

HAS ALSO FILED A DERIVATIVE SUIT, ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF

COLORADO, NAMING THE COMPANY. THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE

COMPANY MISREPRESENTED THE SAFETY OF

VIOXX

AND SEEK

(I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED OR

REIMBURSED BY THE STATE AND ITS AGENCIES;

(II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE STATE AND ITS

AGENCIES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS

INJURED BY

VIOXX

; (III) DAMAGES UNDER VARIOUS COMMON

LAW THEORIES;

AND/OR

(IV) REMEDIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE STATUTORY THEORIES,

INCLUDING STATE CONSUMER FRAUD

AND/OR

FAIR

BUSINESS PRACTICES OR MEDICAID FRAUD STATUTES, INCLUDING CIVIL

PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED IN TWO OTHER

LAWSUITS CONTAINING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS FILED BY GOVERNMENTAL

ENTITIES SEEKING THE REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED MEDICAID

EXPENDITURES FOR

VIOXX

. THOSE LAWSUITS ARE (1) A

CLASS ACTION FILED BY SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA ON

BEHALF OF ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED CALIFORNIA COUNTIES, AND

(2) AN ACTION FILED BY ERIE COUNTY, NEW YORK. WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF THE CASE FILED BY TEXAS (WHICH REMAINS IN TEXAS

STATE COURT AND IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN SEPTEMBER

2008) AND THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ERIE COUNTY

CASES (WHICH ARE PENDING TRANSFER), THE REST OF THE ACTIONS

DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE FEDERAL

MDL AND HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY TO DATE.

SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, THE COMPANY AND VARIOUS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ALL OF THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED BY THE

JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (THE

JPML) TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R. CHESLER

FOR INCLUSION IN A NATIONWIDE MDL (THE SHAREHOLDER

MDL). JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTION, WHICH REQUESTED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF PURCHASERS OF

COMPANY STOCK BETWEEN MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29,

2004, ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF

SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

1934, AND SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS

OF SUIT, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO

ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE ACT AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES

OF MERCK STOCK AND UNDER SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS BASED ON

STATEMENTS IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES

FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERCK STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN, A

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN. ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE

CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS

DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT.

IN OCTOBER 2005, A DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO THE

109

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER GOVERNING THE SHAREHOLDER MDL, THE CASE,

WHICH IS BASED ON THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE

PENSION FUNDS COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 3, 2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED AN AMENDED

COMPLAINT RATHER THAN RESPONDING TO DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS. IN ADDITION IN 2007, SIX NEW COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS FOREIGN

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALSO ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND CERTAIN OFFICERS. DEFENDANTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

RESPOND TO THESE COMPLAINTS UNTIL AFTER THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUES

A DECISION ON THE SECURITIES LAWSUIT CURRENTLY ON APPEAL.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 15, 2005, A COMPLAINT

WAS FILED IN OREGON STATE COURT BY THE STATE OF OREGON THROUGH

THE OREGON STATE TREASURER ON BEHALF OF THE OREGON PUBLIC

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUND AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT

AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS UNDER OREGON SECURITIES LAW. A

TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR OCTOBER 2008.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL

AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). ON MAY 5,

2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS

AND DENIED PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR

COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, ARGUING THAT JUDGE CHESLER ERRED

IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITH

MATERIALS ACQUIRED DURING DISCOVERY. ON JULY 18, 2007, THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED

THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION ON THE GROUNDS THAT JUDGE

CHESLER SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED PLAINTIFFS TO MAKE USE OF THE

DISCOVERY MATERIAL TO TRY TO ESTABLISH DEMAND FUTILITY, AND

REMANDED THE CASE FOR THE DISTRICT COURTS CONSIDERATION OF

WHETHER, EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WOULD STILL BE FUTILE.

PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REQUEST FOR

LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2007. THAT MOTION IS

PENDING.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE



VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS)

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED

FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE LAWSUITS MAKE

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. ON JULY 11, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER

GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. IN OCTOBER 2007, PLAINTIFFS MOVED

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

PARTICIPANTS IN AND BENEFICIARIES OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AT ANY TIME BETWEEN OCTOBER 1,

1998 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND WHOSE PLAN ACCOUNTS

INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN THE MERCK COMMON STOCK FUND

AND/OR

MERCK

COMMON STOCK. THAT MOTION IS PENDING.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO

INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON THE COMPANYS

BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN,

FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER

INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH

RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN S. MARTIN, JR. OF

DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ALLEGATIONS SET FORTH

IN THE DEMAND. JUDGE MARTINS REPORT WAS MADE PUBLIC IN

SEPTEMBER 2006. BASED ON THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES

RECOMMENDATION MADE AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE MARTIN

REPORT AND THE IMPACT THAT DERIVATIVE LITIGATION WOULD HAVE ON

THE COMPANY, THE BOARD REJECTED THE DEMAND. ON OCTOBER 11,

2007, THE SHAREHOLDERS FILED A LAWSUIT IN STATE COURT IN

ATLANTIC COUNTY, NJ AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER EXECUTIVES AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE BOARDS

REJECTION OF THEIR DEMAND WAS UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPER, AND

THAT THE DEFENDANTS BREACHED VARIOUS DUTIES TO THE COMPANY IN

ALLOWING

VIOXX

TO BE MARKETED.

INTERNATIONAL

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LITIGATION

RELATING TO

VIOXX

IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS) IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS

CANADA, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, AND ISRAEL.

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$630 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-INSURANCE. THIS

INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

POTENTIAL DAMAGE AMOUNTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE

ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND LOSSES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS

INSURERS (WHICH PROVIDE EXCESS INSURANCE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE

TO ALL OF THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) HAD COMMENCED AN

ARBITRATION SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO CANCEL THOSE

POLICIES, TO VOID ALL OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THOSE POLICIES

AND TO RAISE OTHER COVERAGE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE

TRIBUNAL IN THE ARBITRATION RULED IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR

ORDERING THE UPPER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES. THE COMPANY RECORDED A

$455 MILLION GAIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS A RESULT OF

CERTAIN OTHER SETTLEMENTS AND THE TRIBUNALS DECISION. IN

ADDITION, PRIOR TO RECORDING THE GAIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2007, AS A RESULT OF SETTLEMENTS WITH, AND PAYMENTS MADE BY,

CERTAIN OF ITS INSURERS, THE COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED

INSURANCE PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION. THE

COMPANY STILL HAS CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RESOLVED AGAINST

LOWER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR AMOUNTS

PAID IN CONNECTION WITH

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS.

AS A RESULT OF SETTLEMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE, THE

COMPANY WILL NOT RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LIMITS DISCUSSED

IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION. THE RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS

AGAINST LOWER LEVEL INSURERS WILL ALSO AFFECT THE TOTAL AMOUNT

OF INSURANCE THAT IS RECOVERED FOR THESE CLAIMS. OTHER THAN THE

REMAINING COVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION FROM THE

LOWER LEVEL EXCESS INSURERS, THE COMPANY HAS NO ADDITIONAL

INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS.

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE COVERAGE

APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF

APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS FIDUCIARY AND

OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WITH STATED

UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF

THE ARBITRATION, ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS

SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE, IF NEEDED, UNDER UPPER-LEVEL EXCESS

POLICIES THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE

DISPUTES WITH THE INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS AND

THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL DISPUTES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY

RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE

LESS THAN THE STATED UPPER LIMITS.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS

ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN

INFORMAL INQUIRY CONCERNING

VIOXX.

ON JANUARY 28,

2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE SEC

ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION. ALSO, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE

DOJ) REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY

CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS (THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL DISPOSITIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF

CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CID) FROM A GROUP OF

ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 31 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA WHO ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANY VIOLATED

STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN RESPONDING

TO THE CIDS.

111

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006

FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS

AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON

CALIFORNIAS MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL

AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE

TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS

TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT

DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO

APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER

SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE

COORDINATION OF MORE THAN 95 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS

IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES

ONLY TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT

THEIR MI OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT OF

ENTERING INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

PRETAX CHARGE OF $4.85 BILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIXED

AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO PLAINTIFFS QUALIFYING FOR PAYMENT

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED THROUGHOUT 2008. A

TRIAL IN THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2008, BUT

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS,

INCLUDING FOR THOSE CASES IN WHICH VERDICTS OR JUDGMENTS HAVE

BEEN ENTERED AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND ARE NOW IN POST-VERDICT

PROCEEDINGS OR ON APPEAL. IN EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE

THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN SUCH CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD A

RESERVE OF $685 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. DURING 2006, THE

COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND

RECORDED ADDITIONAL CHARGES OF $673 MILLION. THUS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD A RESERVE OF

$858 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $616 MILLION

IN THE AGGREGATE, IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO

(I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THIRD QUARTER

OF 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF $210 MILLION AND

$70 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY

FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. IN INCREASING THE RESERVE, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERED THE SAME FACTORS THAT IT CONSIDERED WHEN IT

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY

$200 MILLION IN

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WHICH

RESULTED IN A RESERVE OF $522 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. AFTER ENTERING INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT,

THE COMPANY REVIEWED ITS RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND ALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION OF

ITS RESERVE TO MERCKS ANTICIPATED FUTURE COSTS TO

ADMINISTER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE RESERVE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF

THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT WILL BE CONSUMMATED, BUT THAT CERTAIN LAWSUITS WILL

CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT

AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS

AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND

TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EVENTS

SUCH AS SCHEDULED TRIALS, THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT

2008 AND 2009, AND THE INHERENT INABILITY TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOMES OF SUCH TRIALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT

112

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIABILITY LAWSUITS NOT PARTICIPATING IN OR NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, LIMIT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS LEGAL COSTS BEYOND 2009. TOGETHER WITH

THE $4.85 BILLION RESERVED FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, THE

AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE ESTABLISHED FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS APPROXIMATELY

$5.372 BILLION (THE 

VIOXX

RESERVE). AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, $2.122 BILLION OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL NEED TO

INCREASE THE RESERVE EVERY QUARTER, IT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE ITS RESERVES

FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO

SO.

OTHER

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY 403 CASES, WHICH INCLUDE

APPROXIMATELY 911 PLAINTIFF GROUPS HAD BEEN FILED AND WERE

PENDING AGAINST MERCK IN EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT,

INCLUDING 7 CASES WHICH SEEK CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS WELL

AS DAMAGES AND MEDICAL MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED

OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE

DENTAL PROCEDURES SUCH AS TOOTH EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS,

AND/OR

DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX.

ON AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS NATIONWIDE

SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION (THE 

FOSAMAX

MDL) FOR COORDINATED

PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL HAS BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE JOHN KEENAN IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AS A RESULT OF THE

JPML ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 350 OF THE CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE

KEENAN. JUDGE KEENAN HAS ISSUED A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER SETTING

FORTH A SCHEDULE GOVERNING THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSES

PRIMARILY UPON RESOLVING THE CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS

IN 2007 AND COMPLETING FACT DISCOVERY IN AN INITIAL GROUP OF 25

CASES BY AUGUST 1, 2008. BRIEFING AND ARGUMENT ON

PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS FOR CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL MONITORING

CLASSES WERE COMPLETED IN 2007 AND JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER

DENYING THE MOTIONS ON JANUARY 3, 2008. ON JANUARY 28,

2008, JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED A FURTHER ORDER DISMISSING WITH

PREJUDICE ALL CLASS CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE FIRST FOUR CLASS

ACTION LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST MERCK THAT SOUGHT PERSONAL INJURY

DAMAGES

AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING RELIEF ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS. DISCOVERY IS

ONGOING IN BOTH THE

FOSAMAX

MDL LITIGATION AS WELL AS IN

VARIOUS STATE COURT CASES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND AGAINST

THESE LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A REMAINING

RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF

THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST

THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, THE COMPANY

IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND 2009. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO

THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING

LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE

SOMETIMES USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE

TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO

FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS

PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND

ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH,

LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING

CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED THE

COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE

COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE

COMPANY AS

113

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR COMPLAINTS PENDING IN

FEDERAL AND STATE COURT BROUGHT INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF

COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. FORTY OF THE COUNTY CASES

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE COMPANY WAS DISMISSED FROM THE

SUFFOLK COUNTY CASE, WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY

CASES TO BE FILED. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

THE COMPANY WAS A DEFENDANT IN STATE CASES BROUGHT BY THE

ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF ELEVEN STATES, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING

DEFENDED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2003, THE DOJ NOTIFIED THE

FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO

INTERVENE AT THAT TIME IN A PENDING FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT

CASE THAT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL IN DECEMBER 1999 AGAINST THE

COMPANY. THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER UNSEALING THE COMPLAINT,

WHICH WAS FILED BY A PHYSICIAN IN LOUISIANA, AND ORDERED THAT

THE COMPLAINT BE SERVED. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH ALLEGED THAT THE

COMPANYS DISCOUNTING OF

PEPCID

IN CERTAIN LOUISIANA

HOSPITALS LED TO INCREASES IN COSTS TO MEDICAID, WAS DISMISSED.

ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED BY THE COURT UNTIL THE SEAL IS LIFTED.

THE STATE OF LOUISIANA HAS FILED ITS OWN AMENDED COMPLAINT,

INCORPORATING THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED AMENDED

COMPLAINT. AS PART OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE SEAL IN THIS CASE WAS LIFTED

AND THE CASES WERE DISMISSED.

IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A QUI TAM LAWSUIT UNDER

THE NEVADA FALSE CLAIMS ACT. THE SUIT, IN WHICH THE NEVADA

ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS INTERVENED, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY

INAPPROPRIATELY OFFERED NOMINAL PRICING AND OTHER MARKETING AND

PRICING INDUCEMENTS TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND ALSO FAILED TO

COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MEDICAID BEST PRICE SCHEME

RELATED TO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION WAS DENIED BY THE DISTRICT COURT.

THIS MATTER HAS ALSO BEEN DISMISSED AS PART OF THE RESOLUTION OF

THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS.

DURING DECEMBER 2007 AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2008, THE

COMPANY AND ITS JOINT-VENTURE PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, RECEIVED

SEVERAL JOINT LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND

COMMERCE AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE COMPANIES AND THE MSP PARTNERSHIP

EACH RECEIVED TWO SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS.

MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE ALSO EACH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE OFFICE OF THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED

FEBRUARY 1, 2008 REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE

MARKETING AND SALE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND THE

TIMING OF DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH

MID-JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING

COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR THE CONSUMER FRAUD LITIGATION COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND SAMPLES. THE COMPANY HAD ALSO

TOTAL SETTLEMENT AMOUNT.

THE NEW ORLEANS SETTLEMENT RESOLVES A CIVIL ACTION CONTAINING

ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING PRICING DISCOUNTS OFFERED TO HOSPITALS FOR

PEPCID

. THE ORIGINAL PRICING PROGRAM, KNOWN AS THE FLEX

PROGRAM, WAS LAUNCHED IN 1994 AND CONTINUED TO OPERATE AS THE

FLEX-NP PROGRAM UNTIL ITS TERMINATION IN APRIL 2001. THE NEW

ORLEANS SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTS FOR $250 MILLION PLUS INTEREST

OF THE TOTAL SETTLEMENT AMOUNT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THESE SETTLEMENTS, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A

CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

HUMAN SERVICES, WHICH INCORPORATES THE COMPANYS EXISTING,

COMPREHENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GOVERNING ITS PHARMACEUTICAL

SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

DOJ ADVISING IT OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CIVIL COMPLAINT BROUGHT

UNDER THE QUI TAM PROVISIONS OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT ALLEGING

THAT THE COMPANY VIOLATED CERTAIN RULES RELATED TO ITS

CALCULATIONS OF BEST PRICE AND OTHER FEDERAL PRICING BENCHMARK

MEDICAID REBATE OBLIGATION. DOJ HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT IT

DOES NOT INTEND TO INTERVENE IN THIS ACTION AND HAS CLOSED ITS

INVESTIGATION. THE LAWSUIT HAS NOW BEEN DISMISSED.

THE COMPANY HAS COOPERATED WITH ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. IN

ADDITION TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS, FROM TIME TO TIME, OTHER

FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN REGULATORS OR AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK

INFORMATION ABOUT PRACTICES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY OR

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN INQUIRIES OTHER THAN

THE INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION. IT IS NOT FEASIBLE

TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH INQUIRIES.

BROUGHT UNDER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1987 IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, WHICH ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A

VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING VACCINATED WITH

VARIOUS BIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES AND RUBELLA

AND/OR

TRIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS

M-M-R

II. THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AUTISM,

WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, EPILEPSY,

ENCEPHALITIS, ENCEPHALOPATHY, GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME AND

TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. ALL OF THE REMAINING CASES HAVE BEEN

DISCONTINUED OR STRUCK OUT BY THE COURT AND THE GROUP LITIGATION

HAS CONCLUDED. THERE ARE NO CLAIMS OUTSTANDING AGAINST MERCK. AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS ALSO A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL

AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE

UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G., HEPATITIS B

VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN

VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING

PEDIATRIC VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FALL OF 2001.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 234

ACTIVE THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS WITH APPROXIMATELY 425

PLAINTIFFS. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE MANUFACTURERS

WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS

MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL

INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC

VACCINES. THERE ARE NO CASES CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL. THE

COMPANY WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

115

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE

EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS

PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE

VACCINE ACT). THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON

FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR

VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE

VACCINE COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING

A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE PETITIONER

MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN

VACCINE COURT AND THEN TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A

CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT

TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE

COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE

PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 900 CASES

PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES

AND/OR

THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. NOT ALL

OF THE THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE VACCINE

COURT PROCEEDING ARE COMPANY VACCINES. THE COMPANY IS THE SOLE

SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE DOMESTICALLY. IN JUNE

2007, THE SPECIAL MASTERS PRESIDING OVER THE VACCINE COURT

PROCEEDINGS HELD A TWO AND A HALF WEEK HEARING IN WHICH BOTH

PETITIONERS AND THE GOVERNMENT PRESENTED EVIDENCE ON THE ISSUE

OF WHETHER THE COMBINATION OF

M-M-R

II VACCINE AND

THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES CAN CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS AND

WHETHER IT DID CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER IN THE PETITIONER

IN THAT CASE. TWO SHORTER ADDITIONAL EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS OF

THAT TYPE ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE WERE HELD IN THE FALL OF 2007.

RULINGS IN THESE THREE CASES ARE EXPECTED IN 2008. ACCORDING TO

THE VACCINE COURT, IT EXPECTS TO HOLD EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN

SIX ADDITIONAL SO-CALLED TEST CASES BY SEPTEMBER

2008, ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES, OR

THE

M-M-R

- II VACCINE ALONE, CAN CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM

DISORDERS, AND DID CAUSE SUCH DISORDERS IN THOSE SIX

PETITIONERS. THE VACCINE COURT HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO

USE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THESE TEST CASE HEARINGS TO GUIDE

THE ADJUDICATION OF THE REMAINING AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER CASES.

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND

ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT

BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR

THESE PRODUCTS.

BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A

DECISION REFUSING TO BAR THE APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON

THE GROUNDS THAT MERCKS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS

LIKELY INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC

ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA IN JUNE 2005. IN JULY 2005,

MERCK WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX CORP.

UNTIL JULY 2018. OPPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE EPO AGAINST

THIS PATENT. ADDITIONALLY, MERCK HAS BROUGHT PATENT INFRINGEMENT

SUITS IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN JURISDICTIONS BASED UPON THIS PATENT.

HOLLAND.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JAPAN AFTER A

PROCEEDING WAS FILED CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE

COMPANYS JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY

OTHER

LITIGATION

IN NOVEMBER 2005, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE COMPANYS BOARD ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY HAD

SUSTAINED DAMAGES THROUGH THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF ITS

CHANGE IN CONTROL SEPARATION BENEFITS PLAN (THE CIC

PLAN) IN NOVEMBER 2004. THE SHAREHOLDER MADE A DEMAND ON

THE BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE BOARDS CURRENT

OR FORMER MEMBERS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY

WITH RESPECT TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CIC PLAN. IN RESPONSE TO

THAT DEMAND LETTER, THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD

DETERMINED AT THE NOVEMBER 22, 2005 BOARD MEETING THAT THE

BOARD WOULD TAKE THE SHAREHOLDERS REQUEST UNDER

CONSIDERATION. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD, THE

SHAREHOLDER WAS ADVISED THAT THE BOARD HAD DETERMINED NOT TO

TAKE LEGAL ACTION.

IN FEBRUARY 2008, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMANDING THAT THE

BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO

RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY TO RESOLVE THE

GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 20, 2004, THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY GRANTED A

MOTION BY THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO

HEALTH) AND CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO DISMISS A

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION INVOLVING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS REVENUE RECOGNITION PRACTICE FOR RETAIL

CO-PAYMENTS PAID BY INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM MEDCO HEALTH PROVIDES

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER ALLEGATIONS. THE

COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE

DECISION. ON DECEMBER 15, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT UPHELD MOST OF THE DISTRICT

COURTS DECISION DISMISSING THE SUIT, AND SENT THE ISSUE OF

WHETHER THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROPERLY REFUSED

THE SHAREHOLDER DEMAND RELATING TO THE COMPANYS TREATMENT

OF RETAIL CO-PAYMENTS BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR

RECONSIDERATION UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL STANDARD. PLAINTIFFS

MOVED TO REMAND THEIR ACTION TO STATE COURT ON AUGUST 18,

2006, AND THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THAT MOTION ON

FEBRUARY 1, 2007. THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS

PENDING BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, CHANCERY

DIVISION, HUNTERDON COUNTY. ALL OF THE REMAINING ISSUES WERE

DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE IN FAVOR OF MEDCO HEALTH, MERCK AND THE

INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ON JULY 31, 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH,

THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION

BASIS, A SERIES OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA (THE

GRUER CASES). THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A

NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS,

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY AGREED TO

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT COST

AND DISTRACTION OF PROLONGED LITIGATION. THE PROPOSED CLASS

SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES

FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO

118

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A TOTAL OF $42.5 MILLION, AND

MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR

TO CONTINUE CERTAIN SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF

FIVE YEARS. THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT

MEMBERS OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR

WHICH MEDCO HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME

SINCE DECEMBER 17, 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD HEARINGS

TO HEAR OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT

AND APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED

THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT

TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL

ONLY IF AND WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. CERTAIN CLASS

MEMBER PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN

THE SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH PLANS AND TWO

INDIVIDUALS REMAIN PENDING IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES HAVE ASSERTED CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS

WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR

SIMILAR TO THE CLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS

MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES. THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH ARE

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES.

THREE NOTICES OF APPEAL WERE FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT HEARD

ORAL ARGUMENT IN MAY 2005. ON DECEMBER 8, 2005, THE

APPELLATE COURT ISSUED A DECISION VACATING THE DISTRICT

COURTS JUDGMENT AND REMANDING THE CASES TO THE DISTRICT

COURT TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT COURT TO RESOLVE CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. A HEARING WAS HELD TO ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006. THE DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A RULING ON

AUGUST 10, 2006 RESOLVING SUCH JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES IN

FAVOR OF THE SETTLING PLAINTIFFS. THE CLASS MEMBERS AND THE

OTHER PARTY THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEALED THE DISTRICT

COURTS JUDGMENT RENEWED THEIR APPEALS. ON OCTOBER 4,

2007, THE RENEWED APPEALS WERE AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN

PART BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS. THE APPEALS COURT REMANDED

THE CLASS SETTLEMENT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN THE DISTRICT

COURT.

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS

DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING TWO PARAGRAPHS. THESE CASES ARE BEING

DEFENDED BY MEDCO HEALTH.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY,

WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS

NOTE, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE

EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR

WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED IN THIS NOTE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE

OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS

OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE

GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY

TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP

COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF

CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE

RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE

COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO

SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN

DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES

OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, SUCH

PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH

WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND

PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY

REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM

FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

MERCK HAS ENTERED INTO A CONSENT DECREE (THE DECREE)

WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT

OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE PENNSYLVANIA FISH AND BOAT

COMMISSION RESOLVING THE GOVERNMENTS CLAIMS ASSERTED IN AN

ENFORCEMENT ACTION, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND COMMONWEALTH OF

PENNSYLVANIA V. MERCK & CO., INC., IN RESPONSE TO

THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF 25 GALLONS OF

POTASSIUM THIOCYANATE FROM THE SITE IN JUNE 2006 THAT RESULTED

IN A FISH KILL IN THE WISSAHICKON CREEK AS WELL AS THE

119

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS ON AUGUST 8, 9, AND 16, 2006 THAT

CAUSED FOAMING IN THE CREEK. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE

DECREE, MERCK WILL PAY CIVIL PENALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF

$1.575 MILLION; FUND SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS IN

THE AMOUNT OF $9 MILLION; AND IMPLEMENT

ON-SITE

REMEDIAL MEASURES IN THE AMOUNT OF $10 MILLION. A MOTION TO

ENTER THE DECREE IS PENDING WITH THE COURT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2007,

APPROXIMATELY 1,400 PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT

AGAINST MERCK AND 12 OTHER DEFENDANTS IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE

CLEAN WATER ACT, THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT, AS

WELL AS NEGLIGENCE AND NUISANCE. THE SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR

DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUE, MEDICAL MONITORING AND OTHER

ALLEGED REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH

GROUNDWATER AND SOIL CONTAMINATION FOUND AT THE SITE OF A FORMER

MERCK SUBSIDIARY IN MERCED, CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST THESE CLAIMS.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE

HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND TOTALED $109.6 MILLION AND

$129.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT

CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM OTHER PARTIES AND WILL BE

PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE

SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE NEXT

15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY

POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE

LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $54.0 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE. MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY

OTHER PAID-IN CAPITAL INCREASED BY $848.4 MILLION IN 2007,

$266.5 MILLION IN 2006 AND $30.2 MILLION IN 2005. THE

INCREASE IN 2007 REFLECTS THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES RELATED TO THE

ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA (SEE NOTE 4). THE INCREASES IN

ALL PERIODS ALSO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF SHARES ISSUED UPON

EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RELATED INCOME TAX BENEFITS, AS

WELL AS THE ISSUANCE OF RESTRICTED SHARES. IN ADDITION, THE

INCREASE IN 2006 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF RECOGNIZING SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF

FAS 123R (SEE NOTE 12).

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER WHICH

EMPLOYEES, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANYS EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES MAY BE GRANTED

OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK AT THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT. IN ADDITION TO STOCK OPTIONS,

THE COMPANY GRANTS PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (PSUS)

AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) TO CERTAIN

MANAGEMENT LEVEL EMPLOYEES. THESE PLANS WERE APPROVED BY THE

COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

149.8 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS

UNDER THE COMPANYS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE

COMPANY SETTLES EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

PRIMARILY WITH TREASURY SHARES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMPANY

STOCK AT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT. THESE

AWARDS GENERALLY VEST ONE-THIRD EACH YEAR OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERIOD, WITH A CONTRACTUAL TERM OF

120

TABLE OF CONTENTS

10 YEARS. RSUS ARE STOCK AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED TO

EMPLOYEES AND ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS

THE AWARDS VEST, AS WELL AS NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDEND

EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS IS DETERMINED AND

FIXED ON THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE.

PSUS ARE STOCK AWARDS WHERE THE ULTIMATE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED

WILL BE CONTINGENT ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AGAINST A

PRE-SET OBJECTIVE OR SET OF OBJECTIVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH

PSU IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE OF GRANT BASED ON THE

COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE

NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED WILL BE

ADJUSTED BASED ON THE PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVEMENT OF A

PERFORMANCE TARGET AND FINAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE WILL BE

RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ULTIMATE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED. THE

COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN CONNECTION

WITH PSUS IN 2006 OR 2005. BOTH PSU AND RSU PAYOUTS WILL BE IN

SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK AFTER THE END OF THE VESTING OR

PERFORMANCE PERIOD, GENERALLY THREE YEARS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS

APPLICABLE TO SUCH AWARDS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

FAS 123R. EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS

PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD WHICH

MEASURES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT EXCEEDS THE

EXERCISE PRICE. FAS 123R REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN NET INCOME, WHICH THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE MODIFIED

PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD FOR ADOPTING FAS 123R, AND

THEREFORE, PRIOR PERIODS WERE NOT RETROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTED.

UNDER THIS METHOD, THE PROVISIONS FOR FAS 123R APPLY TO ALL

AWARDS GRANTED OR MODIFIED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006. IN

ADDITION, THE UNRECOGNIZED EXPENSE OF AWARDS THAT HAVE NOT YET

VESTED AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME IN

THE RELEVANT PERIOD AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. ALSO EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STAFF POSITION

123R-3,

TRANSITION ELECTION RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX

EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

, WHICH PROVIDES THE

COMPANY AN OPTIONAL SHORT-CUT METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE

HISTORICAL POOL OF WINDFALL TAX BENEFITS UPON ADOPTING

FAS 123R.

FAS 123R REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PRESENT PRO FORMA

DISCLOSURE, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS AT THE DATE OF

GRANT, INCLUDING THOSE GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES,

IS AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PRO FORMA AMOUNTS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION GRANT

WERE ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES

OPTION PRICING MODEL. UPON THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R,

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY FOR AWARDS

GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR OVER THE PERIOD FROM

THE GRANT DATE TO THE DATE RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY IS ACHIEVED.

THIS APPROACH IS KNOWN AS THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD

APPROACH. IF THE COMPANY HAD BEEN APPLYING THIS APPROACH FOR

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, THE

EFFECT ON PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, AS PROVIDED IN THE ABOVE

TABLE, WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

IN 2005, PRO FORMA COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS CALCULATED USING THE

BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL UTILIZING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL

DATA, SUCH THAT EXPENSE WAS DETERMINED USING SEPARATE EXPECTED

TERM ASSUMPTIONS FOR EACH VESTING TRANCHE. AS A RESULT, PRO

FORMA COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ANY STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2004 BUT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006 WAS

CALCULATED USING THE ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION METHOD PRESCRIBED

IN FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 28,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER VARIABLE STOCK OPTION OR AWARD

PLANS

. UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION

EXPENSE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING

MODEL FOR OPTION GRANTS AFTER ADOPTION OF FAS 123R. IN

APPLYING THIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES BOTH HISTORICAL DATA AND

CURRENT MARKET DATA TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS OPTIONS.

THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL REQUIRES SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTIONS, RISK-FREE RATE, VOLATILITY, AND

DIVIDEND YIELD. THE EXPECTED TERM REPRESENTS THE EXPECTED AMOUNT

OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING,

BASED ON HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED EXERCISE BEHAVIOR. THE

RISK-FREE RATE IS BASED ON THE RATE AT GRANT DATE OF ZERO-COUPON

U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH A TERM EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED TERM

OF THE OPTION. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED USING A BLEND OF

HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE HISTORICAL COMPONENT IS

BASED ON HISTORICAL MONTHLY PRICE CHANGES. THE IMPLIED

VOLATILITY IS OBTAINED FROM MARKET DATA ON THE COMPANYS

TRADED OPTIONS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2007, 2006

AND 2005 WAS $9.51, $7.25 AND $6.66 PER OPTION, RESPECTIVELY,

AND WERE DETERMINED USING THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.

PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN CERTAIN OF ITS

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES. PENSION BENEFITS IN THE UNITED

AND YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PROVIDES

MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS, PRINCIPALLY TO ITS

ELIGIBLE U.S. RETIREES AND SIMILAR BENEFITS TO THEIR

DEPENDENTS, THROUGH ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE

COMPANY USES A DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY

THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE RATE OF

RETURN TO BE EARNED ON PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PERIOD THE BENEFITS

INCLUDED IN THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION ARE TO BE PAID AND IS

DETERMINED ON A COUNTRY BASIS. IN DEVELOPING THE EXPECTED RATE

OF RETURN WITHIN EACH COUNTRY, THE LONG-TERM HISTORICAL RETURNS

DATA IS CONSIDERED AS WELL AS ACTUAL RETURNS ON THE PLAN ASSETS

AND OTHER CAPITAL MARKETS EXPERIENCE. USING THIS REFERENCE

INFORMATION, THE LONG-TERM RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH ASSET

CATEGORY AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED RETURN FOR EACH

COUNTRYS TARGET PORTFOLIO IS DEVELOPED, ACCORDING TO THE

ALLOCATION AMONG THOSE INVESTMENT CATEGORIES. THE EXPECTED

PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE REFLECTS THE CONTRIBUTION OF ACTIVE

MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE. FOR 2008, THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

RATE OF RETURN OF 8.75% WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM 2007 FOR ITS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY

IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 109,

(FIN 48). FIN 48

PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX

POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN.

FIN 48 REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINE WHETHER THE

BENEFITS OF TAX POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX

POSITION. FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF

BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE LARGEST

AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING

REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PORTION

OF THE BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 48, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN

$81 MILLION DECREASE IN ITS EXISTING LIABILITY FOR

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE TO THE

JANUARY 1, 2007 RETAINED EARNINGS BALANCE.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

FIN 48, THE COMPANYS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS WAS $5.01 BILLION, EXCLUDING LIABILITIES FOR

INTEREST AND PENALTIES. IF THE COMPANY WERE TO RECOGNIZE THESE

BENEFITS, THE INCOME TAX PROVISION WOULD REFLECT A FAVORABLE NET

IMPACT OF $3.95 BILLION. IN ADDITION, AT JANUARY 1,

2007, LIABILITIES FOR ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATING TO

THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TOTALED $2.40 BILLION. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET REFLECTS A LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF

$3.69 BILLION. IF THE COMPANY WERE TO RECOGNIZE THESE

BENEFITS, THE INCOME TAX PROVISION WOULD REFLECT A FAVORABLE NET

IMPACT OF $2.60 BILLION. ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WERE

$1.60 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE DECLINES

FROM JANUARY 1, 2007 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT

WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) DISCUSSED

BELOW.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS A COMPONENT OF TAXES ON INCOME IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WHICH AMOUNTED TO

$270 MILLION IN 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE IRS HAS COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION

OF THE COMPANYS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1993 TO 2001. AS

A RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION, THE COMPANY MADE AN AGGREGATE

PAYMENT OF $2.79 BILLION IN FEBRUARY 2007. THIS PAYMENT WAS

OFFSET BY (I) A TAX REFUND OF $165 MILLION RECEIVED IN

2007 FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID FOR THESE MATTERS AND

(II) A FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY

$360 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT,

RESULTING IN A NET CASH COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION IN 2007. THE IMPACT FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO

2001 FOR ITEMS REVIEWED AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION WAS INCLUDED

IN THE PAYMENT ALTHOUGH THOSE YEARS REMAIN OPEN IN ALL OTHER

RESPECTS. THE CLOSING OF THE IRS EXAMINATION DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

2007 AS THESE AMOUNTS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR.

THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF REPORTING THE RESULTS OF THE

IRS ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE YEARS 1993 THROUGH 2001 TO VARIOUS STATE

TAX AUTHORITIES. THIS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL TAX AND INTEREST

PAYMENTS OF $57 MILLION AND $67 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

IN 2007, AND AN EQUIVALENT REDUCTION IN THE BALANCES OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND ACCRUED INTEREST.

IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

WILL CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS; HOWEVER THESE CHANGES

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MERCKS CANADIAN TAX RETURNS FOR

THE YEARS 1998 THROUGH 2004 ARE BEING EXAMINED BY THE CANADA

REVENUE AGENCY (CRA). IN OCTOBER 2006, THE CRA

ISSUED THE COMPANY A NOTICE OF

129

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REASSESSMENT CONTAINING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS, WHICH RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

CANADIAN AND PROVINCIAL TAX DUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.6 BILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS INTEREST OF

APPROXIMATELY $810 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS). IN

ADDITION, IN JULY 2007, THE CRA PROPOSED ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS

FOR 1999 RELATING TO ANOTHER INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTER. THE

ADJUSTMENTS WOULD INCREASE CANADIAN TAX DUE BY APPROXIMATELY

$22 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS $21 MILLION

(U.S. DOLLARS) OF INTEREST. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CRA

WILL PROPOSE SIMILAR ADJUSTMENTS FOR LATER YEARS. THE COMPANY

DISAGREES WITH THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE CRA AND BELIEVES THEY

ARE WITHOUT MERIT. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTEST THE ASSESSMENT

THROUGH THE CRA APPEALS PROCESS AND THE COURTS IF NECESSARY. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS, DURING 2007, THE COMPANY

PLEDGED COLLATERAL TO TWO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ONE OF WHICH

PROVIDED A GUARANTEE TO THE CRA AND THE OTHER TO THE QUEBEC

MINISTRY OF REVENUE REPRESENTING A PORTION OF THE TAX AND

INTEREST ASSESSED. THE COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$1.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE COMPANY HAS

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THESE MATTERS. WHILE THE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS MAY RESULT IN LIABILITIES HIGHER OR

LOWER THAN THE RESERVES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT RESOLUTION OF

THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, AN

UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE

QUARTER IN WHICH AN ADJUSTMENT IS RECORDED OR TAX IS DUE.

IN JULY 2007, THE CRA NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT IT IS IN THE

PROCESS OF PROPOSING A PENALTY OF $160 MILLION

(U.S. DOLLARS) IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2006 NOTICE. THE

PENALTY IS FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON A TIMELY BASIS.

THE COMPANY VIGOROUSLY DISAGREES WITH THE PENALTY AND FEELS IT

IS INAPPLICABLE AND THAT APPROPRIATE INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED ON

A TIMELY BASIS. THE COMPANY IS PURSUING ALL APPROPRIATE REMEDIES

TO AVOID HAVING THE PENALTY ASSESSED AND WAS NOTIFIED IN EARLY

AUGUST 2007 THAT THE CRA IS HOLDING THE IMPOSITION OF A PENALTY

IN ABEYANCE PENDING A REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS SUBMISSIONS

AS TO THE INAPPLICABILITY OF A PENALTY.

THE IRS RECENTLY BEGAN ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS

2002 TO 2005 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

EXAMINATION, THE COMPANY IS CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF A PRE

FILING AGREEMENT WITH THE IRS TO ASSURE CERTAINTY WITH RESPECT

TO THE TIMING AND DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

ACCRUED IN 2007. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN TAX

EXAMINATIONS ARE IN PROGRESS. TAX YEARS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO

EXAMINATION BY MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS INCLUDE GERMANY FROM

1999, ITALY AND JAPAN FROM 2000 AND THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM 2002.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, FOREIGN EARNINGS OF

$17.2 BILLION HAVE BEEN RETAINED INDEFINITELY BY SUBSIDIARY

COMPANIES FOR REINVESTMENT. NO PROVISION WILL BE MADE FOR INCOME

TAXES THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE UPON THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUCH

EARNINGS AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF

THE RELATED UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSIDIARIES OPERATING IN PUERTO RICO

AND SINGAPORE UNDER TAX INCENTIVE GRANTS THAT EXPIRE IN 2015 AND

2026, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

(AJCA) CREATED TEMPORARY INCENTIVES FOR

U.S. MULTINATIONALS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE AJCA, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED

$15.9 BILLION DURING 2005. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCOME

TAX CHARGE OF $766.5 MILLION IN TAXES ON INCOME IN 2005

RELATED TO THIS REPATRIATION, $185 MILLION OF WHICH WAS

PAID IN 2005 AND THE REMAINDER WAS PAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2006. THE COMPANY HAS NOT CHANGED ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY

REINVEST ACCUMULATED EARNINGS EARNED SUBSEQUENT TO

DECEMBER 31, 2002.

SHAREHOLDERS OF MERCK & CO., INC..

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND

THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, OF RETAINED

EARNINGS, OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF

MERCK & CO., INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND THE

RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE

THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 IN

CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN

MANAGEMENTS REPORT UNDER ITEM 9A. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED

ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN 2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS IN

2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN 2007.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS

IN MAY 2000, MERCK & CO., INC. (MERCK) AND

SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION (SCHERING-PLOUGH)

(COLLECTIVELY MANAGEMENT OR THE

PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS (THE

AGREEMENTS) TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE

UNITED STATES, SCHERING-PLOUGHS THEN INVESTIGATIONAL

CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITOR (CAI) EZETIMIBE

(MARKETED TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES AS ZETIA AND AS EZETROL IN

MOST OTHER COUNTRIES) (THE CHOLESTEROL

COLLABORATION) AND A FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING

THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE (THE

RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION). MONTELUKAST SODIUM, A

LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IS SOLD BY MERCK AS SINGULAIR

AND LORATADINE, AN ANTIHISTAMINE, IS SOLD BY SCHERING-PLOUGH AS

CLARITIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE INDICATED FOR THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS

OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS.

THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION IS FORMALLY REFERRED TO AS THE

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL PARTNERSHIP (THE

PARTNERSHIP). IN DECEMBER 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL

COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL COUNTRIES

OF THE WORLD, EXCEPT JAPAN. THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION

AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR EZETIMIBE TO BE DEVELOPED AND MARKETED IN

THE FOLLOWING FORMS.



EZETIMIBE, A ONCE DAILY CAI, NON-STATIN CHOLESTEROL REDUCING

MEDICINE USED ALONE OR CO-ADMINISTERED WITH ANY STATIN

DRUG, AND



EZETIMIBE AND SIMVASTATIN (MERCKS EXISTING ZOCOR STATIN

CHOLESTEROL MODIFYING MEDICINE) COMBINED INTO ONE TABLET

(MARKETED TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES AS VYTORIN AND AS INEGY IN

MOST OTHER COUNTRIES).

VYTORIN AND ZETIA WERE APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG

ADMINISTRATION IN JULY 2004 AND OCTOBER 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

TOGETHER, THESE PRODUCTS, WHETHER MARKETED AS VYTORIN, ZETIA OR

UNDER OTHER TRADEMARKS LOCALLY, ARE REFERRED TO AS THE

CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS.

UNDER THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, THE PARTNERS

ESTABLISHED JOINTLY-OWNED, LIMITED PURPOSE LEGAL ENTITIES BASED

IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO, AND THE UNITED STATES THROUGH WHICH TO

CARRY OUT THE CONTRACTUAL ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP IN THESE

COUNTRIES. AN ADDITIONAL JOINTLY-OWNED, LIMITED PURPOSE LEGAL

ENTITY BASED IN SINGAPORE WAS ESTABLISHED TO OWN THE RIGHTS TO

THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TO FUND AND OVERSEE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES OF THE CHOLESTEROL AND

RESPIRATORY COLLABORATIONS. IN ALL OTHER MARKETS EXCEPT LATIN

AMERICA, SUBSIDIARIES OF MERCK OR SCHERING-PLOUGH PERFORM

MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS UNDER CONTRACT

WITH THE PARTNERSHIP. THESE LEGAL ENTITY AND SUBSIDIARY

OPERATIONS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMBINED

COMPANIES. IN LATIN AMERICA, THE PARTNERSHIP SELLS

DIRECTLY TO SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MERCKS LATIN AMERICAN

SUBSIDIARIES AND SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MERCK COMPETE AGAINST ONE

ANOTHER IN THE CHOLESTEROL MARKET. CONSEQUENTLY, SELLING,

PROMOTION AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES FOR THE CHOLESTEROL

PRODUCTS WITHIN LATIN AMERICA ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMBINED

COMPANIES.

THE PARTNERSHIP IS SUBSTANTIALLY RELIANT ON THE INFRASTRUCTURES

OF MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH. THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGAL ENTITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND MOST

ACTIVITIES ARE PERFORMED BY EMPLOYEES OF EITHER MERCK OR

SCHERING-PLOUGH UNDER SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH THE PARTNERSHIP.

PROFITS, WHICH ARE SHARED BY THE PARTNERS UNDER DIFFERING

ARRANGEMENTS IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, ARE GENERALLY

DEFINED AS NET SALES MINUS (1) AGREED UPON MANUFACTURING

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE PARTNERS AND INVOICED TO THE

PARTNERSHIP, (2) DIRECT PROMOTION EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE

PARTNERS AND INVOICED TO THE PARTNERSHIP, (3) EXPENSES FOR

A LIMITED SPECIALTY SALES FORCE IN THE UNITED STATES INCURRED BY

THE PARTNERS AND INVOICED TO THE PARTNERSHIP, AND CERTAIN

CHOLESTEROL PRODUCT NET SALES, WHICH ARE INVOICED BY ONE OF THE

PARTNERS, AND (5) OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE

PARTNERS THAT WERE NOT CONTEMPLATED WHEN THE CHOLESTEROL

COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO BUT THAT WERE

SUBSEQUENTLY AGREED TO BY BOTH PARTNERS. AGREED UPON RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE PARTNERS AND INVOICED

TO THE PARTNERSHIP ARE SHARED EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER

ADJUSTING FOR SPECIAL ALLOCATIONS IN THE NATURE OF MILESTONES

DUE TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PARTNERSHIPS FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

POSITION, AND CASH FLOWS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE

HISTORICAL RESULTS PRESENTED HEREIN BECAUSE OF THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE PARTNERSHIPS BUSINESS. THE

PARTNERSHIPS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS ARE

DEPENDENT ON THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS. ANY EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE MARKET FOR THOSE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE PARTNERSHIPS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH

FLOWS. THESE EVENTS COULD INCLUDE LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION,

INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING, INCREASED

COMPETITION FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE

TREATMENTS, EXCLUSION FROM GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS,

DISCONTINUATION OR REMOVAL FROM THE MARKET OF A PRODUCT FOR

SAFETY OR OTHER REASON, AND THE RESULTS OF FUTURE CLINICAL OR

OUTCOMES STUDIES. (NOTE 5)

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED BALANCE SHEETS AND COMBINED STATEMENTS

OF NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES, CASH FLOWS AND

PARTNERS CAPITAL (DEFICIT) INCLUDE THE CHOLESTEROL AND

THE RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY PERTAIN TO

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT WORK AND PRE-LAUNCH MARKETING ACTIVITIES.

SPENDING ON RESPIRATORY-RELATED ACTIVITIES IS NOT MATERIAL TO

THE INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THE YEARS PRESENTED. IN

AUGUST 2007, THE PARTNERS ANNOUNCED THAT THE NEW DRUG

APPLICATION FILING FOR MONTELUKAST SODIUM/LORATADINE HAD BEEN

ACCEPTED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR

STANDARD REVIEW. THE PARTNERS ARE SEEKING U.S. MARKETING

SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WHO WANT RELIEF FROM NASAL CONGESTION.

NET SALES INCLUDE THE NET SALES OF THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS SOLD

BY THE COMBINED COMPANIES. EXPENSES INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT MERCK

AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO DIRECTLY

INVOICE TO THE PARTNERSHIP, OR ARE SHARED THROUGH THE

CONTRACTUAL PROFIT SHARING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, AS

DESCRIBED ABOVE.

THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED FOR

THE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN RULES AND REGULATIONS OF

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND REFLECT THE

ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL

AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTNERS. SUCH COMBINED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE ONLY THE EXPENSES AGREED BY THE PARTNERS TO

BE SHARED OR INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF PROFITS UNDER THE

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTNERSHIP, AND ARE NOT INTENDED

TO BE A COMPLETE PRESENTATION OF ALL OF THE COSTS AND EXPENSES

THAT WOULD BE INCURRED BY A STAND-ALONE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

FOR THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION AND

MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.

UNDER THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, CERTAIN

ACTIVITIES ARE CHARGED TO THE PARTNERSHIP BY THE PARTNERS BASED

ON CONTRACTUALLY AGREED UPON ALLOCATIONS OF PARTNER-INCURRED

EXPENSES AS DESCRIBED BELOW. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ANY

ALLOCATIONS OF EXPENSES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE MADE ON A BASIS THAT

REASONABLY REFLECTS THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF SUPPORT PROVIDED. ALL

OTHER EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES OF THE PARTNERS AND ACCORDINGLY, ARE

REFLECTED IN EACH PARTNERS RESPECTIVE EXPENSE LINE ITEMS

IN THEIR SEPARATE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PROFIT SHARING ARRANGEMENTS UNDER THE

CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT ONLY CERTAIN

PARTNER-INCURRED COSTS AND EXPENSES BE INVOICED TO THE

PARTNERSHIP BY THE PARTNERS AND THEREFORE BECOME PART OF THE

PROFIT SHARING CALCULATION. THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS LIST THE

TYPICAL CATEGORIES OF COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT ARE GENERALLY

INCURRED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE,

DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS AND

PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF HOW SUCH COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE TREATED

CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES, AND IN DETERMINING PROFITS UNDER THE

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS.

THEREFORE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED FINANCIAL

AND INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING

SUCH ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS AND

INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF PROVISIONS FOR SALES

DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS FOR WHICH RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE

IS SUBJECT TO AN INCOME TAX, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE COMBINED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SHARED BETWEEN THE PARTNERS. EXCEPT FOR

THESE STATE INCOME TAXES, WHICH ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE

COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, NO PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR

FEDERAL, FOREIGN OR STATE INCOME TAXES. IN JANUARY 2007, THE

PARTNERSHIP ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN

INCOME TAXES

IMPACT ON THE PARTNERSHIPS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PRIMARILY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

THREE CUSTOMERS EACH REPRESENTED 28%, 27% AND 15% OF

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET. THESE SAME THREE CUSTOMERS

ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 70% OF NET SALES IN 2007. BAD DEBTS FOR

THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 HAVE BEEN

MINIMAL. THE PARTNERSHIP DOES NOT NORMALLY REQUIRE COLLATERAL OR

OTHER SECURITY TO SUPPORT CREDIT SALES. IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, OF ITS COMBINED NET SALES FROM THE UNITED STATES.

LEGAL AND

OTHER MATTERS

THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BECOME PARTY TO CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE PARTNERSHIP RECORDS A

LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH

148

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUCH MATTERS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND AN AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM

GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS, A GENERIC COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT

HAD FILED AN ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION FOR A GENERIC FORM

OF ZETIA AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS THAT

ARE LISTED FOR ZETIA. SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE PARTNERSHIP INTEND

TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH THEY BELIEVE ARE VALID,

AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET

PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH

ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE OUTCOMES

WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED

PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY.

ON JANUARY 14, 2008, THE PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE TRIAL (EFFECT OF

COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN

ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA). ENHANCE WAS A

SURROGATE ENDPOINT TRIAL CONDUCTED IN 720 PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE CONDITION

THAT AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 0.2% OF THE POPULATION. THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT WAS THE MEAN CHANGE IN THE INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS

MEASURED AT THREE SITES IN THE CAROTID ARTERIES (THE RIGHT AND

LEFT COMMON CAROTID, INTERNAL CAROTID AND CAROTID BULB) BETWEEN

PATIENTS TREATED WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG VERSUS

PATIENTS TREATED WITH SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE OVER A TWO

YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT. THERE WAS ALSO

NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TREATMENT

GROUPS FOR EACH OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT,

INCLUDING THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. THE PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN

CLOSELY MONITORING SALES OF THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS FOLLOWING

RELEASE OF THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS. TO DATE,

2008 NET SALES OF THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN BELOW

THE PARTNERSHIPS PRIOR EXPECTATIONS.

DURING DECEMBER 2007 AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2008, MERCK

AND SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED JOINT LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE

COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON

OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS AND ONE LETTER FROM THE SENATE

FINANCE COMMITTEE COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS

INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES

RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS OF

MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH. ON JANUARY 25, 2008, MERCK,

SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE PARTNERSHIP EACH RECEIVED TWO SUBPOENAS

FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE SEEKING

SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS. MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH

HAVE ALSO EACH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE OFFICE OF THE

CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED FEBRUARY 1, 2008,

REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE MARKETING AND SALE OF THE

CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS AND THE TIMING OF DISCLOSURES OF THE

RESULTS OF ENHANCE. THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP ARE

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ARE WORKING TO RESPOND

TO THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, SINCE MID-JANUARY 2008, THE

PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP HAVE BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING

COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS. WHILE IT IS

NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS OR

LAWSUITS ARISING FROM THE ENHANCE TRIAL, UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES

COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

PARTNERSHIPS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

CASH FLOWS.

THE PARTNERSHIP MAINTAINS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH DEDUCTIBLES

AND SELF-INSURANCE AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS COST BENEFICIAL.

THE PARTNERSHIP SELF-INSURES ALL OF ITS RISK AS IT RELATES TO

PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ACCRUES AN ESTIMATE OF PRODUCT LIABILITY

CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED.

INDEPENDENT

AUDITORS REPORT

THE PARTNERS OF THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL PARTNERSHIP

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED BALANCE SHEETS OF THE

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL PARTNERSHIP (THE

PARTNERSHIP) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006,

AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, AND THE RELATED COMBINED STATEMENTS

OF NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES, PARTNERS CAPITAL

(DEFICIT) AND CASH FLOWS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, FOR EACH

OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP, MERCK & CO., INC., AND

SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

AUDITING STANDARDS AS ESTABLISHED BY THE AUDITING STANDARDS

BOARD (UNITED STATES) AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AUDITING

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. THE

PARTNERSHIP IS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE, NOR WERE WE ENGAGED TO

PERFORM, AN AUDIT OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. OUR AUDITS INCLUDED CONSIDERATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS A BASIS FOR DESIGNING AUDIT

PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT NOT

FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPRESSING AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

THE PARTNERSHIPS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPRESS NO SUCH OPINION. AN AUDIT

ALSO INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING

THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE OF

COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, ARE

NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS OF ALL THE

ACTIVITIES OF A STAND-ALONE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY INVOLVED IN

THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION AND

MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMBINED FINANCIAL

POSITION OF THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL PARTNERSHIP,

AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

2006, AND THE COMBINED RESULTS OF ITS NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL

EXPENSES AND ITS COMBINED CASH FLOWS, AS DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 1, FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2007, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
