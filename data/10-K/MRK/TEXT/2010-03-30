PRODUCT APPROVALS

IN JULY 2009, THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVED AN EXPANDED INDICATION

FOR

ISENTRESS

. THE BROADENED INDICATION NOW INCLUDES USE IN THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS

STARTING HIV-1 THERAPY FOR THE FIRST TIME (TREATMENT-NAÏVE), AS WELL AS IN TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED

ADULT PATIENTS.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FDA APPROVED

GARDASIL

FOR USE IN BOYS AND MEN 9 THROUGH 26 YEARS OF AGE

FOR THE PREVENTION OF GENITAL WARTS CAUSED BY HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) TYPES 6 AND 11, MAKING

GARDASIL

THE ONLY HPV VACCINE APPROVED FOR USE IN MALES.

GARDASIL

IS ALSO THE ONLY HPV VACCINE THAT

PROTECTS AGAINST HPV TYPES 6 AND 11 WHICH CAUSE APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF ALL GENITAL WARTS

CASES. IN ADDITION, ON OCTOBER 21, 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL

AND PREVENTIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES (ACIP) SUPPORTS THE PERMISSIVE USE

OF

GARDASIL

FOR BOYS AND YOUNG MEN AGES 9 TO 26, WHICH MEANS THAT

GARDASIL

MAY BE GIVEN TO MALES

AGES 9 TO 26 TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACQUIRING GENITAL WARTS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE PATIENTS

HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THE ACIP ALSO VOTED TO RECOMMEND THAT FUNDING BE PROVIDED FOR THE USE OF

GARDASIL

IN MALES THROUGH THE VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM.

DISTRIBUTION

MSD SELLS ITS HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND

RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. HUMAN HEALTH VACCINES

ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO PHYSICIANS, WHOLESALERS, PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

MSDS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF MSDS

PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP

PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE PURCHASED

WORLDWIDE AND ARE NORMALLY AVAILABLE IN QUANTITIES ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MSDS BUSINESS.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN MSDS

MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS. PATENTS

MAY COVER PRODUCTS

PER SE

, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, PROCESSES FOR OR INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN

THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE USES OF PRODUCTS. PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTENDS FOR

VARYING PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEGAL LIFE OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE

PROTECTION AFFORDED, WHICH MAY ALSO VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT

AND ITS SCOPE OF COVERAGE.

THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT INCLUDES A PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE AN

ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INDICATIONS OF NEW OR

CURRENTLY MARKETED DRUGS IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON PEDIATRIC

STUDIES ARE COMPLETED BY THE APPLICANT. THESE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS WERE RE-AUTHORIZED BY THE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE

WHILE THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT NORMALLY RESULTS IN A LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR THE COVERED PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, COMMERCIAL BENEFITS MAY CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED FROM.

(I) LATER-GRANTED PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES RELATED TO THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF

MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF SUCH PRODUCT; (II) PATENTS RELATING TO THE USE OF SUCH

PRODUCT; (III) PATENTS RELATING TO NOVEL COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS; AND (IV) IN THE UNITED

STATES AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES, MARKET EXCLUSIVITY THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER RELEVANT LAW.

THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRATION ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON MANY OTHER

FACTORS SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE MARKET AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT, THE GROWTH OF THE

MARKET, THE COMPLEXITIES AND ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF

THE PRODUCT AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF NEW DRUG PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT

OR SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

THE PATENTS THAT PROVIDE U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

EXPIRE IN APRIL 2010.

IN ADDITION, THE PATENT FOR

COZAAR

EXPIRED IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN MARCH 2010.

HYZAAR

LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN FEBRUARY 2010. MSD EXPECTS THAT SALES OF

THESE PRODUCTS WILL DECLINE RAPIDLY AFTER EXPIRATION OF THESE PATENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PATENT THAT

PROVIDES U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

SINGULAIR

EXPIRES IN AUGUST 2012. MSD EXPECTS THAT WITHIN THE

TWO YEARS FOLLOWING PATENT EXPIRATION, IT WILL LOSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. SALES OF

SINGULAIR

, WITH

MOST OF THOSE DECLINES COMING IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR FOLLOWING PATENT EXPIRATION. ALSO, THE PATENT

FOR

SINGULAIR

WILL EXPIRE IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN AUGUST 2012 AND MSD EXPECTS

SALES OF

SINGULAIR

IN THOSE MARKETS WILL DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY THEREAFTER.

ADDITIONS TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH

ALL RELEVANT LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS INCREASING PATENT LIFE. SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INCREASES IN

PATENT LIFE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GENERAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INCENTIVES FOR AND

USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS ARE SOUGHT IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH REFORM OF PATENT AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO MSDS PATENTS, SEE ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION BELOW.

WORLDWIDE, ALL OF MSDS IMPORTANT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD UNDER TRADEMARKS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN

THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES AS

LONG AS USED; IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS LONG AS REGISTERED. REGISTRATION IS FOR FIXED TERMS AND CAN BE

RENEWED INDEFINITELY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

MSDS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW USES FOR EXISTING

PRODUCTS THROUGH A STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

MSD MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY

AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. MSDS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS BY

PRIORITIZING MSDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES ON DISEASE AREAS OF UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS,

SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. MSD IS MANAGING ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PORTFOLIO ACROSS DIVERSE APPROACHES TO DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT BY BALANCING INVESTMENTS

APPROPRIATELY ON NOVEL, INNOVATIVE TARGETS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON HUMAN

HEALTH, ON DEVELOPING BEST-IN-CLASS APPROACHES, AND ON DELIVERING MAXIMUM VALUE OF ITS NEW

MEDICINES AND VACCINES THROUGH NEW INDICATIONS AND NEW FORMULATIONS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

MSDS SCIENCE-BASED DIVERSIFICATION IS BASED ON EXPANDING MSDS PORTFOLIO OF MODALITIES TO INCLUDE

NOT ONLY SMALL MOLECULES AND VACCINES, BUT ALSO BIOLOGICS, PEPTIDES AND RNAI. FURTHER, MSD MOVED TO

DIVERSIFY ITS PORTFOLIO BY CREATING A NEW DIVISION, MERCK BIOVENTURES, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

HARNESS THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY BIOLOGICAL MEDICINE PATENT EXPIRIES BY DELIVERING HIGH

QUALITY FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC PRODUCTS TO ENHANCE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS WORLDWIDE. MSD WILL CONTINUE TO

PURSUE APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES.

MSD CURRENTLY HAS ONE CANDIDATE UNDER REGULATORY REVIEW INTERNATIONALLY. ADDITIONALLY, MSD HAS

11 DRUG CANDIDATES IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT. THESE CANDIDATES DO NOT INCLUDE CANDIDATES IN PHASE

III BEING DEVELOPED BY OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF MSDS PARENT COMPANY IN WHICH MSD HAS NO OWNERSHIP

INTEREST.

MK-6621, VERNAKALANT (IV), IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL CANDIDATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ATRIAL

FIBRILLATION CURRENTLY UNDERGOING REGULATORY REVIEW IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). IN APRIL 2009,

MSD AND CARDIOME PHARMA CORP. ANNOUNCED A COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT

AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF VERNAKALANT WHICH PROVIDES MSD EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO TO THE INTRAVENOUS FORMULATION OF VERNAKALANT. VERNAKALANT (ORAL) IS

CURRENTLY IN PHASE II DEVELOPMENT. MSD HAS EXCLUSIVE GLOBAL RIGHTS TO THE ORAL FORMULATION OF

VERNAKALANT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF NORMAL HEART RHYTHM IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.

MK-8669, RIDAFOROLIMUS, IS A NOVEL MTOR (MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN) INHIBITOR BEING

EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. THE DRUG CANDIDATE IS BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED AND

COMMERCIALIZED WITH ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., UNDER AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN 2007. A

PHASE III STUDY (SUCCEED) IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC SOFT-TISSUE OR BONE SARCOMAS IS UNDERWAY. MSD

ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA FOR RIDAFOROLIMUS WITH THE FDA IN LATE 2010 OR IN 2011, SUBJECT TO A

REVIEW OF THE RESULTS FROM THE PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSIS OF SUCCEED.

MK-2452, TAFLUPROST, IS A PRESERVATIVE FREE, SYNTHETIC ANALOGUE OF THE PROSTAGLANDIN

F2

A

FOR THE REDUCTION OF ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN APPROPRIATE PATIENTS WITH

PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA AND OCULAR HYPERTENSION. IN APRIL 2009, MSD AND SANTEN PHARMACEUTICAL

CO., LTD. ANNOUNCED A WORLDWIDE LICENSING AGREEMENT FOR TAFLUPROST.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD SUBMITTED FOR FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA FOR MK-0653C, EZETIMIBE

COMBINED WITH ATORVASTATIN, WHICH IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF

DYSLIPIDEMIA, AND THE FDA REFUSED TO FILE THE APPLICATION. THE FDA HAS IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL

MANUFACTURING AND STABILITY DATA THAT ARE NEEDED AND MSD IS ASSESSING THE FDAS RESPONSE AND

ANTICIPATES FILING IN 2011.

MK-0431C, A CANDIDATE CURRENTLY IN PHASE III CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, COMBINES

JANUVIA

WITH

PIOGLITAZONE, ANOTHER TYPE 2 DIABETES THERAPY. MSD CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE FILING AN NDA FOR

MK-0431C WITH THE FDA IN 2011.

MK-0822, ODANACATIB, IS AN ORAL, ONCE-WEEKLY INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT FOR OSTEOPOROSIS.

OSTEOPOROSIS IS A DISEASE WHICH REDUCES BONE DENSITY AND STRENGTH AND RESULTS IN AN INCREASED RISK

OF BONE FRACTURES. ODANACATIB IS A CATHEPSIN K INHIBITOR THAT SELECTIVELY INHIBITS THE CATHEPSIN K

ENZYME. CATHEPSIN K IS KNOWN TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE FUNCTION OF OSTEOCLASTS, WHICH ARE CELLS

THAT BREAK DOWN EXISTING BONE TISSUE, PARTICULARLY THE PROTEIN COMPONENTS OF BONE. INHIBITION OF

CATHEPSIN K IS A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, DATA FROM A

PHASE IIB CLINICAL STUDY OF ODANACATIB WERE PRESENTED AT THE 31ST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN

SOCIETY FOR BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH WHICH SHOWED THAT WHEN STOPPING TREATMENT AFTER TWO YEARS THE

INCREASES IN LOWER BACK (LUMBAR SPINE) BONE MINERAL DENSITY

(BMD) WERE REVERSED OVER THE NEXT YEAR, WHILE BMD AT THE HIP (FEMORAL NECK) REMAINED ABOVE

LEVELS OBSERVED AT THE START OF THE STUDY. ADDITIONALLY, THREE YEARS OF TREATMENT WITH ODANACATIB

50 MG DEMONSTRATED INCREASES IN BMD AT KEY FRACTURE SITES AND MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE FORMATION OF

NEW BONE AS MEASURED BY BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS OF BONE TURNOVER. ODANACATIB IS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CURRENTLY IN PHASE III

CLINICAL TRIALS AND IS BEING EVALUATED IN A LARGE-SCALE, GLOBAL OUTCOMES STUDY TO DETERMINE ITS

EFFECTS ON VERTEBRAL, HIP AND NON-VERTEBRAL FRACTURES. MSD CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE FILING AN NDA

WITH THE FDA IN 2012.

V503 IS A NINE-VALENT HPV VACCINE IN DEVELOPMENT TO EXPAND PROTECTION AGAINST CANCER-CAUSING

HPV TYPES. THE PHASE III CLINICAL PROGRAM IS UNDERWAY AND MSD ANTICIPATES FILING A BLA WITH THE FDA

IN 2012.

MK-0524A IS A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES EXTENDED-RELEASE (ER) NIACIN AND A NOVEL FLUSHING

INHIBITOR, LAROPIPRANT. MK-0524A HAS DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO LOWER LDL-CHOLESTEROL (LDL-C OR

BAD CHOLESTEROL), RAISE HDL-CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C OR GOOD CHOLESTEROL) AND LOWER TRIGLYCERIDES

WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FLUSHING THAN TRADITIONAL EXTENDED RELEASE NIACIN ALONE. HIGH LDL-C, LOW

HDL-C AND ELEVATED TRIGLYCERIDES ARE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES. IN

APRIL 2008, MSD RECEIVED A NON-APPROVABLE ACTION LETTER FROM THE FDA IN RESPONSE TO ITS NDA FOR

MK-0524A. AT A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE LETTER, THE FDA STATED THAT ADDITIONAL EFFICACY AND SAFETY

DATA WERE REQUIRED AND SUGGESTED THAT MSD WAIT FOR THE RESULTS OF THE TREATMENT OF HDL TO REDUCE

THE INCIDENCE OF VASCULAR EVENTS (HPS2-THRIVE) CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES STUDY, WHICH IS EXPECTED

TO BE COMPLETED IN 2012. MSD ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA FOR MK-0524A IN 2012. MK-0524A

HAS BEEN APPROVED IN MORE THAN 45 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF

DYSLIPIDEMIA, PARTICULARLY IN PATIENTS WITH COMBINED MIXED DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHARACTERIZED BY ELEVATED

LEVELS OF LDL-C AND TRIGLYCERIDES AND LOW HDL-C) AND IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA

(HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL AND NON-FAMILIAL) AND IS MARKETED AS

TREDAPTIVE

(OR AS

CORDAPTIVE

IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES).

TREDAPTIVE

SHOULD BE USED IN PATIENTS IN COMBINATION WITH STATINS, WHEN THE CHOLESTEROL

LOWERING EFFECTS OF STATIN MONOTHERAPY IS INADEQUATE.

TREDAPTIVE

CAN BE USED AS MONOTHERAPY ONLY IN

PATIENTS IN WHOM STATINS ARE CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE OR NOT TOLERATED.

MK-0524B IS A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES THE NOVEL APPROACH TO RAISING HDL-C AND LOWERING

TRIGLYCERIDES FROM ER NIACIN COMBINED WITH LAROPIPRANT WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF SIMVASTATIN IN

ONE COMBINATION PRODUCT. MSD WILL NOT SEEK APPROVAL FOR MK-0524B IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL IT

FILES ITS COMPLETE RESPONSE TO THE FDA RELATING TO MK-0524A.

MK-0859, ANACETRAPIB, IS AN INHIBITOR OF THE CHOLESTERYL ESTER TRANSFER PROTEIN (CETP) THAT

HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN LIPID MANAGEMENT BY RAISING HDL-C AND REDUCING LDL-C WITHOUT RAISING BLOOD

PRESSURE. IN NOVEMBER 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED THAT IN A PHASE IIB STUDY IN 589 PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA OR MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA TREATED WITH ANACETRAPIB AS MONOTHERAPY OR

CO-ADMINISTERED WITH ATORVASTATIN, THERE WERE PERSISTENT LIPID EFFECTS IN THE HIGHER DOSE ARMS IN

BOTH THE MONOTHERAPY AND CO-ADMINISTRATION TREATMENT GROUPS EIGHT WEEKS AFTER STOPPING ACTIVE

THERAPY WITH ANACETRAPIB. THE EFFECT OF CETP INHIBITION ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK HAS YET TO BE

ESTABLISHED. A PHASE III TRIAL, TITLED DEFINE, IS ONGOING TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND

EFFICACY OF ANACETRAPIB IN PATIENTS WITH CORONARY HEART DISEASE. MSD ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH

THE FDA BEYOND 2015.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED IT WAS DELAYING THE FILING OF THE

U.S. APPLICATION FOR TELCAGEPANT (MK-0974), MSDS INVESTIGATIONAL CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE

RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST FOR THE INTERMITTENT TREATMENT OF ACUTE MIGRAINE. THE DECISION WAS BASED ON

FINDINGS FROM A PHASE IIA EXPLORATORY STUDY IN WHICH A SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS TAKING TELCAGEPANT

TWICE DAILY FOR THREE MONTHS FOR THE PREVENTION OF MIGRAINE WERE FOUND TO HAVE MARKED ELEVATIONS IN

LIVER TRANSAMINASES. THE DAILY DOSING REGIMEN IN THE PREVENTION STUDY WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE DOSING

REGIMEN USED IN PHASE III STUDIES IN WHICH TELCAGEPANT WAS INTERMITTENTLY ADMINISTERED IN ONE OR

TWO DOSES TO TREAT INDIVIDUAL MIGRAINE ATTACKS AS THEY OCCURRED. OTHER STUDIES WITH TELCAGEPANT FOR

THE ACUTE, INTERMITTENT TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE CONTINUE. FOLLOWING MEETINGS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES

AT THE END OF 2009, MSD IS PLANNING TO CONDUCT AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY STUDY AS PART OF THE OVERALL

PHASE III PROGRAM FOR TELCAGEPANT. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL INFORM PLANNED FILINGS FOR

APPROVAL.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN 2007, CUBIST PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (CUBIST) ENTERED INTO A

LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH MSD FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF CUBICIN (DAPTOMYCIN FOR

INJECTION, MK-3009) IN JAPAN. MSD WILL DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE CUBICIN THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY, BANYU PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. CUBIST COMMERCIALIZES CUBICIN IN THE UNITED STATES.

MK-3009 IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT.

MK-4305 IS AN OREXIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, A POTENTIAL NEW APPROACH TO THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC

INSOMNIA, CURRENTLY IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED THAT PRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR THE PIVOTAL

PHASE III STUDY OF ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418), ITS INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE

HEART FAILURE, SHOWED THAT ROLOFYLLINE DID NOT MEET THE PRIMARY OR SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS.

MSD TERMINATED THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR ROLOFYLLINE.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

INVESTORS IN MSDS DEBT SECURITIES SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF THE INFORMATION SET FORTH

IN THIS FORM 10-K, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN ANY OF MSDS

DEBT SECURITIES. THE RISKS BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES MSD FACES. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT CURRENTLY

KNOWN TO MSD OR THAT MSD PRESENTLY DEEMS IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. MSDS

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. THIS FORM 10-K ALSO CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT

INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MSDS RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISKS IT FACES AS

DESCRIBED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE. SEE CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS BELOW.

CERTAIN OF MSDS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND,

WHEN THAT OCCURS, MSD EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

MSD DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FOR

SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF MSDS PRODUCTS HAVE RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE

ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, MSD FACES STRONG COMPETITION FROM

LOWER PRICED GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF MSDS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO

A RAPID LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED GENERIC VERSIONS OF THAT DRUG BECOME

AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO MSDS SALES, THE LOSS OF PATENT

PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS. THE PATENTS THAT PROVIDE U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

EXPIRE IN APRIL 2010. IN ADDITION, THE PATENT FOR

COZAAR

EXPIRED IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR

EUROPEAN MARKETS IN MARCH 2010.

HYZAAR

LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

FEBRUARY 2010. MSD EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS AFTER SUCH TIMES. IN

ADDITION, THE PATENT THAT PROVIDES U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

SINGULAIR

EXPIRES IN AUGUST 2012.

MSD EXPECTS THAT WITHIN THE TWO YEARS FOLLOWING PATENT EXPIRATION, IT WILL LOSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

U.S. SALES OF

SINGULAIR

, WITH MOST OF THOSE DECLINES COMING IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR FOLLOWING PATENT

EXPIRATION. ALSO, THE PATENT FOR

SINGULAIR

WILL EXPIRE IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

AUGUST 2012 AND MSD EXPECTS SALES OF

SINGULAIR

IN THOSE MARKETS WILL DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY

THEREAFTER.

A CHART LISTING THE U.S. PATENT PROTECTION FOR MSDS MAJOR MARKETED PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH

ABOVE IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS  PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES.

KEY MSD PRODUCTS GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MSDS PROFITS AND CASH FLOWS, AND ANY EVENTS

THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKETS FOR ITS LEADING PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

MSDS ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS AND OPERATING CASH FLOW DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE CONTINUED

PROFITABILITY OF MSDS KEY PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

SINGULAIR

,

VYTORIN, ZETIA, JANUVIA,

AND

GARDASIL

. AS A

RESULT OF MSDS DEPENDENCE ON KEY PRODUCTS, ANY EVENT THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS

OR THE MARKETS FOR ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND CASH FLOWS. THESE EVENTS COULD INCLUDE LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH MANUFACTURING, GENERIC OR OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) AVAILABILITY OF MSDS PRODUCT OR A

COMPETITIVE PRODUCT, THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS, INCREASED COMPETITION FROM

THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND DISCONTINUATION OR REMOVAL FROM THE MARKET

OF THE PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON.

MSDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCTS AND MSD MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS; IN

CONSEQUENCE, MSD MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST PATENT

PROTECTION.

IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, MSD MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS EACH YEAR. DECLINES

IN SALES OF PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

FOSAMAX, COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR,

AFTER THE LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY MEAN

THAT MSDS FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NEW PRODUCTS

WHICH IT MAY DEVELOP THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH LICENSE

OR ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, MSD COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES AND THROUGH VARIOUS

COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. THERE IS A HIGH RATE OF FAILURE INHERENT IN THE RESEARCH TO

DEVELOP NEW DRUGS TO TREAT DISEASES. AS A RESULT, THERE IS A HIGH RISK THAT FUNDS INVESTED BY MSD

IN RESEARCH PROGRAMS WILL NOT GENERATE FINANCIAL RETURNS. THIS RISK PROFILE IS COMPOUNDED BY THE

FACT THAT THIS RESEARCH HAS A LONG INVESTMENT CYCLE. TO BRING A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUND FROM THE

DISCOVERY PHASE TO MARKET MAY TAKE A DECADE OR MORE AND FAILURE CAN OCCUR AT ANY POINT IN THE

PROCESS, INCLUDING LATER IN THE PROCESS AFTER SIGNIFICANT FUNDS HAVE BEEN INVESTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EACH PHASE OF TESTING IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK

THAT MSD WILL ENCOUNTER SERIOUS OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY MSD MAY

ABANDON A PRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND RESOURCES. SOME OF THE

RISKS ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL

TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND MAY YIELD DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ITS INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A NEW DRUG;

OR SALES OF A NEW PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

MSD CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL

BE APPROVED OR LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE

COMPOUNDS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE LAUNCHED, WILL BE

COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. MSD MUST MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND

SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER ITS

SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS PROFITABLE

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

FOSAMAX, COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR,

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING

PRODUCTS OR THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

MSDS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF NEW PRODUCTS, WHICH

ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS.

PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR PROMISING IN DEVELOPMENT MAY FAIL TO REACH MARKET FOR NUMEROUS REASONS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



FINDINGS OF INEFFECTIVENESS, SUPERIOR SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF COMPETING PRODUCTS, OR

HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS IN CLINICAL OR PRE-CLINICAL TESTING;



FAILURE TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, INCLUDING DELAYS IN THE

APPROVAL OF NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW INDICATIONS, AND INCREASING UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE TIME

REQUIRED TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS AND THE BENEFIT/RISK STANDARDS APPLIED BY

REGULATORY AGENCIES IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO GRANT APPROVALS;



LACK OF ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY DUE TO MANUFACTURING COSTS OR OTHER FACTORS; AND



PRECLUSION FROM COMMERCIALIZATION BY THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MSDS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS MSD OBTAINS AND

MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

MSDS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING

AND MARKETING ITS PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA IS OF PARTICULAR

IMPORTANCE TO MSD, AS IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY,

EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY

CASES, THE FDA REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW

PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO

IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE FDA

AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, TO

DELAY OR WITHHOLD REGISTRATION AND MARKETING APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF MSD IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY OF

THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE OBTAINED, MSD MUST MAINTAIN

APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE APPROVAL IS

REQUIRED. MSDS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL, SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, OR ITS

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM SELLING THE NEW PRODUCTS IN

THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS OBTAINED, IF EVER. MSD WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE REVENUES

FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR

CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN MSDS

MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS. PATENTS

COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT

FOR THE SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. MSD SEEKS PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS

PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND WHERE MEANINGFUL PATENT

PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF MSD SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES OR GOVERNMENT

AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS.

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR MSDS BUSINESS TO DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS. MSD IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO

ITS PATENTS OR INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST MSD. MSD AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS ITS IMPORTANT

PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT

AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION BELOW. IN PARTICULAR,

MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG

APPLICATIONS (ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF MSDS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY MSD. MSD NORMALLY RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS

PATENT, INCLUDING BY FILING LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT LITIGATION AND OTHER

CHALLENGES TO MSDS PATENTS ARE COSTLY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE MSD OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES, THIRD PARTY PATENTS MAY PREVENT MSD FROM MARKETING AND

SELLING A PRODUCT IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS HAVE INDICATED THAT COMPULSORY LICENSES TO PATENTS

MAY BE GRANTED IN THE CASE OF NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, WHICH COULD DIMINISH OR ELIMINATE SALES AND

PROFITS FROM THOSE REGIONS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT MSDS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FURTHER, RECENT COURT

DECISIONS RELATING TO OTHER COMPANIES U.S. PATENTS, POTENTIAL U.S. LEGISLATION RELATING TO PATENT

REFORM, AS WELL AS REGULATORY INITIATIVES MAY RESULT IN FURTHER EROSION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

BECOMING AVAILABLE AND, IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SUCH A LOSS COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE. MSDS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST SALES UNLESS AND UNTIL

MSD HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

MSDS HYPERTENSION PRODUCTS

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

WILL EACH LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE

UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2010. IN ADDITION, THE PATENT FOR

COZAAR

EXPIRED IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR

EUROPEAN MARKETS IN MARCH 2010.

HYZAAR

LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

FEBRUARY 2010. MSD EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS AFTER SUCH TIMES. IN

ADDITION, THE PATENT THAT PROVIDES U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

SINGULAIR

EXPIRES IN AUGUST 2012.

MSD EXPECTS THAT WITHIN THE TWO YEARS FOLLOWING PATENT EXPIRATION, IT WILL LOSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

U.S. SALES OF

SINGULAIR

, WITH MOST OF THOSE DECLINES COMING IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR FOLLOWING PATENT

EXPIRATION. ALSO, THE PATENT FOR

SINGULAIR

WILL EXPIRE IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

AUGUST 2012 AND MSD EXPECTS SALES OF

SINGULAIR

IN THOSE MARKETS WILL DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY

THEREAFTER.

MSD FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, MSD FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE PATENT

RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN SOME

COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE

UNITED STATES, POLITICAL PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO LEGISLATION

WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS MSDS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS

PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO MSDS PRODUCTS CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE

TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES,

REDUCING MSDS SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR MSDS DRUGS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION, PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM TIME

TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR LEGISLATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND

RAPID APPROVAL OF GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED INTO LAW COULD WORSEN THIS

SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MSDS SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

MSDS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION MAY

INCREASE AS NEW PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE SAFER

OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN MSDS PRODUCTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE

CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION, THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD AT A

SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN MSDS PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, IF MSD FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS

COMPETITIVE POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

MSD FACES PRICING PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS.

MSD FACES INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE GLOBALLY FROM MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS, INSTITUTIONS

AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT MSDS SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THESE INCLUDE (I) PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND

GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASERS AND (II) U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MEDICARE AND

MEDICAID, INCLUDING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE

2003 ACT). THE 2003 ACT INCLUDED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT FIRST WENT INTO

EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD RESULT IN FURTHER PRICING PRESSURES.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, NUMEROUS MAJOR MARKETS HAVE PERVASIVE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN

FUNDING HEALTHCARE AND, IN THAT REGARD, FIX THE PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND

VACCINE PRODUCTS. CONSEQUENTLY, IN THOSE MARKETS, MSD IS SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING AND

BUDGETARY ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS.

MSD EXPECTS PRICING PRESSURES TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATION AND POLITICAL

ACTION.

MSD BELIEVES THAT THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATION

AS WELL AS POLITICAL AND LEGAL ACTION, AS HEALTH CARE REFORM

IS IMPLEMENTED AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS.

SOME OF THE

PROVISIONS THAT WERE PASSED IN FEDERAL

HEALTH CARE REFORM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT MSDS SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

THE PROVISIONS WILL CREATE GREATER COST CONTROL PRESSURE ON THE U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WHICH COULD LEAD TO GREATER PRESSURE

ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT. THE NEW LAW WILL ALSO INCREASE REBATES AND DISCOUNTS ON

SALES RELATED TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL MEDICAID PROGRAM AND THE MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM, AS WELL AS REQUIRE PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS TO PAY A HEALTH CARE REFORM FEE.

IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL STATES HAVE ENACTED OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT RESTRICT CERTAIN SALES AND MARKETING

ACTIVITIES AND/OR REQUIRE TRACKING AND DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO

HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. SUCH REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT MSDS SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH CARE REFORM OR OTHER RELATED LEGISLATIVE

INITIATIVES MAY FURTHER INCREASE GOVERNMENT

REGULATION OR OTHER GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN HEALTH CARE, LOWER REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND

OTHERWISE CHANGE THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR HEALTH CARE COMPANIES. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO MSDS CURRENT OR FUTURE PRODUCTS, OR THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING REGULATIONS,

MIGHT CHANGE AND THEREBY PREVENT MSD FROM MARKETING SOME OR ALL OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME OR INDEFINITELY.

MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ALL FUTURE CHANGES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL,

OR THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR, OR WHAT IMPACT THEY MAY HAVE ON MSDS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR BUSINESS.

MSD IS EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS IN THE MANUFACTURING OF CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAS, IN THE PAST, EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN MANUFACTURING

CERTAIN OF ITS VACCINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS. THESE ISSUES ARE CONTINUING, IN PARTICULAR, WITH

RESPECT TO THE MANUFACTURE OF BULK VARICELLA WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PRODUCTION OF MSDS VARICELLA

ZOSTER VIRUS-CONTAINING VACCINES, SUCH AS

VARIVAX, PROQUAD

AND

ZOSTAVAX

. MSD IS WORKING ON THESE

ISSUES, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF WHEN OR IF THESE ISSUES WILL BE FINALLY RESOLVED.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MSD IS EXPERIENCING CURRENTLY, MSD MAY EXPERIENCE

DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS INHERENT IN MANUFACTURING ITS PRODUCTS, SUCH AS (I) FAILURE OF MSD OR ANY

OF ITS VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT GOOD

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANUFACTURING PRACTICES AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE GUIDELINES THAT

COULD LEAD TO MANUFACTURING SHUTDOWNS, PRODUCT SHORTAGES AND DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING;

(II) CONSTRUCTION DELAYS RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES OR THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING

FACILITIES, INCLUDING THOSE INTENDED TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND FOR MSDS PRODUCTS; AND (III) OTHER

MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS INCLUDING CHANGES IN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION SITES AND

LIMITS TO MANUFACTURING CAPACITY DUE TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN TYPES OF PRODUCTS

PRODUCED, OR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS THAT COULD IMPACT CONTINUOUS SUPPLY. MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES

CAN RESULT IN PRODUCT SHORTAGES, LEADING TO LOST SALES.

MSD FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MSD VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN

MEDICATION, FROM THE MARKET WORLDWIDE. ALTHOUGH MSD HAS SETTLED THE MAJOR PORTION OF THE

U.S. PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, MSD STILL FACES MATERIAL LITIGATION ARISING FROM THE VOLUNTARY

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND

INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST MSD AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND

DIRECTORS OF MSD ALLEGING THAT MSD MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN

VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION REVERSING JUDGE CHESLERS ORDER AND REMANDING THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT. MSD FILED A

PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS GRANTED. ORAL

ARGUMENT WAS HELD IN THE SUPREME COURT ON NOVEMBER 30, 2009 AND A DECISION IS EXPECTED IN THE FIRST

HALF OF 2010. WHILE MSDS PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WAS PENDING, PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR CONSOLIDATED

AND FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT IN THE DISTRICT COURT. ON MAY 1, 2009, DEFENDANTS MOVED TO

DISMISS THE FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; THAT MOTION HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN WITHOUT PREJUDICE

TO REFILE IT PENDING THE OUTCOME IN THE SUPREME COURT. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST MSD AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS OF

MSD ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA. (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS

AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, THE 

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.) MSD HAS ALSO

BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS.) MSD HAS ALSO BEEN SUED BY TEN STATES, FIVE

COUNTIES AND NEW YORK CITY WITH RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) HAS ISSUED SUBPOENAS REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATING TO

MSDS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE

INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES SUBPOENAS FOR WITNESSES TO

APPEAR BEFORE A GRAND JURY. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE.

MSD IS COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. (ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.) MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL REMEDIES.

THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION IS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BELOW. A TRIAL IN A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CONCLUDED ON JUNE 25, 2009, IN THE FEDERAL

COURT OF AUSTRALIA. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO ALLEGED HE SUFFERED AN MI, SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHERS

IN AUSTRALIA WHO INGESTED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED AN MI, THROMBOTIC STROKE, UNSTABLE ANGINA, TRANSIENT

ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. ON MARCH 5, 2010, THE TRIAL JUDGE DELIVERED HIS

JUDGMENT. THE COURT DECIDED TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS AGAINST MSD, SPECIFICALLY FINDING THAT MSD HAD

DONE EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED OF IT IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS DUTY OF CARE. WITH

REGARD TO MSDS AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARY, MERCK SHARP & DOHME (AUSTRALIA) PTY. LTD., THE COURT DECIDED

TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS BUT TO AWARD THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO THE COURT FOUND SUFFERED A

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AFTER INGESTING

VIOXX

FOR APPROXIMATELY 33 MONTHS, COMPENSATION BASED

ON STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT

VIOXX

WAS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, EVEN THOUGH THE

COURT REJECTED THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT MSD KNEW OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN PRIOR TO THE VOLUNTARY

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

IN SEPTEMBER 2004 THAT

VIOXX

MATERIALLY INCREASED THE RISK OF MI. ON MAY 7,

2010, THE COURT WILL CONDUCT A HEARING TO DETERMINE THE ORDERS TO BE ENTERED GIVING EFFECT TO THE

JUDGMENT, IN WHICH THE COURT WILL DETERMINE WHICH OF ITS FINDINGS OF FACT AND LAW ARE COMMON TO THE

CLAIMS OF OTHER GROUP MEMBERS AND WILL CONSIDER ANY OTHER MOTIONS THAT MIGHT BE BROUGHT. MSDS

SUBSIDIARY INTENDS TO APPEAL THE ADVERSE FINDINGS AFTER THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN ENTERED.

MSD CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN

2010. MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. MSD

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. MSDS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS

WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2009, MSD SPENT APPROXIMATELY $244 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS, AND (II) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN 2009, $75 MILLION OF CHARGES WERE RECORDED, INCLUDING $35 MILLION IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER, TO ADD TO THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION WHICH WAS $279 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND $110 MILLION (THE 

VIOXX

RESERVE)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED

BELOW UNDER ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT MSD

BELIEVES WILL BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION,

HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD ARISE

IN THE COURSE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE

INCURRED BY MSD.

MSD IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN

CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE FOR YEARS AND MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE COURSE THE PROCEEDINGS WILL TAKE. IN VIEW OF THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY

CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, MSD IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE

MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH

RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. OTHER THAN A RESERVE

ESTABLISHED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS DISCUSSED BELOW

UNDER ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, MSD HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY

RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING

IN THE PAYMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES, COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

ISSUES CONCERNING

VYTORIN

AND THE ENHANCE AND SEAS CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

IN THE UNITED STATES AND RESULTS FROM ONGOING TRIALS COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON SUCH SALES.

THE MSP PARTNERSHIP SELLS

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2008, MSD AND

MSDS PARENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE

SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS

FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (ENHANCE) CLINICAL TRIAL, AN IMAGING TRIAL IN 720 PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES VERY HIGH LEVELS

OF LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL AND GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK FOR PREMATURE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG (

VYTORIN

) SIGNIFICANTLY

LOWERED LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE PRE-SPECIFIED

PRIMARY ENDPOINT, A CHANGE IN THE THICKNESS OF CAROTID ARTERY WALLS OVER TWO YEARS AS MEASURED BY

ULTRASOUND. THE IMPROVED REDUCTION IN HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS PRESENTING WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME

(IMPROVE-IT) TRIAL IS UNDERWAY AND IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES DATA FOR

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME. NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN ON CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT DEMONSTRATED

FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN JANUARY 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS

REVIEW OF THE FINAL CLINICAL STUDY REPORT OF ENHANCE. THE FDA STATED THAT THE RESULTS FROM ENHANCE

DID NOT CHANGE ITS POSITION THAT ELEVATED LDL CHOLESTEROL IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE AND THAT LOWERING LDL CHOLESTEROL REDUCES THE RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. FOR A

DISCUSSION CONCERNING LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF THE ENHANCE STUDY, SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BELOW.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD (AS WELL AS MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON

OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS (O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A

VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL

AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, MSD (AS WELL AS  MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED THREE

ADDITIONAL LETTERS EACH  FROM O&I, SEEKING CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SIMVASTATIN

AND EZETIMIBE IN AORTIC STENOSIS (SEAS) CLINICAL TRIAL, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD  RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS  OFFICE AND A LETTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND

DOCUMENTS. FINALLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE  COMPANIES RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CIVIL

DIVISION OF THE DOJ INFORMING IT THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANIES CONDUCT

RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS. AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, A NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS ARISING OUT OF THE ENHANCE STUDY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

AGAINST MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH.

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN JULY 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE SEAS STUDY WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS

DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INTENSIVE LIPID LOWERING WITH

VYTORIN

10/40 MG WOULD REDUCE THE NEED

FOR AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO

IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO HAD NO INDICATION FOR STATIN

THERAPY.

VYTORIN

FAILED TO MEET ITS PRIMARY ENDPOINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR

EVENTS. IN THE STUDY, PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

10/40 MG HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF

CANCER THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO. THERE WAS ALSO A NONSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM

CANCER IN PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

VERSUS THOSE WHO TOOK PLACEBO. CANCER AND CANCER

DEATHS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL MAJOR ORGAN SYSTEMS. MSD BELIEVES THE CANCER FINDING IN SEAS IS

LIKELY TO BE AN ANOMALY THAT, TAKEN IN LIGHT OF ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, DOES NOT SUPPORT AN

ASSOCIATION WITH

VYTORIN

. IN AUGUST 2008, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING THE RESULTS

FROM THE SEAS TRIAL. IN DECEMBER 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE

DATA FROM THE SEAS TRIAL AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF INTERIM DATA FROM THE STUDY OF HEART AND RENAL

PROTECTION (SHARP) AND IMPROVE-IT TRIALS. BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE FDA

INDICATED IT BELIEVED IT IS UNLIKELY THAT

VYTORIN

OR

ZETIA

INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER-RELATED

DEATH. THE SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010. THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR

COMPLETION IN 2013. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010. NEGATIVE

RESULTS FROM THE SHARP TRIAL COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE ENHANCE AND SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS, SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

DECLINED IN 2008 AND 2009 IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE ISSUES CONCERNING THE ENHANCE AND

SEAS CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND COULD CONTINUE TO

HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SUCH SALES. IF SALES OF SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED,

MSDS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS COULD ALSO BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE LITIGATION

CONCERNING THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS

BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CAN DEVELOP UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR EFFICACY CONCERNS.

UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR EFFICACY CONCERNS CAN ARISE WITH RESPECT TO MARKETED PRODUCTS, WHETHER OR

NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED, LEADING TO PRODUCT RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS, OR DECLINING SALES, AS WELL

AS PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER FRAUD AND/OR OTHER CLAIMS.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT MSDS BUSINESS.

ALL ASPECTS OF MSDS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING,

PRICING, SALES, LITIGATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION

AND REGULATION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND AGENCY REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS.

RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS AND OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

MSDS BUSINESS.

MSD DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SUPPLIERS, ALLIANCES WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, AND THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, FOR KEY ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS

INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT FOR ITS

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. FAILURE OF THESE THIRD PARTIES TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL,

REGULATORY AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO MSD OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY DISRUPT THE

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MSD AND THESE THIRD PARTIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS

BUSINESS.

MSD IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

MSD IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. ANY

SIGNIFICANT BREAKDOWN, INTRUSION, INTERRUPTION OR CORRUPTION OF THESE SYSTEMS OR DATA BREACHES

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, MSD CURRENTLY IS PROCEEDING WITH

A MULTI-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE WIDE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM, WHICH INCLUDES

MODIFICATION TO THE DESIGN, OPERATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, AND INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT THE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2010. ANY

MATERIAL PROBLEMS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF MSDS PRODUCTS.

EVEN AFTER A PRODUCT REACHES MARKET, CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL,

INCLUDING RESULTS IN POST-MARKETING PHASE IV TRIALS, MAY DECREASE DEMAND FOR MSDS PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



THE RE-REVIEW OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALREADY MARKETED;



NEW SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF SCIENTIFIC THEORIES;



THE RECALL OR LOSS OF MARKETING APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALREADY MARKETED;



CHANGING GOVERNMENT STANDARDS OR PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS REGARDING SAFETY, EFFICACY OR

LABELING CHANGES; AND



GREATER SCRUTINY IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, CLINICAL TRIALS AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF CERTAIN MARKETED

DRUGS OF MSD AND OF COMPETITORS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY HAVE RAISED SAFETY CONCERNS THAT HAVE LED TO

RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS OR ADVERSE LABELING OF MARKETED PRODUCTS. CLINICAL TRIALS AND

POST-MARKETING

SURVEILLANCE OF CERTAIN MARKETED DRUGS ALSO HAVE RAISED CONCERNS AMONG SOME PRESCRIBERS AND

PATIENTS RELATING TO THE SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN GENERAL THAT HAVE

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE SALES OF SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, INCREASED SCRUTINY OF THE OUTCOMES OF

CLINICAL TRIALS HAS LED TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN MARKET REACTION. FURTHER, THESE MATTERS OFTEN

ATTRACT LITIGATION AND, EVEN WHERE THE BASIS FOR THE LITIGATION IS GROUNDLESS, CONSIDERABLE

RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED TO RESPOND.

IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING THE WAKE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES,

HEALTH AUTHORITIES SUCH AS THE FDA, THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND

MEDICAL DEVICE AGENCY HAVE INCREASED THEIR FOCUS ON SAFETY WHEN ASSESSING THE BENEFIT/RISK BALANCE

OF DRUGS. SOME HEALTH AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO HAVE BECOME MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT

APPROVABILITY OF NEW PRODUCTS OR INDICATIONS AND ARE RE-REVIEWING SELECT PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALREADY

MARKETED, ADDING FURTHER TO THE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE REGULATORY PROCESSES. THERE IS ALSO GREATER

REGULATORY SCRUTINY, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION AND, IN

PARTICULAR, DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING.

IF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS ARE DISCOVERED OR IF THERE IS AN INCREASE IN NEGATIVE

PUBLICITY REGARDING KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS OF ANY OF MSDS PRODUCTS, IT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE

DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT OR REQUIRE MSD TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT SALES, INCLUDING

REMOVING THE PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET, RESTRICTING ITS DISTRIBUTION OR APPLYING FOR LABELING

CHANGES. FURTHER, IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ALL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OPERATE, MSD IS

AT RISK FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

MSD IS SUBJECT TO EVOLVING AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES

THAT MAY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MSD IS SUBJECT TO EVOLVING AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED FOR DETERMINING MSDS TAX LIABILITIES, AND MSDS TAX RETURNS ARE

PERIODICALLY EXAMINED BY VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES. MSD BELIEVES THAT ITS ACCRUAL FOR TAX

CONTINGENCIES IS ADEQUATE FOR ALL OPEN YEARS BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE, INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAW,

AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY TAX AUTHORITIES; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF TAX

CONTINGENCIES, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF ANY TAX MATTERS MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS GREATER OR LESS

THAN AMOUNTS ACCRUED.

IN FEBRUARY 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMAS ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE

U.S. INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT WOULD LIMIT U.S. TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR EXPENSES

RELATED TO UN-REPATRIATED FOREIGN-SOURCE INCOME AND MODIFY THE U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RULES. WE

CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER THESE PROPOSALS WILL BE ENACTED INTO LAW OR WHAT, IF ANY, CHANGES MAY BE

MADE TO SUCH PROPOSALS PRIOR TO THEIR BEING ENACTED INTO LAW. IF THESE OR OTHER CHANGES TO THE

U.S. INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS ARE ENACTED, THEY COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL

RESULTS OF MSD.

IN ADDITION, MSD MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING TAX RATE CHANGES, CHANGES

TO THE LAWS RELATED TO THE REMITTANCE OF FOREIGN EARNINGS (DEFERRAL), OR OTHER LIMITATIONS

IMPACTING THE U.S. TAX TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, NEW TAX LAWS, AND REVISED TAX LAW

INTERPRETATIONS IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.

MSDS DEBT OBLIGATIONS INCURRED TO FINANCE THE MERGER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS.

WHILE MSDS FINANCING STRATEGY FOR THE MERGER WAS FOCUSED ON PRESERVING FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND

FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MSDS BUSINESS AND KEY GROWTH DRIVERS POST-MERGER, DEBT

OBLIGATIONS INCURRED TO FINANCE THE MERGER COULD AFFECT MSDS FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR

REACTING TO, CHANGES IN ITS BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES, THEREBY PLACING IT AT A

COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO COMPETITORS THAT HAVE LESS INDEBTEDNESS. FURTHER, IF MSD

DECIDES TO RETIRE OR PAY DOWN INDEBTEDNESS EARLY IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO DO SO, THEREBY REDUCING THE AVAILABILITY OF ITS CASH

FLOW FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR PRODUCTS MAY BE LIMITED, COST PROHIBITIVE OR UNAVAILABLE.

AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE HAS BECOME LESS AVAILABLE

WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY, MSD SELF-INSURES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RISK, AS THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HAS BECOME MORE

RESTRICTIVE. MSD HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF OBTAINING PRODUCT

LIABILITY INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS AVAILABLE AND, AS SUCH,

HAS NO INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR

MSD PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD AFTER THAT DATE. MSD WILL CONTINUALLY ASSESS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS TO

ADDRESS ITS RISK; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL BE OBTAINED OR,

IF OBTAINED, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY COVER PRODUCT LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THE ANNUAL REPORT, AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY MSD MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN IDENTIFY THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS, WILL, ESTIMATES,

FORECASTS, PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT

THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO

ADDRESS MSDS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT

POTENTIAL, AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH STATEMENT AND SHOULD

UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM MSDS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF

OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE NOT. NO

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY. MSD DOES

NOT ASSUME THE OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. MSD CAUTIONS YOU NOT TO PLACE

UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR

IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AS MSDS PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION.



INCREASED BRAND COMPETITION IN THERAPEUTIC AREAS IMPORTANT TO MSDS LONG-TERM BUSINESS

PERFORMANCE.



THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE

LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A DRUG

CANDIDATE CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE LATE-STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES

COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING IN

DEVELOPMENT BUT FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS, THE INABILITY

TO OBTAIN NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE

AND/OR THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE

SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.



PRICING PRESSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, INCLUDING RULES AND PRACTICES OF

MANAGED CARE GROUPS, JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

DISTRICT JUDGE ELDON E. FALLON. A NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS FILED IN STATE COURT ARE COORDINATED IN

SEPARATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS IN STATE COURTS IN NEW JERSEY, CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, AND THE

COUNTIES OF PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA AND WASHOE AND CLARK COUNTIES, NEVADA. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, MSD HAD BEEN SERVED OR WAS AWARE THAT IT HAD BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 9,100

PENDING LAWSUITS, WHICH INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 19,400 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES

RESULTING FROM THE USE OF

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2010. MSD

HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THE OUTCOMES OF SEVERAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT WERE TRIED

PRIOR TO 2010.

OF THE CASES THAT WENT TO TRIAL, THE

MCDARBY

MATTER WAS RESOLVED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2009, LEAVING ONLY TWO UNRESOLVED POST-TRIAL APPEALS.

ERNST V. MERCK

AND

GARZA V. MERCK.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN SEPTEMBER 2006, MSD FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE AUGUST 2005

JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF IN THE TEXAS STATE COURT CASE,

ERNST V. MERCK

. ON MAY 29,

2008, THE TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT AND ISSUED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR

OF MSD. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND THE EVIDENCE TO BE LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT ON THE ISSUE OF

CAUSATION. PLAINTIFF FILED A MOTION FOR REHEARING

EN BANC

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS. ON JUNE 4, 2009,

IN RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR REHEARING, THE COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED A NEW OPINION

REVERSING THE JURYS VERDICT AND RENDERED JUDGMENT FOR MSD. ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2009, PLAINTIFF FILED A

SECOND MOTION FOR REHEARING

EN BANC,

WHICH THE COURT OF APPEALS DENIED ON NOVEMBER 19, 2009. ON

DECEMBER 7, 2009, PLAINTIFF FILED ANOTHER MOTION FOR REHEARING, WHICH THE COURT OF APPEALS AGAIN

DENIED. PLAINTIFF FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS ON FEBRUARY 3, 2010.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN APRIL 2006, IN

GARZA V. MERCK

, A JURY IN STATE COURT IN RIO GRANDE

CITY, TEXAS RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE FAMILY OF DECEDENT LEONEL GARZA. THE JURY AWARDED A

TOTAL OF $7 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO MR. GARZAS WIDOW AND THREE SONS. THE JURY ALSO

PURPORTED TO AWARD $25 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES EVEN THOUGH UNDER TEXAS LAW, IN THIS CASE,

POTENTIAL PUNITIVE DAMAGES WERE CAPPED AT $750,000. IN MAY 2008, THE SAN ANTONIO COURT OF APPEALS

REVERSED THE JUDGMENT AND RENDERED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MSD. IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COURT OF

APPEALS, ON REHEARING, VACATED ITS PRIOR RULING AND ISSUED A REPLACEMENT. IN THE NEW RULING, THE

COURT ORDERED A TAKE-NOTHING JUDGMENT FOR MSD ON THE DESIGN DEFECT CLAIM, BUT REVERSED AND REMANDED

FOR A NEW TRIAL AS TO THE STRICT LIABILITY CLAIM BECAUSE OF JUROR MISCONDUCT.

IN JANUARY 2009, MSD FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT. THE TEXAS

SUPREME COURT GRANTED MSDS PETITION FOR REVIEW AND ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON JANUARY 20, 2010.

OTHER LAWSUITS

APPROXIMATELY 190 CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PAYORS WERE FILED IN THE NEW JERSEY

COURT AND IN FEDERAL COURT IN THE MDL. ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED IT HAD FINALIZED A

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH IT HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, TO RESOLVE ALL PENDING LAWSUITS IN WHICH

U.S.-BASED PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PAYORS (TPPS) SOUGHT REIMBURSEMENT FOR COVERING

VIOXX

PURCHASED BY

THEIR PLAN MEMBERS. CERTAIN OTHER CLAIMANTS PARTICIPATED IN THE RESOLUTION AS WELL. THE AGREEMENT

PROVIDED THAT MSD DID NOT ADMIT WRONGDOING OR FAULT. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MSD PAID A

FIXED TOTAL OF $80 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES A SETTLEMENT FUND THAT WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG THE

TPPS (INSURERS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND UNION WELFARE FUNDS) PARTICIPATING IN THE RESOLUTION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH A FORMULA THAT IS BASED ON PRODUCT VOLUME AND A PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL PAYMENT OF

ATTORNEYS FEES. IN RETURN, THE SETTLING TPPS WILL DISMISS THEIR LAWSUITS AND RELEASE THEIR CLAIMS

AGAINST MSD. STIPULATED DISMISSALS OF THE SETTLED TTP ACTIONS WERE FILED IN NEW JERSEY AND THE MDL

IN DECEMBER 2009. MSD RECORDED A CHARGE OF $80 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 RELATED TO THE

SETTLEMENT AND PAID THE $80 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009. SINCE THE SETTLEMENT, ONE

ADDITIONAL TPP CASE HAS BEEN FILED WHICH IS PENDING IN THE MDL PROCEEDING.

SEPARATELY, THERE ARE ALSO STILL PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT

OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS. IN THE MDL PROCEEDING, 33 SUCH CLASS ACTIONS REMAIN. IN 2005, MSD MOVED

TO DISMISS A MASTER COMPLAINT THAT INCLUDES THESE CASES, BUT THE MDL COURT HAS NOT YET RULED ON

THAT MOTION.

ON MARCH 17, 2009, THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT DENIED PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION IN

MARTIN-KLEINMAN V. MERCK

, A PUTATIVE CONSUMER CLASS ACTION. PLAINTIFFS MOVED FOR

LEAVE TO APPEAL THE DECISION TO THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT ON NOVEMBER 6, 2009. ON JANUARY 12,

2010, THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT DENIED PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE DENIAL OF

CLASS CERTIFICATION.

ON JUNE 12, 2008, A MISSOURI STATE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS OF MISSOURI PLAINTIFFS SEEKING

REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS RELATING TO

VIOXX.

THE PLAINTIFFS DO NOT ALLEGE ANY PERSONAL

INJURIES FROM TAKING

VIOXX.

THE MISSOURI COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURTS CERTIFICATION

OF A CLASS ON MAY 12, 2009, AND THE MISSOURI SUPREME COURT DENIED MSDS APPLICATION FOR REVIEW OF

THAT DECISION ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2009. TRIAL HAS BEEN SET FOR APRIL 11, 2011. IN ADDITION, IN INDIANA,

PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS OF INDIANA

VIOXX

PURCHASERS IN A CASE PENDING

BEFORE THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA; DISCOVERY IN THAT CASE IS ONGOING. BRIEFING IS

COMPLETE ON PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS OF KENTUCKY

VIOXX

PURCHASERS BEFORE THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF PIKE COUNTY, KENTUCKY. A HEARING ON THIS MATTER WAS HELD ON FEBRUARY 26, 2010. A JUDGE IN

COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS HAS CONSOLIDATED THREE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY

VIOXX

PURCHASERS.

THE PLAINTIFFS IN THOSE ACTIONS RECENTLY VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR LAWSUITS.

PLAINTIFFS ALSO FILED A CLASS ACTION IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT SEEKING CERTIFICATION OF A

CLASS OF CALIFORNIA THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AND END-USERS. THE TRIAL COURT DENIED THE MOTION FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION ON APRIL 30, 2009, AND THE COURT OF APPEAL AFFIRMED THAT RULING ON DECEMBER 15, 2009.

ON JANUARY 25, 2010, PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

MSD HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN TWENTY-ONE SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENT

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF THIRTEEN STATES, FIVE COUNTIES, THE CITY OF NEW YORK,

AND PRIVATE CITIZENS (WHO HAVE BROUGHT

QUI TAM

AND TAXPAYER DERIVATIVE SUITS). THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE

THAT MSD MISREPRESENTED THE SAFETY OF

VIOXX

AND SEEK: (I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED

OR REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY AND ITS AGENCIES; (II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE

GOVERNMENT ENTITY AND ITS AGENCIES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS INJURED BY

VIOXX

; (III) DAMAGES UNDER VARIOUS COMMON LAW THEORIES; AND/OR (IV) REMEDIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE

STATUTORY THEORIES, INCLUDING STATE CONSUMER FRAUD AND/OR FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR MEDICAID FRAUD

STATUTES, INCLUDING CIVIL PENALTIES. NINE OF THE THIRTEEN CASES ARE PENDING IN THE MDL PROCEEDING,

TWO ARE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONAL ORDERS TRANSFERRING THEM TO THE MDL PROCEEDING, AND TWO WERE

REMANDED TO STATE COURT. ONE OF THE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE COUNTIES IS A CLASS ACTION FILED BY

SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED CALIFORNIA COUNTIES.

MSDS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT WAS GRANTED IN NOVEMBER 2009 IN A CASE BROUGHT BY THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS THAT WAS SCHEDULED TO GO TO TRIAL IN EARLY 2010. THE TEXAS ATTORNEY

GENERAL DID NOT APPEAL. IN THE MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL CASE, MSD IS CURRENTLY SEEKING APPELLATE

REVIEW OF THE TRIAL COURTS ORDER DENYING MSDS MOTION TO DISMISS. THE TRIAL COURT HAS ENTERED A

STAY OF PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING DISCOVERY) PENDING THE RESULT OF THAT APPEAL. FINALLY, THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL

ACTIONS IN THE MDL DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH ARE IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE. THE

LOUISIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL CASE IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN THE MDL COURT ON APRIL 12,

2010.

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, MSD AND VARIOUS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS AND

INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ALL OF THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED BY THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (THE JPML) TO THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R. CHESLER FOR INCLUSION IN A

NATIONWIDE MDL (THE SHAREHOLDER MDL). JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION, WHICH REQUESTED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF

PURCHASERS OF MSD STOCK BETWEEN MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29, 2004, ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE

FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF SUIT,

INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE ACT AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES OF MSD STOCK AND UNDER

SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS BASED ON STATEMENTS

IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MSD STOCK

INVESTMENT PLAN, A DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN. ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS

MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION REVERSING JUDGE CHESLERS ORDER AND REMANDING THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT. MSD FILED A

PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ON JANUARY 15, 2009, WHICH

THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED ON MAY 26, 2009. ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON NOVEMBER 30, 2009 AND A

DECISION IS EXPECTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010. WHILE THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WAS PENDING,

PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR CONSOLIDATED AND FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT IN THE DISTRICT COURT.

MSD FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THAT COMPLAINT ON MAY 1, 2009, FOLLOWING WHICH THE DISTRICT COURT

PROCEEDINGS WERE STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE SUPREME COURT APPEAL. THE MOTION TO DISMISS IN

THE DISTRICT COURT HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO MSDS RIGHT TO RE-FILE SUCH A MOTION

PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE SUPREME COURT APPEAL.

IN OCTOBER 2005, A DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER GOVERNING THE SHAREHOLDER MDL, THE CASE, WHICH IS

BASED ON THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PENSION FUNDS COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON

AUGUST 3, 2007. IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT RATHER THAN

RESPONDING TO DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS. IN ADDITION, IN 2007, SIX NEW COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALSO ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS. BY STIPULATION, DEFENDANTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THESE COMPLAINTS UNTIL THE

RESOLUTION OF ANY MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE CONSOLIDATED SECURITIES ACTION.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT

UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND

FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS) HAVE

BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF MSDS CURRENT AND

FORMER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF MSDS RETIREMENT PLANS. THE COMPLAINT MAKES

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS. ON JULY 11, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. ON OCTOBER 19, 2007, PLAINTIFFS MOVED FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF

INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PARTICIPANTS IN AND BENEFICIARIES OF MSDS RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AT ANY

TIME BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 1998 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND WHOSE PLAN ACCOUNTS INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN

THE MSD COMMON STOCK FUND AND/OR MSD COMMON STOCK. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2009, THE COURT DENIED THE MOTION

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS AS TO ONE COUNT AND GRANTED THE MOTION AS TO THE REMAINING COUNTS. THE

COURT ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE CLASS DEFINITION THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO (I) WERE NOT INJURED IN

CONNECTION WITH THEIR INVESTMENTS IN MSD STOCK AND (II) EXECUTED POST-SEPARATION SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS THAT RELEASED THEIR CLAIMS UNDER ERISA. ON MARCH 23, 2009, JUDGE CHESLER DENIED

DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS. ON MAY 11, 2009, JUDGE CHESLER ENTERED AN ORDER

DENYING PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS,

WHICH HAD BEEN FILED ON DECEMBER 24, 2008.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON

MSDS BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO MSD WITH RESPECT TO

THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN S. MARTIN, JR. OF DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ALLEGATIONS SET FORTH IN THE

DEMAND. JUDGE MARTINS REPORT WAS MADE PUBLIC IN SEPTEMBER 2006. BASED ON THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES

RECOMMENDATION MADE AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE MARTIN REPORT AND THE IMPACT THAT DERIVATIVE

LITIGATION WOULD HAVE ON MSD, THE BOARD REJECTED THE DEMAND. ON OCTOBER 11, 2007, TWO SHAREHOLDERS

FILED A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT PURPORTEDLY ON MSDS BEHALF IN STATE COURT IN ATLANTIC

COUNTY, NEW JERSEY AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF MSD. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED

THAT THE BOARDS REJECTION OF THEIR DEMAND WAS UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPER, AND THAT THE DEFENDANTS

BREACHED VARIOUS DUTIES TO MSD IN ALLOWING

VIOXX

TO BE MARKETED. THE PARTIES REACHED A PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT AND, ON FEBRUARY 8, 2010, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING THE

SETTLEMENT AND REQUIRING THAT NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT BE MADE TO MSDS PARENT COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. ON

FEBRUARY 9, 2010, MSDS PARENT COMPANY NOTIFIED SHAREHOLDERS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND ITS TERMS. ON MARCH

22, 2010, THE COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT, CERTAIN

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CHANGES WILL BE MADE AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED

WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED. IN ADDITION, MSD WILL PAY AN AWARD OF FEES AND EXPENSES TO PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS IN AN AMOUNT TO BE

DETERMINED BY THE COURT, NOT TO EXCEED $12.15 MILLION. IN ADDITION, MSD, THE PLAINTIFFS AND THE

INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS WILL EXCHANGE FULL, MUTUAL RELEASES OF ALL CLAIMS THAT WERE, OR COULD HAVE

BEEN, ASSERTED IN THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS. THE SETTLEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION OF

LIABILITY OR WRONGFUL CONDUCT BY MSD OR BY ANY OF THE DEFENDANTS NAMED IN THE ACTIONS. THIS

SETTLEMENT ALSO RESOLVES THE FEDERAL CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION DESCRIBED BELOW.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE

TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). ON MAY 5, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS ON THE

GROUNDS THAT PLAINTIFFS HAD FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DEMAND SHOULD BE EXCUSED AND DENIED

PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, ARGUING THAT JUDGE

CHESLER ERRED IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITH DOCUMENTS ACQUIRED BY

STIPULATION OF THE PARTIES. ON JULY 18, 2007, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION ON THE GROUNDS THAT JUDGE CHESLER SHOULD HAVE

ALLOWED PLAINTIFFS TO SEEK LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT USING THE DOCUMENTS ACQUIRED BY

STIPULATION, AND REMANDED THE CASE FOR THE DISTRICT COURTS CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER, EVEN WITH THE

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, PLAINTIFFS PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD BE FUTILE. PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR BRIEF

IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT, ALONG WITH THEIR PROPOSED AMENDED

COMPLAINT, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007. THE COURT DENIED THE MOTION ON JUNE 17, 2008, AND AGAIN DISMISSED

THE CASE. ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE APPEAL WAS HELD ON JULY 15, 2009. ON

NOVEMBER 10, 2009, BEFORE ANY DECISION WAS ISSUED, THE APPEAL WAS STAYED PENDING APPROVAL OF THE

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN THE DERIVATIVE ACTION PENDING IN THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT DISCUSSED

ABOVE.

INTERNATIONAL LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MSD HAS BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN LITIGATION RELATING TO

VIOXX

IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS) IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS CANADA, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, ISRAEL, THE

PHILIPPINES AND SINGAPORE.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE SUPERIOR COURT IN QUEBEC AUTHORIZED THE INSTITUTION OF A CLASS ACTION ON

BEHALF OF ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO, IN QUEBEC, CONSUMED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ITS

INGESTION. ON MAY 7, 2009, THE PLAINTIFFS SERVED AN INTRODUCTORY MOTION FOR A CLASS ACTION BASED

UPON THAT AUTHORIZATION, AND THE CASE REMAINS IN PRELIMINARY STAGES OF LITIGATION. ON MAY 30, 2008,

THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF QUEENS BENCH IN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA ENTERED AN ORDER CERTIFYING A CLASS

OF

VIOXX

USERS IN CANADA, EXCEPT THOSE IN QUEBEC. MSD APPEALED THE CERTIFICATION ORDER AND, ON

MARCH 30, 2009, THE COURT OF APPEAL GRANTED MSDS APPEAL AND QUASHED THE CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON

OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA DISMISSED PLAINTIFFS APPEAL APPLICATION AND DECIDED

NOT TO REVIEW THE JUDGMENT OF THE SASKATCHEWAN COURT OF APPEAL. ON JULY 28, 2008, THE SUPERIOR

COURT IN ONTARIO DENIED MSDS MOTION TO STAY CLASS PROCEEDINGS IN ONTARIO AND DECIDED TO CERTIFY AN

OVERLAPPING CLASS OF

VIOXX

USERS IN CANADA, EXCEPT THOSE IN QUEBEC AND SASKATCHEWAN, WHO ALLEGE

NEGLIGENCE AND AN ENTITLEMENT TO ELECT TO WAIVE THE TORT. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2009, THE ONTARIO

DIVISIONAL COURT DISMISSED THE APPEAL FROM THE ORDER DENYING THE STAY AND, ON MAY 15, 2009, THE

ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL DENIED LEAVE TO APPEAL. ON OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA

DISMISSED MSDS APPLICATION AND DECIDED NOT TO REVIEW THE JUDGMENT OF THE ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL.

AFTER THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN QUASHED THE MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL CERTIFICATION ORDER

ENTERED IN THAT PROVINCE, MSD APPLIED TO THE ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL FROM THE

ONTARIO CERTIFICATION ORDER. LEAVE TO APPEAL WAS GRANTED, THE APPEAL WAS FILED ON MAY 20, 2009 AND,

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COURTS DECISION, MSD SOUGHT LEAVE TO APPEAL TO THE DIVISIONAL COURT, WHICH

WAS DENIED ON DECEMBER 7, 2009. THESE PROCEDURAL DECISIONS IN THE CANADIAN LITIGATION DO NOT

ADDRESS THE MERITS OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION IN CANADA REMAINS IN AN EARLY STAGE.

A TRIAL IN A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CONCLUDED ON JUNE 25, 2009, IN THE FEDERAL

COURT OF AUSTRALIA. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO ALLEGED HE SUFFERED AN MI, SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHERS

IN AUSTRALIA WHO INGESTED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED AN MI,

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THROMBOTIC STROKE, UNSTABLE ANGINA, TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.

ON MARCH 30, 2009, THE TRIAL JUDGE ENTERED AN ORDER DIRECTING THAT, IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER ISSUES

IN THE PROCEEDING, THE ISSUES TO BE DETERMINED DURING THE TRIAL ARE THOSE ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW IN

THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS INDIVIDUAL CASE, AND THOSE ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE FINDS,

AFTER HEARING THE EVIDENCE, ARE COMMON TO THE CLAIMS OF THE GROUP MEMBERS THAT THE NAMED PLAINTIFF

HAS ALLEGED THAT HE REPRESENTS. ON MARCH 5, 2010, THE TRIAL JUDGE DELIVERED HIS JUDGMENT. THE

COURT DECIDED TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS AGAINST MSD, SPECIFICALLY FINDING THAT MSD HAD DONE EVERYTHING

THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED OF IT IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS DUTY OF CARE. WITH REGARD TO MSDS

AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARY, MERCK SHARP & DOHME (AUSTRALIA) PTY. LTD., THE COURT DECIDED TO DISMISS

CERTAIN CLAIMS BUT TO AWARD THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO THE COURT FOUND SUFFERED AN MI AFTER INGESTING

VIOXX

FOR APPROXIMATELY 33 MONTHS, COMPENSATION BASED ON STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT

VIOXX

WAS NOT FIT

FOR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, EVEN THOUGH THE COURT REJECTED THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT

MSD KNEW OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN PRIOR TO THE VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

IN SEPTEMBER 2004 THAT

VIOXX

MATERIALLY INCREASED THE RISK OF MI. ON MAY 7, 2010, THE COURT WILL CONDUCT A HEARING TO

DETERMINE THE ORDERS TO BE ENTERED GIVING EFFECT TO THE JUDGMENT, IN WHICH THE COURT WILL DETERMINE

WHICH OF ITS FINDINGS OF FACT AND LAW ARE COMMON TO THE CLAIMS OF OTHER GROUP MEMBERS AND WILL

CONSIDER ANY OTHER MOTIONS THAT MIGHT BE BROUGHT. MSDS SUBSIDIARY INTENDS TO APPEAL THE ADVERSE

FINDINGS AFTER THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN ENTERED.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE COVERAGE APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$190 MILLION. MSD HAS FIDUCIARY AND OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER

LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ARBITRATION,

ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE, IF NEEDED, UNDER

UPPER-LEVEL EXCESS POLICIES THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE DISPUTES WITH

THE INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF MSDS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS AND

THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL DISPUTES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES

DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE LESS THAN THE STATED UPPER LIMITS.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAS RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE DOJ REQUESTING INFORMATION

RELATED TO MSDS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL

HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES SUBPOENAS FOR

WITNESSES TO APPEAR BEFORE A GRAND JURY. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN MARCH 2009, MSD RECEIVED A

LETTER FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS IDENTIFYING IT AS A TARGET

OF THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION REGARDING

VIOXX

. FURTHER, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, INVESTIGATIONS

ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER

ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE GOVERNMENTAL

ENTITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS (THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL REMEDIES.

IN ADDITION, MSD RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006 FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON CALIFORNIAS

MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MSD ENTERED INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL AS WELL AS

REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE COORDINATED

PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN 2007, AS A RESULT OF ENTERING INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MSD RECORDED A PRETAX

CHARGE OF $4.85 BILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIXED AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO PLAINTIFFS

QUALIFYING FOR PAYMENT UNDER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THERE ARE TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUIT TRIALS SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2010. MSD

CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. MSD BELIEVES THAT IT

HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE

THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, MSD IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF

LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. MSD HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, OTHER THAN A RESERVE ESTABLISHED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOLUTION OF THE

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES

IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED

WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, MSD HAD AN AGGREGATE RESERVE OF

APPROXIMATELY $4.379 BILLION (THE 

VIOXX

RESERVE) FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2009, MSD SPENT APPROXIMATELY $244 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $54 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN ADDITION,

DURING 2009, MSD PAID AN ADDITIONAL $4.1 BILLION INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. ALSO, DURING 2009, $75 MILLION OF CHARGES WERE RECORDED, INCLUDING $35 MILLION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WAS APPROXIMATELY

$110 MILLION, WHICH IS SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS

INCURRED BY MSD; THE DEVELOPMENT OF MSDS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE

SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT CERTAIN

LAWSUITS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST MSD; THE COSTS AND

OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE

AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 REPRESENTS MSDS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM

AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT

COULD ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS

TO BE INCURRED BY MSD.

MSD WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO SO.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES

INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 978 CASES,

WHICH INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 1,356 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, HAD BEEN FILED AND WERE PENDING AGAINST MSD IN

EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT, INCLUDING ONE CASE WHICH SEEKS CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS WELL

AS DAMAGES AND/OR MEDICAL MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT

THEY HAVE SUFFERED OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE DENTAL PROCEDURES,

SUCH AS TOOTH EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS AND/OR DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

. IN ADDITION, PLAINTIFFS IN APPROXIMATELY FIVE PERCENT OF THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THEY

SUSTAINED STRESS AND/OR LOW ENERGY FEMORAL FRACTURES IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

. ON

AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL

COURTS NATIONWIDE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (THE



FOSAMAX

MDL) FOR COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE

JOHN KEENAN IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AS A RESULT OF THE

JPML ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 771 OF THE CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE KEENAN. JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED A CASE

MANAGEMENT ORDER (AND VARIOUS AMENDMENTS THERETO) SETTING FORTH A SCHEDULE GOVERNING THE

PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSED PRIMARILY UPON RESOLVING THE CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS IN 2007

AND COMPLETING FACT DISCOVERY IN AN INITIAL GROUP OF 25 CASES BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. BRIEFING AND

ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS FOR CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL MONITORING CLASSES WERE COMPLETED IN

2007 AND JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING THE MOTIONS ON JANUARY 3, 2008. ON JANUARY 28, 2008,

JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED A FURTHER ORDER DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE ALL CLASS CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE

FIRST FOUR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST MSD THAT SOUGHT PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGES AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING RELIEF ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS.

DAUBERT

MOTIONS WERE FILED IN MAY 2009 AND JUDGE

KEENAN CONDUCTED A

DAUBERT

HEARING IN JULY 2009. ON JULY 27, 2009, JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED HIS RULING

ON THE PARTIES RESPECTIVE

DAUBERT

MOTIONS. THE RULING DENIED THE PLAINTIFF STEERING COMMITTEES

MOTION AND GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART MSDS MOTION. THE FIRST MDL TRIAL 

BOLES V. MERCK



BEGAN ON AUGUST 11, 2009, AND ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2009. ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2009, THE MDL COURT

DECLARED A MISTRIAL IN

BOLES

BECAUSE THE EIGHT PERSON JURY COULD NOT REACH A UNANIMOUS VERDICT AND,

CONSEQUENTLY, THE

BOLES

CASE IS SET TO BE RETRIED ON JUNE 2, 2010. THE SECOND MDL CASE SET FOR

TRIAL 

FLEMINGS V. MERCK

 WAS SCHEDULED TO START ON JANUARY 12, 2010, BUT JUDGE KEENAN GRANTED

MSDS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DISMISSED THE CASE ON NOVEMBER 23, 2009. THE NEXT MDL CASE

SET FOR TRIAL 

MALEY V. MERCK

 IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO START ON APRIL 19, 2010. MSD FILED A

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN

MALEY

, WHICH THE MDL COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART ON

JANUARY 27, 2010 AND, AS A RESULT, MSD EXPECTS THAT THE TRIAL WILL COMMENCE AS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED

ON APRIL 19. ON FEBRUARY 1, 2010, JUDGE KEENAN SELECTED A NEW BELLWETHER CASE 

JUDITH GRAVES V.

MERCK

 TO REPLACE THE

FLEMINGS

BELLWETHER CASE, WHICH THE MDL COURT DISMISSED WHEN IT GRANTED

SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MSD. THE MDL COURT HAS SET THE

GRAVES

TRIAL TO BEGIN ON SEPTEMBER 13,

2010. A TRIAL IN ALABAMA IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON MAY 3, 2010 AND A TRIAL IN FLORIDA IS

CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON JUNE 21, 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2008, AN APPLICATION WAS MADE BY THE ATLANTIC COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT OF

NEW JERSEY REQUESTING THAT ALL OF THE

FOSAMAX

CASES PENDING IN NEW JERSEY BE CONSIDERED FOR MASS

TORT DESIGNATION AND CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT BEFORE ONE JUDGE IN NEW JERSEY. ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, THE

NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT ORDERED THAT ALL PENDING AND FUTURE ACTIONS FILED IN NEW JERSEY ARISING

OUT OF THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

AND SEEKING DAMAGES FOR EXISTING DENTAL AND JAW-RELATED INJURIES,

INCLUDING OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, BUT NOT SOLELY SEEKING MEDICAL MONITORING, BE DESIGNATED AS A

MASS TORT FOR CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT PURPOSES BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE IN ATLANTIC COUNTY SUPERIOR

COURT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 189 CASES WERE PENDING AGAINST MSD IN THE NEW JERSEY

COORDINATED PROCEEDING. ON JULY 20, 2009, JUDGE HIGBEE ENTERED A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER (AND VARIOUS

AMENDMENTS THERETO) SETTING FORTH A SCHEDULE THAT CONTEMPLATES COMPLETING FACT DISCOVERY IN AN

INITIAL GROUP OF 10 CASES BY FEBRUARY 28, 2010, FOLLOWED BY EXPERT DISCOVERY IN FIVE OF THOSE

CASES, AND A PROJECTED TRIAL DATE OF JULY 12, 2010 FOR THE FIRST CASE TO BE TRIED IN THE NEW JERSEY

COORDINATED PROCEEDING.

DISCOVERY IS ONGOING IN THE

FOSAMAX

MDL LITIGATION, THE NEW JERSEY COORDINATED PROCEEDING, AND

THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONS WHERE

FOSAMAX

CASES ARE PENDING. MSD INTENDS TO DEFEND AGAINST THESE

LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, MSD HAD A REMAINING RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION SOLELY FOR

ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. DURING 2009, MSD SPENT APPROXIMATELY

$35 MILLION AND $40 MILLION WAS ADDED TO THE RESERVE. CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD

HAD A RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $38 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RESERVE

FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL DEFENSE COSTS INCURRED

THUS FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF MSDS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF

THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST MSD; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. MSD WILL CONTINUE

TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED RESERVES. DUE TO THE

UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, MSD IS UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2010. MSD HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL LITIGATION

AWP LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD WAS JOINED IN ONGOING LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE SOMETIMES USED IN

CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAW, INCLUDING FRAUD, MEDICAID FRAUD AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

VIOLATIONS, AMONG OTHER CLAIMS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE LITIGATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS COULD INCLUDE

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES, THE IMPOSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL FINES, PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE OR

ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING

FEDERAL AWP CASES TO FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE CONSOLIDATED

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT

COURT ACTIONS AND ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH, LIKE MSD, HAD

NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED MSDS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED MSD FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. MSD AND MANY

OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND

STATE COURT INCLUDING CASES BROUGHT INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

FIFTY OF THE COUNTY CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN NEW YORK STATE COURT. MSD WAS DISMISSED FROM

THE SUFFOLK COUNTY CASE, WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE FILED. IN ADDITION

TO THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD WAS A DEFENDANT IN STATE CASES BROUGHT

BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF ELEVEN STATES, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED. IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE

KANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL FILED SUIT AGAINST MSD AND SEVERAL OTHER MANUFACTURERS. AWP CLAIMS BROUGHT

BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ARIZONA AGAINST MSD WERE DROPPED IN 2009. THE COURT IN THE AWP CASES

PENDING IN HAWAII LISTED MSD AND OTHERS TO BE SET FOR TRIAL IN AUGUST 2010.

MSD CONTINUES TO RESPOND TO LITIGATION BROUGHT BY CERTAIN STATES AND PRIVATE PAYORS AND TO

INVESTIGATIONS INITIATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

AND SEVERAL STATES REGARDING AWP. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN FEBRUARY 2008, MSD ENTERED INTO A CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENT

(CIA) WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

(HHS-OIG) FOR A FIVE-YEAR TERM. THE CIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT MSD MAINTAIN ITS

ETHICS TRAINING PROGRAM AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES AND MEDICAID

PRICE REPORTING. FURTHER, AS REQUIRED BY THE CIA, MSD HAS RETAINED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW

ORGANIZATION TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMS REVIEW OF ITS PROMOTIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND TO CONDUCT,

ON A SAMPLE BASIS, TRANSACTIONAL REVIEWS OF MSDS PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS AND CERTAIN MEDICAID PRICING

CALCULATIONS. MSD IS ALSO REQUIRED

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTS AND CERTIFICATIONS TO THE HHS-OIG REGARDING ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE

CIA. MSD BELIEVES THAT ITS PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES AND MEDICAID PRICE REPORTS MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

OF THE CIA.

VYTORIN/ZETIA

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD (AS WELL AS MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS

(O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A

COMBINATION OF WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE

ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE

OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE

AUGUST 2008, MSD (AS WELL AS MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED THREE

ADDITIONAL LETTERS EACH FROM O&I, INCLUDING IDENTICAL LETTERS DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING

CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND A LETTER FROM THE

CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS, AND ON JULY 15, 2009, MSD

AND SCHERING-PLOUGH ANNOUNCED THAT THEY REACHED A CIVIL SETTLEMENT WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

REPRESENTING 35 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO RESOLVE A PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED INVESTIGATION

BY THAT GROUP INTO WHETHER THE COMPANIES VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANIES AGREED TO REIMBURSE THE INVESTIGATIVE

COSTS OF THE 35 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WHICH TOTALED $5.4 MILLION, AND TO MAKE

VOLUNTARY ASSURANCES OF COMPLIANCE RELATED TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

, INCLUDING

AGREEING TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT, THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG

ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT, AND OTHER LAWS REQUIRING THE TRUTHFUL AND NON-MISLEADING MARKETING

OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT INCLUDE ANY ADMISSION OF MISCONDUCT OR LIABILITY

BY THE COMPANIES. FURTHERMORE, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANIES RECEIVED

LETTERS FROM THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE DOJ INFORMING THEM THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER

THEIR CONDUCT RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL

HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND RESPONDING TO THE INQUIRIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAD BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED WITH APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL

CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. CERTAIN OF THOSE LAWSUITS ALLEGED

PERSONAL INJURIES AND/OR SOUGHT MEDICAL MONITORING. THE LAWSUITS AGAINST MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH

WERE CONSOLIDATED IN A SINGLE MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION DOCKET BEFORE JUDGE CAVANAUGH OF THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY,

IN RE VYTORIN/ZETIA MARKETING SALES PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS LIABILITY

LITIGATION

. ON AUGUST 5, 2009, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR CHOLESTEROL

JOINT VENTURE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO RESOLVE, FOR A TOTAL FIXED AMOUNT OF $41.5 MILLION, THESE

CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. THE MSP PARTNERSHIP RECORDED THESE CHARGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2009. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2010, JUDGE CAVANAUGH GRANTED FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENTS.

ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 3, 2008, AN MSD SHAREHOLDER FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTION LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING THAT MSD AND ITS

CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RICHARD T. CLARK, VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS. THIS SUIT HAS SINCE BEEN WITHDRAWN AND RE-FILED IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND HAS BEEN

CONSOLIDATED WITH ANOTHER FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE MERCK & CO., INC.

VYTORIN SECURITIES LITIGATION

. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, AND

NAMES AS DEFENDANTS MSD; MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC; AND CERTAIN OF MSDS CURRENT

AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT MSD DELAYED RELEASING

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL REGARDING THE EFFICACY OF

VYTORIN

AND THAT MSD

MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT EXPECTED EARNINGS, KNOWING THAT ONCE THE RESULTS OF THE

VYTORIN

STUDY WERE RELEASED, SALES OF

VYTORIN

WOULD DECLINE AND MSDS EARNINGS WOULD SUFFER. ON

DECEMBER 12, 2008, MSD AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THIS LAWSUIT ON THE GROUNDS THAT

THE PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM FOR WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2009, THE

COURT ISSUED AN OPINION AND ORDER DENYING THE DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THIS LAWSUIT, AND ON

OCTOBER 19, 2009, MSD AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED AN ANSWER TO THE AMENDED CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 22, 2008, A MEMBER OF AN MSD ERISA PLAN FILED A PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN OF MSDS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

ALLEGING THEY BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES UNDER ERISA. SINCE THAT TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER

SIMILAR ERISA LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST MSD IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY, AND ALL OF THOSE LAWSUITS

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE MERCK & CO., INC. VYTORIN ERISA LITIGATION

. A

CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 5, 2009, AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS MSD AND

VARIOUS CURRENT AND FORMER MEMBERS OF MSDS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE

ERISA PLANS INVESTMENT IN MSD STOCK WAS IMPRUDENT BECAUSE MSDS EARNINGS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE

COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF ITS CHOLESTEROL DRUG

VYTORIN

AND THAT DEFENDANTS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

THAT THE RESULTS OF A SCIENTIFIC STUDY WOULD CAUSE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO TURN TO LESS EXPENSIVE

DRUGS FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT. ON APRIL 23, 2009, MSD AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS

THIS LAWSUIT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM FOR WHICH RELIEF CAN BE

GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2009, THE COURT ISSUED AN OPINION AND ORDER DENYING THE DEFENDANTS MOTION

TO DISMISS THIS LAWSUIT. ON NOVEMBER 9, 2009, THE

PLAINTIFFS MOVED TO STRIKE CERTAIN OF THE DEFENDANTS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. THAT MOTION WAS

FULLY BRIEFED ON DECEMBER 4, 2009 AND IS PENDING BEFORE THE COURT.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING

FROM THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR THE CIVIL LITIGATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED A LETTER TO MSDS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS

TO RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY MSD IN 2007 TO RESOLVE CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS DELIVERED

ANOTHER LETTER TO THE BOARD DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD OR A SUBCOMMITTEE THEREOF COMMENCE AN

INVESTIGATION INTO THE MATTERS RAISED BY VARIOUS CIVIL SUITS AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

RELATING TO

VYTORIN.

VACCINE LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD IS A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G., HEPATITIS B VACCINE)

THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN VACCINES. AS OF MARCH 2010, THERE WERE

APPROXIMATELY 200 THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS PENDING IN WHICH MSD IS A DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE

VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE LAWSUITS ARE NOT CURRENTLY ACTIVE. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE

MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS OF

THIMEROSAL. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED

NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC VACCINES. THERE ARE NO

CASES CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL. MSD WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MSD HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND

THAT THE ACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE VACCINE ACT).

THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A

PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE VACCINE

COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE

PETITIONER MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN VACCINE COURT AND THEN

TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO

VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. MSD IS

NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED

STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

MSD IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 5,000 CASES PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING

ALLEGATIONS THAT THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES AND/OR THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM

DISORDERS. NOT ALL OF THE THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDING

ARE MSD VACCINES. MSD IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE DOMESTICALLY. THE SPECIAL MASTERS

PRESIDING OVER THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD HEARINGS IN THREE TEST CASES INVOLVING THE THEORY

THAT THE COMBINATION OF

M-M-R

II VACCINE AND THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM

DISORDERS. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2009, THE SPECIAL MASTERS ISSUED DECISIONS IN EACH OF THOSE CASES,

FINDING THAT THE THEORY WAS UNSUPPORTED BY VALID SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THAT THE PETITIONERS IN

THE THREE CASES WERE THEREFORE NOT ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. TWO OF THOSE THREE CASES ARE CURRENTLY

ON APPEAL. THE SPECIAL MASTERS HELD SIMILAR HEARINGS IN THREE DIFFERENT TEST CASES INVOLVING THE

THEORY THAT THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES ALONE CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. ON MARCH 12, 2010, THE

SPECIAL MASTERS ISSUED DECISIONS IN THIS SECOND SET OF TEST CASES, FINDING THAT THE THEORY WAS ALSO

UNSUPPORTED BY VALID SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THAT THE PETITIONS IN THESE THREE CASES WERE ALSO NOT

ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. THE SPECIAL MASTERS HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD SIMILAR

HEARINGS INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT

M-M-R

II ALONE CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS, BUT THEY HAVE

STATED THAT THEY NO LONGER INTEND TO DO SO. THE VACCINE COURT HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO USE

THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THESE TEST CASE HEARINGS TO GUIDE THE ADJUDICATION OF THE REMAINING

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER CASES.

PATENT LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FILE ANDAS WITH THE FDA

SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF MSDS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED

BY MSD. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES GENERIC FORMS OF

FOSAMAX, NEXIUM, SINGULAIR

,

EMEND

AND

CANCIDAS

PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF MSDS (AND ASTRAZENECAS IN THE CASE OF

NEXIUM

) PATENTS CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, AN ANDA HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC

FORM OF

ZETIA

AND AN ANDA HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A

GENERIC FORM OF

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VYTORIN

, BOTH PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF SCHERING-PLOUGHS PATENT CONCERNING EACH PRODUCT. THE

GENERIC COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, INVALIDITY AND

UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. MSD HAS FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST

COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE (

FOSAMAX

) AND MONTELUKAST (

SINGULAIR

) AND

ASTRAZENECA AND MSD HAVE FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING

ANDAS FOR GENERIC ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

). ALSO, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC VERSIONS OF

EZETIMIBE (

ZETIA

) AND EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN (

VYTORIN

). SIMILAR PATENT CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. MSD INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE VALID,

AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION

DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF

ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A GENERIC COMPANY INDICATING THAT IT

HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ZETIA

AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS THAT ARE LISTED FOR

ZETIA.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, MSD MARKETED

ZETIA

THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE, MSP SINGAPORE COMPANY LLC. ON

MARCH 22, 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MSP SINGAPORE COMPANY LLC FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT

AGAINST GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC., USA AND ITS PARENT CORPORATION (GLENMARK). THE LAWSUIT

AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF GLENMARKS ANDA UNTIL OCTOBER 2010 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT

DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE TRIAL IN THIS MATTER IS SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE ON

MAY 3, 2010.

IN

NOVEMBER 2009, MSDS PARENT COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM MYLAN THAT IT FILED AN

ANDA FOR EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND THAT IT WAS CHALLENGING TWO PATENTS LISTED

IN THE FDA ORANGE BOOK FOR

VYTORIN

.  ON DECEMBER 16, 2009, MSDS PARENT

COMPANY FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST MYLAN.  THE LAWSUIT

AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF MYLANS ANDA UNTIL MAY 2012 OR UNTIL

AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN FEBRUARY 2007, MSD RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS,

INC. (TEVA), A GENERIC COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR MONTELUKAST AND THAT IT

IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENT THAT IS LISTED FOR

SINGULAIR

. ON APRIL 2, 2007, MSD FILED A PATENT

INFRINGEMENT ACTION AGAINST TEVA. A TRIAL IN THIS MATTER WAS HELD IN FEBRUARY 2009. ON AUGUST 19,

2009, THE COURT ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT AND ORDERED THAT

TEVAS ANDA COULD NOT BE APPROVED PRIOR TO EXPIRY OF MSDS EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS IN AUGUST 2012. TEVA

HAD APPEALED THE DECISION, HOWEVER, IN JANUARY 2010, TEVA WITHDREW ITS APPEAL OF THE TRIAL COURTS

DECISION UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT. IN ADDITION, IN MAY 2009, THE UNITED

STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE GRANTED A PETITION BY ARTICLE ONE PARTNERS LLC TO REEXAMINE

MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT. ON DECEMBER 15, 2009, THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE ISSUED

A NOTICE INDICATING THAT IT WILL ALLOW THE CLAIMS OF MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT. PRODUCT EXCLUSIVITY IS

ACCORDINGLY EXPECTED TO BE MAINTAINED UNTIL AUGUST 2012.

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A DECISION REFUSING TO BAR THE

APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON THE GROUNDS THAT MSDS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS LIKELY

INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA IN JUNE

2005. IN JULY 2005, MSD WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX CORP. (APOTEX) SEEKING

DAMAGES FOR LOST SALES OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DUE TO THE PATENT PROCEEDING. IN OCTOBER 2008,

THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA ISSUED A DECISION AWARDING APOTEX ITS LOST PROFITS FOR ITS GENERIC

ALENDRONATE PRODUCT FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT IT WAS HELD OFF THE MARKET DUE TO MSDS LAWSUIT. IN

JUNE 2009, THE TRIAL COURT DECISION WAS UPHELD IN PART AND BOTH COMPANIES SOUGHT LEAVE TO APPEAL TO

THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA. IN JANUARY 2010, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA DECLINED TO HEAR THE

APPEAL, LEAVING INTACT THE DECISION THAT APOTEX IS ENTITLED TO DAMAGES FOR THE DISCRETE PERIOD OF

TIME THAT ITS MARKET ENTRY WAS POSTPONED DUE TO THE LITIGATION LAUNCHED BY MSD.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2004, MSD APPEALED A DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION

OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (EPO) THAT REVOKED MSDS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. ON MARCH 14, 2006, THE BOARD OF APPEAL OF THE EPO UPHELD

THE DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION REVOKING THE PATENT. ON MARCH 28, 2007, THE EPO ISSUED

ANOTHER PATENT IN EUROPE TO MSD THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. UNDER

ITS TERMS, THIS NEW PATENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL JULY 2018. MSD HAS SUED MULTIPLE PARTIES IN EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES ASSERTING ITS EUROPEAN PATENT COVERING ONCE-WEEKLY DOSING OF

FOSAMAX

. DECISIONS HAVE BEEN

RENDERED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND BELGIUM INVALIDATING THE PATENT IN THOSE COUNTRIES. MSD HAS

APPEALED THESE DECISIONS. OPPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE EPO AGAINST THIS PATENT. IN A HEARING

HELD MARCH 17-19, 2009, THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE EPO ISSUED AN APPEALABLE DECISION REVOKING

THIS PATENT. MSD HAS APPEALED THE DECISION.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JAPAN AFTER A PROCEEDING WAS FILED CHALLENGING THE

VALIDITY OF MSDS JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE, THE PATENT

OFFICE INVALIDATED THE PATENT. THE DECISION IS UNDER APPEAL.

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE U.S. PATENT FOR DORZOLAMIDE, COVERING BOTH

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

, EXPIRED,

AFTER WHICH MSD EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S. SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS. MSD IS INVOLVED

IN LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS OF THE CORRESPONDING PATENTS IN CANADA AND GREAT BRITAIN AND GERMANY. IN

NOVEMBER 2009, THE TRIAL COURT IN GREAT BRITAIN ISSUED A DECISION FINDING MSDS

COSOPT

PATENT

INVALID. IN CANADA A TRIAL WAS HELD IN DECEMBER 2009 REGARDING MSDS CANADIAN

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

PATENTS. MSD IS AWAITING A DECISION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT RANBAXY HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. IN NOVEMBER

2005, MSD AND ASTRAZENECA SUED RANBAXY IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, ASTRAZENECA, MSD AND RANBAXY HAVE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES

OCTOBER 2009, MSD AND ASTRAZENECA SUED LUPIN IN THE DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY BASED ON LUPINS

FILING OF AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM.

IN JANUARY 2009, MSD RECEIVED NOTICE FROM SANDOZ THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA AND THAT IT WAS

CHALLENGING FIVE MSD PATENTS LISTED IN THE FDA ORANGE BOOK FOR

EMEND

. IN FEBRUARY 2009, MSD FILED A

PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST SANDOZ. THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF SANDOZS

ANDA UNTIL JULY 2011 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE

CASE IS SCHEDULED TO GO TO TRIAL IN DECEMBER 2010.

IN EUROPE, MSD IS AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPANIES SEEKING REGISTRATION FOR GENERIC LOSARTAN (THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOR

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

). MSD HAS PATENT RIGHTS TO LOSARTAN VIA LICENSE FROM E.I.

THE SETTLEMENT, IF APPROVED BY THE COURT, WILL RESOLVE AND RELEASE ALL CLAIMS THAT WERE OR

COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY ANY SHAREHOLDER OF MSD CHALLENGING ANY ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER,

INCLUDING ANY MERGER DISCLOSURE CLAIMS.

OTHER LITIGATION

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING MSD, THAT ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS ITEM, IN THE OPINION OF MSD, ALL SUCH

PROCEEDINGS ARE EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED, SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY

RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF MSD, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT

IS PROVIDED IN THIS ITEM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

MSD AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE PARTIES TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND,

AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE OPERATORS OF

HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS

WASTE DISPOSED OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP

COSTS. MSD HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED OF

AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY

LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE PROCEEDINGS

ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY

REFLECTS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. MSDS POTENTIAL LIABILITY

VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR

OTHERS THE FINAL COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT

THE OUTCOME OF MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS,

IN THE OPINION OF MSD, SUCH PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR

CAPITAL RESOURCES OF MSD. MSD HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS

AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM

FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, APPROXIMATELY 2,200 PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT

AGAINST MSD AND 12 OTHER DEFENDANTS IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT, AS WELL AS

NEGLIGENCE AND NUISANCE. THE SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURY, DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUE,

MEDICAL MONITORING AND OTHER ALLEGED REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH GROUNDWATER

AND SOIL CONTAMINATION FOUND AT THE SITE OF A FORMER MSD SUBSIDIARY IN MERCED, CALIFORNIA. MSD

INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST THESE CLAIMS.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND TOTALED $72.7 MILLION AND $89.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT CONSIDER POTENTIAL

RECOVERIES FROM OTHER PARTIES AND WILL BE PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE

APPLICABLE SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE

INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $70.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE.

MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

PARTNERSHIPS. EQUITY FROM AFFILIATES DECLINED TO $2.5 BILLION IN 2009 FROM $2.6 BILLION IN 2008

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER EQUITY INCOME FROM THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP, AND DECREASED

EQUITY INCOME FROM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL) DUE TO THE SALE OF MSDS INTEREST IN SEPTEMBER 2009,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PARTNERSHIP RETURNS FROM AZLP.

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

INCLUDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET IN 2009 WAS A $3.2 BILLION GAIN RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE

OF MSDS INTEREST IN MERIAL (SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). ALSO INCLUDED

COMPANY FOUNDATION, $117 MILLION OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RECOGNIZED NET LOSSES AND A $58 MILLION

CHARGE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER MSD VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER

PROTECTION LAWS WITH RESPECT TO THE SALES AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. MSD EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

INTEREST INCOME IN 2009 AS COMPARED WITH 2008 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES AND A

CHANGE IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MIX TOWARD CASH AND SHORTER-DATED SECURITIES IN ANTICIPATION OF

THE MERGER. MSD RECOGNIZED HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2009 LARGELY DUE TO $174 MILLION OF

COMMITMENT FEES AND INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FINANCING OF THE MERGER.

TAXES ON INCOME

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 25.4% IN 2009 AND 20.1% IN 2008. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATE IN 2009 BENEFITED FROM 2009 TAX SETTLEMENTS, INCLUDING THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SETTLEMENT

WITH THE CANADA REVENUE AGENCY (CRA). THESE FAVORABLE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF MSDS INTEREST IN MERIAL BEING TAXABLE IN THE UNITED

STATES AT A COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 38.0%. THE 2008 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

REFLECTS FAVORABLE IMPACTS RELATING TO TAX SETTLEMENTS, THE REALIZATION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND

THE FAVORABLE TAX IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, PARTICULARLY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE

JAPANESE YEN AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT RESULTING FROM THE

AZLP GAIN BEING FULLY TAXABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AT A COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RATE OF

APPROXIMATELY 36.3%.

NET INCOME

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO MERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP. WAS $8.0 BILLION IN 2009 COMPARED WITH

$7.8 BILLION IN 2008. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE GAIN RECORDED ON THE

SALE OF MSDS INTEREST IN MERIAL AND LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MERGER-RELATED

COSTS AND HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

($ IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

ON NOVEMBER 3, 2009, MERCK & CO., INC. (MSD) AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) COMPLETED THEIR PREVIOUSLY-ANNOUNCED MERGER (THE MERGER). IN THE MERGER,

SCHERING-PLOUGH ACQUIRED ALL OF THE SHARES OF MSD, WHICH BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

SCHERING-PLOUGH AND WAS RENAMED MERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP. SCHERING-PLOUGH CONTINUED AS THE

SURVIVING PUBLIC COMPANY AND WAS RENAMED MERCK & CO., INC. (MSDS PARENT COMPANY). MSD IS A

GLOBAL HEALTH CARE COMPANY THAT DELIVERS INNOVATIVE HEALTH SOLUTIONS THROUGH ITS MEDICINES AND

VACCINES, WHICH ARE MARKETED DIRECTLY AND THROUGH JOINT VENTURES. HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC AND PREVENTIVE AGENTS, SOLD BY PRESCRIPTION, FOR THE TREATMENT OF

HUMAN DISORDERS. THESE HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS

AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. VACCINE PRODUCTS

CONSIST OF PREVENTIVE PEDIATRIC, ADOLESCENT AND ADULT VACCINES, PRIMARILY ADMINISTERED AT PHYSICIAN

OFFICES. THESE HUMAN HEALTH VACCINES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO PHYSICIANS, WHOLESALERS, PHYSICIAN

DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. MSDS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE

EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF ITS PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE

PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

2. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

MSD AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED. INTERCOMPANY

BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. CONTROLLING INTEREST IS DETERMINED BY MAJORITY OWNERSHIP

INTEREST AND THE ABSENCE OF SUBSTANTIVE THIRD-PARTY PARTICIPATING RIGHTS OR, IN THE CASE OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, BY MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO EXPECTED LOSSES, RESIDUAL RETURNS OR BOTH. FOR

THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE MSD OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100%, THE OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS

INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

IN EQUITY. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH MSD

HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST, SUCH AS INTERESTS IN ENTITIES OWNED

EQUALLY BY MSD AND A THIRD PARTY THAT ARE UNDER SHARED CONTROL, ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS 

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) WAS ADOPTED WHICH CHANGES THE WAY IN WHICH THE ACQUISITION METHOD IS TO BE

APPLIED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF THE MERGER OR ACQUISITION AT THEIR

RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARISE FROM CONTINGENCIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE IF FAIR VALUE CAN

REASONABLY BE ESTIMATED. IF THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET ACQUIRED OR LIABILITY

ASSUMED THAT ARISES FROM A CONTINGENCY CANNOT BE DETERMINED, THE ASSET OR LIABILITY IS RECOGNIZED

IF PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE; IF THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT MET, NO ASSET OR LIABILITY IS

RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXCHANGE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR AN ASSET OR PAID

TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY (AN EXIT PRICE) IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET FOR THE ASSET

OR LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

ACCORDINGLY, MSD MAY BE REQUIRED TO VALUE ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE MEASURES THAT DO NOT REFLECT MSDS

INTENDED USE OF THOSE ASSETS. ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE (CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED) OVER THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. TRANSACTION COSTS AND COSTS

TO RESTRUCTURE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS ARE REFLECTED IN MSDS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AFTER

THE DATE OF THE MERGER OR ACQUISITION. IF MSD DETERMINES THE ASSETS ACQUIRED DO NOT MEET THE

DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE TRANSACTION WILL BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, AND THEREFORE, NO

GOODWILL WILL BE RECORDED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR MSDS FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES.

CASH EQUIVALENTS 

CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE COMPRISED OF CERTAIN HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH

ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

INVENTORIES 

INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE COST OF A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF DOMESTIC PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED USING THE LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD FOR BOTH FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX PURPOSES. THE COST OF ALL OTHER

INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD. INVENTORIES CONSIST OF

CURRENTLY MARKETED PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN PRODUCTS AWAITING REGULATORY APPROVAL. IN EVALUATING THE

RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES, MSD CONSIDERS THE

PROBABILITY THAT REVENUE WILL BE OBTAINED FROM THE FUTURE SALE OF THE RELATED INVENTORY TOGETHER

WITH THE STATUS OF THE PRODUCT WITHIN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENTS

 INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE OF MSDS INVESTMENTS IS DETERMINED USING

QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR QUOTED PRICES FOR

SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE THAT ARE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY ARE REPORTED NET OF TAX IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) (

AOCI

). FOR DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE CHARGED TO

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

. MSD CONSIDERS

AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS OF ITS INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE DURATION

AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, MSDS ABILITY AND

INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

ON APRIL 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB WAS ADOPTED WHICH AMENDED THE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RECOGNITION GUIDANCE FOR DEBT SECURITIES. PURSUANT TO THIS NEW GUIDANCE, AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED IF MSD DOES NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED

COST BASIS OF THE DEBT SECURITY. IF MSD DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL THE IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITY, AND IT

IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE THE RECOVERY OF

ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE AMOUNT OF THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS,

RECORDED IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

, IS LIMITED TO THE PORTION ATTRIBUTED TO CREDIT LOSS. THE

REMAINING PORTION OF THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO OTHER FACTORS IS RECOGNIZED IN

AOCI

. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN

OTHER (INCOME)

EXPENSE, NET.

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

REVENUES FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY

AND WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ALSO REQUIRES

REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COLLECTION OF SALES PROCEEDS AND COMPLETION OF ALL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.

DOMESTICALLY, SALES DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS AS DIRECT DISCOUNTS AT THE POINT-OF-SALE OR

INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALER, KNOWN AS CHARGEBACKS, OR INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF

REBATES. ADDITIONALLY, SALES ARE GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF RETURN UNDER CERTAIN

CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, WHICH ARE

ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF SALE. ACCRUALS FOR CHARGEBACKS ARE REFLECTED AS A DIRECT REDUCTION TO

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUALS FOR REBATES ARE RECORDED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE ACCRUED

BALANCES RELATIVE TO THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

AND

ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT

LIABILITIES

WERE $50.4 MILLION AND $677.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

$55.6 MILLION AND $560.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

MSD RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF VACCINES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PLACEMENT INTO

STOCKPILES RELATED TO THE PEDIATRIC VACCINE STOCKPILE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) INTERPRETATION

, COMMISSION GUIDANCE REGARDING ACCOUNTING FOR SALES OF VACCINES

AND BIOTERROR COUNTERMEASURES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PLACEMENT INTO THE PEDIATRIC VACCINE

STOCKPILE OR THE STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE.

DEPRECIATION 

DEPRECIATION IS PROVIDED OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS,

PRINCIPALLY USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. FOR TAX PURPOSES, ACCELERATED METHODS ARE USED. THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO 50 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, AND FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS

FOR MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND OFFICE FURNISHINGS.

SOFTWARE CAPITALIZATION 

MSD CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING

OR DEVELOPING INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES, AND

PAYROLL COSTS FOR EMPLOYEES DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

AND AMORTIZED BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSET IS

SUBSTANTIALLY READY FOR USE. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MSDS MULTI-YEAR

IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER 6 TO

10 YEARS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $428 MILLION AND $330 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF REMAINING UNAMORTIZED CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INITIATIVE.

ALL OTHER CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS.

COSTS INCURRED DURING THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE AND POST-IMPLEMENTATION STAGE, AS WELL AS

MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING COSTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

GOODWILL 

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED. GOODWILL IS ASSIGNED TO REPORTING UNITS AND EVALUATED FOR

IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, USING A FAIR VALUE BASED TEST.

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES 

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES INCLUDE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT RIGHTS, TRADENAMES

AND PATENTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ASSIGNED AN ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, ARE AMORTIZED

PRIMARILY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS.

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVIEW, MSD WILL ASSESS RECOVERABILITY FROM FUTURE

OPERATIONS OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES USING PRETAX UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM THE LOWEST

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPROPRIATE ASSET GROUPINGS. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING RESULTS TO THE EXTENT

THAT CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DETERMINED BASED ON

THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) REPRESENTS

THE FAIR VALUE ASSIGNED TO INCOMPLETE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT MSD ACQUIRES THROUGH BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS, WHICH AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION, HAVE NOT REACHED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY. FOR

TRANSACTIONS THAT CLOSED PRIOR TO 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH PROJECTS WAS EXPENSED UPON

ACQUISITION. FOR TRANSACTIONS THAT CLOSED DURING 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECTS WERE

RECORDED AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET RATHER THAN EXPENSED. THE AMOUNTS

CAPITALIZED ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT

TESTING UNTIL COMPLETION OR ABANDONMENT OF THE PROJECTS. UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF EACH

PROJECT, MSD WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET AND BEGIN

AMORTIZATION. MSD TESTS ITS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, THROUGH A ONE-STEP TEST THAT COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS EXPENSED AS INCURRED. UPFRONT AND

MILESTONE PAYMENTS DUE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS

PRIOR TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PAYMENTS DUE TO THIRD PARTIES UPON OR

SUBSEQUENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE SHORTER OF THE REMAINING

LICENSE OR PRODUCT PATENT LIFE. NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES THAT WILL BE

USED IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN

PERFORMED OR WHEN THE GOODS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED RATHER THAN WHEN THE PAYMENT IS MADE.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

MSD EXPENSES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING

GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF

THE AWARDS.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS 

MSD RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. COSTS FOR ONE-TIME TERMINATION

BENEFITS IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE UNTIL TERMINATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE

THE BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD. EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS ARE

PRIMARILY RECORDED WHEN ACTIONS ARE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE.

CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS 

MSD RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

TAXES ON INCOME 

DEFERRED TAXES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND RATES. MSD

EVALUATES TAX POSITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE BENEFITS OF TAX POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX POSITION. FOR TAX POSITIONS

THAT ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, MSD RECOGNIZES THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF

THE BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON

AUDIT, MSD DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PORTION OF THE BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MSD

RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES AND EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITIONS AS A COMPONENT OF

TAXES ON INCOME

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

USE OF ESTIMATES 

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP) AND, ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDE

CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE USED

WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR AMOUNTS RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING FAIR

VALUE DETERMINATIONS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, ESTIMATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING

SUCH ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, DEPRECIABLE AND AMORTIZABLE LIVES,

RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORIES, INCLUDING THOSE PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES,

AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR CONTINGENCIES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER RESERVES, PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ASSUMPTIONS, RESTRUCTURING COSTS,

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL) AND INVESTMENTS, AND

TAXES ON INCOME. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER

FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS 

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM

WITH THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

DURING 2009, SEVERAL NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED

BY THE FASB WERE ADOPTED.

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WAS ADOPTED WHICH CHANGES THE WAY IN

WHICH THE ACQUISITION METHOD IS TO BE APPLIED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THIS GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN

ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR

VALUES WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION

BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, THAT ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT BE CAPITALIZED AND RECORDED AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND ALSO

REQUIRES TRANSACTION COSTS AND COSTS TO RESTRUCTURE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY BE EXPENSED. ON APRIL 1,

2009, ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WAS ISSUED FURTHER AMENDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION. MSDS BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW BEING ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THIS NEW GUIDANCE.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE FOR THE ACCOUNTING, REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE OF

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WAS ADOPTED WHICH REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS BE RECORDED AS EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW

GUIDANCE RESULTED IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF $2.4 BILLION OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (FORMERLY

REFERRED TO AS MINORITY INTERESTS) TO A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET (SEE NOTE 13). ADDITIONALLY, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS NOW SHOWN

SEPARATELY FROM PARENT NET INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN

RESTATED TO REFLECT THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW GUIDANCE.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES TO ALLOW FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR EFFECTS ON AN

ENTITYS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE NEW

GUIDANCE REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED GAINS AND

LOSSES IN A TABULAR FORMAT (SEE NOTE 7). SINCE THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES ONLY ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, THE ADOPTION DID NOT AFFECT MSDS FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED WHICH DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND

ESTABLISHES REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS IN A COLLABORATIVE

ARRANGEMENT AND BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THIRD PARTIES. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION

WAS NOT MATERIAL TO MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 6 FOR THE

ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES OF MSDS COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN

TRANSACTIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND IS EFFECTIVE ON

A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED WHICH CLARIFIES THAT A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET

(AN INTANGIBLE ASSET THAT THE ENTITY DOES NOT INTEND TO ACTIVELY USE, BUT INTENDS TO HOLD TO

PREVENT OTHERS FROM OBTAINING ACCESS TO THE ASSET) SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF

ACCOUNTING AND SHOULD BE ASSIGNED A USEFUL LIFE THAT REFLECTS THE ENTITYS CONSUMPTION OF THE

EXPECTED BENEFITS RELATED TO THE ASSET. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

ON APRIL 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED WHICH ESTABLISHES GENERAL STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTING

FOR AND DISCLOSURE OF EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE BUT BEFORE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED OR ARE AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED. THIS GUIDANCE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED ON

FEBRUARY 24, 2010 TO NO LONGER REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF THE DATE THROUGH WHICH AN ENTITY HAS EVALUATED

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION WAS NOT MATERIAL.

ON APRIL 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES FOR ESTIMATING

FAIR VALUE WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY IN RELATION TO THE NORMAL MARKET ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY (OR SIMILAR

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES). IN ADDITION, THE NEW GUIDANCE INCLUDES GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE A TRANSACTION FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY IS NOT ORDERLY, IN WHICH CASE

THE ENTITY SHALL PLACE LITTLE, IF ANY, WEIGHT ON THAT TRANSACTION PRICE AS AN INDICATOR OF FAIR

VALUE. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WAS NOT

MATERIAL.

ON APRIL 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED WHICH AMENDED THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RECOGNITION

GUIDANCE FOR DEBT SECURITIES. THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR EQUITY SECURITIES WAS NOT AFFECTED. AN

IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS AMORTIZED

COST BASIS. PURSUANT TO THIS NEW GUIDANCE, AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED IF MSD

DOES NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE DEBT SECURITY. IF MSD DOES NOT

INTEND TO SELL THE IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITY, AND IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL BE REQUIRED

TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE THE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE AMOUNT OF THE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IS LIMITED TO THE PORTION ATTRIBUTED TO

CREDIT LOSS. THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO OTHER FACTORS

IS RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

. IN DETERMINING IF CREDIT LOSSES HAVE OCCURRED,

MSD EVALUATES WHETHER EXPECTED CASH FLOWS TO BE RECEIVED ARE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE AMORTIZED

COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY. THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ADOPTION OR DURING

THE PERIOD FROM ADOPTION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD ADOPTED NEW GUIDANCE AMENDING EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE

WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON AN EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT PLAN ASSETS OF DEFINED PENSION OR OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT PLAN ASSETS INCLUDING

HOW INVESTMENT ALLOCATION DECISIONS ARE MADE, THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS, THE INPUTS AND

VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3) ON CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS FOR THE

PERIOD, AND SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS. SINCE THE AMENDED GUIDANCE

REQUIRED ONLY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT MSDS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS (SEE

NOTE 15), THE ADOPTION DID NOT AFFECT MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

DURING 2009, THE FASB ISSUED SEVERAL NEW ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS, WHICH ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE FOR MSD.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO THE ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010. THE AMENDMENT ELIMINATES THE

CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DERECOGNIZING

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS WITH

GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS,

AND AN ENTITYS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN AND EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS RELATED TO TRANSFERRED

FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS

NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

ALSO IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB AMENDED THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE FOR THE

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010. THE AMENDED

GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES INTENDED TO PROVIDE USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH MORE

TRANSPARENT INFORMATION ABOUT AN ENTERPRISES INVOLVEMENT IN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. THE EFFECT

OF ADOPTION ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE

DELIVERABLES, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED IN

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JUNE 15, 2010, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THIS

GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE RESIDUAL METHOD UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE AND REPLACES IT WITH THE

RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD WHEN ALLOCATING REVENUE IN A MULTIPLE DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENT. THE

SELLING PRICE FOR EACH DELIVERABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED USING VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF

SELLING PRICE, IF IT EXISTS, OTHERWISE THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE SHALL BE USED. IF

NEITHER EXISTS FOR A DELIVERABLE, THE VENDOR SHALL USE ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE FOR

THAT DELIVERABLE. AFTER ADOPTION, THIS GUIDANCE WILL ALSO REQUIRE EXPANDED QUALITATIVE AND

QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES. MSD IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON ITS FINANCIAL

POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB AMENDED THE EXISTING DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS,

WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, EXCEPT FOR DISCLOSURES ABOUT PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND

SETTLEMENTS IN THE ROLL FORWARD OF ACTIVITY IN LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2011. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE FOR THE

AMOUNTS OF SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS IN AND OUT OF LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 MEASUREMENTS AND REQUIRES

CERTAIN LEVEL 3 DISCLOSURES ON A GROSS BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THE UPDATES AMEND EXISTING GUIDANCE TO

REQUIRE A GREATER LEVEL OF DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION AND MORE ROBUST DISCLOSURES ABOUT VALUATION

TECHNIQUES AND INPUTS TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SINCE THE AMENDED GUIDANCE REQUIRES ONLY

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION WILL NOT IMPACT MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

3. MERGER WITH SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

ON NOVEMBER 3, 2009, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH COMPLETED THE MERGER. IN THE MERGER,

SCHERING-PLOUGH ACQUIRED ALL OF THE SHARES OF MSD, WHICH BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

SCHERING-PLOUGH AND WAS RENAMED MERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP. SCHERING-PLOUGH CONTINUED AS THE

SURVIVING PUBLIC COMPANY AND WAS RENAMED MERCK & CO., INC. MSD SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED ONE SHARE OF

COMMON STOCK OF MSDS PARENT COMPANY FOR EACH SHARE OF STOCK THAT THEY OWNED.

4. RESTRUCTURING

MERGER RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN FEBRUARY 2010, MSDS PARENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST PHASE OF A NEW GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM (THE MERGER RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM) IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INTEGRATION OF THE LEGACY MSD

AND LEGACY SCHERING-PLOUGH BUSINESSES. THIS MERGER RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO OPTIMIZE

THE COST STRUCTURE OF MSDS PARENT COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AS PART OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE

MERGER RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, BY THE END OF 2012, MSDS PARENT COMPANY EXPECTS TO REDUCE ITS TOTAL

WORKFORCE BY APPROXIMATELY 15% ACROSS ALL AREAS OF THE COMPANY WORLDWIDE. THESE

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS WILL PRIMARILY COME FROM THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATIVE POSITIONS IN

SALES, ADMINISTRATIVE AND HEADQUARTERS ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS FROM THE CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS. THIS FIRST PHASE OF THE MERGER

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2012 WITH THE TOTAL PRETAX COSTS,

INCLUDING THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO MSD, ESTIMATED TO BE $2.6 BILLION TO $3.3 BILLION. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, SEPARATION COSTS UNDER EXISTING SEVERANCE

PROGRAMS WORLDWIDE WERE RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 TO THE EXTENT SUCH COSTS WERE

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. COSTS UNDER VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS WILL BE

RECORDED IN 2010 AS THE RELEVANT CRITERIA ARE MET. APPROXIMATELY 85% OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS

ARE ESTIMATED TO BE CASH OUTLAYS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION EXPENSE. APPROXIMATELY

15% OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH, RELATING PRIMARILY TO THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION

OF FACILITIES TO BE CLOSED OR DIVESTED.

MSD RECORDED PRETAX RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $403.8 MILLION IN 2009 FOR ITS ESTIMATED PORTION OF

THE MERGER RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM COSTS, PRIMARILY REPRESENTING EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS.

2008 GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN OCTOBER 2008, MSD ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM (THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM) TO REDUCE ITS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS. AS PART

OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, MSD EXPECTS TO ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,200 POSITIONS  6,800

ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND 400 VACANCIES  ACROSS ALL AREAS OF MSD WORLDWIDE BY THE END OF 2011. ABOUT

40% OF THESE TOTAL REDUCTIONS WILL OCCUR IN THE UNITED STATES. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM, MSD IS STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT LAYERS BY REDUCING ITS TOTAL NUMBER OF SENIOR AND MID-LEVEL

EXECUTIVES GLOBALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 4,910 POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN

CONNECTION WITH 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS AND THE ELIMINATION

OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS. DURING 2009, BASIC RESEARCH FACILITIES IN POMEZIA, ITALY AND

TSUKUBA, JAPAN WERE SOLD AND THE OPERATIONS CONDUCTED AT THE BASIC RESEARCH FACILITY IN SEATTLE

WERE CLOSED. MSD HAS ALSO SOLD OR CLOSED CERTAIN OTHER FACILITIES AND SOLD RELATED ASSETS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, SEPARATION COSTS UNDER EXISTING SEVERANCE

PROGRAMS WORLDWIDE WERE RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 TO THE EXTENT SUCH COSTS WERE

PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. MSD COMMENCED ACCRUING COSTS RELATED TO ONE-TIME TERMINATION BENEFITS

OFFERED TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 AS THAT IS

WHEN THE NECESSARY CRITERIA WERE MET. PRETAX RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $474.7 MILLION AND

$921.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE RECORDED RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN 2009 AND

2008. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD HAS RECORDED

TOTAL PRETAX ACCUMULATED COSTS OF $1.4 BILLION. THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE

COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2011 WITH THE TOTAL PRETAX COSTS ESTIMATED TO BE $1.6 BILLION TO

$2.0 BILLION. MSD ESTIMATES THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS RELATE TO CASH OUTLAYS,

PRIMARILY FROM EMPLOYEE SEPARATION EXPENSE. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS

ARE NON-CASH, RELATING PRIMARILY TO THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF FACILITIES TO BE CLOSED OR

DIVESTED.

2005 GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN NOVEMBER 2005, MSD ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM (THE 2005 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM) DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS

WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AT THE END OF 2008.

SEPARATION COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AS WELL AS THOSE HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS WHICH WERE PROBABLE AND COULD BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. APPROXIMATELY 3,185 POSITIONS

WERE ELIMINATED IN 2009 OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 3,160 RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM AND

APPROXIMATELY 25 RELATED TO THE MERGER RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. DURING 2009, CERTAIN EMPLOYEES

ANTICIPATED TO BE SEPARATED AS PART OF PLANNED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS FOR THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM WERE INSTEAD TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALE OF A FACILITY.

ACCORDINGLY, THE ACCRUAL OF SEPARATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EMPLOYEES WAS REVERSED RESULTING

IN A REDUCTION TO EXPENSES. APPROXIMATELY 5,800 POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED IN 2008 OF WHICH

APPROXIMATELY 1,750 RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM AND 4,050 RELATED TO THE 2005

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY 2,400 POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED IN 2007 IN CONNECTION WITH THE

2005 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THESE POSITION ELIMINATIONS ARE COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS.

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH FACILITIES TO BE

SOLD OR CLOSED AS PART OF THE PROGRAMS. ALL OF THE SITES HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE UP

THROUGH THE RESPECTIVE CLOSURE DATES, AND SINCE FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE

RESPECTIVE BOOK VALUES, MSD WAS REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION OF THE SITE ASSETS RATHER THAN

WRITE THEM OFF IMMEDIATELY. THE SITE ASSETS INCLUDE MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH FACILITIES AND

EQUIPMENT.

OTHER ACTIVITY IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007 INCLUDES $14.9 MILLION, $29.4 MILLION AND $39.4 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF ASSET ABANDONMENT, SHUT-DOWN AND OTHER RELATED COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER ACTIVITY

INCLUDES $22.7 MILLION, $68.4 MILLION AND $18.9 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY,

RELATED TO CURTAILMENT, SETTLEMENT AND TERMINATION CHARGES ON PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS (SEE NOTE 15). OTHER ACTIVITY ALSO REFLECTS PRETAX LOSSES RESULTING FROM SALES OF

FACILITIES AND RELATED ASSETS IN 2009 OF $57.9 MILLION AND PRETAX GAINS ON SUCH SALES IN 2008 OF

$61.5 MILLION.

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL IN ANY PERIOD.

5. ACQUISITIONS, RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2009, MSD AND AVECIA INVESTMENTS LIMITED ANNOUNCED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT UNDER

WHICH MSD WOULD ACQUIRE THE BIOLOGICS BUSINESS OF THE AVECIA GROUP FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF

$180 MILLION. AVECIA BIOLOGICS IS A CONTRACT MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN

MICROBIAL-DERIVED BIOLOGICS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MSD WOULD ACQUIRE AVECIA BIOLOGICS

LIMITED (AVECIA) AND ALL OF ITS ASSETS, INCLUDING ALL AVECIAS PROCESS DEVELOPMENT AND SCALE-UP,

MANUFACTURING, QUALITY AND BUSINESS SUPPORT OPERATIONS LOCATED IN BILLINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM. THIS

TRANSACTION CLOSED ON FEBRUARY 1, 2010, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS WILL BE INCLUDED IN MSDS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE.

IN SEPTEMBER 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH CSL

BIOTHERAPIES (CSL), A SUBSIDIARY OF CSL LIMITED, TO MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE

AFLURIA

, CSLS SEASONAL

INFLUENZA (FLU) VACCINE, IN THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE 2010/2011-2015/2016 FLU SEASONS. UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MSD WILL ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL ASPECTS OF COMMERCIALIZATION OF

AFLURIA

IN THE UNITED STATES. CSL WILL SUPPLY

AFLURIA

TO MSD AND WILL RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR

MARKETING THE VACCINE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

AFLURIA

IS INDICATED FOR THE ACTIVE IMMUNIZATION

OF PERSONS AGES 6 MONTHS AND OLDER AGAINST INFLUENZA DISEASE CAUSED BY INFLUENZA VIRUS SUBTYPES A

AND TYPE B PRESENT IN THE VACCINE.

IN JULY 2009, MSD AND PORTOLA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (PORTOLA) SIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE GLOBAL

COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF BETRIXABAN

(MK-4448), AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL FACTOR XA INHIBITOR ANTICOAGULANT CURRENTLY IN PHASE II CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PREVENTION OF STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. IN RETURN FOR AN

EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO BETRIXABAN, MSD PAID PORTOLA AN INITIAL FEE OF $50 MILLION AT

CLOSING, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE. PORTOLA IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE

ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS TOTALING UP TO $420 MILLION UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT,

REGULATORY AND COMMERCIALIZATION MILESTONES, AS WELL AS DOUBLE-DIGIT ROYALTIES ON WORLDWIDE SALES

OF BETRIXABAN, IF APPROVED. MSD WILL ASSUME ALL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION COSTS,

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDING THE COSTS OF PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS. PORTOLA RETAINED AN OPTION (A) TO

CO-FUND PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS IN RETURN FOR ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES AND (B) TO CO-PROMOTE

BETRIXABAN WITH MSD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT COMMENCED IN AUGUST 2009 AND,

UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER, WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THERE ARE NO REMAINING ROYALTY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS

AGREEMENT MAY BE TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY IN THE EVENT OF A MATERIAL UNCURED BREACH OR BANKRUPTCY

OF A PARTY. THE AGREEMENT MAY BE TERMINATED BY MSD IN THE EVENT THAT THE PARTIES OR MSD DECIDE TO

CEASE DEVELOPMENT OF BETRIXABAN FOR SAFETY OR EFFICACY. IN ADDITION, MSD MAY TERMINATE THE

AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME UPON 180 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE. PORTOLA MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IN

THE EVENT THAT MSD CHALLENGES ANY PORTOLA PATENT COVERING BETRIXABAN. UPON TERMINATION OF THE

AGREEMENT, DEPENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PARTIES HAVE VARYING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF BETRIXABAN AND, IN THE CASE OF

TERMINATION FOR CAUSE BY MSD, CERTAIN ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS.

IN APRIL 2009, MSD, MEDAREX, INC. (MEDAREX) AND MASSACHUSETTS BIOLOGIC LABORATORIES (MBL)

OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SCHOOL ANNOUNCED AN EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE

AGREEMENT FOR CDA-1 AND CDB-1 (MK-3415A) (ALSO KNOWN AS MDX-066/MDX-1388 AND MBL-CDA1/MBL-CDB1), AN

INVESTIGATIONAL FULLY HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY COMBINATION DEVELOPED TO TARGET AND NEUTRALIZE

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE

TOXINS A AND B, FOR THE TREATMENT OF

C. DIFFICILE

INFECTION. CDA-1 AND CDB-1

WERE CO-DEVELOPED BY MEDAREX AND MBL. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MSD GAINED WORLDWIDE RIGHTS

TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE CDA-1 AND CDB-1. MEDAREX AND MBL RECEIVED AN AGGREGATE UPFRONT PAYMENT

OF $60 MILLION UPON CLOSING, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE, AND ARE

POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS UP TO $165 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE UPON

ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF A DRUG CANDIDATE

COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. UPON COMMERCIALIZATION, MEDAREX AND MBL WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE

DOUBLE-DIGIT ROYALTIES ON PRODUCT SALES AND MILESTONES IF CERTAIN SALES TARGETS ARE MET. THE TERM

OF THE AGREEMENT COMMENCED ON THE CLOSING DATE AND, UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER, WILL CONTINUE UNTIL

THERE ARE NO REMAINING ROYALTY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS IN A COUNTRY, AT WHICH TIME THE AGREEMENT WILL

EXPIRE IN ITS ENTIRETY IN SUCH COUNTRY. EITHER PARTY MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT FOR UNCURED

MATERIAL BREACH BY THE OTHER PARTY, OR BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY OF THE OTHER PARTY. MSD MAY

TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME UPON PROVIDING 180 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE TO MEDAREX AND

MBL.

ALSO, IN APRIL 2009, MSD AND SANTEN PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. (SANTEN) ANNOUNCED A WORLDWIDE

LICENSING AGREEMENT FOR TAFLUPROST (MK-2452), A PROSTAGLANDIN ANALOGUE UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE

UNITED STATES. TAFLUPROST, PRESERVED AND PRESERVATIVE-FREE FORMULATIONS, HAS RECEIVED MARKETING

APPROVAL FOR THE REDUCTION OF ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA AND OCULAR

HYPERTENSION IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN AND NORDIC COUNTRIES AS WELL AS JAPAN AND HAS BEEN FILED FOR

APPROVAL IN ADDITIONAL EUROPEAN AND ASIA PACIFIC MARKETS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MSD

PAID A FEE, WHICH WAS CAPITALIZED AND WILL BE AMORTIZED TO

MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION

COSTS OVER THE

LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING PATENT, AND WILL PAY MILESTONES AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS BASED ON FUTURE SALES

OF TAFLUPROST (BOTH PRESERVED AND PRESERVATIVE-FREE FORMULATIONS) IN EXCHANGE FOR EXCLUSIVE

COMMERCIAL RIGHTS TO TAFLUPROST IN WESTERN EUROPE (EXCLUDING GERMANY), NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA

AND AFRICA. SANTEN WILL RETAIN COMMERCIAL RIGHTS TO TAFLUPROST IN MOST COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE,

NORTHERN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC, INCLUDING JAPAN. MSD WILL PROVIDE PROMOTION SUPPORT TO SANTEN IN

GERMANY AND POLAND. IF TAFLUPROST IS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES, SANTEN HAS AN OPTION TO

CO-PROMOTE IT THERE. THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN MSD AND SANTEN EXPIRES ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS ON

THE LAST TO OCCUR OF (A) THE EXPIRY OF THE LAST TO EXPIRE VALID PATENT CLAIM; OR (B) THE EXPIRATION

OF THE LAST TO EXPIRE ROYALTY. MSD MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME UPON 90 DAYS PRIOR

WRITTEN NOTICE AND ALSO AT ANY TIME UPON 60 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE IF MSD DETERMINES THAT THE

PRODUCT PRESENTS ISSUES OF SAFETY OR TOLERABILITY. IN ADDITION, MSD MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IN

THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE ENUMERATED AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SANTEN AND THE CO-OWNER/LICENSOR OF CERTAIN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TERMINATE OR EXPIRE AND THIS MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTS MSD. IF EITHER MSD

OR SANTEN MATERIALLY BREACHES THE AGREEMENT AND FAILS TO CURE AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE, THEN THE

NON-BREACHING PARTY MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR TERMINATION BY THE

NON-INSOLVENT PARTY DUE TO BANKRUPTCY BY THE OTHER PARTY. FINALLY, THE AGREEMENT WILL TERMINATE IF,

DURING THE TERM, MSD DEVELOPS OR COMMERCIALIZES A COMPETITIVE PRODUCT (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN

THE AGREEMENT).

IN ADDITION, IN APRIL 2009, MSD AND CARDIOME PHARMA CORP. (CARDIOME) ANNOUNCED A

COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF VERNAKALANT

(MK-6621), AN INVESTIGATIONAL CANDIDATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. THE AGREEMENT

PROVIDES MSD WITH EXCLUSIVE GLOBAL RIGHTS TO THE ORAL FORMULATION OF VERNAKALANT (VERNAKALANT

(ORAL)) FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF NORMAL HEART RHYTHM IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, AND

PROVIDES AN MSD AFFILIATE, MERCK SHARP & DOHME (SWITZERLAND) GMBH, WITH EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS OUTSIDE OF

THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO TO THE INTRAVENOUS (IV) FORMULATION OF VERNAKALANT

(VERNAKALANT (IV)) FOR RAPID CONVERSION OF ACUTE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION TO NORMAL HEART RHYTHM.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MSD PAID CARDIOME AN INITIAL FEE OF $60 MILLION UPON CLOSING,

WHICH WAS RECORDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, CARDIOME IS ELIGIBLE TO

RECEIVE UP TO $200 MILLION IN PAYMENTS BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH

THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF VERNAKALANT PRODUCTS (INCLUDING $15 MILLION FOR SUBMISSION FOR

REGULATORY APPROVAL IN EUROPE OF VERNAKALANT (IV), WHICH MSD PAID IN 2009 AS A RESULT OF THAT

SUBMISSION, AND $20 MILLION FOR INITIATION OF A PLANNED PHASE III PROGRAM FOR VERNAKALANT

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(ORAL)) AND UP TO $100 MILLION FOR MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH APPROVALS IN OTHER SUBSEQUENT

INDICATIONS OF BOTH THE INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL FORMULATIONS. ALSO, CARDIOME WILL RECEIVE TIERED

ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES OF ANY APPROVED PRODUCTS AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RECEIVE UP TO

$340 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT SALES THRESHOLDS. CARDIOME

HAS RETAINED AN OPTION TO CO-PROMOTE VERNAKALANT (ORAL) WITH MSD THROUGH A HOSPITAL-BASED SALES

FORCE IN THE UNITED STATES. MSD WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL FUTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THESE CANDIDATES. MSD HAS GRANTED CARDIOME A

SECURED, INTEREST-BEARING CREDIT FACILITY OF UP TO $100 MILLION THAT CARDIOME MAY ACCESS IN

TRANCHES OVER SEVERAL YEARS COMMENCING IN 2010. CARDIOMES CO-DEVELOPMENT PARTNER IN NORTH AMERICA,

ASTELLAS PHARMA U.S., INC., SUBMITTED AN NDA WITH THE FDA FOR KYNAPID (VERNAKALANT HYDROCHLORIDE)

INJECTION IN DECEMBER 2006 THAT INCLUDED RESULTS FROM TWO PIVOTAL PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS. IN

DECEMBER 2007, THE CARDIOVASCULAR AND RENAL DRUGS ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THAT THE FDA

APPROVE VERNAKALANT (IV) FOR RAPID CONVERSION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. IN AUGUST 2008, THE FDA

ISSUED AN APPROVABLE ACTION LETTER REQUESTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. A PHASE IIB DOUBLE-BLIND,

PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED, DOSE-RANGING CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS AT RISK OF RECURRENT ATRIAL

FIBRILLATION SHOWED THAT, AT THE 500 MG DOSE, VERNAKALANT (ORAL) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE RATE OF

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION RELAPSE AS COMPARED TO PLACEBO. THIS AGREEMENT CONTINUES IN EFFECT UNTIL THE

EXPIRATION OF CARDIOMES CO-PROMOTION RIGHTS AND ALL ROYALTY AND MILESTONE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE TERMINATED IN THE EVENT OF INSOLVENCY OR A MATERIAL UNCURED BREACH BY EITHER

PARTY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COLLABORATION MAY BE TERMINATED BY MSD IN THE EVENT THAT MSD DETERMINES

(IN GOOD FAITH) THAT IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIALIZATION OF A

VERNAKALANT PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. IN ADDITION, MSD MAY TERMINATE THE

AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME UPON 12 MONTHS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE. CARDIOME MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IN

THE EVENT THAT MSD CHALLENGES ANY CARDIOME PATENT COVERING VERNAKALANT. UPON TERMINATION OF THE

AGREEMENT, DEPENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PARTIES HAVE VARYING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF VERNAKALANT AND IN SOME CASES

CONTINUING ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS.

IN MARCH 2009, MSD ACQUIRED INSMED INC.S (INSMED) PORTFOLIO OF FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC

THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES AND ITS COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN BOULDER, COLORADO.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MSD PAID INSMED AN AGGREGATE OF $130 MILLION IN CASH TO ACQUIRE

ALL RIGHTS TO THE BOULDER FACILITIES AND INSMEDS PIPELINE OF FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC CANDIDATES.

INSMEDS FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES TWO CLINICAL CANDIDATES: MK-4214, AN

INVESTIGATIONAL RECOMBINANT GRANULOCYTE-COLONY STIMULATING FACTOR (G-CSF) THAT WILL BE EVALUATED

FOR ITS ABILITY TO PREVENT INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY, AND MK-6302,

A PEGYLATED RECOMBINANT G-CSF DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR LESS FREQUENT DOSING. THE TRANSACTION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION; ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED

WERE RECORDED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR

VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ACQUISITION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO INSMEDS FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS

PORTFOLIO (MK-4214 AND MK-6302) AND AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET WAS RECORDED. THE FAIR

VALUE WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF NEW PRODUCT

CANDIDATES RESULTING FROM INSMEDS FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS PORTFOLIO ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF

THEIR ESTIMATED TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING AN INCOME APPROACH REFLECTING APPROPRIATE

RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY RELATED TO MK-4214 AND MK-6302 IS NOT EXPECTED

TO BE MATERIAL TO MSDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. THE REMAINING NET ASSETS ACQUIRED WERE

NOT MATERIAL AND THERE WERE NO OTHER MILESTONE OR ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ACQUISITION. THIS TRANSACTION CLOSED ON MARCH 31, 2009, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN MSDS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2009.

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, MSD AND JAPAN TOBACCO INC. (JT) SIGNED A WORLDWIDE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO

DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305 (MK-5442), AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL OSTEOANABOLIC (BONE GROWTH

STIMULATING) AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS, A DISEASE WHICH REDUCES BONE DENSITY AND

STRENGTH AND RESULTS IN AN INCREASED RISK OF BONE FRACTURES. JTT-305 IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL

CALCIUM SENSING RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED BY JT IN PHASE II CLINICAL

TRIALS IN JAPAN FOR ITS EFFECT ON INCREASING BONE DENSITY AND IS IN PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS OUTSIDE

OF JAPAN. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MSD GAINED WORLDWIDE RIGHTS, EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, TO

DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305 AND CERTAIN OTHER RELATED COMPOUNDS. JT RECEIVED AN UPFRONT

PAYMENT OF $85 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE, AND IS ELIGIBLE TO

RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF A DRUG CANDIDATE COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. JT WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO

RECEIVE ROYALTIES FROM SALES OF ANY DRUG CANDIDATES THAT RECEIVE MARKETING APPROVAL. THE LICENSE

AGREEMENT BETWEEN MSD AND JT WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL EXPIRATION OF ALL ROYALTY AND MILESTONE

OBLIGATIONS, AND MAY BE TERMINATED IN THE EVENT OF AN UNCURED MATERIAL BREACH BY THE OTHER PARTY.

THE AGREEMENT MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED BY MSD WITHOUT CAUSE BEFORE INITIAL COMMERCIAL SALE OF JTT-305

BY GIVING SIX MONTHS PRIOR NOTICE TO JT, AND THEREAFTER BY GIVING ONE YEAR PRIOR NOTICE THEREOF TO

JT. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY BY MSD IF MSD DETERMINES DUE TO SAFETY

AND/OR EFFICACY CONCERNS BASED ON AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO CEASE DEVELOPMENT OF JTT-305

AND/OR TO WITHDRAW JTT-305 FROM THE MARKET ON A PERMANENT BASIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, MSD COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA, INC. (NOVACARDIA), A

PRIVATELY HELD CLINICAL-STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. MSD

ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF NOVACARDIA FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $366.4 MILLION

(INCLUDING $16.4 MILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS ON HAND AT CLOSING), WHICH WAS PAID THROUGH THE

ISSUANCE OF 7.3 MILLION SHARES OF MSD COMMON STOCK TO THE FORMER NOVACARDIA SHAREHOLDERS BASED ON

MSDS AVERAGE CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, MSD RECORDED A CHARGE OF $325.1 MILLION FOR IN-PROCESS RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418), NOVACARDIAS INVESTIGATIONAL PHASE III

COMPOUND FOR ACUTE HEART FAILURE, AS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT

BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE CHARGE, WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX

PURPOSES, WAS RECORDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE

PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR THE

ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF ITS TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS AT THAT TIME UTILIZING AN INCOME

APPROACH REFLECTING AN APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 22.0%. THE REMAINING PURCHASE

PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF $16.4 MILLION, A DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATING TO A

NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD OF $23.9 MILLION AND OTHER NET ASSETS OF $1.0 MILLION. BECAUSE

NOVACARDIA WAS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS,

THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION

AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED. NOVACARDIAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

MSDS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE. IN JUNE 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED THAT

PRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR THE PIVOTAL PHASE III STUDY OF ROLOFYLLINE SHOWED THAT ROLOFYLLINE DID NOT

MEET THE PRIMARY OR SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS. MSD TERMINATED THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

FOR ROLOFYLLINE.

ALSO IN 2007, MSD AND GTX, INC. (GTX) ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR A RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL STRATEGIC COLLABORATION FOR SELECTIVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS

(SARMS), A NEW INVESTIGATIONAL CLASS OF DRUGS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT AGE-RELATED MUSCLE LOSS

(SARCOPENIA) AS WELL AS OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. MSD HAS DISCONTINUED INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT

OF MK-2866 (WHICH IS A SARM) UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND HAS SUBSEQUENTLY TERMINATED ITS AGREEMENT

WITH GTX.

ALSO IN 2007, MSD AND ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (ARIAD) ENTERED INTO A GLOBAL

COLLABORATION TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE RIDAFOROLIMUS (MK-8669), ARIADS NOVEL MTOR

INHIBITOR, FOR USE IN CANCER. THIS COLLABORATION GENERALLY CONTINUES IN EFFECT UNTIL THE EXPIRATION

OF ALL ROYALTY AND MILESTONE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS. THIS COLLABORATION MAY GENERALLY BE TERMINATED IN

THE EVENT OF INSOLVENCY OR A MATERIAL UNCURED BREACH BY EITHER PARTY. THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENT

BETWEEN MSD AND ARIAD MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED BY MSD UPON THE FAILURE OF MK-8669 TO MEET CERTAIN

DEVELOPMENTAL AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS OR IN THE EVENT MSD CONCLUDES IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO CONTINUE

THE DEVELOPMENT OF MK-8669 FOR USE IN A CANCER INDICATION. IN ADDITION, MSD MAY TERMINATE THE ARIAD

COLLABORATION AGREEMENT ON OR AFTER THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE BY PROVIDING AT

LEAST 12 MONTHS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE. UPON TERMINATION OF THE ARIAD COLLABORATION AGREEMENT,

DEPENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PARTIES HAVE VARYING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MK-8669 AND CONTINUING ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS.

6. COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

MSD CONTINUES ITS STRATEGY OF ESTABLISHING EXTERNAL ALLIANCES TO COMPLEMENT ITS SUBSTANTIAL

INTERNAL RESEARCH CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, LICENSING PRECLINICAL AND

CLINICAL COMPOUNDS AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS TO DRIVE BOTH NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. MSD

SUPPLEMENTS ITS INTERNAL RESEARCH WITH AN AGGRESSIVE LICENSING AND EXTERNAL ALLIANCE STRATEGY

FOCUSED ON THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF COLLABORATIONS FROM EARLY RESEARCH TO LATE-STAGE COMPOUNDS, AS

WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS OFTEN

INCLUDE UPFRONT PAYMENTS AND ROYALTY OR PROFIT SHARE PAYMENTS, CONTINGENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF

CERTAIN FUTURE EVENTS LINKED TO THE SUCCESS OF THE ASSET IN DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS EXPENSE

REIMBURSEMENTS OR PAYMENTS TO THE THIRD PARTY.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2, ON JANUARY 1, 2009, NEW GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB WAS ADOPTED WHICH

DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTABLISHES REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN

PARTICIPANTS IN A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT AND BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THIRD

PARTIES. MSD REVIEWED ITS THIRD PARTY ARRANGEMENTS TO DETERMINE IF ANY ARRANGEMENT IS WITHIN THE

SCOPE OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE. EACH ARRANGEMENT IS UNIQUE IN NATURE AND MSDS MOST SIGNIFICANT

ARRANGEMENT IS DISCUSSED BELOW.

COZAAR/HYZAAR

IN 1989, MSD AND E.I. DUPONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY (DUPONT) AGREED TO FORM A LONG-TERM

RESEARCH AND MARKETING COLLABORATION TO DEVELOP A CLASS OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR HIGH BLOOD

PRESSURE AND HEART DISEASE, DISCOVERED BY DUPONT, CALLED ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS, WHICH

INCLUDE

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

. IN RETURN, MSD PROVIDED DUPONT MARKETING RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND

CANADA TO ITS PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES,

SINEMET

AND

SINEMET CR

. PURSUANT TO A 1994 AGREEMENT WITH

DUPONT, MSD HAS AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO MARKET

PATENT PROTECTION IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN FEBRUARY 2010.

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

MSD MANAGES THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS ON ITS

EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND

THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF MSDS REVENUES AND EARNINGS IN FOREIGN AFFILIATES IS EXPOSED TO

CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE OBJECTIVES AND ACCOUNTING RELATED TO MSDS FOREIGN CURRENCY

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS ITS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED

BELOW.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF MSDS REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. MSD RELIES ON

SUSTAINED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM FOREIGN SOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THE EXTENT THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CASH FLOWS IS

DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF A STRENGTHENING DOLLAR, MSDS ABILITY TO FUND RESEARCH AND OTHER

DOLLAR-BASED STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AT A CONSISTENT LEVEL MAY BE IMPAIRED. MSD HAS ESTABLISHED

REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST VOLATILITY OF FUTURE

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES AT ITS U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ENTITIES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR LONGER-TERM

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS

DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. TO ACHIEVE

THIS OBJECTIVE, MSD WILL PARTIALLY HEDGE FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED THIRD PARTY AND

INTERCOMPANY DISTRIBUTOR ENTITY SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER ITS PLANNING CYCLE, TYPICALLY

NO MORE THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. MSD WILL LAYER IN HEDGES OVER TIME, INCREASING THE

PORTION OF THIRD PARTY AND INTERCOMPANY DISTRIBUTOR ENTITY SALES HEDGED AS IT GETS CLOSER TO THE

EXPECTED DATE OF THE FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, SUCH THAT IT IS PROBABLE THE

HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. THE PORTION OF SALES HEDGED IS BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF COST-BENEFIT

PROFILES THAT CONSIDER NATURAL OFFSETTING EXPOSURES, REVENUE AND EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITIES AND

CORRELATIONS, AND THE COST OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES ARE A SPECIFIED

COMPONENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF SIMILARLY DENOMINATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-BASED SALES TRANSACTIONS, EACH

OF WHICH RESPONDS TO THE HEDGED RISK IN THE SAME MANNER. MSD MANAGES ITS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION

EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS, WHICH PROVIDE MSD WITH A RIGHT, BUT

NOT AN OBLIGATION, TO SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT A PREDETERMINED PRICE. IF THE

U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, TOTAL CHANGES IN

THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS OFFSET THE DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS OF THE

HEDGED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS, THE OPTIONS VALUE REDUCES

TO ZERO, BUT MSD BENEFITS FROM THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH

FLOWS. MSD ALSO UTILIZES FORWARD CONTRACTS IN ITS REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE INCREASE IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS OFFSETS THE DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS

OF THE HEDGED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS, THE DECREASE IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS OFFSETS THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.

THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AS EITHER ASSETS (GAIN POSITIONS) OR LIABILITIES (LOSS POSITIONS) IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. ACCORDINGLY, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON

THESE CONTRACTS IS RECORDED IN

AOCI

AND RECLASSIFIED INTO

SALES

WHEN THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED REVENUE

IS RECOGNIZED. THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN

DE

MINIMIS

. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT THE

U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS FROM THE EFFECTS OF

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEIR CONVERSION TO U.S. DOLLARS. IN THESE

INSTANCES, MSD PRINCIPALLY UTILIZES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ENABLE MSD TO BUY AND SELL

FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES AND ECONOMICALLY OFFSET THE CONSEQUENCES

OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM THE NET ASSETS.

MSD ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES DENOMINATED IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRY CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. FOR EXPOSURES IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRY CURRENCIES, MSD WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF

EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES WHEN IT IS DEEMED ECONOMICAL TO DO SO BASED ON A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT

CONSIDERS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EXPOSURE, THE VOLATILITY OF THE EXCHANGE RATE AND THE COST OF THE

HEDGING INSTRUMENT. MSD WILL ALSO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE ON MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES BY MANAGING OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND NET ASSET POSITIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REMEASURED AT SPOT RATES IN

EFFECT ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE WITH THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SPOT RATES REPORTED IN

MITIGATE THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE REMEASURED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES

IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE SPOT-FORWARD DIFFERENCES. THESE

DIFFERENCES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE

AVERAGE MATURITIES AT INCEPTION OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR.

WHEN APPLICABLE, MSD USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED SECURITIES DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN SPOT

RATES ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

, AND OFFSET BY THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE

FORWARD CONTRACTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPOT RATE FLUCTUATIONS. CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTS FAIR VALUE DUE

TO SPOT-FORWARD DIFFERENCES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DESIGNATED HEDGE RELATIONSHIP AND RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

. THESE AMOUNTS, AS WELL AS HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS, WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 OR 2007. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD WAS A PARTY TO SEVEN PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH

THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE NOTES. THERE ARE TWO SWAPS MATURING IN 2011 WITH NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF $125 MILLION EACH THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERT MSDS $250 MILLION, 5.125% FIXED-RATE NOTES

DUE 2011 TO FLOATING RATE INSTRUMENTS AND FIVE SWAPS MATURING IN 2015 WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

$150 MILLION EACH THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERT $750 MILLION OF MSDS $1.0 BILLION, 4.0% FIXED-RATE

NOTES DUE 2015 TO FLOATING RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES

OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK LONDON INTERBANK

OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) SWAP RATE. THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN

THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND OFFSET BY THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES

IN THE SWAP CONTRACTS. DURING 2008, MSD TERMINATED FOUR INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF $250 MILLION EACH, AND TERMINATED ONE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT

OF $500 MILLION. THESE SWAPS HAD EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED ITS $1.0 BILLION, 4.75% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE

2015 AND ITS $500 MILLION, 4.375% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE 2013 TO VARIABLE RATE DEBT. AS A RESULT OF

THE SWAP TERMINATIONS, MSD RECEIVED $128.3 MILLION IN CASH, EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST WHICH WAS

NOT MATERIAL. THE CORRESPONDING GAINS RELATED TO THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT OF THE DEBT ASSOCIATED WITH

THE TERMINATED SWAP CONTRACTS WERE DEFERRED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE NOTES. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS

OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THESE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS MITIGATE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF REMEASURED FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD ESTIMATES $65.6 MILLION OF PRETAX NET UNREALIZED LOSS ON

DERIVATIVES MATURING WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS THAT HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES OVER

THAT SAME PERIOD WILL BE RECLASSIFIED FROM

AOCI

TO

SALES

. THE AMOUNT ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO

SALES

MAY DIFFER AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ULTIMATELY

DETERMINED BY ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES AT MATURITY.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXCHANGE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR AN ASSET OR PAID TO

TRANSFER A LIABILITY (AN EXIT PRICE) IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET FOR THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. ENTITIES

ARE REQUIRED TO USE A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH MAXIMIZES THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND

MINIMIZES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WHEN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. THERE ARE THREE LEVELS OF

INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.

LEVEL 1

 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. MSDS LEVEL 1

ASSETS INCLUDE EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN AN ACTIVE EXCHANGE MARKET.

LEVEL 2

 OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. MSDS LEVEL 2 ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE DEBT SECURITIES WITH QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE TRADED LESS

FREQUENTLY THAN EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS, CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, U.S. AND FOREIGN

GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, MUNICIPAL

SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WHOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING

MODELS WITH INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR

CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

LEVEL 3

 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY AND THAT

ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

METHODOLOGIES, OR SIMILAR TECHNIQUES, AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR

VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR ESTIMATION. MSDS LEVEL 3 ASSETS MAINLY INCLUDE CERTAIN

MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS WITH

LIMITED MARKET ACTIVITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, $71.5 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 8.4%, OF MSDS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3 ASSETS (ALL OF WHICH WERE PLEDGED UNDER CERTAIN

COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS (SEE NOTE 17)). ALL OF THE ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 WERE ACQUIRED WHEN MSD ELECTED TO BE REDEEMED-IN-KIND FROM A SHORT-TERM FIXED INCOME FUND

THAT RESTRICTED CASH REDEMPTIONS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

IF THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FALL WITHIN MORE THAN ONE

LEVEL DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE CATEGORIZATION IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT.

THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION OF DERIVATIVES INCLUDES AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT

RISK OF COUNTERPARTIES TO THE DERIVATIVES AND MSDS OWN CREDIT RISK, THE EFFECTS OF WHICH WERE

NOT SIGNIFICANT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD HAD APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION OF CASH EQUIVALENTS.

LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUES

FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED LEVEL 3 WHEN THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING

MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGIES OR SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AND AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT MODEL

ASSUMPTION OR INPUT IS UNOBSERVABLE. LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN INVESTMENT

SECURITIES FOR WHICH THERE IS LIMITED MARKET ACTIVITY SUCH THAT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR ESTIMATION. MSDS LEVEL 3 INVESTMENT SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN

CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS FOR WHICH THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE OBSERVABILITY OF MARKET PRICING FOR

THESE INVESTMENTS. THESE SECURITIES WERE VALUED PRIMARILY USING PRICING MODELS FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT

UNDERSTANDS THE METHODOLOGIES. THESE MODELS INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS SUCH AS CONTRACTUAL

TERMS, MATURITY, TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH INFLOWS, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT LIQUIDITY

AND CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.

ON JANUARY 1, 2008, MSD HAD $1,273.1 MILLION INVESTED IN A SHORT-TERM FIXED INCOME FUND

(THE FUND). DUE TO MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS, CASH REDEMPTIONS FROM THE FUND WERE RESTRICTED.

AS A RESULT OF THIS RESTRICTION ON CASH REDEMPTIONS, MSD DID NOT CONSIDER THE FUND TO BE TRADED IN

AN ACTIVE MARKET WITH OBSERVABLE PRICING ON JANUARY 1, 2008 AND THESE AMOUNTS WERE CATEGORIZED AS

LEVEL 3. ON JANUARY 7, 2008, MSD ELECTED TO BE REDEEMED-IN-KIND FROM THE FUND AND RECEIVED ITS

SHARE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES OF THE FUND. AS A RESULT, THE MAJORITY OF THE UNDERLYING

SECURITIES WERE TRANSFERRED OUT OF LEVEL 3 AS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THESE SECURITIES HAD

OBSERVABLE MARKETS. ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, $71.5 MILLION OF THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ASSOCIATED

WITH THE REDEMPTION-IN-KIND WERE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 AS THE SECURITIES CONTAINED AT LEAST ONE

SIGNIFICANT INPUT WHICH WAS UNOBSERVABLE. THESE SECURITIES ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTIRE BALANCE OF MSDS

LEVEL 3 ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. DURING 2009, LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF

$26.7 MILLION, WHICH WERE NO LONGER PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL, WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM

OTHER ASSETS

TO

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

SOME OF MSDS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS BUT

ARE RECORDED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THEIR LIQUID OR SHORT-TERM NATURE, SUCH

AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF LOANS PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT PORTION) AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS $8.8 BILLION COMPARED WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $8.5 BILLION AND AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS $6.3 BILLION COMPARED WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $6.2 BILLION. FAIR VALUE WAS

ESTIMATED USING QUOTED DEALER PRICES.

LETTER OF CREDIT

IN AUGUST 2008, MSD EXECUTED A $4.1 BILLION LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION, WHICH SATISFIED CERTAIN CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

(SEE NOTE 12). MSD PLEDGED COLLATERAL TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OF APPROXIMATELY $5.1 BILLION

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS PLEDGED AS

COLLATERAL WAS SET BY THE LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT AND SUCH ASSETS WERE HELD IN CUSTODY BY A

THIRD PARTY, THE ASSETS WERE MANAGED BY MSD. MSD CONSIDERED THE ASSETS PLEDGED UNDER THE LETTER OF

CREDIT AGREEMENT TO BE RESTRICTED. THE LETTER OF CREDIT AMOUNT AND REQUIRED COLLATERAL BALANCES

DECLINED AS PAYMENTS (AFTER THE FIRST $750 MILLION) UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WERE MADE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, $3.8 BILLION WAS RECORDED WITHIN

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS

AND $1.3 BILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS

OTHER ASSETS

. DURING 2009, MSD MADE ALL REMAINING PAYMENTS INTO

THE

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT FUNDS PURSUANT TO THE U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE LETTER

OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED AND THE COLLATERAL WAS RELEASED.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, MSD MONITORS CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CORPORATE

ISSUERS OF SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS. CREDIT EXPOSURE

LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED TO LIMIT A CONCENTRATION WITH ANY SINGLE ISSUER OR INSTITUTION. CASH AND

INVESTMENTS ARE PLACED IN INSTRUMENTS THAT MEET HIGH CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS, AS SPECIFIED IN

MSDS INVESTMENT POLICY GUIDELINES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXECUTED UNDER INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES

ASSOCIATION MASTER AGREEMENTS. THE MASTER AGREEMENTS WITH SEVERAL OF MSDS FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

COUNTERPARTIES ALSO INCLUDE CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEXES. THESE ANNEXES CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL TO BE EXCHANGED DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, MSDS

CREDIT RATING, AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009,

CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS

INCLUDES CASH COLLATERAL OF $69.2 MILLION RECEIVED FROM VARIOUS COUNTERPARTIES WITH A

CORRESPONDING OFFSET INCLUDED IN

ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

. MSD HAD NOT ADVANCED ANY

CASH COLLATERAL TO COUNTERPARTIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

MSDS FOUR LARGEST U.S. CUSTOMERS, MCKESSON CORPORATION, CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.,

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION AND MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., REPRESENTED, IN AGGREGATE,

APPROXIMATELY ONE-FOURTH OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. MSD MONITORS THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF ITS CUSTOMERS TO WHICH IT GRANTS CREDIT TERMS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

BAD DEBTS HAVE BEEN MINIMAL. MSD DOES NOT NORMALLY REQUIRE COLLATERAL OR OTHER SECURITY TO SUPPORT

CREDIT SALES.

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP

IN 2000, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH (COLLECTIVELY THE PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO

CREATE AN EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION

MEDICINES FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR EQUAL SHARING OF

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND FOR CO-PROMOTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS BY EACH COMPANY. IN 2001, THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD,

EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN 2002, EZETIMIBE, THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS

LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES AS

ZETIA

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES). IN 2004, A

COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

, WAS APPROVED IN THE

UNITED STATES AS

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES).

THE CHOLESTEROL AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE SHARING OF OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY THE

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP) BASED UPON PERCENTAGES THAT VARY BY

PRODUCT, SALES LEVEL AND COUNTRY. IN THE U.S. MARKET, THE PARTNERS SHARED PROFITS ON

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

SALES EQUALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST $300 MILLION OF ANNUAL

ZETIA

SALES ON WHICH

SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVES A GREATER SHARE OF PROFITS. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDED EXPENSES THAT THE

PARTNERS CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO SHARE, SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANUFACTURING COSTS, SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED PROMOTION COSTS (INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND DIRECT AND IDENTIFIABLE

OUT-OF-POCKET PROMOTION) AND OTHER AGREED UPON COSTS FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES SUCH AS ON-GOING

ASTRAZENECA LP

IN 1982, MSD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB (ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRAS

PRODUCTS UNDER A ROYALTY-BEARING LICENSE. IN 1993, MSDS TOTAL SALES OF ASTRA PRODUCTS REACHED A

LEVEL THAT TRIGGERED THE FIRST STEP IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT VENTURE BUSINESS CARRIED ON BY

ASTRA MERCK INC. (AMI), IN WHICH MSD AND ASTRA EACH OWNED A 50% SHARE. THIS JOINT VENTURE, FORMED

IN 1994, DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC,

THE FIRST OF A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH

SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, MSD AND ASTRA COMPLETED THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATIONS OF THE

JOINT VENTURE WHEREBY MSD ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN AMI, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND

CONTRIBUTED KBIS OPERATING ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS L.P.

(THE PARTNERSHIP), IN EXCHANGE FOR A 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. ASTRA CONTRIBUTED THE NET

ASSETS OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ASTRA USA, INC., TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR A 99%

GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP) UPON ASTRAS 1999 MERGER

WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC (THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER), BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS

FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS.

WHILE MAINTAINING A 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN AZLP, MSD HAS CONSENT AND PROTECTIVE RIGHTS

INTENDED TO PRESERVE ITS BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE POWER OF

THE GENERAL PARTNER TO MAKE CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS OR DISPOSITIONS. FURTHERMORE, IN LIMITED EVENTS

OF DEFAULT, ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WILL BE GRANTED TO MSD, INCLUDING POWERS TO DIRECT THE ACTIONS OF, OR

REMOVE AND REPLACE, THE PARTNERSHIPS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. MSD

EARNS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS AND SUCH REVENUE WAS

$1.4 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY

RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM,

AS WELL AS

PRILOSEC

. IN ADDITION, MSD EARNS CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP

RETURNS WHICH ARE RECORDED IN

EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES

AS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. SUCH

RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS

BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN

REPRESENTING MSDS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED AZLP GAAP EARNINGS. THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER TRIGGERED A

PARTIAL REDEMPTION IN MARCH 2008 OF MSDS INTEREST IN CERTAIN AZLP PRODUCT RIGHTS. UPON THIS

REDEMPTION, MSD RECEIVED $4.3 BILLION FROM AZLP. THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED PRIMARILY ON A MULTIPLE OF

MSDS AVERAGE ANNUAL VARIABLE RETURNS DERIVED FROM SALES OF THE FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS FOR

THE THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THE REDEMPTION (THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE). MSD RECORDED

A $1.5 BILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE PARTIAL REDEMPTION IN 2008. THE PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF MSDS

INTEREST IN THE PRODUCT RIGHTS DID NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN MSDS 1% LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, ASTRA PURCHASED AN OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) FOR

A PAYMENT OF $443.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS DEFERRED INCOME, TO BUY MSDS INTEREST IN THE

KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

(THE NON-PPI

PRODUCTS). ASTRAZENECA CAN EXERCISE THE ASSET OPTION IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010 AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE OF $647 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE NET PRESENT VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 OF

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROJECTED FUTURE PRETAX REVENUE TO BE RECEIVED BY MSD FROM THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS (THE

APPRAISED VALUE). ON FEBRUARY 26, 2010, ASTRAZENECA NOTIFIED MSD THAT IT WAS EXERCISING THE ASSET

OPTION. MSD ALSO HAD THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008 AT THE APPRAISED

VALUE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, MSD ADVISED ASTRAZENECA THAT IT WOULD NOT EXERCISE THE ASSET OPTION, THUS

THE $443.0 MILLION REMAINS DEFERRED BUT WILL BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE ASSET OPTION IS CONSUMMATED. IN

ADDITION, IN 1998 MSD GRANTED ASTRA AN OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION) TO BUY MSDS COMMON STOCK

INTEREST IN KBI, AND, THEREFORE, MSDS INTEREST IN

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

, EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER

ASTRAS EXERCISE OF THE ASSET OPTION. ASTRA CAN ALSO EXERCISE THE SHARES OPTION IN 2017 OR IF

COMBINED ANNUAL SALES OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE, ONLY

SO LONG AS ASTRAZENECAS ASSET OPTION HAS BEEN EXERCISED IN 2010. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR THE

SHARES OPTION IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRUE-UP MECHANISMS.

THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER CONSTITUTED A TRIGGER EVENT UNDER THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS. AS

A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN EXCHANGE FOR MSDS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA PRODUCTS

WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4 MILLION (THE

ADVANCE PAYMENT). THE ADVANCE PAYMENT WAS DEFERRED AS IT REMAINED SUBJECT TO A TRUE-UP

CALCULATION (THE TRUE-UP AMOUNT) THAT WAS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IN MARCH

2008 OF THE ASTRA PRODUCT RIGHTS RETAINED BY MSD. THE CALCULATED TRUE-UP AMOUNT OF $243.7 MILLION

WAS RETURNED TO AZLP IN MARCH 2008 AND MSD RECOGNIZED A PRETAX GAIN OF $723.7 MILLION RELATED TO

THE RESIDUAL ADVANCE PAYMENT BALANCE.

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS, BECAUSE A TRIGGER EVENT HAS

OCCURRED, THE SUM OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE, THE APPRAISED VALUE AND THE TRUE-UP

AMOUNT WAS GUARANTEED TO BE A MINIMUM OF $4.7 BILLION. DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF

AGREED VALUE LESS PAYMENT OF THE TRUE-UP AMOUNT RESULTED IN CASH RECEIPTS TO MSD OF $4.0 BILLION

AND AN AGGREGATE PRETAX GAIN OF $2.2 BILLION WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

IN

2008. ASTRAZENECAS PURCHASE OF MSDS INTEREST IN THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS IS CONTINGENT UPON THE

EXERCISE OF THE ASSET OPTION BY ASTRAZENECA IN 2010 AND, THEREFORE, PAYMENT OF THE APPRAISED VALUE

MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR. ALSO, IN MARCH 2008, THE $1.38 BILLION OUTSTANDING LOAN FROM ASTRA PLUS

INTEREST THROUGH THE REDEMPTION DATE WAS SETTLED. AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, MSD RECEIVED

NET PROCEEDS FROM AZLP OF $2.6 BILLION.

MERIAL LIMITED

IN 1997, MSD AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW SANOFI-AVENTIS) COMBINED THEIR ANIMAL HEALTH

BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH WAS A

STAND-ALONE JOINT VENTURE, 50% OWNED BY EACH PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF

PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF

ANIMAL SPECIES.

ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2009, MSD SOLD ITS 50% INTEREST IN MERIAL TO SANOFI-AVENTIS FOR $4 BILLION IN

CASH. THE SALE RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF A $3.2 BILLION GAIN IN 2009 REFLECTED IN

OTHER INCOME

(EXPENSE), NET.

ALSO, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF MERIAL, MSD, SANOFI-AVENTIS AND SCHERING-PLOUGH SIGNED A

CALL OPTION AGREEMENT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CALL OPTION AGREEMENT, FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE

MERGER, SANOFI-AVENTIS HAD AN OPTION TO REQUIRE MSDS PARENT COMPANY TO COMBINE ITS

INTERVET/SCHERING-PLOUGH ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS WITH MERIAL TO FORM AN ANIMAL HEALTH JOINT VENTURE

THAT WOULD BE OWNED EQUALLY BY MSDS PARENT COMPANY AND SANOFI-AVENTIS. ON MARCH 9, 2010, MSDS

PARENT COMPANY AND SANOFI-AVENTIS ANNOUNCED THAT SANOFI-AVENTIS HAD EXERCISED THE OPTION. AS PART

OF THE CALL OPTION AGREEMENT, THE VALUE OF MERIAL HAS BEEN FIXED AT $8 BILLION. THE MINIMUM TOTAL

VALUE RECEIVED BY MSDS PARENT COMPANY FOR CONTRIBUTING INTERVET/SCHERING-PLOUGH TO THE COMBINED

ENTITY WOULD BE $9.25 BILLION (SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY TRANSACTION ADJUSTMENTS), CONSISTING OF A FLOOR

VALUATION OF INTERVET/SCHERING-PLOUGH WHICH IS FIXED AT A MINIMUM OF $8.5 BILLION (SUBJECT TO

POTENTIAL UPWARD REVISION BASED ON A VALUATION EXERCISE BY THE TWO PARTIES) AND AN ADDITIONAL

PAYMENT BY SANOFI-AVENTIS OF

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$750 MILLION. BASED ON THE VALUATION EXERCISE OF INTERVET/SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE CUSTOMARY

TRANSACTION ADJUSTMENTS, IF MERIAL AND INTERVET/SCHERING-PLOUGH ARE COMBINED, A PAYMENT MAY BE

REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY EITHER PARTY TO MAKE THE JOINT VENTURE EQUALLY OWNED BY MSDS PARENT COMPANY

AND SANOFI-AVENTIS. THIS PAYMENT WOULD TRUE-UP THE VALUE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT THEY ARE

EQUAL. ANY FORMATION OF A NEW ANIMAL HEALTH JOINT VENTURE WITH SANOFI-AVENTIS IS SUBJECT TO

CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS INCLUDING ANTITRUST REVIEW IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. PRIOR TO

THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, THE AGREEMENTS PROVIDED MSD WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS TO TERMINATE THE CALL

OPTION FOR A FEE OF $400 MILLION. THE RECOGNITION OF THE TERMINATION FEE WAS DEFERRED UNTIL THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 WHEN THE CONDITIONS THAT COULD HAVE TRIGGERED ITS PAYMENT LAPSED. THE AMOUNT

IS REFLECTED IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.

MERIAL SALES WERE $1.8 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2009 UNTIL THE SEPTEMBER 17,

2009 DIVESTITURE DATE, $2.6 BILLION FOR 2008 AND $2.4 BILLION FOR 2007.

SANOFI PASTEUR MSD

IN 1994, MSD AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.) ESTABLISHED AN

EQUALLY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN EUROPE. JOINT VENTURE VACCINE SALES WERE $1.6 BILLION FOR

2009, $1.9 BILLION FOR 2008 AND $1.4 BILLION FOR 2007.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON°MERCK CONSUMER PHARMACEUTICALS COMPANY

IN 1989, MSD FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO DEVELOP AND MARKET A BROAD RANGE

OF NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS 50% OWNED VENTURE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXPANDED

INTO CANADA. SIGNIFICANT JOINT VENTURE PRODUCTS ARE

PEPCID AC

, AN OVER-THE-COUNTER FORM OF THE

ULCER MEDICATION

PEPCID

, AS WELL AS

PEPCID COMPLETE

, AN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT WHICH COMBINES THE

ULCER MEDICATION WITH ANTACIDS. SALES OF PRODUCTS MARKETED BY THE JOINT VENTURE WERE $203.2 MILLION

FOR 2009, $212.1 MILLION FOR 2008 AND $219.7 MILLION FOR 2007.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, INCLUDING THE ABOVE JOINT

VENTURES, TOTALED $1.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND $1.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THESE

AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN

OTHER ASSETS

. AMOUNTS DUE FROM THE ABOVE JOINT VENTURES INCLUDED IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

12. CONTINGENCIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

MSD IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS

BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS WELL AS

ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS. MSD RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE

ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY AS ASSESSMENTS CHANGE OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, A PORTION OF THE OVERALL ACCRUAL IS ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED

AND CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS PAST EXPERIENCE, NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS

INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LOSSES ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS

CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

MSDS DECISION TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE IS DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING COST

AND AVAILABILITY, EXISTING AT THE TIME SUCH DECISIONS ARE MADE. AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE HAS BECOME LESS AVAILABLE WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.

MSD HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF OBTAINING PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS AVAILABLE AND AS SUCH, HAS NO

INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR MSD

PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD AFTER THAT DATE. MSD WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS INSURANCE NEEDS AND THE

COSTS, AVAILABILITY AND BENEFITS OF PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN SEPTEMBER 2006, MSD FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE AUGUST 2005

JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF IN THE TEXAS STATE COURT CASE,

ERNST V. MERCK

. ON MAY 29,

2008, THE TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT AND ISSUED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR

OF MSD. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND THE EVIDENCE TO BE LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT ON THE ISSUE OF

CAUSATION. PLAINTIFF FILED A MOTION FOR REHEARING

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS. ON JUNE 4, 2009,

IN RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR REHEARING, THE COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED A NEW OPINION

REVERSING THE JURYS VERDICT AND RENDERED JUDGMENT FOR MSD. ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2009, PLAINTIFF FILED A

SECOND MOTION FOR REHEARING

EN BANC,

WHICH THE COURT OF APPEALS DENIED ON NOVEMBER 19, 2009. ON

DECEMBER 7, 2009, PLAINTIFF FILED ANOTHER MOTION FOR REHEARING, WHICH THE COURT OF APPEALS AGAIN

DENIED. PLAINTIFF FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS ON FEBRUARY 3, 2010.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN APRIL 2006, IN

GARZA V. MERCK

, A JURY IN STATE COURT IN RIO GRANDE

CITY, TEXAS RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE FAMILY OF DECEDENT LEONEL GARZA. THE JURY AWARDED A

TOTAL OF $7 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO MR. GARZAS WIDOW AND THREE SONS. THE JURY ALSO

PURPORTED TO AWARD $25 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES EVEN THOUGH UNDER TEXAS LAW, IN THIS CASE,

POTENTIAL PUNITIVE DAMAGES WERE CAPPED AT $750,000. IN MAY 2008, THE SAN ANTONIO COURT OF APPEALS

REVERSED THE JUDGMENT AND RENDERED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MSD. IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COURT OF

APPEALS, ON REHEARING, VACATED ITS PRIOR RULING AND ISSUED A REPLACEMENT. IN THE NEW RULING, THE

COURT ORDERED A TAKE-NOTHING JUDGMENT FOR MSD ON THE DESIGN DEFECT CLAIM, BUT REVERSED AND REMANDED

FOR A NEW TRIAL AS TO THE STRICT LIABILITY CLAIM BECAUSE OF JUROR MISCONDUCT. IN JANUARY 2009, MSD

FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT. THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT GRANTED MSDS

PETITION FOR REVIEW AND ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON JANUARY 20, 2010.

OTHER LAWSUITS

APPROXIMATELY 190 CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PAYORS WERE FILED IN THE NEW JERSEY

COURT AND IN FEDERAL COURT IN THE MDL. ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2009, MSD ANNOUNCED IT HAD FINALIZED A

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH IT HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, TO RESOLVE ALL PENDING LAWSUITS IN WHICH

U.S.-BASED PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PAYORS (TPPS) SOUGHT REIMBURSEMENT FOR COVERING

VIOXX

PURCHASED BY

THEIR PLAN MEMBERS. CERTAIN OTHER CLAIMANTS PARTICIPATED IN THE RESOLUTION AS WELL. THE AGREEMENT

PROVIDED THAT MSD DID NOT ADMIT WRONGDOING OR FAULT. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MSD PAID A

FIXED TOTAL OF $80 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES A SETTLEMENT FUND THAT WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG THE

TPPS (INSURERS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND UNION WELFARE FUNDS) PARTICIPATING IN THE RESOLUTION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH A FORMULA THAT IS BASED ON PRODUCT VOLUME AND A PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL PAYMENT OF

ATTORNEYS FEES. IN RETURN, THE SETTLING TPPS WILL DISMISS THEIR LAWSUITS AND RELEASE THEIR CLAIMS

AGAINST MSD. STIPULATED DISMISSALS OF THE SETTLED TTP ACTIONS WERE FILED IN NEW JERSEY AND THE MDL

IN DECEMBER 2009. MSD RECORDED A CHARGE OF $80 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 RELATED TO THE

SETTLEMENT AND PAID THE $80 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009. SINCE THE SETTLEMENT, ONE

ADDITIONAL TPP CASE HAS BEEN FILED WHICH IS PENDING IN THE MDL PROCEEDING.

SEPARATELY, THERE ARE ALSO STILL PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT

OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS. IN THE MDL PROCEEDING, 33 SUCH CLASS ACTIONS REMAIN. IN 2005, MSD MOVED

TO DISMISS A MASTER COMPLAINT THAT INCLUDES THESE CASES, BUT THE MDL COURT HAS NOT YET RULED ON

THAT MOTION.

ON MARCH 17, 2009, THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT DENIED PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION IN

MARTIN-KLEINMAN V. MERCK

, A PUTATIVE CONSUMER CLASS ACTION. PLAINTIFFS MOVED FOR

LEAVE TO APPEAL THE DECISION TO THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT ON NOVEMBER 6, 2009. ON JANUARY 12,

2010, THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT DENIED PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE DENIAL OF

CLASS CERTIFICATION.

ON JUNE 12, 2008, A MISSOURI STATE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS OF MISSOURI PLAINTIFFS SEEKING

REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS RELATING TO

VIOXX.

THE PLAINTIFFS DO NOT ALLEGE ANY PERSONAL

INJURIES FROM TAKING

VIOXX.

THE MISSOURI COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURTS CERTIFICATION

OF A CLASS ON MAY 12, 2009, AND THE MISSOURI SUPREME COURT DENIED MSDS APPLICATION FOR REVIEW OF

THAT DECISION ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2009. TRIAL HAS BEEN SET FOR APRIL 11, 2011. IN ADDITION, IN INDIANA,

PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS OF INDIANA

VIOXX

PURCHASERS IN A CASE PENDING

BEFORE THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA; DISCOVERY IN THAT CASE IS ONGOING. BRIEFING IS

COMPLETE ON PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS OF KENTUCKY

VIOXX

PURCHASERS BEFORE THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF PIKE COUNTY, KENTUCKY. A HEARING ON THIS MATTER WAS HELD ON FEBRUARY 26, 2010. A JUDGE IN

COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS HAS CONSOLIDATED THREE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY

VIOXX

PURCHASERS.

THE PLAINTIFFS IN THOSE ACTIONS RECENTLY VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR LAWSUITS.

PLAINTIFFS ALSO FILED A CLASS ACTION IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT SEEKING CERTIFICATION OF A

CLASS OF CALIFORNIA THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AND END-USERS. THE TRIAL COURT DENIED THE MOTION FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION ON APRIL 30, 2009, AND THE COURT OF APPEAL AFFIRMED THAT RULING ON DECEMBER 15, 2009.

ON JANUARY 25, 2010, PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN TWENTY-ONE SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENT

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF THIRTEEN STATES, FIVE COUNTIES, THE CITY OF NEW YORK,

AND PRIVATE CITIZENS (WHO HAVE BROUGHT

QUI TAM

AND TAXPAYER DERIVATIVE SUITS). THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE

THAT MSD MISREPRESENTED THE SAFETY OF

VIOXX

AND SEEK: (I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED

OR REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY AND ITS AGENCIES; (II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE

GOVERNMENT ENTITY AND ITS AGENCIES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS INJURED BY

VIOXX

; (III) DAMAGES UNDER VARIOUS COMMON LAW THEORIES; AND/OR (IV) REMEDIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE

STATUTORY THEORIES, INCLUDING STATE CONSUMER FRAUD AND/OR FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR MEDICAID FRAUD

STATUTES, INCLUDING CIVIL PENALTIES. NINE OF THE THIRTEEN CASES ARE PENDING IN THE MDL PROCEEDING,

TWO ARE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONAL ORDERS TRANSFERRING THEM TO THE MDL PROCEEDING, AND TWO WERE

REMANDED TO STATE COURT. ONE OF THE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE COUNTIES IS A CLASS ACTION FILED BY

SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED CALIFORNIA COUNTIES.

MSDS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT WAS GRANTED IN NOVEMBER 2009 IN A CASE BROUGHT BY THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS THAT WAS SCHEDULED TO GO TO TRIAL IN EARLY 2010. THE TEXAS ATTORNEY

GENERAL DID NOT APPEAL. IN THE MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL CASE, MSD IS CURRENTLY SEEKING APPELLATE

REVIEW OF THE TRIAL COURTS ORDER DENYING MSDS MOTION TO DISMISS. THE TRIAL COURT HAS ENTERED A

STAY OF PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING DISCOVERY) PENDING THE RESULT OF THAT APPEAL. FINALLY, THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL ACTIONS IN THE MDL DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH ARE IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE. THE

LOUISIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL CASE IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN THE MDL COURT ON APRIL 12,

2010.

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, MSD AND VARIOUS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS AND

INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ALL OF THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED BY THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (THE JPML) TO THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R. CHESLER FOR INCLUSION IN A

NATIONWIDE MDL (THE SHAREHOLDER MDL). JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION, WHICH REQUESTED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF

PURCHASERS OF MSD STOCK BETWEEN MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29, 2004, ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE

FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF SUIT,

INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE ACT AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES OF MSD STOCK AND UNDER

SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS BASED ON STATEMENTS

IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MSD STOCK

INVESTMENT PLAN, A DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN. ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS

MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION REVERSING JUDGE CHESLERS ORDER AND REMANDING THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT. MSD FILED A

PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ON JANUARY 15, 2009, WHICH

THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED ON MAY 26, 2009. ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON NOVEMBER 30, 2009 AND A

DECISION IS EXPECTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010. WHILE THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WAS PENDING,

PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR CONSOLIDATED AND FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT IN THE DISTRICT COURT.

MSD FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THAT COMPLAINT ON MAY 1, 2009, FOLLOWING WHICH THE DISTRICT COURT

PROCEEDINGS WERE STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE SUPREME COURT APPEAL. THE MOTION TO DISMISS IN

THE DISTRICT COURT HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO MSDS RIGHT TO RE-FILE SUCH A MOTION

PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE SUPREME COURT APPEAL.

IN OCTOBER 2005, A DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER GOVERNING THE SHAREHOLDER MDL, THE CASE, WHICH IS

BASED ON THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PENSION FUNDS COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON

AUGUST 3, 2007. IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT RATHER THAN

RESPONDING TO DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS. IN ADDITION, IN 2007, SIX NEW COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALSO ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS. BY STIPULATION, DEFENDANTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THESE COMPLAINTS UNTIL THE

RESOLUTION OF ANY MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE CONSOLIDATED SECURITIES ACTION.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT

UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND

FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS) HAVE

BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF MSDS CURRENT AND

FORMER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF MSDS RETIREMENT PLANS. THE COMPLAINT MAKES

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS. ON JULY 11, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. ON OCTOBER 19, 2007, PLAINTIFFS MOVED FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF

INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PARTICIPANTS IN AND BENEFICIARIES OF MSDS RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AT ANY

TIME BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 1998 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND WHOSE PLAN ACCOUNTS INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN

THE MSD COMMON STOCK FUND AND/OR MSD COMMON STOCK. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2009, THE COURT DENIED THE MOTION

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS AS TO ONE COUNT AND GRANTED THE MOTION AS TO THE REMAINING COUNTS. THE

COURT ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE CLASS DEFINITION THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO (I) WERE NOT INJURED IN

CONNECTION WITH THEIR INVESTMENTS IN MSD STOCK AND (II) EXECUTED POST-SEPARATION SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS THAT RELEASED THEIR CLAIMS UNDER ERISA. ON MARCH 23, 2009, JUDGE CHESLER DENIED

DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS. ON MAY 11, 2009, JUDGE CHESLER ENTERED AN ORDER

DENYING PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS,

WHICH HAD BEEN FILED ON DECEMBER 24, 2008.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON

MSDS BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO MSD WITH RESPECT TO

THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN S. MARTIN, JR. OF DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO CONDUCT AN

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ALLEGATIONS SET FORTH IN THE DEMAND. JUDGE

MARTINS REPORT WAS MADE PUBLIC IN SEPTEMBER 2006. BASED ON THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATION

MADE AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE MARTIN REPORT AND THE IMPACT THAT DERIVATIVE LITIGATION

WOULD HAVE ON MSD, THE BOARD REJECTED THE DEMAND. ON OCTOBER 11, 2007, TWO SHAREHOLDERS FILED A

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT PURPORTEDLY ON MSDS BEHALF IN STATE COURT IN ATLANTIC COUNTY, NEW

JERSEY AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF MSD. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED THAT THE

BOARDS REJECTION OF THEIR DEMAND WAS UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPER, AND THAT THE DEFENDANTS BREACHED

VARIOUS DUTIES TO MSD IN ALLOWING

VIOXX

TO BE MARKETED. THE PARTIES REACHED A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT

AND, ON FEBRUARY 8, 2010, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT AND

REQUIRING THAT NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT BE MADE TO

MSDS PARENT COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. ON FEBRUARY 9,

2010, MSDS PARENT COMPANY  NOTIFIED SHAREHOLDERS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND ITS TERMS. ON MARCH 22, 2010, THE

COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT,  CERTAIN CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE CHANGES WILL BE MADE AND  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED

WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED. IN ADDITION, MSD WILL  PAY AN AWARD OF FEES AND EXPENSES TO PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS IN AN AMOUNT TO BE DETERMINED

BY THE COURT, NOT TO EXCEED $12.15 MILLION. IN ADDITION, MSD, THE PLAINTIFFS AND THE INDIVIDUAL

DEFENDANTS WILL EXCHANGE FULL, MUTUAL RELEASES OF ALL CLAIMS THAT WERE, OR COULD HAVE BEEN,

ASSERTED IN THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS. THE SETTLEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION OF LIABILITY OR

WRONGFUL CONDUCT BY MSD OR BY ANY OF THE DEFENDANTS NAMED IN THE ACTIONS. THIS SETTLEMENT ALSO

RESOLVES THE FEDERAL CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION DESCRIBED BELOW.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE

TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). ON MAY 5, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS ON THE

GROUNDS THAT PLAINTIFFS HAD FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DEMAND SHOULD BE EXCUSED AND DENIED

PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, ARGUING THAT JUDGE

CHESLER ERRED IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITH DOCUMENTS ACQUIRED BY

STIPULATION OF THE PARTIES. ON JULY 18, 2007, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION ON THE GROUNDS THAT JUDGE CHESLER SHOULD HAVE

ALLOWED PLAINTIFFS TO SEEK LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT USING THE DOCUMENTS ACQUIRED BY

STIPULATION, AND REMANDED THE CASE FOR THE DISTRICT COURTS CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER, EVEN WITH THE

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, PLAINTIFFS PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD BE FUTILE. PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR BRIEF

IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT, ALONG WITH THEIR PROPOSED AMENDED

COMPLAINT, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007. THE COURT DENIED THE MOTION ON JUNE 17, 2008, AND AGAIN DISMISSED

THE CASE. ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE APPEAL WAS HELD ON JULY 15, 2009. ON

NOVEMBER 10, 2009, BEFORE ANY DECISION WAS ISSUED, THE APPEAL WAS STAYED PENDING APPROVAL OF THE

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN THE DERIVATIVE ACTION PENDING IN THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT DISCUSSED

ABOVE.

INTERNATIONAL LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MSD HAS BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN LITIGATION RELATING TO

VIOXX

IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS) IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS CANADA, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, ISRAEL, THE

PHILIPPINES AND SINGAPORE.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE SUPERIOR COURT IN QUEBEC AUTHORIZED THE INSTITUTION OF A CLASS ACTION ON

BEHALF OF ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO, IN QUEBEC, CONSUMED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ITS

INGESTION. ON MAY 7, 2009, THE PLAINTIFFS SERVED AN INTRODUCTORY MOTION FOR A CLASS ACTION BASED

UPON THAT AUTHORIZATION, AND THE CASE REMAINS IN PRELIMINARY STAGES OF LITIGATION. ON MAY 30, 2008,

THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF QUEENS BENCH IN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA ENTERED AN ORDER CERTIFYING A CLASS

OF

VIOXX

USERS IN CANADA, EXCEPT THOSE IN QUEBEC. MSD APPEALED THE CERTIFICATION ORDER AND, ON

MARCH 30, 2009, THE COURT OF APPEAL GRANTED MSDS APPEAL AND QUASHED THE CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON

OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA DISMISSED PLAINTIFFS APPEAL APPLICATION AND DECIDED

NOT TO REVIEW THE JUDGMENT OF THE SASKATCHEWAN COURT OF APPEAL. ON

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JULY 28, 2008, THE SUPERIOR

COURT IN ONTARIO DENIED MSDS MOTION TO STAY CLASS PROCEEDINGS IN ONTARIO AND DECIDED TO CERTIFY AN

OVERLAPPING CLASS OF

VIOXX

USERS IN CANADA, EXCEPT THOSE IN QUEBEC AND SASKATCHEWAN, WHO ALLEGE

NEGLIGENCE AND AN ENTITLEMENT TO ELECT TO WAIVE THE TORT. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2009, THE ONTARIO

DIVISIONAL COURT DISMISSED THE APPEAL FROM THE ORDER DENYING THE STAY AND, ON MAY 15, 2009, THE

ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL DENIED LEAVE TO APPEAL. ON OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA

DISMISSED MSDS APPLICATION AND DECIDED NOT TO REVIEW THE JUDGMENT OF THE ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL.

AFTER THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN QUASHED THE MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL CERTIFICATION ORDER

ENTERED IN THAT PROVINCE, MSD APPLIED TO THE ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL FROM THE

ONTARIO CERTIFICATION ORDER. LEAVE TO APPEAL WAS GRANTED, THE APPEAL WAS FILED ON MAY 20, 2009 AND,

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COURTS DECISION, MSD SOUGHT LEAVE TO APPEAL TO THE DIVISIONAL COURT, WHICH

WAS DENIED ON DECEMBER 7, 2009. THESE PROCEDURAL DECISIONS IN THE CANADIAN LITIGATION DO NOT

ADDRESS THE MERITS OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION IN CANADA REMAINS IN AN EARLY STAGE.

A TRIAL IN A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CONCLUDED ON JUNE 25, 2009, IN THE FEDERAL

COURT OF AUSTRALIA. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO ALLEGED HE SUFFERED AN MI, SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHERS

IN AUSTRALIA WHO INGESTED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED AN MI, THROMBOTIC STROKE, UNSTABLE ANGINA, TRANSIENT

ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. ON MARCH 30, 2009, THE TRIAL JUDGE ENTERED AN ORDER

DIRECTING THAT, IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER ISSUES IN THE PROCEEDING, THE ISSUES TO BE DETERMINED

DURING THE TRIAL ARE THOSE ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW IN THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS INDIVIDUAL CASE, AND

THOSE ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE FINDS, AFTER HEARING THE EVIDENCE, ARE COMMON TO

THE CLAIMS OF THE GROUP MEMBERS THAT THE NAMED PLAINTIFF HAS ALLEGED THAT HE REPRESENTS. ON MARCH

5, 2010, THE TRIAL JUDGE DELIVERED HIS JUDGMENT. THE COURT DECIDED TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS AGAINST

MSD, SPECIFICALLY FINDING THAT MSD HAD DONE EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED OF IT IN

THE DISCHARGE OF ITS DUTY OF CARE. WITH REGARD TO MSDS AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARY, MERCK SHARP & DOHME

(AUSTRALIA) PTY. LTD., THE COURT DECIDED TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS BUT TO AWARD THE NAMED

PLAINTIFF, WHO THE COURT FOUND SUFFERED AN MI AFTER INGESTING

VIOXX

FOR APPROXIMATELY 33 MONTHS,

COMPENSATION BASED ON STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT

VIOXX

WAS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABLE

QUALITY, EVEN THOUGH THE COURT REJECTED THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT MSD KNEW OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN

PRIOR TO THE VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

IN SEPTEMBER 2004 THAT

VIOXX

MATERIALLY INCREASED THE

RISK OF MI. ON MAY 7, 2010, THE COURT WILL CONDUCT A HEARING TO DETERMINE THE ORDERS TO BE ENTERED

GIVING EFFECT TO THE JUDGMENT, IN WHICH THE COURT WILL DETERMINE WHICH OF ITS FINDINGS OF FACT AND

LAW ARE COMMON TO THE CLAIMS OF OTHER GROUP MEMBERS AND WILL CONSIDER ANY OTHER MOTIONS THAT MIGHT

BE BROUGHT. MSDS SUBSIDIARY INTENDS TO APPEAL THE ADVERSE FINDINGS AFTER THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN

ENTERED.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE COVERAGE APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$190 MILLION. MSD HAS FIDUCIARY AND OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER

LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ARBITRATION,

ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE, IF NEEDED, UNDER

UPPER-LEVEL EXCESS POLICIES THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE DISPUTES WITH

THE INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF MSDS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS AND

THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL DISPUTES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES

DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE LESS THAN THE STATED UPPER LIMITS.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAS RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE DOJ REQUESTING INFORMATION

RELATED TO MSDS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL

HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES SUBPOENAS FOR

WITNESSES TO APPEAR BEFORE A GRAND JURY. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN MARCH 2009, MSD RECEIVED A

LETTER FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS IDENTIFYING IT AS A TARGET

OF THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION REGARDING

VIOXX

. FURTHER, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, INVESTIGATIONS

ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER

ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE GOVERNMENTAL

ENTITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS (THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL REMEDIES.

IN ADDITION, MSD RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006 FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON CALIFORNIAS

MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MSD ENTERED INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL AS WELL AS

REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE COORDINATED

PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN 2007, AS A RESULT OF ENTERING INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MSD RECORDED A PRETAX

CHARGE OF $4.85 BILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIXED AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO PLAINTIFFS

QUALIFYING FOR PAYMENT UNDER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE ARE TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUIT TRIALS SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2010. MSD

CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. MSD BELIEVES THAT IT

HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE

THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, MSD IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF

LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. MSD HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, OTHER THAN A RESERVE ESTABLISHED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOLUTION OF THE

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES

IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED

WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, MSD HAD AN AGGREGATE RESERVE OF

APPROXIMATELY $4.379 BILLION (THE 

VIOXX

RESERVE) FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2009, MSD SPENT APPROXIMATELY $244 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $54 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN ADDITION,

DURING 2009, MSD PAID AN ADDITIONAL $4.1 BILLION INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. ALSO, DURING 2009, $75 MILLION OF CHARGES WERE RECORDED, INCLUDING $35 MILLION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WAS APPROXIMATELY

$110 MILLION, WHICH IS SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS

INCURRED BY MSD; THE DEVELOPMENT OF MSDS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE

SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT CERTAIN

LAWSUITS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST MSD; THE COSTS AND

OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE

AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 REPRESENTS MSDS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM

AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT

COULD ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS

TO BE INCURRED BY MSD.

MSD WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO SO.

OTHER PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

FOSAMAX

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES

INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 978 CASES,

WHICH INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 1,356 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, HAD BEEN FILED AND WERE PENDING AGAINST MSD IN

EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT, INCLUDING ONE CASE WHICH SEEKS CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS WELL

AS DAMAGES AND/OR MEDICAL MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT

THEY HAVE SUFFERED OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE DENTAL PROCEDURES,

SUCH AS TOOTH EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS AND/OR DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

. IN ADDITION, PLAINTIFFS IN APPROXIMATELY FIVE PERCENT OF THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THEY

SUSTAINED STRESS AND/OR LOW ENERGY FEMORAL FRACTURES IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

. ON

AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL

COURTS NATIONWIDE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (THE



FOSAMAX

MDL) FOR COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE

JOHN KEENAN IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AS A RESULT OF THE

JPML ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 771 OF THE CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE KEENAN. JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED A CASE

MANAGEMENT ORDER (AND VARIOUS AMENDMENTS THERETO) SETTING FORTH A SCHEDULE GOVERNING THE

PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSED PRIMARILY UPON RESOLVING THE CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS IN 2007

AND COMPLETING FACT DISCOVERY IN AN INITIAL GROUP OF 25 CASES BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. BRIEFING AND

ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS FOR CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL MONITORING CLASSES WERE COMPLETED IN

2007 AND JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING THE MOTIONS ON JANUARY 3, 2008. ON JANUARY 28, 2008,

JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED A FURTHER ORDER DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE ALL CLASS CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE

FIRST FOUR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST MSD THAT SOUGHT PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGES AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING RELIEF ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS.

DAUBERT

MOTIONS WERE FILED IN MAY 2009 AND JUDGE

KEENAN CONDUCTED A

DAUBERT

HEARING IN JULY 2009. ON JULY 27, 2009, JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED HIS RULING

ON THE PARTIES RESPECTIVE

DAUBERT

MOTIONS. THE RULING DENIED THE PLAINTIFF STEERING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMITTEES MOTION AND GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART MSDS MOTION. THE FIRST MDL TRIAL 

BOLES V. MERCK



BEGAN ON AUGUST 11, 2009, AND ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2009. ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2009, THE MDL COURT

DECLARED A MISTRIAL IN

BOLES

BECAUSE THE EIGHT PERSON JURY COULD NOT REACH A UNANIMOUS VERDICT AND,

CONSEQUENTLY, THE

BOLES

CASE IS SET TO BE RETRIED ON JUNE 2, 2010. THE SECOND MDL CASE SET FOR

TRIAL 

FLEMINGS V. MERCK

 WAS SCHEDULED TO START ON JANUARY 12, 2010, BUT JUDGE KEENAN GRANTED

MSDS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DISMISSED THE CASE ON NOVEMBER 23, 2009. THE NEXT MDL CASE

SET FOR TRIAL 

MALEY V. MERCK

 IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO START ON APRIL 19, 2010. MSD FILED A

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN

MALEY

, WHICH THE MDL COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART ON

JANUARY 27, 2010 AND, AS A RESULT, MSD EXPECTS THAT THE TRIAL WILL COMMENCE AS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED

ON APRIL 19. ON FEBRUARY 1, 2010, JUDGE KEENAN SELECTED A NEW BELLWETHER CASE 

JUDITH GRAVES V.

MERCK

 TO REPLACE THE

FLEMINGS

BELLWETHER CASE, WHICH THE MDL COURT DISMISSED WHEN IT GRANTED

SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MSD. THE MDL COURT HAS SET THE

GRAVES

TRIAL TO BEGIN ON SEPTEMBER 13,

2010. A TRIAL IN ALABAMA IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON MAY 3, 2010 AND A TRIAL IN FLORIDA IS

CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON JUNE 21, 2010.

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2008, AN APPLICATION WAS MADE BY THE ATLANTIC COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT OF

NEW JERSEY REQUESTING THAT ALL OF THE

FOSAMAX

CASES PENDING IN NEW JERSEY BE CONSIDERED FOR MASS

TORT DESIGNATION AND CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT BEFORE ONE JUDGE IN NEW JERSEY. ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, THE

NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT ORDERED THAT ALL PENDING AND FUTURE ACTIONS FILED IN NEW JERSEY ARISING

OUT OF THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

AND SEEKING DAMAGES FOR EXISTING DENTAL AND JAW-RELATED INJURIES,

INCLUDING OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, BUT NOT SOLELY SEEKING MEDICAL MONITORING, BE DESIGNATED AS A

MASS TORT FOR CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT PURPOSES BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE IN ATLANTIC COUNTY SUPERIOR

COURT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 189 CASES WERE PENDING AGAINST MSD IN THE NEW JERSEY

COORDINATED PROCEEDING. ON JULY 20, 2009, JUDGE HIGBEE ENTERED A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER (AND VARIOUS

AMENDMENTS THERETO) SETTING FORTH A SCHEDULE THAT CONTEMPLATES COMPLETING FACT DISCOVERY IN AN

INITIAL GROUP OF 10 CASES BY FEBRUARY 28, 2010, FOLLOWED BY EXPERT DISCOVERY IN FIVE OF THOSE

CASES, AND A PROJECTED TRIAL DATE OF JULY 12, 2010 FOR THE FIRST CASE TO BE TRIED IN THE NEW JERSEY

COORDINATED PROCEEDING.

DISCOVERY IS ONGOING IN THE

FOSAMAX

MDL LITIGATION, THE NEW JERSEY COORDINATED PROCEEDING, AND

THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONS WHERE

FOSAMAX

CASES ARE PENDING. MSD INTENDS TO DEFEND AGAINST THESE

LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, MSD HAD A REMAINING RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION SOLELY FOR

ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. DURING 2009, MSD SPENT APPROXIMATELY

$35 MILLION AND $40 MILLION WAS ADDED TO THE RESERVE. CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD

HAD A RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $38 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RESERVE

FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL DEFENSE COSTS INCURRED

THUS FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF MSDS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF

THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST MSD; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. MSD WILL CONTINUE

TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED RESERVES. DUE TO THE

UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, MSD IS UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2010. MSD HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL LITIGATION

AWP LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD WAS JOINED IN ONGOING LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE SOMETIMES USED IN

CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAW, INCLUDING FRAUD, MEDICAID FRAUD AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

VIOLATIONS, AMONG OTHER CLAIMS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE LITIGATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS COULD INCLUDE

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES, THE IMPOSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL FINES, PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE OR

ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING

FEDERAL AWP CASES TO FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE CONSOLIDATED

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT

COURT ACTIONS AND ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH, LIKE MSD, HAD

NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED MSDS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED MSD FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. MSD AND MANY

OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND

STATE COURT INCLUDING CASES BROUGHT INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

FIFTY OF THE COUNTY CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN NEW YORK STATE COURT. MSD WAS DISMISSED FROM

THE SUFFOLK COUNTY CASE, WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE FILED. IN ADDITION

TO THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD WAS A DEFENDANT IN STATE CASES BROUGHT

BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF ELEVEN STATES, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED. IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE

KANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL FILED SUIT AGAINST MSD AND SEVERAL OTHER MANUFACTURERS. AWP CLAIMS BROUGHT

BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ARIZONA AGAINST MSD WERE DROPPED IN 2009. THE COURT IN THE AWP CASES

PENDING IN HAWAII LISTED MSD AND OTHERS TO BE SET FOR TRIAL IN AUGUST 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD CONTINUES TO RESPOND TO LITIGATION BROUGHT BY CERTAIN STATES AND PRIVATE PAYORS AND TO

INVESTIGATIONS INITIATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

AND SEVERAL STATES REGARDING AWP. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN FEBRUARY 2008, MSD ENTERED INTO A CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENT

(CIA) WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

(HHS-OIG) FOR A FIVE-YEAR TERM. THE CIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT MSD MAINTAIN ITS

ETHICS TRAINING PROGRAM AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES AND MEDICAID

PRICE REPORTING. FURTHER, AS REQUIRED BY THE CIA, MSD HAS RETAINED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW

ORGANIZATION TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMS REVIEW OF ITS PROMOTIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND TO CONDUCT,

ON A SAMPLE BASIS, TRANSACTIONAL REVIEWS OF MSDS PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS AND CERTAIN MEDICAID PRICING

CALCULATIONS. MSD IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTS AND CERTIFICATIONS TO THE HHS-OIG

REGARDING ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE CIA. MSD BELIEVES THAT ITS PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES AND MEDICAID

PRICE REPORTS MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CIA.

VYTORIN/ZETIA

LITIGATION

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD (AS WELL AS MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE

COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS (O&I), AND THE

RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF

WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE

CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE AUGUST 2008, MSD (AS

WELL AS MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED THREE

ADDITIONAL LETTERS EACH FROM O&I, INCLUDING IDENTICAL LETTERS DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING

CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND A LETTER

FROM THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS, AND ON JULY 15,

2009, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH ANNOUNCED THAT THEY REACHED A CIVIL SETTLEMENT WITH THE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL REPRESENTING 35 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO RESOLVE A PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED

INVESTIGATION BY THAT GROUP INTO WHETHER THE COMPANIES VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION

LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANIES AGREED TO

REIMBURSE THE INVESTIGATIVE COSTS OF THE 35 STATES AND THE DISTRICT

OF COLUMBIA, WHICH TOTALED

$5.4 MILLION, AND TO MAKE VOLUNTARY ASSURANCES OF COMPLIANCE RELATED TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

, INCLUDING AGREEING TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT, THE

U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT, AND OTHER LAWS REQUIRING THE TRUTHFUL AND

NON-MISLEADING MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT INCLUDE ANY ADMISSION

OF MISCONDUCT OR LIABILITY BY THE COMPANIES. FURTHERMORE, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN

SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANIES RECEIVED LETTERS FROM THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE DOJ INFORMING

THEM THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THEIR CONDUCT RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE

INVESTIGATIONS AND RESPONDING TO THE INQUIRIES.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAD BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED WITH

APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. CERTAIN OF THOSE

LAWSUITS ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES AND/OR SOUGHT MEDICAL MONITORING. THE LAWSUITS AGAINST MSD AND

SCHERING-PLOUGH WERE CONSOLIDATED IN A SINGLE MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION DOCKET BEFORE JUDGE

CAVANAUGH OF THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY,

IN RE VYTORIN/ZETIA MARKETING SALES PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS

LIABILITY LITIGATION

. ON AUGUST 5, 2009, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR

CHOLESTEROL JOINT VENTURE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO RESOLVE, FOR A TOTAL FIXED AMOUNT OF

$41.5 MILLION, THESE CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. THE MSP PARTNERSHIP RECORDED THESE CHARGES IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2010, JUDGE CAVANAUGH GRANTED FINAL APPROVAL OF THE

SETTLEMENTS.

ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 3, 2008, AN MSD SHAREHOLDER FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTION LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING THAT MSD AND ITS

CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RICHARD T. CLARK, VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS. THIS SUIT HAS SINCE BEEN WITHDRAWN AND RE-FILED IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND HAS BEEN

CONSOLIDATED WITH ANOTHER FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE MERCK & CO., INC.

VYTORIN SECURITIES LITIGATION

. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, AND

NAMES AS DEFENDANTS MSD; MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC; AND CERTAIN OF MSDS CURRENT

AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT MSD DELAYED RELEASING

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL REGARDING THE EFFICACY OF

VYTORIN

AND THAT MSD

MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT EXPECTED EARNINGS, KNOWING THAT ONCE THE RESULTS OF THE

VYTORIN

STUDY WERE RELEASED, SALES OF

VYTORIN

WOULD DECLINE AND MSDS EARNINGS WOULD SUFFER. ON

DECEMBER 12, 2008, MSD AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THIS LAWSUIT ON THE GROUNDS THAT

THE PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM FOR WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2009, THE

COURT ISSUED AN OPINION AND ORDER DENYING THE DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THIS LAWSUIT, AND ON

OCTOBER 19, 2009, MSD AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED AN ANSWER TO THE AMENDED CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT.

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 22, 2008, A MEMBER OF AN MSD ERISA PLAN FILED A PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MSD AND CERTAIN OF MSDS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

ALLEGING THEY BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES UNDER ERISA. SINCE THAT TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER

SIMILAR ERISA LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST MSD IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY, AND ALL OF THOSE LAWSUITS

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE MERCK & CO., INC. VYTORIN ERISA LITIGATION

. A

CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 5, 2009, AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS MSD AND

VARIOUS CURRENT AND FORMER MEMBERS OF MSDS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE

ERISA PLANS INVESTMENT IN MSD STOCK WAS IMPRUDENT BECAUSE MSDS EARNINGS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE

COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF ITS CHOLESTEROL DRUG

VYTORIN

AND THAT DEFENDANTS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

THAT THE RESULTS OF A SCIENTIFIC STUDY WOULD CAUSE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO TURN TO LESS EXPENSIVE

DRUGS FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT. ON APRIL 23, 2009, MSD AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS

THIS LAWSUIT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM FOR WHICH RELIEF CAN BE

GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2009, THE COURT ISSUED AN OPINION AND ORDER DENYING THE DEFENDANTS MOTION

TO DISMISS THIS LAWSUIT. ON NOVEMBER 9, 2009, THE PLAINTIFFS MOVED TO STRIKE CERTAIN OF THE

DEFENDANTS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. THAT MOTION WAS FULLY BRIEFED ON DECEMBER 4, 2009 AND IS PENDING

BEFORE THE COURT.

MSD INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING

FROM THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR THE CIVIL LITIGATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED A LETTER TO MSDS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS

TO RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY MSD IN 2007 TO RESOLVE CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS DELIVERED

ANOTHER LETTER TO THE BOARD DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD OR A SUBCOMMITTEE THEREOF COMMENCE AN

INVESTIGATION INTO THE MATTERS RAISED BY VARIOUS CIVIL SUITS AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

RELATING TO

VYTORIN.

VACCINE LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD IS A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G., HEPATITIS B VACCINE)

THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN VACCINES. AS OF MARCH 2010, THERE WERE

APPROXIMATELY 200 THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS PENDING IN WHICH MSD IS A DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE

VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE LAWSUITS ARE NOT CURRENTLY ACTIVE. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE

MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS OF

THIMEROSAL. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED

NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC VACCINES. THERE ARE NO

CASES CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL. MSD WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MSD HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND

THAT THE ACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE VACCINE ACT).

THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A

PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE VACCINE

COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE

PETITIONER MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN VACCINE COURT AND THEN

TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO

VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. MSD IS

NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED

STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

MSD IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 5,000 CASES PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING

ALLEGATIONS THAT THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES AND/OR THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM

DISORDERS. NOT ALL OF THE

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDING

ARE MSD VACCINES. MSD IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE DOMESTICALLY. THE SPECIAL MASTERS

PRESIDING OVER THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD HEARINGS IN THREE TEST CASES INVOLVING THE THEORY

THAT THE COMBINATION OF

M-M-R

II VACCINE AND THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM

DISORDERS. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2009, THE SPECIAL MASTERS ISSUED DECISIONS IN EACH OF THOSE CASES,

FINDING THAT THE THEORY WAS UNSUPPORTED BY VALID SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THAT THE PETITIONERS IN

THE THREE CASES WERE THEREFORE NOT ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. TWO OF THOSE THREE CASES ARE CURRENTLY

ON APPEAL. THE SPECIAL MASTERS HELD SIMILAR HEARINGS IN THREE DIFFERENT TEST CASES INVOLVING THE

THEORY THAT THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES ALONE CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. ON MARCH 12, 2010, THE

SPECIAL MASTERS ISSUED DECISIONS IN THIS SECOND SET OF TEST CASES, FINDING THAT THE THEORY WAS ALSO

UNSUPPORTED BY VALID SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THAT THE PETITIONS IN THESE THREE CASES WERE ALSO NOT

ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. THE SPECIAL MASTERS HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD SIMILAR

HEARINGS INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT

M-M-R

II ALONE CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS, BUT THEY HAVE

STATED THAT THEY NO LONGER INTEND TO DO SO. THE VACCINE COURT HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO USE

THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THESE TEST CASE HEARINGS TO GUIDE THE ADJUDICATION OF THE REMAINING

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER CASES.

PATENT LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FILE ANDAS WITH THE FDA

SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF MSDS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED

BY MSD. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES GENERIC FORMS OF

FOSAMAX, NEXIUM, SINGULAIR

,

EMEND

AND

CANCIDAS

PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF MSDS (AND ASTRAZENECAS IN THE CASE OF

NEXIUM

) PATENTS CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, AN ANDA HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC

FORM OF

ZETIA

AND AN ANDA HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A

GENERIC FORM OF

VYTORIN

, BOTH PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF SCHERING-PLOUGHS PATENT CONCERNING EACH

PRODUCT. THE GENERIC COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT,

INVALIDITY AND UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. MSD HAS FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL

COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE (

FOSAMAX

) AND MONTELUKAST (

SINGULAIR

)

AND ASTRAZENECA AND MSD HAVE FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES

FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

). ALSO, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC VERSIONS OF

EZETIMIBE (

ZETIA

) AND EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN (

VYTORIN

). SIMILAR PATENT CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. MSD INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE VALID,

AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION

DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF

ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A GENERIC COMPANY INDICATING THAT IT

HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ZETIA

AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS THAT ARE LISTED FOR

ZETIA.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, MSD MARKETED

ZETIA

THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE, MSP SINGAPORE COMPANY LLC. ON

MARCH 22, 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MSP SINGAPORE COMPANY LLC FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT

AGAINST GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC., USA AND ITS PARENT CORPORATION (GLENMARK). THE LAWSUIT

AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF GLENMARKS ANDA UNTIL OCTOBER 2010 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT

DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE TRIAL IN THIS MATTER IS SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE ON

MAY 3, 2010.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, MSDS PARENT COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM MYLAN THAT IT FILED AN ANDA FOR

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND THAT IT WAS CHALLENGING TWO PATENTS LISTED IN THE FDA ORANGE BOOK FOR

VYTORIN

.  ON

DECEMBER 16, 2009, MSDS PARENT COMPANY FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST MYLAN.  THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS

FDA APPROVAL OF MYLANS ANDA UNTIL MAY 2012 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN FEBRUARY 2007, MSD RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS,

INC. (TEVA), A GENERIC COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR MONTELUKAST AND THAT IT

IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENT THAT IS LISTED FOR

SINGULAIR

. ON APRIL 2, 2007, MSD FILED A PATENT

INFRINGEMENT ACTION AGAINST TEVA. A TRIAL IN THIS MATTER WAS HELD IN FEBRUARY 2009. ON AUGUST 19,

2009, THE COURT ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT AND ORDERED THAT

TEVAS ANDA COULD NOT BE APPROVED PRIOR TO EXPIRY OF MSDS EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS IN AUGUST 2012. TEVA

HAD APPEALED THE DECISION, HOWEVER, IN JANUARY 2010, TEVA WITHDREW ITS APPEAL OF THE TRIAL COURTS

DECISION UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT. IN ADDITION, IN MAY 2009, THE UNITED

STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE GRANTED A PETITION BY ARTICLE ONE PARTNERS LLC TO REEXAMINE

MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT. ON DECEMBER 15, 2009, THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE ISSUED

A NOTICE INDICATING THAT IT WILL ALLOW THE CLAIMS OF MSDS

SINGULAIR

PATENT. PRODUCT EXCLUSIVITY IS

ACCORDINGLY EXPECTED TO BE MAINTAINED UNTIL AUGUST 2012.

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A DECISION REFUSING TO BAR THE

APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON THE GROUNDS THAT MSDS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS LIKELY

INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA IN JUNE

2005. IN JULY 2005, MSD WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX CORP. (APOTEX) SEEKING

DAMAGES FOR LOST SALES OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DUE TO THE PATENT PROCEEDING. IN OCTOBER 2008,

THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA ISSUED A DECISION AWARDING APOTEX ITS LOST PROFITS FOR ITS GENERIC

ALENDRONATE PRODUCT FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT IT WAS HELD OFF THE MARKET DUE TO MSDS LAWSUIT. IN

JUNE 2009, THE TRIAL COURT DECISION WAS UPHELD IN PART AND BOTH COMPANIES SOUGHT LEAVE TO APPEAL TO

THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA. IN JANUARY 2010, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA DECLINED TO HEAR THE

APPEAL, LEAVING INTACT THE DECISION THAT APOTEX IS ENTITLED TO DAMAGES FOR THE DISCRETE PERIOD OF

TIME THAT ITS MARKET ENTRY WAS POSTPONED DUE TO THE LITIGATION LAUNCHED BY MSD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2004, MSD APPEALED A DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION

OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (EPO) THAT REVOKED MSDS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. ON MARCH 14, 2006, THE BOARD OF APPEAL OF THE EPO UPHELD

THE DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION REVOKING THE PATENT. ON MARCH 28, 2007, THE EPO ISSUED

ANOTHER PATENT IN EUROPE TO MSD THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. UNDER

ITS TERMS, THIS NEW PATENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL JULY 2018. MSD HAS SUED MULTIPLE PARTIES IN EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES ASSERTING ITS EUROPEAN PATENT COVERING ONCE-WEEKLY DOSING OF

FOSAMAX

. DECISIONS HAVE BEEN

RENDERED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND BELGIUM INVALIDATING THE PATENT IN THOSE COUNTRIES. MSD HAS

APPEALED THESE DECISIONS. OPPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE EPO AGAINST THIS PATENT. IN A HEARING

HELD MARCH 17-19, 2009, THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE EPO ISSUED AN APPEALABLE DECISION REVOKING

THIS PATENT. MSD HAS APPEALED THE DECISION.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JAPAN AFTER A PROCEEDING WAS FILED CHALLENGING THE

VALIDITY OF MSDS JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE, THE PATENT

OFFICE INVALIDATED THE PATENT. THE DECISION IS UNDER APPEAL.

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE U.S. PATENT FOR DORZOLAMIDE, COVERING BOTH

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

, EXPIRED,

AFTER WHICH MSD EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S. SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS. MSD IS INVOLVED

IN LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS OF THE CORRESPONDING PATENTS IN CANADA AND GREAT BRITAIN AND GERMANY. IN

NOVEMBER 2009, THE TRIAL COURT IN GREAT BRITAIN ISSUED A DECISION FINDING MSDS

COSOPT

PATENT

INVALID. IN CANADA A TRIAL WAS HELD IN DECEMBER 2009 REGARDING MSDS CANADIAN

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

PATENTS. MSD IS AWAITING A DECISION.

MSD AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT RANBAXY HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. IN NOVEMBER

2005, MSD AND ASTRAZENECA SUED RANBAXY IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, ASTRAZENECA, MSD AND RANBAXY HAVE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES

THAT RANBAXY WILL NOT BRING ITS GENERIC ESOMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL

MAY 27, 2014. MSD AND ASTRAZENECA EACH RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND (CID) FROM THE U.S.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) IN JULY 2008 REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH RANBAXY. MSD

IS COOPERATING WITH THE FTC IN RESPONDING TO THIS CID.

MSD AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN JANUARY 2006 THAT IVAX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (IVAX),

SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED BY TEVA, HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS

PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. IN

OCTOBER 2009, MSD AND ASTRAZENECA SUED LUPIN IN THE DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY BASED ON LUPINS

FILING OF AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM.

IN JANUARY 2009, MSD RECEIVED NOTICE FROM SANDOZ THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA AND THAT IT WAS

CHALLENGING FIVE MSD PATENTS LISTED IN THE FDA ORANGE BOOK FOR

EMEND

. IN FEBRUARY 2009, MSD FILED A

PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST SANDOZ. THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF SANDOZS

ANDA UNTIL JULY 2011 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE

CASE IS SCHEDULED TO GO TO TRIAL IN DECEMBER 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE MERGER

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS BROUGHT AGAINST MSD CHALLENGING THE

MERGER AND SEEKING OTHER FORMS OF RELIEF. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE LAWSUIT HAS BEEN SETTLED

PENDING COURT APPROVAL.

THE SETTLEMENT, IF APPROVED BY THE COURT, WILL RESOLVE AND RELEASE ALL CLAIMS THAT WERE OR

COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY ANY SHAREHOLDER OF MSD CHALLENGING ANY ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER,

INCLUDING ANY MERGER DISCLOSURE CLAIMS.

OTHER LITIGATION

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING MSD, THAT ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS NOTE, IN THE OPINION OF MSD, ALL SUCH

PROCEEDINGS ARE EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED, SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY

RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF MSD, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT

IS PROVIDED IN THIS NOTE.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

MSD AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE PARTIES TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND,

AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE OPERATORS OF

HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS

WASTE DISPOSED OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP

COSTS. MSD HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED OF

AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY

LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE PROCEEDINGS

ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY

REFLECTS THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. MSDS POTENTIAL LIABILITY

VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR

OTHERS THE FINAL COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT

THE OUTCOME OF MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS,

IN THE OPINION OF MSD, SUCH PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR

CAPITAL RESOURCES OF MSD. MSD HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS

AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM

FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, APPROXIMATELY 2,200 PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT

AGAINST MSD AND 12 OTHER DEFENDANTS IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT, AS WELL AS

NEGLIGENCE AND NUISANCE. THE SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURY, DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUE,

MEDICAL MONITORING AND OTHER ALLEGED REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH GROUNDWATER

AND SOIL CONTAMINATION FOUND AT THE SITE OF A FORMER MSD SUBSIDIARY IN MERCED, CALIFORNIA. MSD

INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST THESE CLAIMS.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND TOTALED $72.7 MILLION AND $89.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT CONSIDER POTENTIAL

RECOVERIES FROM OTHER PARTIES AND WILL BE PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE

APPLICABLE SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE

INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $70.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE.

MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

PREFERRED STOCK OBLIGATION WITH A DIVIDEND RATE OF 5% PER ANNUM, WHICH IS CARRIED BY KBI AND

INCLUDED IN

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.

14. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

MSDS PARENT COMPANY HAS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER WHICH EMPLOYEES, NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN OF MSDS EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES MAY BE GRANTED OPTIONS TO

PURCHASE SHARES OF MSDS PARENT COMPANY COMMON STOCK AT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT.

IN ADDITION TO STOCK OPTIONS, MSDS PARENT COMPANY GRANTS PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (PSUS) AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) TO CERTAIN MANAGEMENT LEVEL EMPLOYEES. THESE PLANS WERE APPROVED BY

THE MSDS PARENT COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS.

AS

A RESULT OF THE MERGER ON NOVEMBER 3, 2009, MSD BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE MSDS

PARENT COMPANY. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MERGER, OUTSTANDING MSD SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

BECAME IDENTICAL AWARDS OF MSDS PARENT COMPANY. FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER, MSD

RECORDED THE EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. FOR PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER, AN

ALLOCATION OF THE EXPENSE FOR EMPLOYEES OF MSD AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAS BEEN RECORDED USING A CONSISTENT METHOD WITH MSDS PARENT COMPANY.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS ALLOCATION METHOD IS REASONABLE. THE TABLES BELOW REFLECT ACVITITY FOR

THESE AWARDS FOR MSD EMPLOYEES FOR THE PRE AND POST-MERGER PERIODS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, 105.5 MILLION SHARES COLLECTIVELY WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE

MSDS PARENT COMPANYS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. PRIOR TO THE MERGER, EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARDS WERE SETTLED PRIMARILY WITH TREASURY SHARES. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER, THESE

AWARDS ARE BEING SETTLED WITH NEWLY ISSUED MSDS PARENT COMPANY SHARES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO PURCHASE SHARES OF MSDS PARENT COMPANY COMMON STOCK AT

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT. THESE AWARDS GENERALLY VEST ONE-THIRD EACH YEAR OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD, WITH A CONTRACTUAL TERM OF 10 YEARS. RSUS ARE STOCK AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED TO

EMPLOYEES AND ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARDS VEST, AS WELL AS

NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE STOCK OPTION AND RSU AWARDS IS

DETERMINED AND FIXED ON THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE MSDS PARENT COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. PSUS ARE

STOCK AWARDS WHERE THE ULTIMATE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED WILL BE

CONTINGENT ON THE MSDS PARENT

COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AGAINST A PRE-SET OBJECTIVE OR SET OF OBJECTIVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH PSU

IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE OF GRANT BASED ON THE MSDS PARENT COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. OVER THE PSU

PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED WILL BE ADJUSTED

BASED ON THE PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVEMENT OF A PERFORMANCE TARGET AND FINAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE WILL

BE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ULTIMATE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED. RSU AND PSU DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE IN

SHARES OF MSDS PARENT COMPANY STOCK AFTER THE END OF THE VESTING OR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, GENERALLY

THREE YEARS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SUCH AWARDS.

TOTAL PRETAX SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST RECORDED IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $376.0 MILLION,

$348.0 MILLION AND $330.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WITH RELATED INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF

$119.5 MILLION, $107.5 MILLION AND $104.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL IS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTION GRANTS.

IN APPLYING THIS MODEL, BOTH HISTORICAL DATA AND CURRENT MARKET DATA ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR

VALUE OF OPTIONS. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL REQUIRES SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED DIVIDEND

YIELD, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, VOLATILITY, AND TERM OF THE OPTIONS. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD IS

BASED ON HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. THE RISK-FREE RATE IS BASED ON THE RATE AT GRANT

DATE OF ZERO-COUPON U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH A TERM EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTION.

EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED USING A BLEND OF HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE HISTORICAL

COMPONENT IS BASED ON HISTORICAL MONTHLY PRICE CHANGES. THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS OBTAINED FROM

MARKET DATA ON THE MSDS PARENT COMPANYS TRADED OPTIONS. THE EXPECTED LIFE REPRESENTS THE EXPECTED

AMOUNT OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING, BASED ON HISTORICAL AND

FORECASTED EXERCISE BEHAVIOR.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO MSD EMPLOYEES IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS

$4.02, $9.80 AND $9.51 PER OPTION, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE DETERMINED USING THE FOLLOWING

15. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

MSD HAS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN

CERTAIN OF ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES. PENSION BENEFITS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE BASED ON A

FORMULA THAT CONSIDERS FINAL AVERAGE PAY AND YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE. IN ADDITION, MSD PROVIDES

MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS, PRINCIPALLY TO ITS ELIGIBLE U.S. RETIREES AND SIMILAR

BENEFITS TO THEIR DEPENDENTS, THROUGH ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. MSD USES DECEMBER 31

AS THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE FOR ALL OF ITS PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WAS $4.6 BILLION IN

2009 AND $3.5 BILLION IN 2008. THE PENSION PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF U.S. PLANS INCLUDED IN

THIS TABLE WAS $5.2 BILLION IN 2009 AND $4.6 BILLION IN 2008. APPROXIMATELY 36% OF MSDS PENSION

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION RELATES TO INTERNATIONAL DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS, OF WHICH EACH

INDIVIDUAL PLAN IS NOT SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THE TOTAL BENEFIT OBLIGATION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $6.3 BILLION AND $5.7

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PENSION PLANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS WAS $4.0 BILLION AND $3.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR PENSION PLANS WITH BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS WAS $1.5 BILLION AND $4.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $2.7 BILLION AND $6.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THOSE PLANS WITH

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE FAIR

VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS WAS $483.1 MILLION AND $414.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $1.1 BILLION AND $880.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MSD ADOPTED NEW AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE ISSUED

BY THE FASB WHICH REVISED THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR PLAN ASSETS OF DEFINED PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THIS AMENDED GUIDANCE REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF HOW INVESTMENT ALLOCATION

DECISIONS ARE MADE, THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS, THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED

TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3) ON CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PERIOD, AND SIGNIFICANT

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS.

ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO USE A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH MAXIMIZES THE USE OF OBSERVABLE

INPUTS AND MINIMIZES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WHEN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. THERE ARE THREE

LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.

LEVEL 1

 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE PLANS

LEVEL 1 ASSETS PRIMARILY INCLUDE REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES (MUTUAL FUNDS) AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

LEVEL 2

 OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES; OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIABILITIES. THE PLANS LEVEL 2 ASSETS PRIMARILY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN COMMON/COLLECTIVE

TRUSTS AND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES AND

CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS.

LEVEL 3

 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY AND THAT

ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

METHODOLOGIES, OR SIMILAR TECHNIQUES, AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR

VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR ESTIMATION. THE PLANS LEVEL 3 ASSETS PRIMARILY INCLUDE

INVESTMENTS IN INSURANCE CONTRACTS WHICH ARE VALUED USING METHODOLOGIES THAT MANAGEMENT

UNDERSTANDS. THE PLANS LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS IN INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY VALUED USING A

CREDITING RATE THAT APPROXIMATES MARKET RETURNS AND INVEST IN UNDERLYING SECURITIES WHOSE MARKET

VALUES ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGIES,

OR SIMILAR TECHNIQUES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, $262.0 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 3.4%, OF THE

PENSION INVESTMENTS WERE CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3 ASSETS.

IF THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS FALL WITHIN MORE THAN ONE LEVEL DESCRIBED

ABOVE, THE CATEGORIZATION IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT.

MSD HAS ESTABLISHED INVESTMENT GUIDELINES FOR ITS U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

TO CREATE AN ASSET ALLOCATION THAT IS EXPECTED TO DELIVER A RATE OF RETURN SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE

LONG-TERM OBLIGATION OF EACH PLAN, GIVEN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK. THE TARGET INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

OF U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IS ALLOCATED 45% TO 60% IN U.S. EQUITIES,

20% TO 30% IN INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, 15% TO 25% IN FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS, AND UP TO 8% IN CASH

AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE PORTFOLIOS EQUITY WEIGHTING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF

THE PLANS BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE EXPECTED ANNUAL STANDARD DEVIATION OF RETURNS OF THE TARGET

PORTFOLIO, WHICH APPROXIMATES 13%, REFLECTS BOTH THE EQUITY ALLOCATION AND THE DIVERSIFICATION

BENEFITS AMONG THE ASSET CLASSES IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO INVESTS. FOR NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS, THE

TARGETED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO VARIES BASED ON THE DURATION OF PENSION LIABILITIES AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENT RULES AND REGULATIONS. ALTHOUGH A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN

U.S. EQUITIES, CONCENTRATION RISK IS MITIGATED THROUGH THE USE OF STRATEGIES THAT ARE DIVERSIFIED

WITHIN MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS DURING 2010 ARE

EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION AND $50 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

MSD REASSESSES ITS BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS. FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS EVALUATED ON MEASUREMENT DATES AND MODIFIED TO

REFLECT THE PREVAILING MARKET NOTE OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS

REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE RATE OF RETURN TO BE EARNED ON PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PERIOD THE BENEFITS

INCLUDED IN THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION ARE TO BE PAID AND IS DETERMINED ON A COUNTRY BASIS. IN

DEVELOPING THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN WITHIN EACH COUNTRY, LONG-TERM HISTORICAL RETURNS DATA IS

CONSIDERED AS WELL AS ACTUAL RETURNS ON THE PLAN ASSETS AND OTHER CAPITAL MARKETS EXPERIENCE. USING

THIS REFERENCE INFORMATION, THE LONG-TERM RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH ASSET CATEGORY AND A

WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED RETURN FOR EACH COUNTRYS TARGET PORTFOLIO IS DEVELOPED, ACCORDING TO THE

ALLOCATION AMONG THOSE INVESTMENT CATEGORIES. THE EXPECTED PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE REFLECTS THE

CONTRIBUTION OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE. FOR 2010, MSDS EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN OF 8.75%

WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM 2009 FOR ITS U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

INTEREST INCOME IN 2009 INCLUDES INTEREST INCOME FROM AFFILIATES

OF $148.7 MILLION AND INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2009 INCLUDES INTEREST EXPENSE FROM

AFFILIATES OF $28.3 MILLION.

THE DECLINE IN INTEREST INCOME IN 2009 AS COMPARED WITH 2008 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER

INTEREST RATES AND A CHANGE IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MIX TOWARD CASH AND SHORTER-DATED

SECURITIES IN ANTICIPATION OF THE MERGER. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2009 IS LARGELY DUE

TO $174 MILLION OF COMMITMENT FEES AND INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FINANCING OF THE

MERGER. INCLUDED IN OTHER, NET IN 2009 WAS A $3.2 BILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF MSDS INTEREST IN

MERIAL (SEE NOTE 10), $231 MILLION OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RECOGNIZED NET GAINS, AND AN $80 MILLION

CHARGE RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE

VIOXX

THIRD-PARTY PAYOR LITIGATION IN THE UNITED STATES.

INCLUDED IN OTHER, NET IN 2008 WAS AN AGGREGATE GAIN ON DISTRIBUTION FROM AZLP OF $2.2 BILLION (SEE

NOTE 10), A GAIN OF $249 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF THE REMAINING WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO

AGGRASTAT

, A $300 MILLION EXPENSE FOR A CONTRIBUTION TO THE MERCK COMPANY FOUNDATION, $117 MILLION

OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RECOGNIZED NET LOSSES AND A $58 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF

AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER MSD VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WITH RESPECT TO THE SALES

AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE FLUCTUATION IN EXCHANGE LOSSES (GAINS) IN 2008 FROM 2007 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER

COST OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS DUE TO LOWER U.S. INTEREST RATES AND UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS OF

PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON NET LONG OR NET SHORT FOREIGN

CURRENCY POSITIONS, CONSIDERING BOTH NET MONETARY ASSETS AND RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS.

THE CHANGE IN OTHER, NET FOR 2008 PRIMARILY REFLECTS AN AGGREGATE GAIN IN 2008 FROM AZLP OF $2.2

BILLION, THE IMPACT OF A $671 MILLION CHARGE IN 2007 RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN CIVIL

GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AND A 2008 GAIN OF $249 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF THE REMAINING

WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $300 MILLION EXPENSE FOR A CONTRIBUTION TO THE

REFLECTS THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE IN 2007 DISCUSSED BELOW.

IF MSD WERE TO RECOGNIZE THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $3.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE INCOME TAX PROVISION WOULD REFLECT A FAVORABLE NET IMPACT OF $2.6 BILLION.

THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE

ANTICIPATED CLOSURE OF VARIOUS TAX EXAMINATIONS. MSD ESTIMATES THAT THE CHANGE COULD RESULT IN A

REDUCTION IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $240 MILLION.

INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A (BENEFIT) EXPENSE

OF $(184) MILLION IN 2009, $101 MILLION IN 2008 AND $270 MILLION IN 2007. LIABILITIES FOR ACCRUED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION OF

MSDS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1993 TO 2001. AS A RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION, MSD MADE AN AGGREGATE

PAYMENT OF $2.79 BILLION IN FEBRUARY 2007. THIS PAYMENT WAS OFFSET BY (I) A TAX REFUND OF $165

MILLION RECEIVED IN 2007 FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID FOR THESE MATTERS AND (II) A FEDERAL TAX

BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $360 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT, RESULTING IN A

NET CASH COST TO MSD OF APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION IN 2007. THE IMPACT FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2001

FOR ITEMS REVIEWED AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT ALTHOUGH THOSE YEARS

REMAIN OPEN IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS. THE CLOSING OF THE IRS EXAMINATION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON MSDS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2007 AS THESE AMOUNTS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED FOR.

MSD REPORTED THE RESULTS OF THE IRS ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE YEARS 1993 THROUGH 2001 TO VARIOUS

STATE TAX AUTHORITIES. THIS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL TAX, AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTY PAYMENTS OF

$20 MILLION AND $9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2008 AND $57 MILLION AND $67 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN

2007, AND AN EQUIVALENT REDUCTION IN THE BALANCES OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, ACCRUED INTEREST

AND PENALTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN OCTOBER 2006, THE CANADA REVENUE AGENCY (CRA) ISSUED MSD A

NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT CONTAINING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS. IN

FEBRUARY 2009, MSD AND THE CRA NEGOTIATED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN REGARD TO THESE MATTERS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE SETTLEMENT, MSD PAID AN ADDITIONAL TAX OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION (U.S.

DOLLARS) AND INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY $360 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) WITH NO ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OR

PENALTIES DUE ON THIS ASSESSMENT. THE SETTLEMENT WAS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

MSD HAD PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THESE MATTERS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TAXES PAID

IS EXPECTED TO BE CREDITABLE FOR U.S. TAX PURPOSES. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSOCIATED

COLLATERAL AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2008, THE CRA PROPOSED ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS FOR 1999

AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO OTHER INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS. THE ADJUSTMENTS WOULD

INCREASE CANADIAN TAX DUE BY APPROXIMATELY $312 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS $314 MILLION (U.S.

DOLLARS) OF INTEREST THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CRA WILL PROPOSE SIMILAR

ADJUSTMENTS FOR LATER YEARS. MSD DISAGREES WITH THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE CRA AND BELIEVES THEY

ARE WITHOUT MERIT. MSD INTENDS TO CONTEST THE ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE CRA APPEALS PROCESS AND THE

COURTS IF NECESSARY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON MSDS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS FOR THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DURING 2007, MSD

PLEDGED COLLATERAL TO TWO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ONE OF WHICH PROVIDED A GUARANTEE TO THE CRA AND

THE OTHER TO THE QUEBEC MINISTRY OF REVENUE REPRESENTING A PORTION OF THE TAX AND INTEREST

ASSESSED. AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT NOTED ABOVE, GUARANTEES REQUIRED TO APPEAL THE DISPUTES

WERE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED AND APPROXIMATELY $960 MILLION OF ASSOCIATED COLLATERAL WAS RELEASED.

CERTAIN OF THE CASH AND INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO BE COLLATERALIZED FOR GUARANTEES REQUIRED TO APPEAL

OTHER CANADIAN TAX DISPUTES. THE

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDER OF MERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP..

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, EQUITY AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF MERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP. (THE COMPANY) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER

31, 2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH

OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED,

IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT UNDER ITEM 9A. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS

OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS

OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT,

AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE

DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN

WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN 2007.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN

WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN 2009.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN

WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN 2009.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I)

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

MANAGEMENT OF MSD, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER, EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MSDS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. BASED ON THEIR

EVALUATION, AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FORM 10-K, MSDS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT MSDS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS

DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) OR 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE

ACT)) ARE EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) OF THE ACT. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN

EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK

IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF

THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MSDS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR

REPORT WHICH APPEARS HEREIN.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION COMPLETED THE MERGER. DURING THE 2009

PERIOD LEADING UP TO THE MERGER, THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO MSDS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING THAT WERE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT. FOR THE POST-MERGER PERIOD,

MANAGEMENT MAINTAINED THE OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY OF MSDS LEGACY CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

TO SUPPORT BUSINESS INTEGRATION PLANS, A PROCESS FOR EVALUATING AND ADDRESSING NECESSARY CHANGES TO

THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS ADOPTED. AS MSD HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IT

IS IN THE PROCESS OF A MULTI-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE WIDE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM.

MSD INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT THIS SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2010 AND FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

ARE UNDER REVISION TO ADDRESS MSDS REQUIREMENTS. IN 2009, MSD ENTITIES IMPLEMENTED A WORLDWIDE

EMPLOYEE DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SYSTEM INCLUDED MODIFICATIONS TO THE

DESIGN AND OPERATION OF CONTROLS VALIDATING COMPONENTS OF EMPLOYEE MASTER DATA.

AND CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES AND TOTALED $85 MILLION IN 2009.

5. LEGAL AND OTHER MATTERS

THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BECOME PARTY TO CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL

TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE PARTNERSHIP RECORDS A

LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MATTERS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND AN

AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION

ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE PARTNERSHIP MAINTAINS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH DEDUCTIBLES AND SELF-INSURANCE AS MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES IS COST BENEFICIAL. THE PARTNERSHIP SELF-INSURES ALL OF ITS RISK AS IT RELATES TO PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND ACCRUES AN ESTIMATE OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC. USA

(GLENMARK), A GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ABBREVIATED NEW

DRUG APPLICATION (ANDA) FOR A GENERIC FORM OF ZETIA AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS

THAT ARE LISTED FOR ZETIA. IN MARCH 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE

PARTNERSHIP FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST GLENMARK AND ITS PARENT COMPANY. THE

LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA

APPROVAL OF GLENMARKS ANDA UNTIL THE EARLIER OF OCTOBER 2010 OR AN

ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY. THE TRIAL IN THIS MATTER IS SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE ON MAY 3, 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEW MERCK AND THE PARTNERSHIP INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH THEY BELIEVE ARE

VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE

OUTCOMES WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY.

IN

NOVEMBER 2009, NEW MERCK RECEIVED NOTICE FROM MYLAN THAT IT FILED AN ANDA FOR

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND THAT IT WAS CHALLENGING TWO PATENTS LISTED IN THE FDA ORANGE BOOK FOR

VYTORIN. ON DECEMBER 16, 2009, NEW MERCK FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST MYLAN.

THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF MYLANS ANDA UNTIL MAY 2012 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE

COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2008, THE PARTNERS ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF

COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC

PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (ENHANCE) CLINICAL TRIAL, AN

IMAGING TRIAL IN 720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE GENETIC

CONDITION THAT CAUSES VERY HIGH LEVELS OF LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL AND GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK FOR

PREMATURE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG (VYTORIN) SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN

SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT WITH

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE PRE-SPECIFIED PRIMARY ENDPOINT, A CHANGE IN THE

THICKNESS OF CAROTID ARTERY WALLS OVER TWO YEARS AS MEASURED BY ULTRASOUND. THE IMPROVED REDUCTION

IN HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS PRESENTING WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (IMPROVE-IT) TRIAL IS UNDERWAY AND

IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES DATA FOR EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IN PATIENTS WITH

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME. NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN ON CARDIOVASCULAR

MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN

JANUARY 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE FINAL CLINICAL STUDY REPORT

OF ENHANCE. THE FDA STATED THAT THE RESULTS FROM ENHANCE DID NOT CHANGE ITS POSITION THAT AN

ELEVATED LDL CHOLESTEROL IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND THAT LOWERING LDL

CHOLESTEROL REDUCES THE RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.

ON JULY 21, 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE SIMVASTATIN AND EZETIMIBE IN AORTIC

STENOSIS (SEAS) STUDY WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INTENSIVE LIPID

LOWERING WITH VYTORIN 10/40 MG WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK OF

CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO

MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO HAD NO INDICATION FOR STATIN THERAPY. VYTORIN FAILED TO MEET ITS

PRIMARY END POINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. IN THE STUDY, PATIENTS IN THE

GROUP WHO TOOK VYTORIN 10/40 MG HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF CANCER THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO.

THERE WAS ALSO A NONSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM CANCER IN PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN VERSUS THOSE WHO TOOK PLACEBO. CANCER AND CANCER DEATHS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL MAJOR

ORGAN SYSTEMS. THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP BELIEVE THE CANCER FINDING IN SEAS IS LIKELY TO BE

AN ANOMALY THAT, TAKEN IN LIGHT OF ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION WITH

VYTORIN. IN AUGUST 2008, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING THE RESULTS FROM THE SEAS

TRIAL. IN DECEMBER 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE DATA FROM THE

SEAS TRIAL AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF INTERIM DATA FROM THE STUDY OF HEART AND RENAL PROTECTION

(SHARP) AND IMPROVE-IT TRIALS. BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE FDA INDICATED IT

BELIEVED IT IS UNLIKELY THAT VYTORIN OR ZETIA INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER-RELATED DEATH. THE SHARP

TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010. THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION IN

2013. IN THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL, RECENTLY APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE ENDPOINTS WERE ACCRUED AND A

BLINDED INTERIM EFFICACY ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED BY THE DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB) FOR

THE TRIAL. AFTER PERFORMING THE ANALYSIS THE DSMB APPROVED CONTINUING THE STUDY.

THE PARTNERS ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE

AVAILABLE DATA AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE DATA; HOWEVER, THE PARTNERS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGES

IN THE CLINICAL USE OF VYTORIN ARE WARRANTED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE DECEMBER 2007, MSD AND NEW MERCK HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

ADDRESSED TO BOTH COMPANIES FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON

OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS (O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A

VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF VYTORIN, AS WELL

AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE AUGUST 2008,

THE PARTNERS HAVE RECEIVED THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM O&I, INCLUDING ONE DATED FEBRUARY 19,

2009, SEEKING CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL. ALSO, AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK

STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND A LETTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL

SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS, AND ON JULY 15, 2009, THE PARTNERS AND THE

PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THAT THEY

100

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REACHED A CIVIL SETTLEMENT WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL REPRESENTING

35 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO RESOLVE A PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED INVESTIGATION BY THAT

GROUP INTO WHETHER THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN

MARKETING

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREED TO

REIMBURSE THE INVESTIGATIVE COSTS OF THE 35 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHICH TOTALED

$5.4 MILLION, AND TO MAKE VOLUNTARY ASSURANCES OF COMPLIANCE RELATED TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

, INCLUDING AGREEING TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT, THE

U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT, AND OTHER LAWS REQUIRING THE TRUTHFUL AND

NON-MISLEADING MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT INCLUDE ANY ADMISSION

OF MISCONDUCT OR LIABILITY BY THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP. FURTHERMORE, AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP RECEIVED LETTERS FROM THE CIVIL

DIVISION OF THE DOJ INFORMING THEM THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THEIR CONDUCT RELATING TO

THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE

PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP ARE COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND RESPONDING TO THE

INQUIRIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP HAVE BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD

CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF VYTORIN AND ZETIA. CERTAIN OF

THOSE LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURIES AND/OR SEEK MEDICAL MONITORING. THE LAWSUITS AGAINST THE

PARTNERS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN A SINGLE MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION DOCKET BEFORE JUDGE CAVANAUGH OF

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY,

IN RE VYTORIN/ZETIA MARKETING SALES PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS LIABILITY

LITIGATION

. ON AUGUST 5, 2009, THE PARTNERS JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR CHOLESTEROL JOINT

VENTURE, ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO RESOLVE, FOR A TOTAL FIXED AMOUNT OF $41.5 MILLION, THESE CIVIL

CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. THE PARTNERSHIP RECORDED THESE CHARGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. ON

FEBRUARY 9, 2010, JUDGE CAVANAUGH GRANTED FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENTS.

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL PARTNERSHIP

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

(COLLECTIVELY THE PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS (THE AGREEMENTS) TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES, SCHERING-PLOUGHS THEN INVESTIGATIONAL CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION

INHIBITOR (CAI) EZETIMIBE (MARKETED TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES AS ZETIA AND AS EZETROL IN MOST

OTHER COUNTRIES) (THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION) AND A FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE (THE RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION). MONTELUKAST

SODIUM, A LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IS SOLD BY MERCK AS SINGULAIR AND LORATADINE, AN

ANTIHISTAMINE, IS SOLD BY SCHERING-PLOUGH AS CLARITIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE INDICATED FOR THE RELIEF

OF SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS. THE RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION WAS TERMINATED IN 2008 IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF A NOT-APPROVABLE LETTER FROM

THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOR THE FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET.

THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION IS FORMALLY REFERRED TO AS THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL

PARTNERSHIP (THE PARTNERSHIP). IN DECEMBER 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WERE

EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCEPT JAPAN. THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION

AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR EZETIMIBE TO BE DEVELOPED AND MARKETED IN THE FOLLOWING FORMS.



EZETIMIBE, A ONCE DAILY CAI, NON-STATIN CHOLESTEROL REDUCING MEDICINE USED ALONE OR

CO-ADMINISTERED WITH ANY STATIN DRUG, AND



EZETIMIBE AND SIMVASTATIN (MERCKS EXISTING ZOCOR STATIN CHOLESTEROL MODIFYING

MEDICINE) COMBINED INTO ONE TABLET (MARKETED TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES AS VYTORIN AND AS

INEGY IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES).

VYTORIN AND ZETIA WERE APPROVED BY THE FDA IN JULY 2004 AND OCTOBER 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

TOGETHER, THESE PRODUCTS, WHETHER MARKETED AS VYTORIN, ZETIA OR UNDER OTHER TRADEMARKS LOCALLY, ARE

REFERRED TO AS THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS.

PURPOSE LEGAL ENTITY BASED IN SINGAPORE WAS ESTABLISHED TO OWN THE RIGHTS TO THE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY AND TO FUND AND OVERSEE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES OF THE

CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION. IN ALL OTHER MARKETS EXCEPT LATIN AMERICA, SUBSIDIARIES OF MERCK OR

SCHERING-PLOUGH PERFORM MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE

PARTNERSHIP. THESE LEGAL ENTITY AND SUBSIDIARY OPERATIONS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE

COMBINED COMPANIES. IN LATIN AMERICA, THE PARTNERSHIP SELLS DIRECTLY TO SCHERING-PLOUGH AND

MERCKS LATIN AMERICAN SUBSIDIARIES AND SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MERCK COMPETE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN

THE CHOLESTEROL MARKET. CONSEQUENTLY, SELLING, PROMOTION AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES FOR THE

CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS WITHIN LATIN AMERICA ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMBINED COMPANIES.

THE PARTNERSHIP IS SUBSTANTIALLY RELIANT ON THE INFRASTRUCTURES OF MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE PARTNERS AND INVOICED TO THE PARTNERSHIP ARE

SHARED EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR SPECIAL ALLOCATIONS IN THE NATURE OF MILESTONES

DUE TO ONE OF THE PARTNERS.

THE PARTNERSHIPS FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND CASH FLOWS MAY DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THE HISTORICAL RESULTS PRESENTED HEREIN BECAUSE OF THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

RELATED TO THE PARTNERSHIPS BUSINESS. THE

PARTNERSHIPS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CHOLESTEROL

PRODUCTS. ANY EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET FOR THOSE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE PARTNERSHIPS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE EVENTS COULD INCLUDE LOSS

OF PATENT PROTECTION, INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING, INCREASED COMPETITION FROM THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS, EXCLUSION FROM GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS,

DISCONTINUATION OR REMOVAL FROM THE MARKET OF A PRODUCT FOR SAFETY OR OTHER REASON, AND THE RESULTS

EXPENSES, CASH FLOWS AND PARTNERS CAPITAL (DEFICIT) INCLUDE THE CHOLESTEROL AND RESPIRATORY

COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES. INTERPARTNERSHIP BALANCES AND PROFITS ARE

ELIMINATED.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED BASED ON CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE

PARTNERS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING SUCH ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES

DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS AND GOVERNMENT AND MANAGED CARE REBATES. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT

IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CASH HELD BY THE PARTNERSHIP. THE PARTNERSHIPS

CASH, WHICH IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN HIGHLY LIQUID MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, IS USED TO FUND TRADE

OBLIGATIONS COMING DUE IN THE MONTH AND FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTNERS. INTEREST INCOME EARNED

ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE IN

THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES AND AMOUNTED TO

$10 MILLION AND $8 MILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ARE REFLECTED AS A DIRECT REDUCTION TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND

AMOUNTED TO $34 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. ACCRUALS FOR REBATES ARE REFLECTED AS REBATES

PAYABLE, SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE COMBINED BALANCE SHEET.

INCOME TAXES

GENERALLY, TAXABLE INCOME OR LOSSES OF THE PARTNERSHIP ARE ALLOCATED TO THE PARTNERS AND

INCLUDED IN EACH PARTNERS INCOME TAX RETURN. IN SOME STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS, THE

PARTNERSHIP IS SUBJECT TO AN INCOME TAX, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SHARED BETWEEN THE PARTNERS. EXCEPT FOR THESE INCOME TAXES, WHICH ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE

COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, NO PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR FEDERAL, FOREIGN OR STATE INCOME

TAXES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE PARTNERSHIP HAD $49 MILLION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COMPRISED

SOLELY OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS (NOLS) GENERATED BY A BRANCH OF A LEGAL ENTITY OF THE

PARTNERSHIP. THESE NOLS EXPIRE BETWEEN 2009 AND 2015, AND CARRY A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN

JANUARY 2007, THE PARTNERSHIP ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48).

ADOPTION OF FIN 48 HAD NO IMPACT ON THE

PARTNERSHIPS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK & SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE PARTNERSHIPS CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE

PARTNERSHIP DOES NOT NORMALLY REQUIRE COLLATERAL OR OTHER SECURITY TO SUPPORT CREDIT SALES. BAD

DEBTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 HAVE BEEN MINIMAL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THREE

CUSTOMERS EACH REPRESENTED 25%, 19% AND 17% OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET. THE SAME THREE CUSTOMERS

THE PARTNERSHIP HAS ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS WITH THE PARTNERS FOR THE SUPPLY OF

ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS (API) AND FOR THE FORMULATION AND PACKAGING OF THE CHOLESTEROL

PRODUCTS AT AN AGREED UPON COST. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE SUPPLY AGREEMENTS, THE PARTNERSHIP HAS

ENTERED INTO CAPACITY AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH THE PARTNERSHIP HAS COMMITTED TO TAKE A SPECIFIED

ANNUAL MINIMUM SUPPLY OF API AND FORMULATED TABLETS OR PAY A PENALTY. THESE CAPACITY AGREEMENTS ARE

IN EFFECT FOR A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF PRODUCTION BY ONE OF THE

PARTNERS AND EXPIRE BEGINNING IN 2009. THE PARTNERSHIP HAD NO PAYMENT OBLIGATION UNDER THE CAPACITY

AGREEMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

THE PARTNERSHIP RECEIVES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCT, MANUFACTURING SERVICES, SALES FORCE SERVICES, ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND R&D SERVICES,

FROM ITS PARTNERS. THE PARTNERSHIP HAD A NET PAYABLE TO MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH FOR THESE

SERVICES OF $81 MILLION AND $100 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCLUDES CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED COSTS FOR PHYSICIAN

DETAILING PROVIDED BY SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MERCK OF $223 MILLION AND $201 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN

2008 AND $242 MILLION AND $197 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2007. THESE EXPENSES ARE NOT NECESSARILY

REFLECTIVE OF THE ACTUAL COST OF THE PARTNERS SALES EFFORTS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE AMOUNTS

ARE CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED. INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE $68 MILLION AND $60 MILLION IN 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED COSTS OF PHYSICIAN DETAILING IN ITALY. THESE

AMOUNTS WERE NOT INVOICED OR PAID BY THE PARTNERSHIP TO THE PARTNERS, BUT ARE A COMPONENT OF THE

PROFIT SHARING CALCULATION.

COST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDE CONTRACTUALLY

DEFINED COSTS FOR DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES PROVIDED BY MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH OF

$39 MILLION AND $34 MILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY

REFLECTIVE OF THE ACTUAL COSTS FOR SUCH DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.

THE PARTNERSHIP ALSO SELLS CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THE PARTNERS, PRINCIPALLY TO MERCK

AND SCHERING-PLOUGH AFFILIATES IN LATIN AMERICA. IN LATIN AMERICA, WHERE THE PARTNERS COMPETE WITH

ONE ANOTHER IN THE CHOLESTEROL MARKET, MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH PURCHASE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS FROM

THE PARTNERSHIP AND SELL DIRECTLY TO THIRD PARTIES. SALES TO THE PARTNERS ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES

AT THEIR INVOICED PRICE IN THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL

EXPENSES AND TOTALED $74 MILLION AND $82 MILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

5. LEGAL AND OTHER MATTERS

THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BECOME PARTY TO CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL

TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE PARTNERSHIP RECORDS A

LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MATTERS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND AN

AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION

ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE PARTNERSHIP MAINTAINS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH DEDUCTIBLES AND SELF-INSURANCE AS MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES IS COST BENEFICIAL. THE PARTNERSHIP SELF-INSURES ALL OF ITS RISK AS IT RELATES TO PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND ACCRUES AN ESTIMATE OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC. USA

(GLENMARK), A GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ABBREVIATED NEW

DRUG APPLICATION (ANDA) FOR A GENERIC FORM OF ZETIA AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS

THAT ARE LISTED FOR ZETIA. IN MARCH 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE PARTNERSHIP FILED A PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST GLENMARK AND ITS PARENT COMPANY. THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA

APPROVAL OF GLENMARKS ANDA UNTIL THE EARLIER OF OCTOBER 2010 OR AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY.

SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE PARTNERSHIP INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH THEY BELIEVE ARE

VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE

OUTCOMES WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE PARTNERS ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND

HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (ENHANCE) CLINICAL TRIAL, AN IMAGING TRIAL IN

720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES

VERY HIGH LEVELS OF LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL AND GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK FOR PREMATURE CORONARY

ARTERY DISEASE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG (VYTORIN) SIGNIFICANTLY

LOWERED LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE PRE-SPECIFIED

PRIMARY ENDPOINT, A CHANGE IN THE THICKNESS OF CAROTID ARTERY WALLS OVER TWO YEARS AS MEASURED BY

ULTRASOUND. THERE ALSO WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN

AND SIMVASTATIN ON THE FOUR PRE-SPECIFIED KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: PERCENT OF PATIENTS MANIFESTING

REGRESSION IN THE AVERAGE CAROTID ARTERY INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS (CA IMT); PROPORTION OF PATIENTS

DEVELOPING NEW CAROTID ARTERY PLAQUES >1.3 MM; CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM CA IMT; AND

CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE CA IMT PLUS IN THE AVERAGE COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY IMT. IN ENHANCE, WHEN

COMPARED TO SIMVASTATIN ALONE, EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL,

AS WELL AS TRIGLYCERIDES AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP). EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR

THE REDUCTION OF CRP. IN THE ENHANCE STUDY, THE OVERALL SAFETY PROFILE OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN WAS

GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE PRODUCT LABEL. THE ENHANCE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED NOR POWERED TO

EVALUATE CARDIOVASCULAR CLINICAL EVENTS. THE IMPROVED REDUCTION IN HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS PRESENTING

WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (IMPROVE-IT) TRIAL IS UNDERWAY AND IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES DATA FOR EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME. NO

INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN ON CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND

ABOVE THAT DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN MARCH 2008, THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE

WERE REPORTED AT THE ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC SESSION OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY. IN JANUARY

2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE FINAL CLINICAL STUDY REPORT OF

ENHANCE. THE FDA STATED THAT THE RESULTS FROM ENHANCE DID NOT CHANGE ITS POSITION THAT AN ELEVATED

LDL CHOLESTEROL IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND THAT LOWERING LDL CHOLESTEROL

REDUCES THE RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE FDA ALSO STATED THAT, BASED ON CURRENT AVAILABLE

DATA, PATIENTS SHOULD NOT STOP TAKING VYTORIN OR OTHER CHOLESTEROL LOWERING MEDICATIONS AND SHOULD

TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT VYTORIN, ZETIA, OR THE ENHANCE TRIAL.

ON JULY 21, 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE SIMVASTATIN AND EZETIMIBE IN AORTIC

STENOSIS (SEAS) STUDY WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INTENSIVE LIPID

LOWERING WITH VYTORIN 10/40 MG WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK OF

CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO

MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO HAD NO INDICATION FOR STATIN THERAPY. VYTORIN FAILED TO MEET ITS

PRIMARY END POINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. THERE ALSO WAS NO SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF AORTIC VALVE EVENTS; HOWEVER, THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN

THE GROUP OF PATIENTS TAKING VYTORIN COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF ISCHEMIC

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. VYTORIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF AORTIC STENOSIS. NO

INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF VYTORIN ON CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT

DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN THE STUDY, PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN 10/40 MG HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF CANCER THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO. THERE WAS ALSO A

NONSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM CANCER IN PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK VYTORIN VERSUS

THOSE WHO TOOK PLACEBO. CANCER AND CANCER DEATHS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL MAJOR ORGAN SYSTEMS.

THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP BELIEVE THE CANCER FINDING IN SEAS IS LIKELY TO BE AN ANOMALY

THAT, TAKEN IN LIGHT OF ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION WITH VYTORIN. IN

AUGUST 2008, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING THE RESULTS FROM THE SEAS TRIAL. IN THIS

ANNOUNCEMENT, THE FDA ALSO CITED INTERIM DATA FROM TWO LARGE ONGOING CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS OF

VYTORIN  THE STUDY OF HEART AND RENAL PROTECTION (SHARP) AND THE IMPROVE-IT CLINICAL TRIALS  IN

WHICH THERE WAS NO INCREASED RISK OF CANCER WITH THE COMBINATION OF SIMVASTATIN PLUS EZETIMIBE. THE

SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010. THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION

AROUND 2012. THE FDA DETERMINED THAT, AS OF THAT TIME, THESE FINDINGS IN THE SEAS TRIAL PLUS THE

INTERIM DATA FROM ONGOING TRIALS SHOULD NOT PROMPT PATIENTS TO STOP TAKING VYTORIN OR ANY OTHER

CHOLESTEROL LOWERING DRUG.

THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES TO FURTHER

EVALUATE THE AVAILABLE DATA AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE DATA, AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGES IN

THE CLINICAL USE OF VYTORIN ARE WARRANTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE DECEMBER 2007, MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL

LETTERS ADDRESSED TO BOTH COMPANIES FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, ITS

SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS (O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE SENATE

FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND

INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS OF MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH. IN ADDITION,

SINCE AUGUST 2008, THE PARTNERS HAVE RECEIVED THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM O&I, INCLUDING ONE

DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL

TRIAL. ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM

THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OFFICES AND A LETTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT

ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARTNERS AND THE

PARTNERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED FIVE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CIDS) FROM A MULTISTATE GROUP OF 35

STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO ARE JOINTLY INVESTIGATING WHETHER VIOLATIONS OF STATE CONSUMER

PROTECTION LAWS OCCURRED WHEN MARKETING VYTORIN. FINALLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, MERCK AND

SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ)

INFORMING THEM THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANIES CONDUCT RELATING TO THE

PROMOTION OF VYTORIN CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE

PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP ARE COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND RESPONDING TO THE

INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP HAVE BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED WITH

APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF VYTORIN AND ZETIA. CERTAIN OF THOSE

LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURIES AND/OR SEEK MEDICAL MONITORING. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN

FILED IN OR TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT, ARE COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT COURT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE DENNIS M. CAVANAUGH.

THE PARTIES ARE PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN MOTIONS PRACTICE AND BRIEFING.

WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS OR LAWSUITS ARISING FROM

THE ENHANCE AND SEAS CLINICAL TRIALS, UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE PARTNERSHIPS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

PARTNERSHIP (THE PARTNERSHIP) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, AND THE RELATED

COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES, PARTNERS CAPITAL (DEFICIT) AND CASH

FLOWS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, FOR EACH OF THE TWO YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP, MERCK &

CO., INC., AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. THE PARTNERSHIP IS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE, NOR WERE WE ENGAGED TO PERFORM, AN

AUDIT OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR AUDITS INCLUDED CONSIDERATION OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS A BASIS FOR DESIGNING AUDIT PROCEDURES THAT ARE

APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPRESSING AN OPINION ON THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PARTNERSHIPS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. ACCORDINGLY, WE

EXPRESS NO SUCH OPINION. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN RULES AND

REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, ARE NOT INTENDED
