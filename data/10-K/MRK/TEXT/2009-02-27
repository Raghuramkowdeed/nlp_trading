SEGMENT, SEE ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA BELOW.

OVERVIEW

 DURING 2008, THE COMPANY CONTINUED

TO ADDRESS BUSINESS CHALLENGES IN THE MIDST OF AN EVOLVING

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT. REVENUE DECLINED BY 1% IN

2008 DRIVEN LARGELY BY LOWER SALES OF

FOSAMAX

(ALENDRONATE SODIUM) FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF

OSTEOPOROSIS.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

(ALENDRONATE SODIUM/CHOLECALCIFEROL) LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FORMULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IN

FEBRUARY 2008 AND APRIL 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND AS A RESULT THE

COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES IN THE

UNITED STATES WITHIN THE

FOSAMAX

FRANCHISE. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE WERE LOWER SALES OF

ZOCOR

(SIMVASTATIN)

,

THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR

MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL WHICH LOST U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN

2006. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE DECLINES WERE HIGHER SALES OF

JANUVIA

(SITAGLIPTIN PHOSPHATE) AND

JANUMET

(SITAGLIPTIN PHOSPHATE AND METFORMIN HYDROCHLORIDE) FOR THE

TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND

ISENTRESS

(RALTEGRAVIR),

AN ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV INFECTION.

TO ADDRESS THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY CHALLENGES THAT MERCK

FACES, THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION AND CUSTOMER

VALUE IN ORDER TO DRIVE THE GROWTH OF ITS BUSINESS AND HELP

POSITION MERCK FOR FUTURE SUCCESS.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH RE-ENGINEERING

ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, THE

ROLL-OUT OF A NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL AND THE CONTINUATION OF

MERCKS SUPPLY STRATEGY. THESE ACTIVITIES SHOULD ENABLE THE

COMPANY TO OPTIMIZE ITS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND INVEST IN GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES, SUCH AS EMERGING MARKETS, MERCK BIOVENTURES AND

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.

MERCK CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE COMPANYS

SCIENTIFIC PORTFOLIO BOTH THROUGH INTERNAL PROGRAMS AND EXTERNAL

RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS. THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING

NOVEL,

BEST-IN-CLASS

OR FOLLOW-ON TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN PRIMARY CARE, SPECIALTY

CARE, AND HOSPITAL SETTINGS. ADDITIONALLY, MERCK RESEARCH

LABORATORIES IS PURSUING A PORTFOLIO OF TREATMENT MODALITIES

THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDES SMALL MOLECULES AND VACCINES, BUT ALSO

BIOLOGICS, PEPTIDES AND RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI).

FURTHER, MERCK IS MOVING TO DIVERSIFY ITS PORTFOLIO BY CREATING

A NEW DIVISION, MERCK BIOVENTURES, WHICH LEVERAGES A UNIQUE

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM FOR BOTH FOLLOW-ON AND NOVEL BIOLOGICS.

THE COMPANY HAS NUMEROUS ACTIVE CLINICAL PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

COMPANYS MAJOR RESEARCH FRANCHISES: BONE, RESPIRATORY,

IMMUNOLOGY AND ENDOCRINE; CARDIOVASCULAR; DIABETES AND OBESITY;

INFECTIOUS DISEASES; NEUROSCIENCE; ONCOLOGY AND VACCINES. THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NINE CANDIDATES IN PHASE III CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANTICIPATES SUBMITTING TWO NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS

(NDA) WITH THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG

ADMINISTRATION (FDA) WITH RESPECT TO TWO OF THE

CANDIDATES IN 2009: MK-0974, TELCAGEPANT, AN INVESTIGATIONAL

COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINES, AND MK-7418,

ROLOFYLLINE, AN INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF

ACUTE HEART FAILURE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES

SUBMITTING AN NDA IN 2009 FOR MK-0653C, EZETIMIBE COMBINED WITH

ATORVASTATIN, AN INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF

DYSLIPIDEMIA BEING DEVELOPED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINT

VENTURE. ALSO, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES REGULATORY ACTION IN 2009

ON TWO SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA.

ONE FOR

GARDASIL

, MERCKS HPV VACCINE, FOR USE IN

MALES; AND ONE FOR

ISENTRESS

, A

FIRST-IN-CLASS

INTEGRASE INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1 INFECTION, FOR AN

EXPANDED INDICATION FOR USE IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS.

ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE, THE COMPANY IS ROLLING OUT A MORE

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC SELLING MODEL THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, HELP BUILD TRUST WITH CUSTOMERS, AND

IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE STRATEGY EMPLOYS THE USE OF NEW

MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES TO COMPLEMENT A NEW, MORE

CUSTOMER-CENTERED APPROACH; AND MOVES AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL

FREQUENCY-BASED SALES AND MARKETING APPROACH; IT ALSO CREATES

EFFICIENCIES BY ELIMINATING REDUNDANCIES IN CORE FUNCTIONS AND

ACROSS THE SALES ORGANIZATION.

ON THE MANUFACTURING SIDE, MERCK HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE IT BEGAN RE-ENGINEERING TO CREATE A

LEAN, FLEXIBLE, COST-EFFECTIVE CAPABILITY. THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO ADDRESS ITS MANUFACTURING ISSUES AND IT IS WORKING TO BUILD

ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN VACCINES AND BIOLOGICS, AS WELL AS TO

SUPPORT MERCKS EXPANSION INTO EMERGING MARKETS. TO ASSIST

THIS GOAL, THE COMPANY IS SHIFTING INVESTMENTS FROM DEVELOPED

MARKETS INTO EMERGING MARKETS COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE AND

STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE OPPORTUNITY.

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM (THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM) TO REDUCE

ITS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MERCK IS ROLLING OUT A NEW,

MORE CUSTOMER-CENTRIC SELLING MODEL. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY

WILL MAKE GREATER USE OF OUTSIDE TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES,

CENTRALIZE COMMON SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AND

CONSOLIDATE AND STREAMLINE ITS OPERATIONS. MERCKS

MANUFACTURING DIVISION WILL FURTHER FOCUS ITS CAPABILITIES ON

CORE PRODUCTS AND OUTSOURCE NON-CORE MANUFACTURING. ALSO, MERCK

IS EXPANDING ITS ACCESS TO WORLDWIDE EXTERNAL SCIENCE THROUGH A

BASIC RESEARCH GLOBAL OPERATING STRATEGY, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE PIPELINE AND IS FOCUSED ON TRANSLATING

BASIC RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY INTO LATE-STAGE CLINICAL SUCCESS. TO

INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, BASIC RESEARCH OPERATIONS WILL

CONSOLIDATE WORK IN SUPPORT OF A GIVEN THERAPEUTIC AREA INTO ONE

OF FOUR LOCATIONS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF

RESEARCH FACILITIES AND RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF THREE BASIC

RESEARCH SITES LOCATED IN TSUKUBA, JAPAN; POMEZIA, ITALY; AND

SEATTLE BY THE END OF 2009. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,200

POSITIONS  6,800 ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND 400

VACANCIES  ACROSS ALL AREAS OF THE COMPANY WORLDWIDE

BY THE END OF 2011, APPROXIMATELY 1,750 OF WHICH THE COMPANY

ELIMINATED IN 2008. ABOUT 40% OF THE TOTAL REDUCTIONS WILL OCCUR

IN THE UNITED STATES. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM,

THE COMPANY IS STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT LAYERS BY REDUCING ITS

TOTAL NUMBER OF SENIOR AND MID-LEVEL EXECUTIVES GLOBALLY BY

APPROXIMATELY 25%. THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW

EMPLOYEES AS THE BUSINESS REQUIRES. THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2011 WITH THE

TOTAL PRETAX COSTS ESTIMATED TO BE $1.6 BILLION TO

$2.0 BILLION. IN 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED PRETAX

RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $921.3 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2008

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT TWO-THIRDS OF

THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS WILL RESULT IN FUTURE CASH OUTLAYS,

PRIMARILY FROM EMPLOYEE SEPARATION EXPENSE. APPROXIMATELY

ONE-THIRD OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH, RELATING

PRIMARILY TO THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF FACILITIES TO BE

CLOSED OR DIVESTED. MERCK EXPECTS THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

TO YIELD CUMULATIVE PRETAX SAVINGS OF $3.8 BILLION TO

$4.2 BILLION FROM 2008 TO 2013.

DURING 2008, IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH

ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP), THE COMPANY RECORDED AN

AGGREGATE PRETAX GAIN OF $2.2 BILLION WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET AND RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM AZLP

OF $2.6 BILLION. SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS) ASSUMING DILUTION

FOR 2008 WERE $3.64, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE GAIN ON

DISTRIBUTION FROM AZLP OF $0.66 PER SHARE AND RESTRUCTURING

COSTS OF $(0.44) PER SHARE. IN ADDITION, EPS IN 2008 REFLECTS

THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CERTAIN TAX ITEMS. ALL OF THESE ITEMS

ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT)

WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE

PLAINTIFFS STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA

STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC STROKE

(IS) CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED

STATES. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED

CLAIMS, WAS SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH

THREE OF THE FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE

THAN 95% OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY TO U.S. LEGAL

RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI OR IS OCCURRED IN

THE UNITED STATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2008, THE DEADLINE FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM (AS DEFINED BELOW), MORE THAN 48,100 OF THE

APPROXIMATELY 48,325 INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND WHOSE CLAIMS WERE NOT 1) DISMISSED,

2) EXPECTED TO BE DISMISSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, OR

3) TOLLED CLAIMS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED HAD

SUBMITTED SOME OR ALL OF THE MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR ENROLLMENT

IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THIS REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 99.8%

OF THE ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED WITH THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT,

MERCK COULD EXERCISE A RIGHT TO WALK AWAY FROM THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT IF THE THRESHOLDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT MET.

THE COMPANY WAIVED THAT RIGHT AS OF AUGUST 4, 2008. THE

WAIVER OF THAT RIGHT TRIGGERED MERCKS OBLIGATION TO PAY A

FIXED TOTAL OF $4.85 BILLION. PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE IN

INSTALLMENTS INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS. THE FIRST PAYMENT OF

$500 MILLION WAS MADE IN AUGUST 2008 AND AN ADDITIONAL

PAYMENT OF $250 MILLION WAS MADE IN OCTOBER 2008.

ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE ON A PERIODIC BASIS GOING

FORWARD, WHEN AND AS NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS OF CLAIMS AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

JOINT VENTURES

 THE COMPANY HAS A NUMBER OF

JOINT VENTURES RELATING TO ITS PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINES AND

INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENTS.

PHARMACEUTICAL

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE

SEPARATE EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE

UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. IN

DECEMBER 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD,

EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN OCTOBER 2002,

ZETIA (

EZETIMIBE)

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), THE

FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS

LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JULY 2004,

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), A

COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR,

WAS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

THE RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE

SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS

IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA

(ENHANCE) CLINICAL TRIAL, AN IMAGING TRIAL IN

720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES VERY

HIGH LEVELS OF LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL AND GREATLY

INCREASES THE RISK FOR PREMATURE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN

10/80 MG (

VYTORIN

) SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL

BAD CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN SIMVASTATIN 80 MG

ALONE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT

WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE

PRE-SPECIFIED PRIMARY ENDPOINT, A CHANGE IN THE THICKNESS OF

CAROTID ARTERY WALLS OVER TWO YEARS AS MEASURED BY ULTRASOUND.

THERE ALSO WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT

WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ON THE FOUR

PRE-SPECIFIED KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: PERCENT OF PATIENTS

MANIFESTING REGRESSION IN THE AVERAGE CAROTID ARTERY

INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS (CA IMT); PROPORTION OF

PATIENTS DEVELOPING NEW CAROTID ARTERY PLAQUES >1.3 MM;

CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM CA IMT; AND CHANGES IN THE

AVERAGE CA IMT PLUS IN THE AVERAGE COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY IMT. IN

ENHANCE, WHEN COMPARED TO SIMVASTATIN ALONE,

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL BAD

CHOLESTEROL, AS WELL AS TRIGLYCERIDES AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN

(CRP). EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR

THE REDUCTION OF CRP. IN THE ENHANCE STUDY, THE OVERALL SAFETY

PROFILE OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN WAS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH

THE PRODUCT LABEL. THE ENHANCE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED NOR

POWERED TO EVALUATE CARDIOVASCULAR CLINICAL EVENTS. THE IMPROVED

REDUCTION IN HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS PRESENTING WITH ACUTE CORONARY

SYNDROME (IMPROVE-IT) TRIAL IS UNDERWAY AND IS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES DATA FOR

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME.

NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN ON

CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT

DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN MARCH

2008, THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE WERE REPORTED AT THE ANNUAL

SCIENTIFIC SESSION OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY.

ON JULY 21, 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE

SIMVASTATIN AND EZETIMIBE IN AORTIC STENOSIS (SEAS)

STUDY WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER

INTENSIVE LIPID LOWERING WITH

VYTORIN

10/40 MG

WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK

OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO IN

PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO

HAD NO INDICATION FOR STATIN THERAPY.

VYTORIN

FAILED TO

MEET ITS PRIMARY END POINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. THERE ALSO WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF AORTIC VALVE EVENTS; HOWEVER,

THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS TAKING

VYTORIN

COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF

ISCHEMIC CARDIOVASCULAR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EVENTS.

VYTORIN

IS NOT INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF

AORTIC STENOSIS. NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF

VYTORIN

ON

CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT

DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN THE STUDY,

PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

10/40 MG HAD

A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF CANCER THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO.

THERE WAS ALSO A NONSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM CANCER

IN PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

VERSUS THOSE

WHO TOOK PLACEBO. CANCER AND CANCER DEATHS WERE DISTRIBUTED

ACROSS ALL MAJOR ORGAN SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE CANCER

FINDING IN SEAS IS LIKELY TO BE AN ANOMALY THAT, TAKEN IN LIGHT

OF ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION WITH

VYTORIN

. IN AUGUST 2008, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS

INVESTIGATING THE RESULTS FROM THE SEAS TRIAL. IN THIS

ANNOUNCEMENT, THE FDA ALSO CITED INTERIM DATA FROM TWO LARGE

ONGOING CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS OF

VYTORIN

 THE

STUDY OF HEART AND RENAL PROTECTION (SHARP) AND THE

IMPROVE-IT CLINICAL TRIALS  IN WHICH THERE WAS NO

INCREASED RISK OF CANCER WITH THE COMBINATION OF SIMVASTATIN

PLUS EZETIMIBE. THE SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN

2010. THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION AROUND

2012. THE FDA DETERMINED THAT, AS OF THAT TIME, THESE FINDINGS

IN THE SEAS TRIAL PLUS THE INTERIM DATA FROM ONGOING TRIALS

SHOULD NOT PROMPT PATIENTS TO STOP TAKING

VYTORIN

OR ANY

OTHER CHOLESTEROL LOWERING DRUG.

THE COMPANY, THROUGH MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PHARMACEUTICALS (THE

MSP PARTNERSHIP), IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

REGULATORY AGENCIES TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE AVAILABLE DATA AND

INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE DATA; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

BELIEVE THAT CHANGES IN THE CLINICAL USE OF

VYTORIN

ARE

WARRANTED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY AND ITS JOINT VENTURE

PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

ADDRESSED TO BOTH COMPANIES FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY

AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS

(O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE

SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF

WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF

ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND

PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY

CORPORATE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE AUGUST 2008, THE

COMPANIES HAVE RECEIVED THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM O&I,

INCLUDING ONE DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING CERTAIN

INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL. AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANIES HAVE EACH RECEIVED SUBPOENAS

FROM THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OFFICES

AND A LETTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING

SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED FIVE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CIDS)

FROM A MULTISTATE GROUP OF 35 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO ARE

JOINTLY INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANIES VIOLATED STATE

CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VYTORIN

. FINALLY,

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CIVIL

DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ )

INFORMING IT THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE

COMPANIES CONDUCT RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS

AND WORKING WITH SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED WITH

APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON

LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MSP

PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. CERTAIN OF THOSE LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURIES

AND/OR

SEEK

MEDICAL MONITORING. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED IN OR

TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT, ARE COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT

COURT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE DENNIS M. CAVANAUGH.

THE PARTIES ARE PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN MOTIONS PRACTICE AND

BRIEFING. ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 3, 2008,

A MERCK SHAREHOLDER FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN

FEDERAL COURT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING

THAT MERCK AND ITS CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, RICHARD T. CLARK, VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.

ON APRIL 22, 2008, A MEMBER OF A COMPANY EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT ( ERISA) PLAN FILED A

PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF

ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ALLEGING THEY BREACHED THEIR

FIDUCIARY DUTIES UNDER ERISA.

IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN EQUALLY

OWNED JOINT VENTURE THAT DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF

ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC (

OMEPRAZOLE), THE FIRST IN A CLASS OF

MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE

PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA RESTRUCTURED THE JOINT VENTURE

WHEREBY THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN THE JOINT

VENTURE, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED

KBIS OPERATING ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE

PARTNERSHIP), IN EXCHANGE FOR A 1% LIMITED PARTNER

INTEREST. ASTRA CONTRIBUTED THE NET ASSETS OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED

SUBSIDIARY, ASTRA USA, INC., TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR

A

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

99% GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED

ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP) UPON ASTRAS 1999 MERGER

WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC (THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER),

BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH KBI

RETAINED RIGHTS.

THE COMPANY EARNS CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP RETURNS AS WELL AS ONGOING

REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS. THE

PARTNERSHIP RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN

THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON

SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND A

PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

UNDISTRIBUTED PARTNERSHIP GAAP EARNINGS. THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER

TRIGGERED A PARTIAL REDEMPTION IN MARCH 2008 OF MERCKS

INTEREST IN CERTAIN AZLP PRODUCT RIGHTS. UPON THIS REDEMPTION,

MERCK RECEIVED $4.3 BILLION FROM AZLP. THIS AMOUNT WAS

BASED PRIMARILY ON A MULTIPLE OF MERCKS AVERAGE ANNUAL

VARIABLE RETURNS DERIVED FROM SALES OF THE FORMER ASTRA USA,

INC. PRODUCTS FOR THE THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THE REDEMPTION (THE

LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE). MERCK

RECORDED A $1.5 BILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE PARTIAL

REDEMPTION IN 2008. THE PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF MERCKS

INTEREST IN THE PRODUCT RIGHTS DID NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN

MERCKS 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. AS DESCRIBED IN

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS BELOW, AFTER CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS, THE COMPANY

RECORDED AN AGGREGATE PRETAX GAIN OF $2.2 BILLION.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, ASTRA PURCHASED AN

OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS DEFERRED INCOME, TO

BUY MERCKS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE

GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

(ESOMEPRAZOLE) AND

PRILOSEC

(THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS). THE ASSET

OPTION IS EXERCISABLE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010 AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE EQUAL TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008

OF PROJECTED FUTURE PRETAX REVENUE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY

FROM THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS (THE APPRAISED VALUE).

MERCK ALSO HAD THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRA TO PURCHASE SUCH

INTEREST IN 2008 AT THE APPRAISED VALUE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE

COMPANY ADVISED AZLP THAT IT WOULD NOT EXERCISE THE ASSET

OPTION, THUS THE $443.0 MILLION REMAINS DEFERRED. IN

ADDITION, IN 1998, THE COMPANY GRANTED ASTRA AN OPTION (THE

SHARES OPTION) TO BUY MERCKS COMMON STOCK

INTEREST IN KBI AND, THEREFORE, MERCKS INTEREST IN

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

, EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER

ASTRAS EXERCISE OF THE ASSET OPTION. ASTRA CAN ALSO

EXERCISE THE SHARES OPTION IN 2017 OR IF COMBINED ANNUAL SALES

OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN

EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG AS ASTRAZENECAS ASSET OPTION HAS

BEEN EXERCISED IN 2010. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR THE SHARES OPTION

IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES

OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME

OF EXERCISE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

TRUE-UP

MECHANISMS.

IN 1989, THE COMPANY FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH

JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO DEVELOP AND MARKET A BROAD RANGE

OF NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS 50%

OWNED JOINT VENTURE ALSO INCLUDES CANADA. SIGNIFICANT JOINT

VENTURE PRODUCTS ARE

PEPCID AC

(FAMOTIDINE), AN

OVER-THE-COUNTER FORM OF THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION

PEPCID

(FAMOTIDINE), AS WELL AS

PEPCID COMPLETE,

AN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT WHICH COMBINES THE COMPANYS

ULCER MEDICATION WITH ANTACIDS (CALCIUM CARBONATE AND MAGNESIUM

HYDROXIDE).

VACCINES

IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW

SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.) FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET HUMAN

VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE THEN EXISTING EU

AND THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY AND SANOFI

PASTEUR CONTRIBUTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEIR EUROPEAN VACCINE

BUSINESSES FOR EQUAL SHARES IN THE JOINT VENTURE, KNOWN AS

PASTEUR MÉRIEUX MSD, S.N.C. (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR MSD,

S.N.C.). THE JOINT VENTURE MAINTAINS A PRESENCE, DIRECTLY OR

THROUGH AFFILIATES OR BRANCHES IN BELGIUM, ITALY, GERMANY,

SPAIN, FRANCE, AUSTRIA, IRELAND, SWEDEN, PORTUGAL, THE

NETHERLANDS, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THROUGH

DISTRIBUTORS IN THE REST OF ITS TERRITORY.

OTHER

IN 1997, THE COMPANY AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW

SANOFI-AVENTIS S.A.) COMBINED THEIR RESPECTIVE ANIMAL HEALTH

BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A

FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE

JOINT VENTURE, 50% OWNED BY EACH PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A

COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE

THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL

SPECIES.

COMPETITION

 THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY

REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT

CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUCH COMPETITION INVOLVES AN INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO MARKET THESE INNOVATIONS

EFFECTIVELY. WITH ITS LONG-STANDING EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANY IS WELL PREPARED TO COMPETE IN THE

SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MEET COMPETITION INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL, FLEXIBILITY TO MEET

CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS, AN EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND A

STRONG TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVE IN

ACQUIRING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND

LICENSES AND HAS BEEN REFINING ITS SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS

TO FURTHER ADDRESS CHANGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS. TO ENHANCE ITS

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO PURSUE EXTERNAL

ALLIANCES. HOWEVER, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES BY COMPETITORS MAY RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS AND

PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS, EVEN FOR PRODUCTS PROTECTED BY PATENTS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS AVAILABLE TO TREAT DISEASES

TYPICALLY INCREASES OVER TIME AND HAS RESULTED IN SLOWING THE

GROWTH IN SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS,

ALLOWS, ENCOURAGES OR, IN A FEW INSTANCES, IN THE ABSENCE OF

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN, MANDATES

THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS (THOSE CONTAINING THE

SAME ACTIVE CHEMICAL AS AN INNOVATORS PRODUCT) RATHER THAN

BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS. GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER

PRESSURES TOWARD THE DISPENSING OF GENERIC PRODUCTS HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY PATENTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR,

WHICH LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE U.S. IN 2006 AND

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES THEREAFTER.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

LOST MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2008. AS

A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS, THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

U.S. SALES. ALSO,

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

LOST

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN OCTOBER 2008 AND AS A

RESULT THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS.

DISTRIBUTION

 THE COMPANY SELLS ITS HUMAN

HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND

RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS,

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. HUMAN HEALTH

VACCINES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO PHYSICIANS, WHOLESALERS,

PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THE

COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE

EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS

IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE

ORGANIZATIONS.

RAW MATERIALS

 RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE

PURCHASED WORLDWIDE AND ARE NORMALLY AVAILABLE IN QUANTITIES

ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL

AND VACCINES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND INVESTIGATION

 THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL REGULATION BY

REGIONAL, COUNTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. OF PARTICULAR

IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ADMINISTERS

REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY,

EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. IN 1997, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

MODERNIZATION ACT (THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT) WAS

PASSED AND WAS THE CULMINATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE

REFORM EFFORT DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE REGULATORY PROCEDURES

WITHIN THE FDA AND TO IMPROVE THE REGULATION OF DRUGS, MEDICAL

DEVICES AND FOOD. THE LEGISLATION WAS PRINCIPALLY DESIGNED TO

ENSURE THE TIMELY AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS AND

BIOLOGICS BY EXPEDITING THE PREMARKET REVIEW PROCESS FOR NEW

PRODUCTS. A KEY PROVISION OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE

RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT OF 1992,

WHICH PERMITS THE CONTINUED COLLECTION OF USER FEES FROM

PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO AUGMENT FDA RESOURCES

EARMARKED FOR THE REVIEW OF HUMAN DRUG APPLICATIONS. THIS HELPS

PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PROMPT APPROVAL OF

SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NEW DRUGS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS

BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER

2003. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING

ACCESS TO MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE

PRESERVING MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

INNOVATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES AND BY ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES.

THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED, AND MAY CONSIDER AGAIN,

PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENTS ROLE IN

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE PROPOSALS MAY INCLUDE REMOVING THE CURRENT LEGAL

PROHIBITION AGAINST THE SECRETARY OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES INTERVENING IN PRICE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN MEDICARE DRUG

BENEFIT PROGRAM PLANS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THEY MAY

ALSO INCLUDE MANDATING THE PAYMENT OF REBATES FOR SOME OR ALL OF

THE PHARMACEUTICAL UTILIZATION IN MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT PLANS.

IN ADDITION, CONGRESS MAY AGAIN CONSIDER PROPOSALS TO ALLOW,

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES FROM

OTHER COUNTRIES.

FOR MANY YEARS, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER

FEDERAL AND STATE OVERSIGHT WITH THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR NEW

DRUGS, DRUG SAFETY, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, DRUG PURCHASING

AND REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND FORMULARIES VARIOUSLY UNDER

REVIEW. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW DRUGS

TO THE MARKET, IN THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. ONE TYPE OF

FEDERAL INITIATIVE TO CONTAIN FEDERAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING IS

THE PROSPECTIVE OR CAPITATED PAYMENT SYSTEM, FIRST

IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE

REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS. SUCH A SYSTEM ESTABLISHES IN ADVANCE

A FLAT RATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE PATIENTS

FOR WHOM THE PAYOR IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. THIS TYPE OF PAYMENT

SYSTEM AND OTHER COST CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS ARE NOW WIDELY USED BY

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYORS AND HAVE CAUSED HOSPITALS, HEALTH

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY TO

BE MORE COST-CONSCIOUS IN THEIR TREATMENT DECISIONS, INCLUDING

DECISIONS REGARDING THE MEDICINES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR

PATIENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO WORK WITH PRIVATE AND FEDERAL

EMPLOYERS TO SLOW INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. FURTHER, THE

COMPANYS EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN

HELP SAVE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF THE

COMPANYS MEDICINES AND HAVE HELPED OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF

INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

ALSO, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED METHODS TO

DIRECTLY REDUCE THE COST OF DRUGS AND VACCINES FOR WHICH THEY

PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PAY

SPECIFIED REBATES FOR MEDICINES REIMBURSED BY MEDICAID, TO

PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR OUTPATIENT MEDICINES PURCHASED BY CERTAIN

PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ENTITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATE

SHARE HOSPITALS (HOSPITALS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA), AND

TO PROVIDE MINIMUM DISCOUNTS OF 24% OFF OF A DEFINED

NON-FEDERAL AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR PURCHASES

BY CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

INITIATIVES IN SOME STATES SEEK REBATES BEYOND THE MINIMUM

REQUIRED BY MEDICAID LEGISLATION, IN SOME CASES FOR PATIENTS

BEYOND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. UNDER THE FEDERAL

VACCINES FOR CHILDREN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM, THE U.S. CENTERS

FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) FUNDS AND

PURCHASES RECOMMENDED PEDIATRIC VACCINES AT A PUBLIC SECTOR

PRICE FOR THE IMMUNIZATION OF MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE, UNINSURED,

NATIVE AMERICAN AND CERTAIN UNDERINSURED CHILDREN. THE COMPANY

WAS AWARDED A CDC CONTRACT IN 2008 FOR THE SUPPLY OF PEDIATRIC

VACCINES FOR THE VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2006, PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID

WHO ARE ALSO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES (65 YEARS AND OLDER OR

DISABLED) LEFT THE STATE-ADMINISTERED MEDICAID SYSTEM TO BE

COVERED BY THE NEW MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ENCOUNTERS SIMILAR

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE

IT DOES BUSINESS. THERE, TOO, THE PRIMARY THRUST OF GOVERNMENTAL

INQUIRY AND ACTION IS TOWARD DETERMINING DRUG SAFETY AND

EFFECTIVENESS, OFTEN WITH MECHANISMS FOR CONTROLLING THE PRICES

OF OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE PROFITS OF

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES. THE EU HAS ADOPTED DIRECTIVES

CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION, LABELING, ADVERTISING, WHOLESALE

DISTRIBUTION AND APPROVAL FOR MARKETING OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

FOR HUMAN USE. THE COMPANYS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE

ALREADY CONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE DIRECTIVES;

CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, RECOGNIZING THE

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY, ARE

WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE

CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING MARKET DEREGULATION.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC)

LAUNCHED A SECTOR INQUIRY IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETS UNDER

THE RULES OF EU COMPETITION LAW. AS PART OF ITS INQUIRY, THE

COMPANYS OFFICES IN GERMANY WERE INSPECTED BY THE

AUTHORITIES IN JANUARY 2008. THE PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE EC

WAS ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2008, IN WHICH THE EC STATED

THAT IT HAD CONFIRMED ITS ORIGINAL HYPOTHESIS THAT COMPETITION

IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR MAY BE RESTRICTED OR DISTORTED, AS

INDICATED BY A DECLINE IN INNOVATION MEASURED BY THE NUMBER OF

NOVEL MEDICINES REACHING THE MARKET, AND BY ALLEGED INSTANCES OF

DELAYED MARKET ENTRY OF GENERIC MEDICINES. THE PUBLIC

CONSULTATION PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO THE PRELIMINARY REPORT

EXPIRED ON JANUARY 31, 2009, AND THE EC HAS ISSUED FURTHER

INQUIRIES IN RESPECT OF THE SUBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION. THE EC

HAS NOT ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL PRACTICES. THE FINAL REPORT IS PLANNED

FOR LATER IN 2009. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE EC IN

THIS SECTOR INQUIRY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND IS, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE

ACTIONS. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

COMPANY ON ITS OWN MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT

RECALLS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS GLOBALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RECENTLY ENACTED

LAWS IN A MAJORITY OF U.S. STATES REQUIRING SECURITY BREACH

NOTIFICATION.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

 PATENT

PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH

PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS.

PATENTS MAY COVER PRODUCTS

PER SE

, PHARMACEUTICAL

FORMULATIONS, PROCESSES FOR OR INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE USES OF PRODUCTS. PROTECTION FOR

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTENDS FOR VARYING PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE LEGAL LIFE OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE

PROTECTION AFFORDED, WHICH MAY ALSO VARY FROM COUNTRY TO

COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT AND ITS SCOPE OF

COVERAGE.

THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT INCLUDES A PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY

PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INDICATIONS OF NEW OR

CURRENTLY MARKETED DRUGS IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON PEDIATRIC

STUDIES ARE COMPLETED BY THE APPLICANT. THESE EXCLUSIVITY

PROVISIONS WERE RE-AUTHORIZED BY THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE

ACT PASSED IN SEPTEMBER 2007. CURRENT U.S. PATENT LAW

PROVIDES ADDITIONAL PATENT TERM UNDER PATENT TERM RESTORATION

FOR PERIODS WHEN THE PATENTED PRODUCT WAS UNDER REGULATORY

REVIEW BEFORE THE FDA.

PATENT PORTFOLIOS DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE

COMPANY NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. THE COMPANY HAS THE

FOLLOWING KEY U.S. PATENT PROTECTION (INCLUDING PATENT TERM

RESTORATION AND PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY) FOR MAJOR MARKETED

PRODUCTS.

A BASIC PATENT IS ALSO IN EFFECT FOR SUSTIVA

/STOCRIN.

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE

FROM THE COMPANY, SELLS SUSTIVA IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND

CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY MARKETS

STOCRIN

IN OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

WHILE THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT NORMALLY RESULTS IN A

LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR THE COVERED PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCT, COMMERCIAL BENEFITS MAY CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED FROM.

(I) LATER-GRANTED PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES

RELATED TO THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF SUCH PRODUCT; (II) PATENTS RELATING TO

THE USE OF SUCH PRODUCT; (III) PATENTS RELATING TO NOVEL

COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS; AND (IV) IN THE UNITED

STATES AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES, MARKET EXCLUSIVITY THAT MAY

BE AVAILABLE UNDER RELEVANT LAW. THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT

EXPIRATION ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON MANY

OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE MARKET AND THE POSITION

OF THE PRODUCT IN IT, THE GROWTH OF THE MARKET, THE COMPLEXITIES

AND ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENT OF THE PRODUCT AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF NEW DRUG

PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT OR SIMILAR

LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

ADDITIONS TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES

AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH ALL RELEVANT LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS

INCREASING PATENT LIFE. SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INCREASES IN

PATENT LIFE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GENERAL INCREASE IN

THE NUMBER OF INCENTIVES FOR AND USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS ARE

SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH REFORM

OF PATENT AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF

INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS

PATENTS, SEE PATENT LITIGATION AND RISK

FACTORS BELOW.

WORLDWIDE, ALL OF THE COMPANYS IMPORTANT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD

UNDER TRADEMARKS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME

COUNTRIES AS LONG AS USED; IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS LONG AS

REGISTERED. REGISTRATION IS FOR FIXED TERMS AND CAN BE RENEWED

INDEFINITELY.

ROYALTIES RECEIVED DURING 2008 ON PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES

AND OTHER RIGHTS AMOUNTED TO $209.3 MILLION. THE COMPANY

ALSO PAID ROYALTIES AMOUNTING TO $1.318 BILLION IN 2008

UNDER PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES IT HOLDS.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE INTRODUCTION

OF NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH A

STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY

11,000 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THE COMPANYS RESEARCH

ACTIVITIES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE

$4.8 BILLION IN 2008, $4.9 BILLION IN 2007 AND

$4.8 BILLION IN 2006. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ONGOING

COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH OVER A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS

AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL

AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MERCKS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS DESIGNED TO

INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS BY

PRIORITIZING THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESOURCES ON DISEASE AREAS OF UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, SCIENTIFIC

OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. MERCK IS MANAGING ITS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO ACROSS DIVERSE APPROACHES TO

DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT BY BALANCING INVESTMENTS APPROPRIATELY

ON NOVEL, INNOVATIVE TARGETS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A MAJOR

IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH, ON DEVELOPING

BEST-IN-CLASS

APPROACHES, AND ON DELIVERING MAXIMUM VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS NEW MEDICINES AND VACCINES THROUGH NEW

INDICATIONS AND NEW FORMULATIONS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

MERCKS SCIENCE-BASED DIVERSIFICATION IS BASED ON EXPANDING

THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF MODALITIES TO INCLUDE NOT ONLY

SMALL MOLECULES AND VACCINES, BUT ALSO BIOLOGICS, PEPTIDES AND

RNAI. FURTHER, MERCK IS MOVING TO DIVERSIFY ITS PORTFOLIO BY

CREATING A NEW DIVISION, MERCK BIOVENTURES, WHICH LEVERAGES A

UNIQUE PLATFORM FOR BOTH FOLLOW-ON AND NOVEL BIOLOGICS. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL LICENSING

OPPORTUNITIES.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A NEW MODEL FOR ITS

BASIC RESEARCH GLOBAL OPERATING STRATEGY. THE NEW MODEL WILL

ALIGN FRANCHISE AND FUNCTION THROUGH CLEAR ROLES AND

RESPONSIBILITIES, ALIGN RESOURCES

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH DISEASE AREA PRIORITIES AND BALANCE CAPACITY ACROSS

DISCOVERY PHASES AND ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACT UPON THOSE

PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS. ADDITIONALLY,

THE STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO

WORLDWIDE EXTERNAL SCIENCE AND INCORPORATE EXTERNAL RESEARCH AS

A KEY COMPONENT OF THE COMPANYS EARLY DISCOVERY PIPELINE

IN ORDER TO TRANSLATE BASIC RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY INTO

LATE-STAGE CLINICAL SUCCESS.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS, INDUSTRY PRACTICE

AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST

FOREIGN COUNTRIES PROVIDE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVENESS

AND SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THROUGH PRECLINICAL TESTS

AND CONTROLLED CLINICAL EVALUATION. BEFORE A NEW DRUG OR VACCINE

MAY BE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES, RECORDED DATA ON

PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ARE INCLUDED IN THE NDA FOR

A DRUG OR THE BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION (BLA)

FOR A VACCINE SUBMITTED TO THE FDA FOR THE REQUIRED APPROVAL.

ONCE THE COMPANYS SCIENTISTS DISCOVER A NEW SMALL MOLECULE

COMPOUND THAT THEY BELIEVE HAS PROMISE TO TREAT A MEDICAL

CONDITION, THE COMPANY COMMENCES PRECLINICAL TESTING WITH THAT

COMPOUND. PRECLINICAL TESTING INCLUDES LABORATORY TESTING AND

ANIMAL SAFETY STUDIES TO GATHER DATA ON CHEMISTRY, PHARMACOLOGY

AND TOXICOLOGY. PENDING ACCEPTABLE PRECLINICAL DATA, THE COMPANY

WILL INITIATE CLINICAL TESTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ESTABLISHED

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE CLINICAL TESTING BEGINS WITH PHASE

I STUDIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ASSESS SAFETY, TOLERABILITY,

PHARMACOKINETICS, AND PRELIMINARY PHARMACODYNAMIC ACTIVITY OF

THE COMPOUND IN HUMANS. IF FAVORABLE, ADDITIONAL, LARGER

PHASE II STUDIES ARE INITIATED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF

THE COMPOUND IN THE AFFECTED POPULATION, DEFINE APPROPRIATE

DOSING FOR THE COMPOUND, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS

THAT COULD LIMIT THE COMPOUNDS USEFULNESS. IF DATA FROM

THE PHASE II TRIALS ARE SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY COMMENCES

LARGE-SCALE PHASE III TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE COMPOUNDS

EFFICACY AND SAFETY. UPON COMPLETION OF THOSE TRIALS, IF

SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY SUBMITS REGULATORY FILINGS WITH THE

APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD TO HAVE THE

PRODUCT CANDIDATE APPROVED FOR MARKETING. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT A COMPOUND THAT IS THE RESULT OF ANY PARTICULAR

PROGRAM WILL OBTAIN THE REGULATORY APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR IT TO

BE MARKETED.

VACCINE DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWS THE SAME GENERAL PATHWAY AS FOR

DRUGS. PRECLINICAL TESTING FOCUSES ON THE VACCINES SAFETY

AND ABILITY TO ELICIT A PROTECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE

(IMMUNOGENICITY). PRE-MARKETING VACCINE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE

TYPICALLY DONE IN THREE PHASES. INITIAL PHASE I CLINICAL STUDIES

ARE CONDUCTED IN NORMAL SUBJECTS TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY,

TOLERABILITY AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF THE VACCINE CANDIDATE.

PHASE II STUDIES ARE DOSE-RANGING STUDIES AND MAY ENROLL

HUNDREDS OF SUBJECTS. FINALLY, PHASE III TRIALS TYPICALLY

ENROLL THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DATA

ON EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANY SUBMITS

REGULATORY FILINGS WITH THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCIES.

ALSO DURING THIS STAGE, THE PROPOSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY

UNDERGOES A PRE-APPROVAL INSPECTION DURING WHICH PRODUCTION OF

THE VACCINE AS IT IS IN PROGRESS IS EXAMINED IN DETAIL.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA REVIEW PROCESS BEGINS ONCE A

COMPLETE NDA IS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED BY THE FDA. PURSUANT TO

THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT, THE FDA REVIEW PERIOD

TARGETS FOR NDAS OR SUPPLEMENTAL NDAS IS EITHER SIX MONTHS, FOR

PRIORITY REVIEW, OR TEN MONTHS, FOR A STANDARD REVIEW. WITHIN

60 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF AN NDA, THE FDA DETERMINES IF THE

APPLICATION IS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE TO PERMIT A SUBSTANTIVE

REVIEW. THE FDA ALSO ASSESSES, AT THAT TIME, WHETHER THE

APPLICATION WILL BE GRANTED A PRIORITY REVIEW OR STANDARD

REVIEW. ONCE THE REVIEW TIMELINES ARE DEFINED, THE FDA WILL

GENERALLY ACT UPON THE APPLICATION WITHIN THOSE TIMELINES,

UNLESS A MAJOR AMENDMENT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED (EITHER AT THE

COMPANYS OWN INITIATIVE OR THE FDAS REQUEST) TO THE

PENDING APPLICATION. IF THIS OCCURS, THE FDA MAY EXTEND THE

REVIEW PERIOD TO ALLOW FOR REVIEW OF THE NEW INFORMATION, BUT BY

NO MORE THAN 180 DAYS. EXTENSIONS TO THE REVIEW PERIOD ARE

COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY. THE FDA CAN ACT ON AN APPLICATION

BY ISSUING AN APPROVAL LETTER OR A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN 2009 FOR

MK-0974, TELCAGEPANT, AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL CALCITONIN

GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, WHICH REPRESENTS A NEW

MECHANISM FOR THE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE AND HAS DEMONSTRATED

EFFICACY COMPARABLE TO ZOLMITRIPTAN, AN EFFECTIVE TRIPTAN, IN

THE PHASE III CLINICAL PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY ALSO ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN 2009

FOR MK-7418, ROLOFYLLINE, A POTENTIAL

FIRST-IN-CLASS

SELECTIVE ADENOSINE A1 ANTAGONIST, WHICH IS A PHASE III

INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE

HEART FAILURE.

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA

IN 2009 FOR MK-0653C, EZETIMIBE COMBINED WITH ATORVASTATIN, AN

INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA

BEING DEVELOPED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINT VENTURE.

THE COMPANY ALSO ANTICIPATES REGULATORY ACTION IN 2009 ON TWO

SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA: ONE

FOR

GARDASIL

, MERCKS HPV VACCINE, FOR USE IN MALES;

AND ONE FOR

ISENTRESS

, A

FIRST-IN-CLASS

INTEGRASE INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1 INFECTION, FOR AN

EXPANDED INDICATION FOR USE IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS.

IN JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SECOND COMPLETE RESPONSE

LETTER FROM FDA REGARDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL BLA

(SBLA) FOR THE USE OF

GARDASIL

IN WOMEN

AGES 27 THOUGH 45. THE AGENCY HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF

THE RESPONSE THAT MERCK PROVIDED IN JULY 2008 AND HAS

RECOMMENDED THAT MERCK SUBMIT ADDITIONAL DATA WHEN THE

48 MONTH STUDY HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE INITIAL SBLA

INCLUDED DATA COLLECTED THROUGH AN AVERAGE OF 24 MONTHS

FROM ENROLLMENT INTO THE STUDY, WHICH IS WHEN THE NUMBER OF

PRE-SPECIFIED ENDPOINTS HAD BEEN MET. FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE

FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY, MERCK ANTICIPATES PROVIDING A

RESPONSE TO THE AGENCY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009. THE LETTER

DOES NOT AFFECT CURRENT INDICATIONS FOR

GARDASIL

IN

FEMALES AGES 9 THROUGH 26 NOR DOES THE LETTER RELATE TO THE

SBLA THAT WAS SUBMITTED IN DECEMBER 2008 FOR THE USE OF

GARDASIL

IN MALES.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, DATA ON SEVERAL PHASE III

ISENTRESS

STUDIES WERE PRESENTED AT THE

16

TH

CONFERENCE

ON RETROVIRUSES AND OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN MONTREAL,

CANADA. IN NEW SUBGROUP ANALYSES OF A PHASE III STUDY

(STARTMRK) THAT COMPARED

ISENTRESS

TO EFAVIRENZ (ONE OF

THE LEADING ANTIRETROVIRALS PRESCRIBED FOR PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED

(TREATMENT-NAÏVE) HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS),

ISENTRESS

WAS FOUND TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS EFAVIRENZ AT SUPPRESSING

VIRAL LOAD AND PROVIDED IMPROVEMENTS IN IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION

ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PATIENT SUBPOPULATIONS THROUGH

48 WEEKS. THE USE OF

ISENTRESS

IN PREVIOUSLY

UNTREATED HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL USE OF THE

DRUG. BOTH MEDICINES WERE TAKEN IN COMBINATION WITH

TENOFOVIR/EMTRICITABINE. IN ADDITION, RESULTS FROM TWO

PHASE III STUDIES (SWITCHMRK-1 AND -2) EVALUATING THE

EFFECT OF SWITCHING PATIENTS WHOSE HIV IS CONTROLLED ON A

LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR-BASED REGIMEN TO A REGIMEN CONTAINING

ISENTRESS

TABLETS SHOWED THAT

ISENTRESS

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES AND

NON-HDL-CHOLESTEROL. THE STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT

ISENTRESS

DID NOT DEMONSTRATE NON-INFERIOR VIROLOGIC EFFICACY AT

MAINTAINING VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION. AS A RESULT OF THE VIRAL

LOAD FINDINGS IN THESE TRIALS, MERCK DISCONTINUED THESE TWO

STUDIES.

MERCK CURRENTLY HAS NINE PRODUCTS IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT

(INCLUDING MK-0974 AND MK-7418 DISCUSSED ABOVE).

MK-8669, DEFOROLIMUS, IS A NOVEL MTOR (MAMMALIAN TARGET OF

RAPAMYCIN) INHIBITOR BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF

CANCER. THE DRUG CANDIDATE IS BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED AND

COMMERCIALIZED WITH ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., UNDER AN

AGREEMENT REACHED IN 2007. A PHASE III STUDY (SUCCEED) IN

PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC SOFT-TISSUE OR BONE SARCOMAS IS UNDER

WAY. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE FILING AN NDA WITH THE

FDA IN 2010.

V503 IS A NINE-VALENT HPV VACCINE IN DEVELOPMENT TO EXPAND

PROTECTION AGAINST CANCER-CAUSING HPV TYPES. THE PHASE III

CLINICAL PROGRAM IS UNDERWAY AND MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING A BLA

WITH THE FDA IN 2012.

MK-0822, ODANACATIB, IS A HIGHLY SELECTIVE INHIBITOR OF THE

CATHEPSIN K ENZYME, WHICH IS BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT

OF OSTEOPOROSIS. THE PHASE III PROGRAM IS ONGOING. MERCK

CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN 2012.

MK-0524A IS A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES EXTENDED-RELEASE

(ER) NIACIN AND A NOVEL FLUSHING INHIBITOR,

LAROPIPRANT. MK-0524A HAS DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO LOWER

LDL-CHOLESTEROL (LDL-C), RAISE HDL-CHOLESTEROL

(HDL-C) AND LOWER TRIGLYCERIDES WITH SIGNIFICANTLY

LESS FLUSHING THAN TRADITIONAL EXTENDED RELEASE NIACIN ALONE.

HIGH LDL-C, LOW HDL-C AND ELEVATED TRIGLYCERIDES ARE RISK

FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES. IN APRIL

2008, MERCK RECEIVED A NON-APPROVABLE ACTION LETTER FROM THE FDA

IN RESPONSE TO ITS NDA FOR MK-0524A. AT A MEETING TO THE DISCUSS

THE LETTER, THE FDA STATED THAT ADDITIONAL EFFICACY AND SAFETY

DATA WERE REQUIRED AND SUGGESTED THAT THE COMPANY WAIT FOR THE

RESULTS OF THE TREATMENT OF HDL TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF

VASCULAR EVENTS (HPS2-THRIVE) CARDIOVASCULAR

OUTCOMES STUDY, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN JANUARY

2012. MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA FOR MK-0524A

IN 2012.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN JULY 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT

TREDAPTIVE

(ALSO

KNOWN AS MK-0524A) WAS APPROVED FOR MARKETING IN THE 27

COUNTRIES OF THE EU, ICELAND AND NORWAY.

TREDAPTIVE

IS

APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA, PARTICULARLY IN

PATIENTS WITH COMBINED MIXED DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHARACTERIZED BY

ELEVATED LEVELS OF LDL-C AND TRIGLYCERIDES AND LOW HDL-C) AND IN

PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (HETEROZYGOUS

FAMILIAL AND NON-FAMILIAL).

TREDAPTIVE

SHOULD BE USED IN

PATIENTS IN COMBINATION WITH STATINS, WHEN THE CHOLESTEROL

LOWERING EFFECTS OF STATIN MONOTHERAPY IS INADEQUATE.

TREDAPTIVE

CAN BE USED AS MONOTHERAPY ONLY IN PATIENTS IN

WHOM STATINS ARE CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE OR NOT TOLERATED. THE

LAUNCH OF

TREDAPTIVE

IN EUROPE AND OTHER MARKETS HAS BEEN

DELAYED DUE TO A MANUFACTURING-RELATED ISSUE. MERCK IS COMMITTED

TO QUICKLY RESOLVING THE ISSUE AND TO MAKING

TREDAPTIVE

AVAILABLE IN EUROPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN OTHER COUNTRIES

AROUND THE WORLD, MERCK CONTINUES TO PURSUE REGULATORY APPROVALS

FOR MK-0524A.

MK-0524B IS A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES THE NOVEL APPROACH TO

RAISING HDL-C AND LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES FROM ER NIACIN COMBINED

WITH LAROPIPRANT WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF SIMVASTATIN IN ONE

COMBINATION PRODUCT. MERCK WILL NOT SEEK APPROVAL FOR MK-0524B

IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL IT FILES ITS COMPLETE RESPONSE

RELATING TO MK-0524A.

MK-0859, ANACETRAPIB, IS AN INHIBITOR OF THE CHOLESTERYL ESTER

TRANSFER PROTEIN THAT HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN LIPID MANAGEMENT BY

RAISING HDL-C AND REDUCING LDL-C WITHOUT RAISING BLOOD PRESSURE.

A PHASE III STUDY WAS INITIATED IN 2008 AND ENROLLMENT IN A

CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES STUDY IS PLANNED TO BEGIN IN 2010. THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA BEYOND 2014.

MK-0431C COMBINES

JANUVIA

WITH PIOGLITAZONE, ANOTHER TYPE

2 DIABETES THERAPY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH

THE FDA IN 2011.

IN OCTOBER 2008, MERCK ANNOUNCED IT WILL NOT SEEK REGULATORY

APPROVAL FOR TARANABANT, AN INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINE, TO TREAT

OBESITY AND HAS DISCONTINUED ITS PHASE III CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR TARANABANT FOR OBESITY. AVAILABLE

PHASE III DATA SHOWED THAT BOTH EFFICACY AND ADVERSE EVENTS

WERE DOSE RELATED, WITH GREATER EFFICACY AND MORE ADVERSE EVENTS

IN THE HIGHER DOSES. THEREFORE, AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE

COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE OVERALL PROFILE OF TARANABANT DID

NOT SUPPORT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT FOR OBESITY.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS COLLABORATION WITH

DYNAVAX TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (DYNAVAX) FOR THE

DEVELOPMENT OF V270, AN INVESTIGATIONAL HEPATITIS B VACCINE,

WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO IN 2007. IN OCTOBER 2008, MERCK AND

DYNAVAX RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE FDA REGARDING THE TWO

COMPANIES RESPONSE TO THE AGENCYS REQUEST FOR SAFETY

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE CLINICAL HOLD ON THE TWO

INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG (IND) APPLICATIONS FOR

V270. IN ISSUING THE CLINICAL HOLD IN MARCH 2008, THE FDA

REQUESTED A REVIEW OF CLINICAL AND SAFETY DATA INCLUDING ALL

AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT A SINGLE CASE OF WEGENERS

GRANULOMATOSIS, AN UNCOMMON DISEASE IN WHICH THE BLOOD VESSELS

ARE INFLAMED, REPORTED IN A PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL.

DYNAVAX AND MERCK HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED A RESPONSE TO THE FDA

IN SEPTEMBER 2008. IN ITS OCTOBER 2008 CORRESPONDENCE, THE FDA

ADVISED THE COMPANIES THAT THE BALANCE OF RISK VERSUS POTENTIAL

BENEFIT NO LONGER FAVORED CONTINUED CLINICAL EVALUATION OF V270

IN HEALTHY ADULTS AND CHILDREN.

THE COMPANYS CLINICAL PIPELINE INCLUDES CANDIDATES IN

MULTIPLE DISEASE AREAS, INCLUDING ANEMIA, ATHEROSCLEROSIS,

CANCER, DIABETES, HEART FAILURE, HYPERTENSION, INFECTIOUS

DISEASES, MIGRAINE, NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, PSYCHIATRIC

DISEASES, OSTEOPOROSIS, PAIN, AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE. THE

COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS ITS INTERNAL RESEARCH WITH AN AGGRESSIVE

LICENSING AND EXTERNAL ALLIANCE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE ENTIRE

SPECTRUM OF COLLABORATIONS FROM EARLY RESEARCH TO LATE-STAGE

COMPOUNDS, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY COMPLETED A

NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN 2008, INCLUDING RESEARCH

COLLABORATIONS, PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS, AND

TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC

CATEGORIES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, MERCK AND JAPAN TOBACCO INC. (JT)

SIGNED A WORLDWIDE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP AND

COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305, AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL OSTEOANABOLIC

(BONE GROWTH STIMULATING) AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF

OSTEOPOROSIS, A DISEASE WHICH REDUCES BONE DENSITY AND STRENGTH

AND RESULTS IN AN INCREASED RISK OF BONE FRACTURES. JTT-305 IS

AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL CALCIUM SENSING RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST THAT

IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED BY JT IN PHASE II CLINICAL

TRIALS IN JAPAN FOR ITS EFFECT ON INCREASING BONE DENSITY AND IS

IN PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS OUTSIDE OF JAPAN. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE AGREEMENT, MERCK GAINED WORLDWIDE RIGHTS, EXCEPT FOR JAPAN,

TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305 AND CERTAIN OTHER RELATED

COMPOUNDS. JT RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $85 MILLION,

WHICH

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND IS

ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF

CERTAIN MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL

OF A DRUG CANDIDATE COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. JT WILL ALSO BE

ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ROYALTIES FROM SALES OF ANY DRUG CANDIDATES

THAT RECEIVE MARKETING APPROVAL. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN

MERCK AND JT WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL EXPIRATION OF ALL

ROYALTY AND MILESTONE OBLIGATIONS, AND MAY BE TERMINATED IN THE

EVENT OF AN UNCURED MATERIAL BREACH BY THE OTHER PARTY. THE

AGREEMENT MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED BY MERCK WITHOUT CAUSE BEFORE

INITIAL COMMERCIAL SALE OF JTT-305 BY GIVING SIX MONTHS PRIOR

NOTICE TO JT, AND THEREAFTER BY GIVING ONE YEAR PRIOR NOTICE

THEREOF TO JT. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED

IMMEDIATELY BY MERCK IF MERCK DETERMINES DUE TO SAFETY

AND/OR

EFFICACY CONCERNS BASED ON AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO

CEASE DEVELOPMENT OF JTT-305

AND/OR

TO

WITHDRAW JTT-305 FROM THE MARKET ON A PERMANENT BASIS.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, MERCK ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH

INSMED INC. (INSMED) TO PURCHASE INSMEDS

PORTFOLIO OF FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES AND ITS

COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN BOULDER,

COLORADO. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL PAY

INSMED AN AGGREGATE OF $130 MILLION IN CASH TO ACQUIRE ALL

RIGHTS TO THE BOULDER FACILITIES  AND INSMEDS PIPELINE OF

FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC CANDIDATES. INSMEDS FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS

PORTFOLIO INCLUDES TWO CLINICAL CANDIDATES: INS-19, AN

INVESTIGATIONAL RECOMBINANT GRANULOCYTE-COLONY STIMULATING

FACTOR (G-CSF) THAT WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ITS

ABILITY TO PREVENT INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING

CHEMOTHERAPY, AND INS-20, A PEGYLATED RECOMBINANT G-CSF DESIGNED

TO ALLOW FOR LESS FREQUENT DOSING. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR

INITIAL PAYMENTS OF UP TO $10 MILLION FOR INS-19 AND

INS-20. MERCK WILL PAY INSMED THE REMAINING BALANCE UPON CLOSING

OF THE TRANSACTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER MILESTONE OR ROYALTY

OBLIGATIONS.

VACANCIES  ACROSS ALL AREAS OF THE COMPANY WORLDWIDE

BY THE END OF 2011. ABOUT 40% OF THE TOTAL REDUCTIONS WILL OCCUR

IN THE UNITED STATES. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM,

THE COMPANY IS STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT LAYERS BY REDUCING ITS

TOTAL NUMBER OF SENIOR AND MID-LEVEL EXECUTIVES GLOBALLY BY

APPROXIMATELY 25%. MERCK WILL ROLLOUT A NEW, MORE

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC SELLING MODEL DESIGNED TO PROVIDE MERCK WITH A

MEANINGFUL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND HELP PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS

AND PAYERS IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE COMPANY ALSO WILL MAKE

GREATER USE OF OUTSIDE TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES, CENTRALIZE COMMON

SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AND CONSOLIDATE AND STREAMLINE

ITS OPERATIONS. MERCKS MANUFACTURING DIVISION WILL FURTHER

FOCUS ITS CAPABILITIES ON CORE PRODUCTS AND OUTSOURCE NON-CORE

MANUFACTURING. IN ADDITION, MERCK IS EXPANDING ITS ACCESS TO

WORLDWIDE EXTERNAL SCIENCE THROUGH A BASIC RESEARCH GLOBAL

OPERATING STRATEGY, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE

PIPELINE AND IS FOCUSED ON TRANSLATING BASIC RESEARCH

PRODUCTIVITY INTO LATE-STAGE CLINICAL SUCCESS. TO INCREASE

EFFICIENCIES, BASIC RESEARCH OPERATIONS WILL CONSOLIDATE WORK IN

SUPPORT OF A GIVEN THERAPEUTIC AREA INTO ONE OF FOUR LOCATIONS.

THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESEARCH FACILITIES

AND RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF THREE BASIC RESEARCH SITES IN

TSUKUBA, JAPAN; POMEZIA, ITALY; AND SEATTLE BY THE END OF 2009.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN

2008, THE COMPANY INCURRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY

$18.7 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FACILITIES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES.

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE

$34.5 MILLION IN 2008, $19.5 MILLION IN 2007,

$12.6 MILLION IN 2006, AND ARE ESTIMATED AT

$47.1 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2009 THROUGH 2013. THESE

AMOUNTS DO NOT CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM OTHER PARTIES.

THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND

PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND, IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE

LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS WHICH ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND TOTALED

$89.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF REMEDIATION,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY POSSIBLE

EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE LIABILITIES

ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $70.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE.

MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE EXPENDITURES SHOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES

FOR ANY YEAR.

GEOGRAPHIC

AREA INFORMATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE

CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES. SALES WORLDWIDE BY

SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE 44% OF SALES IN

2008  AND 39% OF SALES IN 2007 AND 2006.

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AND OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ABROAD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REGARD

THESE RISKS AS A DETERRENT TO FURTHER EXPANSION OF ITS

OPERATIONS ABROAD. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CLOSELY REVIEWS ITS

METHODS OF OPERATIONS AND ADOPTS STRATEGIES RESPONSIVE TO

CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPANDING ITS OPERATIONS

IN COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA,

EASTERN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC WHERE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT

POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE

COMPANY TO EARN FAIR RETURNS. BUSINESS IN THESE DEVELOPING

AREAS, WHILE SOMETIMES LESS STABLE, OFFERS IMPORTANT

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH OVER TIME.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS BELOW.

THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION, FROM THE

MARKET WORLDWIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY

10,800 PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY

26,800 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING

FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX,

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 242 PURPORTED CLASS

ACTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF

VIOXX.

(ALL OF THESE SUITS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS.) AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007,

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT

COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PLAINTIFFS

STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS

COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE

COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS

CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS

SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE

FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE THAN 95% OF THE

CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION.

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY TO U.S. LEGAL

RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI OR IS OCCURRED IN

THE UNITED STATES.

AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2008, THE DEADLINE FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, MORE THAN 48,100 OF THE APPROXIMATELY 48,325

INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND

WHOSE CLAIMS WERE NOT 1) DISMISSED, 2) EXPECTED TO BE

DISMISSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, OR 3) TOLLED CLAIMS THAT

APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED HAD SUBMITTED SOME OR ALL OF THE

MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THIS REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 99.8% OF THE ELIGIBLE MI AND IS

CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED WITH THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MERCK COULD EXERCISE A

RIGHT TO WALK AWAY FROM THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IF THE

THRESHOLDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT MET. THE COMPANY

WAIVED THAT RIGHT AS OF AUGUST 4, 2008. THE WAIVER OF THAT

RIGHT TRIGGERED MERCKS OBLIGATION TO PAY A FIXED TOTAL OF

$4.85 BILLION. PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE IN INSTALLMENTS INTO

THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS. THE FIRST PAYMENT OF $500 MILLION WAS

MADE IN AUGUST 2008 AND AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OF

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$250 MILLION WAS MADE IN OCTOBER 2008. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS

WILL BE MADE ON A PERIODIC BASIS GOING FORWARD, WHEN AND AS

NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS OF CLAIMS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

OF THE PLAINTIFF GROUPS DESCRIBED ABOVE, MOST ARE CURRENTLY IN

THE

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, 70 PLAINTIFF GROUPS WHO WERE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED AND THEIR CLAIMS

REMAINED PENDING AGAINST MERCK. IN ADDITION, THE CLAIMS OF 1,400

PLAINTIFF GROUPS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM REMAINED

PENDING AGAINST MERCK. A NUMBER OF THE 1,400 PLAINTIFF GROUPS

ARE SUBJECT TO MOTIONS TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

COURT-ORDERED DEADLINES. SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2008, HUNDREDS

OF THESE PLAINTIFF GROUPS HAVE SINCE BEEN DISMISSED.

CLAIMS OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REMAIN PENDING

IN THE NEW JERSEY COURT, AND COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A

LARGE NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS HAS THREATENED TO FILE

NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL SUCH ACTIONS. DISCOVERY IS CURRENTLY ONGOING

IN THESE CASES, AND A STATUS CONFERENCE WITH THE COURT TOOK

PLACE IN JANUARY 2009 TO DISCUSS SCHEDULING ISSUES, INCLUDING

THE SELECTION OF EARLY TRIAL POOL CASES.

THERE ARE ALSO PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL

PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND CLAIMING EITHER

REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS OR AN ENTITLEMENT TO

MEDICAL MONITORING. ALL OF THESE CASES ARE AT EARLY PROCEDURAL

STAGES, AND NO CLASS HAS BEEN CERTIFIED. IN NEW JERSEY, THE

TRIAL COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT IN THE CASE OF SINCLAIR, A

PURPORTED STATEWIDE MEDICAL MONITORING CLASS. THE APPELLATE

DIVISION REVERSED THE DISMISSAL, AND THE ISSUE WAS APPEALED TO

THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT. THAT COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON

OCTOBER 22, 2007. ON JUNE 4, 2008, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE APPELLATE DIVISION AND DISMISSED THIS

ACTION.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS HAVE

BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY

MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN

VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS). ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE.

PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ON

SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION

REVERSING JUDGE CHESLERS ORDER AND REMANDING THE CASE TO

THE DISTRICT COURT. ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2008, MERCK FILED A

PETITION SEEKING REHEARING

EN BANC,

WHICH WAS DENIED. THE

CASE WAS REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT IN OCTOBER 2008, AND

PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED THEIR CONSOLIDATED AND FIFTH AMENDED

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL

CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA. (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE

REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS.) IN

ADDITION, SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY

FILED AND DISMISSED ARE NOW ON APPEAL AND SEVERAL SHAREHOLDERS

HAVE FILED DEMANDS WITH THE COMPANY ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST THE

BOARD MEMBERS AND COMPANY OFFICERS. (ALL OF THESE SUITS AND

DEMANDS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED

AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

BEEN SUED BY TEN STATES, FIVE COUNTIES AND NEW YORK CITY WITH

RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS RELATING TO

VIOXX

MAY BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANY

CONCERNING

VIOXX.

THE DOJ HAS ISSUED A SUBPOENA

REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH,

MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN

A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES.

THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES SUBPOENAS FOR WITNESSES TO APPEAR

BEFORE A GRAND JURY. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY

LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH

AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. (ALL OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.) THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER, THEY COULD

RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

JURIES HAVE NOW DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY TWELVE TIMES AND

IN PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FIVE TIMES. ONE MERCK VERDICT WAS SET

ASIDE BY THE COURT AND HAS NOT BEEN RETRIED. ANOTHER MERCK

VERDICT WAS SET ASIDE AND RETRIED, LEADING TO ONE OF THE FIVE

PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO UNRESOLVED

MISTRIALS. WITH RESPECT TO THE FIVE PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS,

MERCK FILED AN APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE

CASES. IN ONE OF THOSE FIVE, AN

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT OVERTURNED THE TRIAL VERDICT AND

DIRECTED THAT JUDGMENT BE ENTERED FOR MERCK, AND IN ANOTHER, AN

INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT OVERTURNED THE TRIAL VERDICT,

ENTERING JUDGMENT FOR MERCK ON ONE CLAIM AND ORDERING A NEW

TRIAL ON THE REMAINING CLAIMS. THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LITIGATION IS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

THE OUTCOMES OF THESE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS

SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED TO INDICATE ANY TREND OR WHAT OUTCOME

MAY BE LIKELY IN FUTURE

VIOXX

TRIALS.

A TRIAL IN A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN AUSTRALIA IS SCHEDULED TO

COMMENCE ON MARCH 30, 2009, IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF

AUSTRALIA. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO ALLEGES HE SUFFERED A MI,

SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHERS IN AUSTRALIA WHO INGESTED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED A MI, THROMBOTIC STROKE, UNSTABLE ANGINA,

TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. ON

NOVEMBER 24, 2008, THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION FOR AN ORDER

THAT THE PROCEEDING NO LONGER CONTINUE AS A REPRESENTATIVE

PROCEEDING. DURING A HEARING ON DECEMBER 5, 2008, THE COURT

DISMISSED THAT MOTION AND, ON JANUARY 9, 2009, ISSUED ITS

REASONS FOR THAT DECISION. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2009, THE

COMPANYS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL THAT DECISION WAS

DENIED AND THE PARTIES WERE DIRECTED TO PREPARE PROPOSED LISTS

OF ISSUES TO BE TRIED.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2009. EXCEPT

WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIAL SCHEDULED TO BE HELD

IN AUSTRALIA, THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER

TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND

AGAINST THEM. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT

TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS

DEFENSE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $305 MILLION

IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO

(I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $62 MILLION TO ADD TO THE RESERVE

SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION WHICH WAS $522 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND $279 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN ADDITION, IN 2007, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $4.85 BILLION EQUAL TO THE

AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO THE QUALIFYING CLAIMANTS IN THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY PAID

$750 MILLION INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS FOR THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM. THUS, THE COMPANYS TOTAL RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS $4.379 BILLION

(THE 

VIOXX

RESERVE). THE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE ALLOCATED TO DEFENSE COSTS IS BASED ON

CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM

AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES WILL BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION,

HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD ARISE IN THE COURSE OF

THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF

DEFENSE COSTS TO BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY ADDITIONAL

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN CONNECTION

WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS AND

THE COMPANY HAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO THE COURSE THE

PROCEEDINGS WILL TAKE. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF

PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE

ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES,

THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS,

AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR

RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT

INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO

THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM

OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING IN THE PAYMENT OF

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

IN EXCESS OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND, WHEN THAT OCCURS,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE

MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS

PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAVE

RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION

FROM LOWER PRICE GENERIC

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO A RAPID LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT

PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED GENERIC VERSIONS OF THAT DRUG BECOME

AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY

TO THE COMPANYS SALES, THE LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION CAN

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

LOST MARKETING

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2008. AS A RESULT OF THESE

EVENTS, THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

U.S. SALES. SALES

OF

FOSAMAX

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE ALREADY BEEN

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE

SODIUM PRODUCTS IN SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM,

CANADA AND GERMANY. ALSO,

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

LOST

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN OCTOBER 2008 AND AS A

RESULT THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS.

THE PATENT THAT PROVIDES U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

PRIMAXIN

EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2009. AFTER SUCH TIME, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S. SALES OF

PRIMAXIN

. IN ADDITION,

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

WILL EACH LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL

2010. THE COMPANY EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN U.S. SALES OF

THESE PRODUCTS AFTER THAT TIME.

A CHART LISTING THE U.S. PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE

COMPANYS MAJOR MARKETED PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH ABOVE IN

ITEM 1. BUSINESS  PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND

LICENSES.

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT

SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND THE

COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS; IN CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST

PATENT PROTECTION.

LIKE OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS

EACH YEAR. DECLINES IN SALES OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

AFTER THE LOSS OF MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY

MEAN THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS

PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NEW PRODUCTS WHICH IT

DEVELOPS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO

OBTAIN THROUGH LICENSE OR ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE

COMPANY COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED

RESOURCES, AND THROUGH VARIOUS COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD

PARTIES. TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THE

COMPANY MUST MAKE ONGOING, SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFORTS IT IS FUNDING WILL RESULT IN A

COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO COMMIT

SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO RECRUITING AND

RETAINING HIGH QUALITY SCIENTISTS AND OTHER PERSONNEL WITH

PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE.

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, SEE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ABOVE. EACH PHASE OF

TESTING IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A

SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER SERIOUS

OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE

COMPANY MAY ABANDON A PRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY. SOME OF THE RISKS

ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND MAY YIELD

DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL

SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ITS

INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A

NEW DRUG; OR SALES OF A NEW PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

THE COMPANY CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF

ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL BE APPROVED OR LAUNCHED;

WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE

COMPOUNDS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY

PRODUCTS, ONCE LAUNCHED, WILL BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE

COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW

PRODUCTS AND SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR

EXISTING PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER ITS SUBSTANTIAL

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE

LOST AS PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

, LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY

COMPETING PRODUCTS OR THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT

TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ISSUES CONCERNING

VYTORIN

AND THE ENHANCE AND SEAS

CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

IN THE U.S.

THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH SELL

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

THROUGH THEIR JOINT VENTURE COMPANY, THE MSP PARTNERSHIP. ON

JANUARY 14, 2008, THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE TRIAL. ENHANCE WAS A

SURROGATE ENDPOINT TRIAL CONDUCTED IN 720 PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE CONDITION

THAT AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 0.2% OF THE POPULATION. THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT WAS THE MEAN CHANGE IN THE INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS

MEASURED AT THREE SITES IN THE CAROTID ARTERIES (THE RIGHT AND

LEFT COMMON CAROTID, INTERNAL CAROTID AND CAROTID BULB) BETWEEN

PATIENTS TREATED WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG VERSUS

PATIENTS TREATED WITH SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE OVER A TWO

YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT. THERE WAS ALSO

NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TREATMENT

GROUPS FOR EACH OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT,

INCLUDING THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY AND ITS JOINT VENTURE

PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

ADDRESSED TO BOTH COMPANIES FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY

AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS

(O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE

SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF

WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF

ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND

PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY

CORPORATE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE AUGUST 2008, THE

COMPANIES HAVE RECEIVED THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM O&I,

INCLUDING ONE DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING CERTAIN

INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL,

WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THE COMPANIES HAVE EACH

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY STATE

ATTORNEYS GENERAL OFFICES AND A LETTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT

ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED FIVE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE

DEMANDS (CIDS) FROM A MULTISTATE GROUP OF 35 STATE

ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO ARE JOINTLY INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE

COMPANIES VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VYTORIN

. FINALLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY RECEIVED

A LETTER FROM THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE DOJ INFORMING IT THAT

THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANIES CONDUCT

RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS

TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH

SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED WITH APPROXIMATELY

145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON LAW AND STATE

CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MSP

PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. CERTAIN OF THOSE LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURIES

AND/OR

SEEK

MEDICAL MONITORING. ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON

APRIL 3, 2008, A MERCK SHAREHOLDER FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTION LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF

PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING THAT MERCK AND ITS CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RICHARD T. CLARK, VIOLATED THE FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS. ON APRIL 22, 2008, A MEMBER OF A MERCK

ERISA PLAN FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ALLEGING THEY

BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES UNDER ERISA.

IN JANUARY 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS

REVIEW OF THE FINAL CLINICAL STUDY REPORT OF ENHANCE. THE FDA

STATED THAT THE RESULTS FROM ENHANCE DID NOT CHANGE ITS POSITION

THAT AN ELEVATED LDL CHOLESTEROL IS A RISK FACTOR FOR

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND THAT LOWERING LDL CHOLESTEROL REDUCES

THE RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE FDA ALSO STATED THAT,

BASED ON CURRENT AVAILABLE DATA, PATIENTS SHOULD NOT STOP TAKING

VYTORIN

OR OTHER CHOLESTEROL LOWERING MEDICATIONS AND

SHOULD TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

VYTORIN

,

ZETIA

, OR THE ENHANCE TRIAL.

IN JULY 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE SEAS STUDY

WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INTENSIVE

LIPID LOWERING WITH

VYTORIN

WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR

AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR

MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH

ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO HAD NO

INDICATION FOR STATIN THERAPY.

VYTORIN

FAILED TO MEET ITS

PRIMARY END POINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR

EVENTS. THERE ALSO WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE KEY

SECONDARY END POINT OF AORTIC VALVE EVENTS; HOWEVER, THERE WAS A

REDUCTION IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS TAKING

VYTORIN

COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF

ISCHEMIC CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. IN THE STUDY, PATIENTS IN THE

GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF CANCER

THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO. THERE WAS ALSO A NONSIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CANCER IN PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

VERSUS

THOSE WHO TOOK PLACEBO. CANCER AND CANCER DEATHS WERE

DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL MAJOR ORGAN SYSTEMS.

IN AUGUST 2008, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING THE

RESULTS FROM THE SEAS TRIAL. IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THE FDA ALSO

CITED INTERIM DATA FROM TWO LARGE ONGOING CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS

OF

VYTORIN

 THE STUDY OF HEART AND RENAL

PROTECTION (SHARP) AND THE IMPROVE-IT CLINICAL

TRIALS  IN WHICH THERE WAS NO INCREASED RISK OF

CANCER WITH THE COMBINATION OF SIMVASTATIN PLUS EZETIMIBE. THE

SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010. THE IMPROVE-IT

TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION AROUND 2012. THE FDA

DETERMINED THAT, AS OF THAT TIME, THESE FINDINGS IN THE SEAS

TRIAL PLUS THE INTERIM DATA FROM ONGOING TRIALS SHOULD NOT

PROMPT PATIENTS TO STOP TAKING

VYTORIN

OR ANY OTHER

CHOLESTEROL LOWERING DRUG.

FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE ENHANCE AND SEAS CLINICAL

TRIAL RESULTS, SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

DECLINED

IN 2008 IN THE U.S. THESE ISSUES CONCERNING THE ENHANCE AND

SEAS CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MSP

PARTNERSHIPS SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND

COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SUCH SALES. IF SALES

OF SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING

FROM THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR THE LITIGATION CONCERNING

THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS THE COMPANY OBTAINS AND

MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL

TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING ITS

PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE FDA IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY, AS

IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL,

SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO IS

PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY

CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

TESTING, TO DELAY OR WITHHOLD REGISTRATION AND MARKETING

APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT

WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND

UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE

OBTAINED, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS

TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE APPROVAL

IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL,

SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, OR ITS FAILURE TO

MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM

SELLING THE NEW PRODUCTS IN THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS

OBTAINED, IF EVER. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE

REVENUES FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT

DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS

PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS

WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN

HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN

MARKETS. PATENTS COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED

NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SEEKS

PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS

WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND WHERE MEANINGFUL

PATENT PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS

PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES OR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE

OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT

APPLICATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TO

DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN

PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO ITS PATENTS OR

INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS ITS IMPORTANT PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS  PATENT

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LITIGATION BELOW. IN PARTICULAR, MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW

DRUG APPLICATIONS (ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

NORMALLY RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS PATENT, INCLUDING

BY FILING LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT

LITIGATION AND OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS

ARE COSTLY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE THE COMPANY OF

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES,

THIRD PARTY PATENTS MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING AND

SELLING A PRODUCT IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

AS DISCUSSED BELOW IN ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

(TEVA), A GENERIC COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT HAD

FILED AN ANDA FOR MONTELUKAST AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE

U.S. PATENT THAT IS LISTED FOR

SINGULAIR

. ON

APRIL 2, 2007, THE COMPANY FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT

ACTION AGAINST TEVA. THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA

APPROVAL OF TEVAS ANDA UNTIL AUGUST 2009 OR UNTIL AN

ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. A

TRIAL IN THIS MATTER COMMENCED ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN

PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO

DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE

PRODUCTS BECOMING AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST SALES UNLESS

AND UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY

SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC

PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM

LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS

PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN

SOME COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN

IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICAL

PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO

LEGISLATION WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS

PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE

EMERGENCE OF GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED

PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES, REDUCING THE COMPANYS

SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR

THE COMPANYS DRUGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION, PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR

LEGISLATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND RAPID APPROVAL OF

GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED INTO LAW COULD

WORSEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION MAY INCREASE AS NEW

PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE SAFER OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR

MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION,

THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE SOLD

AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

AS A RESULT, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE

POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION

AND PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANY FACES PRICING PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO ITS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICE

PRESSURES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THESE INCLUDE

(I) PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND

GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASERS AND (II) U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS RELATED TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, INCLUDING THE

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF

2003 (THE 2003 ACT). THE 2003 ACT INCLUDED A

PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHICH FIRST WENT INTO

EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER

OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES

COULD RESULT IN FURTHER PRICING PRESSURES.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, NUMEROUS MAJOR MARKETS HAVE PERVASIVE

GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN FUNDING HEALTHCARE, AND IN THAT

REGARD, FIX THE PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND

VACCINE PRODUCTS.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSEQUENTLY, IN THOSE MARKETS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING AND BUDGETARY ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO

ITS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS PRICING PRESSURES TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS IN THE

MANUFACTURING OF CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED

DIFFICULTIES IN MANUFACTURING CERTAIN OF ITS VACCINES AND OTHER

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS WORKING ON THESE ISSUES, BUT THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE OF WHEN OR IF THESE ISSUES WILL BE FINALLY

RESOLVED.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING

CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS

INHERENT IN MANUFACTURING ITS PRODUCTS, SUCH AS (I) FAILURE

OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS TO COMPLY WITH

CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES AND OTHER APPLICABLE

REGULATIONS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE GUIDELINES THAT COULD LEAD TO

MANUFACTURING SHUTDOWNS, PRODUCT SHORTAGES AND DELAYS IN PRODUCT

MANUFACTURING; (II) CONSTRUCTION DELAYS RELATED TO THE

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES OR THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING

FACILITIES, INCLUDING THOSE INTENDED TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND

FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS; AND (III) OTHER

MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS INCLUDING CHANGES IN

MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION SITES AND LIMITS TO MANUFACTURING

CAPACITY DUE TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN TYPES OF

PRODUCTS PRODUCED, OR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS THAT COULD IMPACT

CONTINUOUS SUPPLY. MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES CAN RESULT IN

PRODUCT SHORTAGES, LEADING TO LOST SALES.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CAN DEVELOP UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR

EFFICACY CONCERNS.

UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR EFFICACY CONCERNS CAN ARISE WITH RESPECT TO

MARKETED PRODUCTS, WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED,

LEADING TO PRODUCT RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS, OR DECLINING SALES, AS

WELL AS PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER FRAUD

AND/OR

OTHER

CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY HAS NO PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR PRODUCTS

FIRST SOLD AFTER AUGUST 1, 2004.

AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE

HAS BECOME LESS AVAILABLE WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS

DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF OBTAINING PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS

AVAILABLE AND, AS SUCH, HAS NO INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT

LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY

FOR PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD AFTER THAT DATE.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS.

ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, PRICING, SALES,

LITIGATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND AGENCY REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS AND CURRENT UNCERTAINTY IN GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS.

THE CURRENT FINANCIAL CRISIS AND UNCERTAINTY IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL VOLATILITY IN THE CREDIT

MARKETS AND A LOW LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IN MANY FINANCIAL MARKETS.

THESE CONDITIONS MAY RESULT IN A FURTHER SLOWDOWN TO THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS BY

REDUCING THE PRICES THAT DRUG WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS,

HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

MAY BE ABLE OR WILLING TO PAY FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR

BY REDUCING THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, WHICH

COULD IN TURN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS SALES AND

REVENUE GENERATION AND RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS AND OUTSOURCING

ARRANGEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SUPPLIERS,

ALLIANCES WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

AND THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, FOR KEY ASPECTS OF ITS

BUSINESS INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND

COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT FOR ITS

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. FAILURE OF THESE THIRD PARTIES

TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL, REGULATORY AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO

THE COMPANY OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY

DISRUPT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THESE THIRD

PARTIES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS.

DECEMBER 31, 2008, 70 PLAINTIFF GROUPS WHO WERE OTHERWISE

ELIGIBLE FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED AND

THEIR CLAIMS REMAINED PENDING AGAINST MERCK. IN ADDITION, THE

CLAIMS OF 1,400 PLAINTIFF GROUPS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM REMAINED PENDING AGAINST MERCK. A NUMBER OF

THE 1,400 PLAINTIFF GROUPS ARE SUBJECT TO MOTIONS TO DISMISS FOR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COURT-ORDERED DEADLINES. SINCE

DECEMBER 31, 2008, HUNDREDS OF THESE PLAINTIFF GROUPS HAVE

SINCE BEEN DISMISSED.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CLAIMS OF OVER 27,400 PLAINTIFFS HAD BEEN

DISMISSED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. OF THESE, THERE HAVE

BEEN OVER 4,925 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED WITH

PREJUDICE (I.E., THEY CANNOT BE BROUGHT AGAIN) EITHER BY

PLAINTIFFS THEMSELVES OR BY THE COURTS. OVER 22,475 ADDITIONAL

PLAINTIFFS HAVE HAD THEIR CLAIMS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE

(I.E., SUBJECT TO THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, THEY

CAN BE BROUGHT AGAIN). OF THESE, APPROXIMATELY 13,750 PLAINTIFF

GROUPS REPRESENT PLAINTIFFS WHO HAD LAWSUITS PENDING IN THE NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT AT THE TIME OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

DESCRIBED BELOW AND WHO ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM),

JUDGE HIGBEE HAS DISMISSED THESE CASES WITHOUT PREJUDICE FOR

ADMINISTRATIVE REASONS.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH

THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE

PLAINTIFFS STEERING COMMITTEE (PSC) OF THE

FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA

STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI

AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS

SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE

FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE THAN 95% OF THE

U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS

AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED

STATES.

THE ENTIRE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ACCOMPANYING

EXHIBITS, MAY BE FOUND AT

WWW.MERCK.COM

. THE

COMPANY HAS INCLUDED THIS WEBSITE ADDRESS ONLY AS AN INACTIVE

TEXTUAL REFERENCE AND DOES NOT INTEND IT TO BE AN ACTIVE LINK TO

ITS WEBSITE NOR DOES IT INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE INFORMATION

CONTAINED THEREIN. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL

PAY A FIXED AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $4.85 BILLION INTO TWO

FUNDS ($4.0 BILLION FOR MI CLAIMS AND $850 MILLION FOR

IS CLAIMS) FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS THAT ENTER INTO THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM. INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WILL BE EXAMINED BY ADMINISTRATORS

OF THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM TO DETERMINE QUALIFICATION BASED ON

OBJECTIVE, DOCUMENTED FACTS PROVIDED BY CLAIMANTS, INCLUDING

RECORDS SUFFICIENT FOR A SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF INDEPENDENT

RISK FACTORS. THE CONDITIONS IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ALSO

REQUIRE CLAIMANTS TO PASS THREE GATES: AN INJURY GATE, A

DURATION GATE, AND A PROXIMITY GATE (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT).

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT MERCK DOES NOT ADMIT

CAUSATION OR FAULT. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDED THAT

MERCKS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE TRIGGERED ONLY IF,

AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS, (1) LAW FIRMS ON THE FEDERAL AND

STATE PSCS AND FIRMS THAT HAVE TRIED CASES IN THE COORDINATED

PROCEEDINGS ELECT TO RECOMMEND ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM TO 100%

OF THEIR CLIENTS WHO ALLEGE EITHER MI OR IS, AND (2) BY

JUNE 30, 2008, PLAINTIFFS ENROLL IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM

AT LEAST 85% OF EACH OF ALL CURRENTLY PENDING AND TOLLED

(I) MI CLAIMS, (II) IS CLAIMS, (III) ELIGIBLE MI

AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH INVOLVE DEATH, AND

(IV) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH ALLEGE MORE

THAN 12 MONTHS OF USE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, MERCK COULD EXERCISE A RIGHT TO WALK AWAY FROM THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IF THE THRESHOLDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS

WERE NOT MET. THE COMPANY WAIVED THAT RIGHT AS OF AUGUST 4,

2008. THE WAIVER OF THAT RIGHT TRIGGERED MERCKS OBLIGATION

TO PAY A FIXED TOTAL OF $4.85 BILLION. PAYMENTS WILL BE

MADE IN INSTALLMENTS INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS. THE FIRST

PAYMENT OF

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$500 MILLION WAS MADE IN AUGUST 2008 AND AN ADDITIONAL

PAYMENT OF $250 MILLION WAS MADE IN OCTOBER 2008. INTERIM

PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO ALLEGED THAT

THEY SUFFERED AN MI AND THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT INTERIM

PAYMENTS TO IS CLAIMANTS WILL BEGIN SHORTLY. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS

WILL BE MADE ON A PERIODIC BASIS GOING FORWARD, WHEN AND AS

NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS OF CLAIMS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

MERCKS TOTAL PAYMENT FOR BOTH FUNDS OF $4.85 BILLION

IS A FIXED AMOUNT TO BE ALLOCATED AMONG QUALIFYING CLAIMANTS

BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION. THE DISTRIBUTION OF

INTERIM PAYMENTS TO QUALIFIED CLAIMANTS BEGAN IN AUGUST 2008 AND

WILL CONTINUE ON A ROLLING BASIS UNTIL ALL CLAIMANTS WHO QUALIFY

FOR AN INTERIM PAYMENT ARE PAID. FINAL PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE

AFTER THE EXAMINATION OF ALL OF THE ELIGIBLE CLAIMS HAS BEEN

COMPLETED.

AFTER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 9,

2007, JUDGES IN THE FEDERAL MDL, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS AND NEW

JERSEY STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS ENTERED A SERIES OF ORDERS.

THE ORDERS: (1) TEMPORARILY STAYED THEIR RESPECTIVE

LITIGATIONS; (2) REQUIRED PLAINTIFFS TO REGISTER THEIR

CLAIMS BY JANUARY 15, 2008; (3) REQUIRED PLAINTIFFS

WITH CASES PENDING AS OF NOVEMBER 9, 2007 TO PRESERVE AND

PRODUCE RECORDS AND SERVE EXPERT REPORTS; AND (4) REQUIRED

PLAINTIFFS WHO FILE THEREAFTER TO MAKE SIMILAR PRODUCTIONS ON AN

ACCELERATED SCHEDULE. THE CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA AND WASHOE

COUNTY, NEVADA COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS WERE ALSO GENERALLY

STAYED.

AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2008, THE DEADLINE FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, MORE THAN 48,100 OF THE APPROXIMATELY 48,325

INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND

WHOSE CLAIMS WERE NOT 1) DISMISSED, 2) EXPECTED TO BE

DISMISSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, OR 3) TOLLED CLAIMS THAT

APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED HAD SUBMITTED SOME OR ALL OF THE

MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THIS REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 99.8% OF THE ELIGIBLE MI AND IS

CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED WITH THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

ON APRIL 14, 2008 AND JUNE 3, 2008, TWO GROUPS OF

VARIOUS PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS FILED SUIT

AGAINST BROWNGREER, THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM (THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR), AND

U.S. BANCORP, ESCROW AGENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM (THE

AVMED AND GREATER NEW YORK BENEFIT FUND

SUITS). THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS CLAIM

TO HAVE PAID HEALTHCARE COSTS ON BEHALF OF SOME OF THE ENROLLING

CLAIMANTS AND SEEK TO ENJOIN THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR FROM

PAYING ENROLLED CLAIMANTS UNTIL THEIR CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

FROM THE ENROLLED CLAIMANTS ARE RESOLVED. EACH GROUP SOUGHT

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS. JUDGE

FALLON DENIED THESE REQUESTS. IN AVMED, THE DEFENDANTS MOVED TO

SEVER THE CLAIMS OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS AND, IN GREATER NEW

YORK BENEFIT FUND, TO STRIKE THE CLASS ALLEGATIONS. JUDGE FALLON

GRANTED THESE MOTIONS. AVMED APPEALED BOTH OF THESE DECISIONS.

THE FIFTH CIRCUIT HEARD ARGUMENT ON AVMEDS APPEAL ON

NOVEMBER 4, 2008. ON NOVEMBER 17, 2008, THE COURT OF

APPEALS AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURTS RULING THAT DENIED

THE TWO MOTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. GREATER NEW

YORK BENEFIT FUND HAS SERVED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. ON

JANUARY 22, 2009, THE PSC AND COUNSEL FOR CERTAIN PRIVATE

INSURERS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THE

AGREEMENT PROVIDES A PROGRAM FOR RESOLUTION OF LIENS ASSERTED BY

PRIVATE INSURERS AGAINST PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY CERTAIN CLAIMANTS

WHO HAVE ENROLLED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THE AGREEMENT CAN

BE TERMINATED BY THE PRIVATE INSURERS IF FEWER THAN 90% OF

ELIGIBLE CLAIMANTS PARTICIPATE. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE AVMED AND

GREATER NEW YORK BENEFIT FUND LAWSUITS HAVE AGREED TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT.

THERE ARE TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2009. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A

LIST OF SUCH TRIALS AT ITS WEBSITE AT

WWW.MERCK.COM

, WHICH IT WILL PERIODICALLY UPDATE

AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY HAS INCLUDED ITS WEBSITE ADDRESS

ONLY AS AN INACTIVE TEXTUAL REFERENCE AND DOES NOT INTEND IT TO

BE AN ACTIVE LINK TO ITS WEBSITE NOR DOES IT INCORPORATE BY

REFERENCE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.

THE COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THE OUTCOMES OF SEVERAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT WERE TRIED PRIOR TO

2008.

JURIES HAVE NOW DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY TWELVE TIMES AND

IN PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FIVE TIMES. ONE MERCK VERDICT WAS SET

ASIDE BY THE COURT AND HAS NOT BEEN RETRIED. ANOTHER MERCK

VERDICT WAS SET ASIDE AND RETRIED, LEADING TO ONE OF THE FIVE

PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO UNRESOLVED

MISTRIALS. WITH RESPECT TO THE FIVE PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS,

MERCK FILED AN APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE

CASES. IN ONE OF THOSE FIVE, AN INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT

OVERTURNED THE TRIAL VERDICT AND DIRECTED THAT JUDGMENT BE

ENTERED FOR MERCK, AND IN ANOTHER, AN INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE

COURT OVERTURNED THE TRIAL VERDICT, ENTERING JUDGMENT FOR MERCK

ON ONE CLAIM AND ORDERING A NEW TRIAL ON THE REMAINING CLAIMS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALL BUT THE FOLLOWING THREE CASES THAT WENT TO TRIAL ARE NOW

RESOLVED: MCDARBY V. MERCK, ERNST V. MERCK, AND

GARZA V. MERCK.

THE FIRST, MCDARBY, WAS ORIGINALLY TRIED ALONG WITH A SECOND

PLAINTIFF, CONA, IN APRIL 2006, IN SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY,

LAW DIVISION, ATLANTIC COUNTY. THE JURY RETURNED A SPLIT

VERDICT. THE JURY DETERMINED THAT

VIOXX

DID NOT

SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEART ATTACK OF MR. CONA,

BUT DID SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEART ATTACK OF

MR. MCDARBY. THE JURY ALSO CONCLUDED THAT, IN EACH CASE,

MERCK VIOLATED NEW JERSEYS CONSUMER FRAUD STATUTE, WHICH

ALLOWS PLAINTIFFS TO RECEIVE THEIR EXPENSES FOR PURCHASING THE

DRUG, TREBLED, AS WELL AS REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES. THE

JURY AWARDED $4.5 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO

MR. MCDARBY AND HIS WIFE, WHO ALSO WAS A PLAINTIFF IN THAT

CASE, AS WELL AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $9 MILLION. ON

JUNE 8, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE DENIED MERCKS MOTION FOR A

NEW TRIAL. ON JUNE 15, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE AWARDED

APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN

ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE

JUDGMENTS IN BOTH CASES AND THE APPELLATE DIVISION HELD ORAL

ARGUMENT ON BOTH CASES ON JANUARY 16, 2008. ON MAY 29,

2008, THE NEW JERSEY APPELLATE DIVISION VACATED THE CONSUMER

FRAUD AWARDS IN BOTH CASES ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE PRODUCT

LIABILITY ACT PROVIDES THE SOLE REMEDY FOR PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS. THE APPELLATE DIVISION ALSO VACATED THE MCDARBY PUNITIVE

DAMAGE AWARD ON THE GROUND OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND VACATED THE

ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS AWARDED UNDER THE CONSUMER FRAUD

ACT IN BOTH CASES. THE COURT UPHELD THE MCDARBY COMPENSATORY

AWARD. THE COMPANY HAS FILED WITH THE SUPREME COURT OF

NEW JERSEY A PETITION TO APPEAL THOSE PARTS OF THE TRIAL

COURTS RULINGS THAT THE APPELLATE DIVISION AFFIRMED.

PLAINTIFFS FILED A CROSS-PETITION TO APPEAL THOSE PARTS OF THE

TRIAL COURTS RULINGS THAT THE APPELLATE DIVISION REVERSED.

ON OCTOBER 8, 2008, THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY GRANTED

MERCKS PETITION FOR CERTIFICATION OF APPEAL, LIMITED

SOLELY TO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND

COSMETIC ACT PREEMPTS STATE LAW TORT CLAIMS PREDICATED ON THE

ALLEGED INADEQUACY OF WARNINGS CONTAINED IN

VIOXX

LABELING THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA. THE COURT DENIED THE

PLAINTIFFS CROSS-PETITION. ON DECEMBER 4, 2008, THE

NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT GRANTED MERCKS MOTION TO STAY THE

APPEAL PENDING THE ISSUANCE OF A DECISION FROM UNITED STATES

SUPREME COURT IN WYETH V. LEVINE.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN SEPTEMBER 2006, MERCK FILED A NOTICE

OF APPEAL OF THE AUGUST 2005 JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE

PLAINTIFF IN THE TEXAS STATE COURT CASE, ERNST V. MERCK. ON

MAY 29, 2008, THE TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE TRIAL

COURTS JUDGMENT AND ISSUED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MERCK.

THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND THE EVIDENCE TO BE LEGALLY

INSUFFICIENT ON THE ISSUE OF CAUSATION. PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A

MOTION FOR REHEARING

EN BANC

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS.

MERCK FILED A RESPONSE IN OCTOBER 2008. IN JANUARY 2009,

PLAINTIFFS FILED A REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REHEARING MOTION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN APRIL 2006, IN GARZA V. MERCK, A JURY

IN STATE COURT IN RIO GRANDE CITY, TEXAS RETURNED A VERDICT IN

FAVOR OF THE FAMILY OF DECEDENT LEONEL GARZA. THE JURY AWARDED A

TOTAL OF $7 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO

MR. GARZAS WIDOW AND THREE SONS. THE JURY ALSO

PURPORTED TO AWARD $25 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES EVEN

THOUGH UNDER TEXAS LAW, IN THIS CASE, POTENTIAL PUNITIVE DAMAGES

WERE CAPPED AT $750,000. ON MAY 14, 2008, THE

SAN ANTONIO COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE JUDGMENT AND

RENDERED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MERCK. ON DECEMBER 10,

2008, THE COURT OF APPEALS, ON REHEARING, VACATED ITS PRIOR

RULING AND ISSUED A REPLACEMENT. IN THE NEW RULING, THE COURT

ORDERED A TAKE-NOTHING JUDGMENT FOR MERCK ON THE DESIGN DEFECT

CLAIM, BUT REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL AS TO THE

STRICT LIABILITY CLAIM BECAUSE OF JUROR MISCONDUCT. ON

JANUARY 26, 2009, MERCK FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH

THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT.

MERCK VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

FROM THE MARKET ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. MOST STATES HAVE STATUTES OF

LIMITATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS OF NO MORE THAN THREE

YEARS, WHICH REQUIRE THAT CLAIMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS LEARNED OR COULD HAVE

LEARNED OF THEIR POTENTIAL CAUSE OF ACTION. AS A RESULT, SOME

MAY VIEW SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AS A SIGNIFICANT DEADLINE FOR

FILING

VIOXX

CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, HOWEVER,

THAT THE LAW REGARDING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS CAN BE COMPLEX

AND VARIABLE, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND APPLICABLE LAW. SOME

STATES HAVE LONGER STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS. THERE ARE ALSO

ARGUMENTS THAT THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS BEGAN RUNNING BEFORE

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE HIGBEE

AND FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FALLON HAVE ISSUED ORDERS IN

CASES FROM NEW JERSEY AND EIGHT OTHER JURISDICTIONS RULING THAT

THE STATUTORY PERIOD FOR MAKING

VIOXX

PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS HAS PASSED. JUDGE HIGBEES ORDER WAS ISSUED ON

OCTOBER 15, 2007 AND JUDGE FALLONS WAS ISSUED ON

NOVEMBER 8, 2007.

OTHER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 29, 2005, A NEW JERSEY

STATE TRIAL COURT CERTIFIED A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS (SUCH AS UNIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS) THAT PAID IN

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE

VIOXX

USED BY THEIR PLAN MEMBERS

OR INSUREDS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE SOUGHT RECOVERY OF

CERTAIN

VIOXX

PURCHASE COSTS (PLUS PENALTIES) BASED ON

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE PURPORTED CLASS MEMBERS PAID MORE FOR

VIOXX

THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY KNOWN OF THE

PRODUCTS ALLEGED RISKS. ON MARCH 31, 2006, THE NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, AFFIRMED THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE CERTIFICATION OF A NATIONWIDE CLASS

ACTION OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, FINDING THAT THE SUIT DOES NOT

MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CLASS ACTION. CLAIMS OF CERTAIN

INDIVIDUAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REMAIN PENDING IN THE NEW JERSEY

COURT, AND COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF

THIRD-PARTY PAYORS HAVE FILED ADDITIONAL SUCH ACTIONS. JUDGE

HIGBEE LIFTED THE STAY IN THESE CASES AND THE CASES ARE

CURRENTLY IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE. A STATUS CONFERENCE WITH THE

COURT TOOK PLACE IN JANUARY 2009 TO DISCUSS SCHEDULING ISSUES IN

THESE CASES, INCLUDING THE SELECTION OF EARLY TRIAL POOL CASES.

THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS

MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION IN MARTIN-KLEINMAN V. MERCK,

WHICH IS A PUTATIVE CONSUMER CLASS ACTION, ON DECEMBER 5,

2008.

CLASS ACTIONS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL

PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND CLAIMING EITHER

REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS OR AN ENTITLEMENT TO

MEDICAL MONITORING. THE MAJORITY OF THESE CASES ARE AT EARLY

PROCEDURAL STAGES. ON JUNE 12, 2008, A MISSOURI STATE COURT

CERTIFIED A CLASS OF MISSOURI PLAINTIFFS SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT

FOR

OUT-OF-POCKET

COSTS RELATING TO

VIOXX.

THE PLAINTIFFS DO NOT ALLEGE ANY

PERSONAL INJURIES FROM TAKING

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY FILED A

PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW ON JUNE 23, 2008, WHICH

WAS GRANTED ON JULY 30, 2008. BRIEFING IS NOW COMPLETE.

DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE APPEAL, DISCOVERY IS PROCEEDING IN

THE LOWER COURT. ON FEBRUARY 3, 2009, JUDGE FALLON

DISMISSED THE MASTER PERSONAL INJURY/WRONGFUL DEATH CLASS ACTION

MASTER COMPLAINT AND THE MEDICAL MONITORING CLASS ACTION MASTER

COMPLAINT IN THE MDL.

PLAINTIFFS ALSO HAVE FILED A CLASS ACTION IN CALIFORNIA STATE

COURT SEEKING CLASS CERTIFICATION OF CALIFORNIA THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS AND END-USERS. THE PARTIES ARE ENGAGED IN CLASS

ARGUMENT ON THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUE ON FEBRUARY 19,

2009.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN EIGHTEEN

SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF TEN STATES,

FIVE COUNTIES, THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AND PRIVATE CITIZENS (WHOM

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION,

WHICH REQUESTED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF PURCHASERS OF COMPANY STOCK

BETWEEN MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29, 2004, ALLEGED

THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND

20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND SOUGHT

UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF SUIT,

INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ASSERTED

CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT

AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES OF MERCK

STOCK AND UNDER SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933 AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS BASED ON STATEMENTS IN A

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE.

PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ON

SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION

REVERSING JUDGE CHESLERS ORDER AND REMANDING THE CASE TO

THE DISTRICT COURT. ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2008, MERCK FILED A

WHICH WAS DENIED. THE

CASE WAS REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT IN OCTOBER 2008, AND

PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED THEIR CONSOLIDATED AND FIFTH AMENDED

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT. MERCK FILED A PETITION FOR A WRIT

OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ON

JANUARY 15, 2009. MERCK EXPECTS TO FILE A MOTION TO DISMISS

THE FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT.

IN OCTOBER 2005, A DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER

GOVERNING THE SHAREHOLDER MDL, THE CASE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE

SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, WAS

CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS.

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PENSION FUNDS

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 3, 2007. IN SEPTEMBER 2007,

THE DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT RATHER THAN

RESPONDING TO DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS. IN ADDITION IN

2007, SIX NEW COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW

JERSEY ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALSO

ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS

VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS. DEFENDANTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THESE

COMPLAINTS UNTIL AFTER JUDGE CHESLER RESOLVES ANY MOTION TO

DISMISS IN THE CONSOLIDATED SECURITIES ACTION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL

AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). ON MAY 5,

2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS

AND DENIED PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR

COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, ARGUING THAT JUDGE CHESLER ERRED

IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITH

MATERIALS ACQUIRED DURING DISCOVERY. ON JULY 18, 2007, THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED

THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION ON THE GROUNDS THAT JUDGE

CHESLER SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED PLAINTIFFS TO MAKE USE OF THE

DISCOVERY MATERIAL TO TRY TO ESTABLISH DEMAND FUTILITY, AND

REMANDED THE CASE FOR THE DISTRICT COURTS CONSIDERATION OF

WHETHER, EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WOULD STILL BE FUTILE.

PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REQUEST FOR

LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2007. THE COURT

DENIED THE MOTION IN JUNE 2008 AND CLOSED THE CASE. PLAINTIFFS

HAVE APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS)

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED

FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE LAWSUITS MAKE

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. ON JULY 11, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER

GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. IN OCTOBER 2007, PLAINTIFFS MOVED

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AT ANY TIME BETWEEN OCTOBER 1,

1998 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND WHOSE PLAN ACCOUNTS

INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN THE MERCK COMMON STOCK FUND

AND/OR

MERCK

COMMON STOCK. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2009, THE COURT DENIED THE

MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS AS TO ONE COUNT AND GRANTED

THE MOTION AS TO THE REMAINING COUNTS. THE COURT ALSO LIMITED

THE CLASS TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PARTICIPANTS IN AND

BENEFICIARIES OF THE COMPANYS RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS WHO

SUFFERED A LOSS DUE TO THEIR INVESTMENTS IN MERCK STOCK THROUGH

THE PLANS AND WHO DID NOT EXECUTE A SETTLEMENT RELEASING THEIR

CLAIMS. ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, DEFENDANTS FILED

THIS LITIGATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO

INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON THE COMPANYS

BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN,

FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER

INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH

RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN S. MARTIN, JR. OF

DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ALLEGATIONS SET FORTH

IN THE DEMAND. JUDGE MARTINS REPORT WAS MADE PUBLIC IN

SEPTEMBER 2006. BASED ON THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES

RECOMMENDATION MADE AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE MARTIN

REPORT AND THE IMPACT THAT DERIVATIVE LITIGATION WOULD HAVE ON

THE COMPANY, THE BOARD REJECTED THE DEMAND. ON OCTOBER 11,

2007, THE SHAREHOLDERS FILED A LAWSUIT IN STATE COURT IN

ATLANTIC COUNTY, NEW JERSEY AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER

EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE

BOARDS REJECTION OF THEIR DEMAND WAS UNREASONABLE AND

IMPROPER, AND THAT THE DEFENDANTS BREACHED VARIOUS DUTIES TO THE

COMPANY IN ALLOWING

VIOXX

TO BE MARKETED. THE CURRENT AND

FORMER EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR DEFENDANTS FILED MOTIONS TO

DISMISS THE COMPLAINT IN JUNE 2008. ON OCTOBER 30, 2008,

2008, THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN GRANTED THE COMPANY

LEAVE TO APPEAL THE CERTIFICATION ORDER. THAT APPEAL WAS ARGUED

BEFORE THAT COURT, AND THE COURT HAS RESERVED DECISION. ON

JULY 28, 2008, THE SUPERIOR COURT IN ONTARIO DENIED THE

COMPANYS MOTION TO STAY CLASS PROCEEDINGS IN ONTARIO,

WHICH HAD BEEN BASED ON THE EARLIER CERTIFICATION ORDER ENTERED

IN SASKATCHEWAN, AND DECIDED TO CERTIFY AN OVERLAPPING CLASS OF

VIOXX

USERS IN CANADA, EXCEPT THOSE IN QUEBEC AND

SASKATCHEWAN, WHO ALLEGE NEGLIGENCE AND AN ENTITLEMENT TO ELECT

DIVISIONAL COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO

APPEAL THE SUPERIOR COURTS DECISION DENYING THE STAY OF

THE ONTARIO CLASS PROCEEDINGS AND DENIED THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO APPEAL THE CERTIFICATION ORDER. THE COMPANYS

2009. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2009, THE DIVISIONAL COURT DECLINED

TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER DENYING THE STAY. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

SEEK LEAVE TO APPEAL FROM THE ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL. EARLIER,

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE SUPERIOR COURT IN QUEBEC AUTHORIZED THE

INSTITUTION OF A CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO,

IN QUEBEC, CONSUMED

OUT OF ITS INGESTION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT INSTITUTED AN ACTION BASED UPON THAT

AUTHORIZATION.

$630 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTIBLES AND

CO-INSURANCE.

THIS INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY $590 MILLION IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY INSURANCE PROCEEDS RELATING TO THE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS

ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN

INFORMAL INQUIRY CONCERNING

VIOXX.

ON JANUARY 28,

2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE SEC

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE DOJ REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED

TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES

WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE

INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THIS INVESTIGATION

INCLUDES SUBPOENAS FOR WITNESSES TO APPEAR BEFORE A GRAND JURY.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING

CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN

ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE

BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH

THESE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS

(THE 

CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY

COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

VIOXX.

AS PART OF THE

CIVIL RESOLUTION OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, MERCK PAID A TOTAL OF

$58 MILLION TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE 29 STATES AND THE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THE AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES COMPLIANCE

MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PREVIOUSLY

ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006

FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS

AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON

CALIFORNIAS MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL

AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE

TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS

TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT

DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO

APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER

SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE

COORDINATION OF MORE THAN 95% OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY

TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI

OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 2007, AS A RESULT OF

ENTERING INTO

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE

OF $4.85 BILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIXED AGGREGATE

AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO PLAINTIFFS QUALIFYING FOR PAYMENT UNDER THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2009. EXCEPT

WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIAL SCHEDULED TO BE HELD

IN AUSTRALIA, THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER

TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF

THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS

SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. IN

EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO

RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN SUCH

CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD AN

AGGREGATE RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $5.372 BILLION

(THE

VIOXX

RESERVE) FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM

AND THE COMPANYS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $305 MILLION

IN THE AGGREGATE, IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO

(I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $62 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. IN

ADDITION, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THE COMPANY PAID AN ADDITIONAL

$250 MILLION INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AFTER HAVING PAID $500 MILLION INTO

THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.379 BILLION. IN ADDING TO

THE

VIOXX

RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THE SAME FACTORS THAT IT

CONSIDERED WHEN IT PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS

CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WERE AS

FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY; THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND

STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION,

INCLUDING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT

CERTAIN LAWSUITS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF

CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES

OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING

ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL

ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE AMOUNT

OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

ALLOCATED SOLELY TO DEFENSE COSTS REPRESENTS THE COMPANYS

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE

INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL

TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT

COULD ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD

AFFECT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE INCURRED BY

THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE

TO INCREASE THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE

IF, BASED UPON THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE

APPROPRIATE TO DO SO.

OTHER

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY 779 CASES, WHICH INCLUDE

APPROXIMATELY 1,158 PLAINTIFF GROUPS HAD BEEN FILED AND WERE

PENDING AGAINST MERCK IN EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT,

INCLUDING ONE CASE WHICH SEEKS CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS

WELL AS DAMAGES

AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW,

GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE DENTAL PROCEDURES, SUCH AS

TOOTH EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS

AND/OR

DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX.

ON AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS NATIONWIDE

SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION (THE 

FOSAMAX

MDL) FOR COORDINATED

PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL HAS BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE JOHN KEENAN IN THE

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW

YORK. AS A RESULT OF THE JPML ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 645 OF THE

CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE KEENAN. JUDGE KEENAN HAS ISSUED A CASE

MANAGEMENT ORDER (AND VARIOUS AMENDMENTS THERETO) SETTING FORTH

A SCHEDULE GOVERNING THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSED PRIMARILY

UPON RESOLVING THE CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS IN 2007

AND COMPLETING FACT DISCOVERY IN AN INITIAL GROUP OF 25 CASES BY

OCTOBER 1, 2008. BRIEFING AND ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS

MOTIONS FOR CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL MONITORING CLASSES WERE

COMPLETED IN 2007 AND JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING THE

MOTIONS ON JANUARY 3, 2008. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, JUDGE

KEENAN ISSUED A FURTHER ORDER DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE ALL

CLASS CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE FIRST FOUR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

FILED AGAINST MERCK THAT SOUGHT PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGES

AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING RELIEF ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS. IN OCTOBER

2008, JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER REQUIRING THAT

DAUBERT

MOTIONS BE FILED IN MAY 2009 AND SCHEDULING TRIALS IN THE

FIRST THREE CASES IN THE MDL FOR AUGUST 2009, OCTOBER 2009, AND

JANUARY 2010, RESPECTIVELY. A TRIAL IS SCHEDULED IN ALABAMA

STATE COURT LATER IN 2009.

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2008, AN APPLICATION WAS MADE BY THE

ATLANTIC COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY REQUESTING THAT ALL

OF THE

FOSAMAX

CASES PENDING IN NEW JERSEY BE CONSIDERED

FOR MASS TORT DESIGNATION AND CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT BEFORE ONE

JUDGE IN NEW JERSEY. ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT ORDERED THAT ALL PENDING AND FUTURE ACTIONS FILED

IN NEW JERSEY ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

AND

SEEKING DAMAGES FOR EXISTING DENTAL AND JAW-RELATED INJURIES,

INCLUDING OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, BUT NOT SOLELY SEEKING

MEDICAL MONITORING, BE DESIGNATED AS A MASS TORT FOR CENTRALIZED

MANAGEMENT PURPOSES BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE IN ATLANTIC COUNTY

SUPERIOR COURT. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME

COURTS ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 100 CASES WERE COORDINATED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE, WHO IS EXPECTED

TO BEGIN SETTING VARIOUS CASE MANAGEMENT DEADLINES DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

DISCOVERY IS ONGOING IN BOTH THE

FOSAMAX

MDL LITIGATION

AS WELL AS IN VARIOUS STATE COURT CASES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A REMAINING

RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. DURING

2008, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION AND ADDED

$40 MILLION TO ITS RESERVE. CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD A RESERVE OF

APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST

THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, THE COMPANY

IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE COMPLETION OF THE

FIRST THREE FEDERAL TRIALS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO

THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING

LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE

SOMETIMES USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE

TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO

FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS

PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND

ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH,

LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING

CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED THE

COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE

COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE

COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR

COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURT BROUGHT

INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

FIFTY OF THE COUNTY CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN NEW YORK

STATE COURT. THE COMPANY WAS DISMISSED FROM THE SUFFOLK COUNTY

CASE, WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE

FILED. IN ADDITION TO THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY WAS A DEFENDANT IN STATE

CASES BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF ELEVEN STATES,

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED. IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE KANSAS

ATTORNEY GENERAL FILED SUIT AGAINST MERCK AND SEVERAL OTHER

MANUFACTURERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ARIZONA

VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED MERCK FROM ITS CASE IN FEBRUARY 2009. THE

COURT IN THE AWP CASES PENDING IN HAWAII LISTED MERCK AND OTHERS

TO BE SET FOR TRIAL IN MID-2010.

GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

THAT IT ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO SETTLE

FEDERAL AND STATE CIVIL CASES ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE

MEDICAID REBATE STATUTE, AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE FALSE

CLAIMS ACTS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS

AND SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES BETWEEN  1994 AND 2001. IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE SETTLEMENTS, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

MERCK ENTERED INTO A CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENT

(CIA) WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL (HHS-OIG) FOR A

FIVE-YEAR TERM. THE CIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT MERCK

MAINTAIN ITS ETHICS TRAINING PROGRAM AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

GOVERNING PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES AND MEDICAID PRICE REPORTING.

FURTHER, AS REQUIRED BY THE CIA, MERCK HAS RETAINED AN

INDEPENDENT REVIEW ORGANIZATION (IRO) TO CONDUCT A

SYSTEMS REVIEW OF ITS PROMOTIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND TO

CONDUCT, ON A SAMPLE BASIS, TRANSACTIONAL REVIEWS OF

MERCKS PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS AND CERTAIN MEDICAID PRICING

CALCULATIONS. MERCK IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTS

AND CERTIFICATIONS TO THE HHS-OIG REGARDING ITS COMPLIANCE WITH

THE CIA. THE IRO IS CURRENTLY  CONDUCTING THE REQUIRED REVIEWS.

MERCK IS SCHEDULED TO SUBMIT ITS FIRST ANNUAL REPORT TO THE

HHS-OIG IN MAY 2009.

VYTORIN/ZETIA

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY AND ITS JOINT VENTURE

PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

ADDRESSED TO BOTH COMPANIES FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY

AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS

(O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE

SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF

WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF

ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND

PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY

CORPORATE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE AUGUST 2008, THE

COMPANIES HAVE RECEIVED THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM O&I,

INCLUDING ONE DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING CERTAIN

INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL. AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANIES HAVE EACH RECEIVED SUBPOENAS

FROM THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OFFICES

AND A LETTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING

SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED FIVE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CIDS)

FROM A MULTISTATE GROUP OF 35 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO ARE

JOINTLY INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANIES VIOLATED STATE

CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VYTORIN

. FINALLY,

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CIVIL

DIVISION OF THE DOJ INFORMING IT THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING

WHETHER THE COMPANIES CONDUCT RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL

HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE

INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO

THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR

BEEN SERVED WITH APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

ALLEGING COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. CERTAIN OF THOSE LAWSUITS

ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURIES

AND/OR

SEEK

MEDICAL MONITORING. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED IN OR

TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT, ARE COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT

COURT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE DENNIS M. CAVANAUGH.

THE PARTIES ARE PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN MOTIONS PRACTICE AND

BRIEFING.

ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 3, 2008, A MERCK

SHAREHOLDER FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL

COURT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING THAT

MERCK AND ITS CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

RICHARD T. CLARK, VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. THIS

SUIT HAS SINCE BEEN WITHDRAWN AND

RE-FILED

IN

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH

ANOTHER FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT UNDER THE CAPTION IN RE

MERCK & CO., INC.

VYTORIN

SECURITIES

LITIGATION. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON

OCTOBER 6, 2008 AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS MERCK;

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC; AND CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANYS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, THE

COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT MERCK DELAYED RELEASING UNFAVORABLE

RESULTS OF A CLINICAL STUDY REGARDING THE EFFICACY OF

VYTORIN

AND THAT MERCK MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT

EXPECTED EARNINGS, KNOWING THAT ONCE THE RESULTS OF THE

VYTORIN

STUDY WERE RELEASED, SALES OF

VYTORIN

WOULD DECLINE AND MERCKS EARNINGS WOULD SUFFER. ON

APRIL 22, 2008, A MEMBER OF A MERCK ERISA PLAN FILED A

PUTATIVE

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ALLEGING THEY BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY

DUTIES UNDER ERISA. SINCE THAT TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER

SIMILAR ERISA LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE DISTRICT

OF NEW JERSEY, AND ALL OF THOSE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED

UNDER THE CAPTION IN RE MERCK & CO., INC.

VYTORIN

ERISA LITIGATION. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS

FILED ON FEBRUARY 5, 2009, AND NAMES AS DEFENDANTS MERCK

AND VARIOUS MEMBERS OF MERCKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES OF MERCKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE ERISA PLANS INVESTMENT IN

COMPANY STOCK WAS IMPRUDENT BECAUSE THE COMPANYS EARNINGS

ARE DEPENDENT ON THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF ITS CHOLESTEROL DRUG

VYTORIN

AND THAT DEFENDANTS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

THAT THE RESULTS OF A SCIENTIFIC STUDY WOULD CAUSE THE MEDICAL

COMMUNITY TO TURN TO LESS EXPENSIVE DRUGS FOR CHOLESTEROL

MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS REFERRED

TO IN THIS SECTION VIGOROUSLY. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING

FROM THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR THE CIVIL LITIGATION COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY

DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE

RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE

COMPANY IN 2007 TO RESOLVE CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

DELIVERED ANOTHER LETTER TO THE BOARD DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD

OR A SUBCOMMITTEE THEREOF COMMENCE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE

MATTERS RAISED BY VARIOUS CIVIL SUITS AND GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO

VYTORIN.

VACCINE

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL

AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE

UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G., HEPATITIS B

VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN

VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING

PEDIATRIC VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FALL OF

2001. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 230

THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS PENDING IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS A

DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE LAWSUITS ARE NOT

CURRENTLY ACTIVE. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE

MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING

THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE

ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY

HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO

THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC VACCINES. THERE ARE NO CASES CURRENTLY

SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL. THE COMPANY WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE

LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE

EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS

PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE

VACCINE ACT). THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON

FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR

VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE

VACCINE COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING

A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE PETITIONER

MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN

VACCINE COURT AND THEN TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A

CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT

TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE

COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE

PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 5,000 CASES

PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES

AND/OR

THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. NOT ALL

OF THE THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE VACCINE

COURT PROCEEDING ARE COMPANY VACCINES. THE COMPANY IS THE SOLE

SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE DOMESTICALLY. THE SPECIAL

MASTERS PRESIDING OVER THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD

HEARINGS IN THREE TEST CASES INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT THE

COMBINATION OF

M-M-R

II VACCINE AND THIMEROSAL IN

VACCINES CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. ON FEBRUARY 12,

2009, THE SPECIAL MASTERS ISSUED DECISIONS IN EACH OF THOSE

CASES, FINDING THAT THE THEORY WAS UNSUPPORTED BY VALID

SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THAT THE PETITIONERS IN THE THREE CASES

WERE THEREFORE NOT ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. THE SPECIAL MASTERS

HAVE HELD SIMILAR HEARINGS IN THREE DIFFERENT TEST CASES

INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES ALONE CAUSES

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. DECISIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED IN

THIS SECOND SET OF TEST CASES. THE SPECIAL MASTERS HAD

PREVIOUSLY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD SIMILAR HEARINGS

INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT

M-M-R

II ALONE CAUSES AUTISM

SPECTRUM DISORDERS, BUT THEY HAVE STATED THAT THEY NO LONGER

INTEND TO DO SO. THE VACCINE COURT HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS

TO

USE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THESE TEST CASE HEARINGS TO GUIDE

THE ADJUDICATION OF THE REMAINING AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER CASES.

PATENT

LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS FILE ANDAS WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC

FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

FOSAMAX,

NEXIUM, SINGULAIR

,

PRIMAXIN

AND

EMEND

PRIOR TO

THE EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS (AND ASTRAZENECAS IN

THE CASE OF

NEXIUM

) PATENTS CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, AN ANDA HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

ZETIA

PRIOR

TO THE EXPIRATION OF SCHERING-PLOUGHS PATENT CONCERNING

THAT PRODUCT. THE GENERIC COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY

INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, INVALIDITY AND

UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. THE COMPANY HAS FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING

ANDAS FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE (

FOSAMAX

),

MONTELUKAST (

SINGULAIR

), IMIPENEM/CILASTATIN

(

PRIMAXIN

) AND ASTRAZENECA AND THE COMPANY HAVE FILED

PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES

FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

).

ALSO, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE FILED A PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING

ANDAS FOR GENERIC EZETIMIBE (

ZETIA

). SIMILAR PATENT

CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE

VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO

MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS.

AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE

OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY

SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A

GENERIC COMPANY INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ZETIA

AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS

THAT ARE LISTED FOR

ZETIA

. MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH

MARKET

ZETIA

THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE, MSP SINGAPORE

COMPANY LLC. ON MARCH 22, 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH AND MSP

SINGAPORE COMPANY LLC FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST

GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC., USA AND ITS PARENT CORPORATION

(GLENMARK). THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA

APPROVAL OF GLENMARKS ANDA UNTIL OCTOBER 2010 OR UNTIL AN

ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

LETTER FROM RANBAXY LABORATORIES LTD. (RANBAXY)

STATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC

VERSION OF MERCKS

PRIMAXIN

(IMIPENEM/CILASTATIN).

THE LAWSUIT ASSERTED INFRINGEMENT ON MERCKS PATENT WHICH

IS DUE TO EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2009. IN JULY 2008, MERCK

AND RANBAXY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH RANBAXY

CAN BEGIN TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

IMIPENEM/CILASTATIN ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2009.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED

A NOTICE FROM TEVA, A GENERIC COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT HAD

FILED AN ANDA FOR MONTELUKAST AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE

U.S. PATENT THAT IS LISTED FOR

SINGULAIR

. ON

APRIL 2, 2007, THE COMPANY FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT

ACTION AGAINST TEVA. THE LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA

APPROVAL OF TEVAS ANDA UNTIL AUGUST 2009 OR UNTIL AN

ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. A

TRIAL IN THIS MATTER COMMENCED ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, DC FOUND THE

COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS

TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED ON THE COURT OF

APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

LOST MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2008. AS

A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS, THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

U.S. SALES. SIMILARLY, IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS

THE BASIC USE PATENT COVERING ALENDRONATE EXPIRED IN 2008 AND

GENERIC PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOLD.

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A

DECISION REFUSING TO BAR THE APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON

THE GROUNDS THAT MERCKS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS

LIKELY INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC

ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA IN JUNE 2005. IN JULY 2005,

MERCK WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX CORP.

(APOTEX) SEEKING DAMAGES FOR LOST SALES OF GENERIC

WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DUE TO THE PATENT PROCEEDING. IN OCTOBER

2008, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA ISSUED A DECISION AWARDING

APOTEX ITS LOST PROFITS FOR ITS GENERIC ALENDRONATE PRODUCT FOR

THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT IT WAS HELD OFF THE MARKET DUE TO

MERCKS LAWSUIT. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THIS DECISION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY APPEALED

THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT

RANBAXY HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA

CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA

SUED RANBAXY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ASTRAZENECA, MERCK AND RANBAXY HAVE

ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES THAT RANBAXY

WILL NOT BRING ITS GENERIC ESOMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT TO MARKET IN THE

UNITED STATES UNTIL MAY 27, 2014. THE COMPANY AND

ASTRAZENECA EACH RECEIVED A CID FROM THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL

TRADE COMMISSION (THE FTC) IN JULY 2008 REGARDING

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH RANBAXY. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THE FTC IN RESPONDING TO THIS CID.

THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN JANUARY 2006 THAT

IVAX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (IVAX), SUBSEQUENTLY

ACQUIRED BY TEVA, HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM.

THE ANDA CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

DR. REDDYS LABORATORIES (DR.

REDDYS) IN THE DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY BASED ON

DR. REDDYS FILING OF AN ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE

MAGNESIUM. A TRIAL HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 2010 WITH

RESPECT TO BOTH IVAXS AND DR. REDDYS ANDAS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN

DECEMBER 2008 THAT SANDOZ INC. (SANDOZ) HAD FILED AN

ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS

PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. IN

JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA SUED SANDOZ IN THE

DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY BASED ON SANDOZS FILING OF AN

IN JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE THAT AN ANDA WAS

FILED WITH THE FDA FOR APREPITANT WHICH CONTAINED A

PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGE TO PATENTS ON

EMEND

. THE

COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WITH THE NOTICE

TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN.

IN EUROPE, THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPANIES SEEKING

REGISTRATION FOR GENERIC LOSARTAN (THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOR

COZAAR

). THE COMPANY HAS PATENT RIGHTS TO LOSARTAN VIA

LICENSE FROM E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY (DU

PONT). THE COMPANY AND DU PONT HAVE FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS COMPANIES IN PORTUGAL,

SPAIN, NORWAY AND AUSTRIA.

OTHER

LITIGATION

IN FEBRUARY 2008, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMANDING THAT THE

BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO

RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY IN 2007 TO RESOLVE

CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH

SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO HEALTH), THE COMPANY AND

MEDCO HEALTH AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS, A SERIES

OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA (THE GRUER

CASES). THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A

NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER,

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS, HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. MEDCO

HEALTH AND THE COMPANY AGREED TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN

ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT COST AND DISTRACTION OF PROLONGED

LITIGATION. THE PROPOSED CLASS SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY

PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND

THE COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND

MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A TOTAL OF $42.5 MILLION,

AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES

OR TO CONTINUE CERTAIN SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD

OF FIVE YEARS. THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT

MEMBERS OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR

WHICH MEDCO HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME

SINCE DECEMBER 17, 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD HEARINGS

TO HEAR OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT

AND APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED

THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT

TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL

ONLY IF AND WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. CERTAIN CLASS

MEMBER PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN

THE SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH PLANS AND TWO

INDIVIDUALS REMAIN PENDING IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES HAVE ASSERTED CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS

WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR

SIMILAR TO THE CLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS

MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES. THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH ARE

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES.

THREE NOTICES OF APPEAL WERE FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT HEARD

ORAL ARGUMENT IN MAY 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE APPELLATE COURT

ISSUED A DECISION VACATING THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT

AND REMANDING THE CASES TO THE DISTRICT COURT TO ALLOW THE

DISTRICT COURT TO RESOLVE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. A

HEARING WAS HELD TO ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES IN FEBRUARY 2006. THE

DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A RULING IN AUGUST 2006 RESOLVING SUCH

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES IN FAVOR OF THE SETTLING PLAINTIFFS. THE

CLASS MEMBERS AND THE OTHER PARTY THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEALED

THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT RENEWED THEIR APPEALS. IN

OCTOBER 2007, THE RENEWED APPEALS WERE AFFIRMED IN PART AND

VACATED IN PART BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS. THE APPEALS

COURT REMANDED THE CLASS SETTLEMENT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN

THE DISTRICT COURT.

THE DISTRICT COURT PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THE AMENDED SETTLEMENT

IN MAY 2008. HOWEVER, PLAINTIFFS THAT HAD INITIALLY OPTED OUT OF

THE SETTLEMENT CLASS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE SETTLEMENT. THE

DISTRICT COURT ORDERED BRIEFING ON THE OBJECTIONS AND HEARD

ARGUMENT IN OCTOBER 2008. THE DISTRICT COURT HAS NOT YET ISSUED

ITS RULING ON THOSE OBJECTIONS.

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS

DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING THREE PARAGRAPHS. THESE CASES ARE

BEING DEFENDED BY MEDCO HEALTH.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY,

WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS

ITEM, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE

EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR

WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED IN THIS ITEM.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE

OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS

OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE

GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY

TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP

COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF

CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE

RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE

COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO

SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE

MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET

BEEN DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME

OF MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE

AGENCIES OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY,

SUCH PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY

WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES

OF THE COMPANY. THE

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING

FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REDUCTION

FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM FORMER SITE

OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, APPROXIMATELY 2,200 PLAINTIFFS HAVE

FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT AGAINST MERCK AND 12 OTHER DEFENDANTS

IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE RESOURCE

CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT, AS WELL AS NEGLIGENCE AND

NUISANCE. THE SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURY, DIMINUTION

OF PROPERTY VALUE, MEDICAL MONITORING AND OTHER ALLEGED REAL AND

PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH GROUNDWATER AND SOIL

CONTAMINATION FOUND AT THE SITE OF A FORMER MERCK SUBSIDIARY IN

MERCED, CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST

THESE CLAIMS.

OPERATIONS.

DESCRIPTION

OF MERCKS BUSINESS

MERCK IS A GLOBAL RESEARCH-DRIVEN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT

DISCOVERS, DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY MANAGED ON A PRODUCTS

BASIS AND ARE COMPRISED OF TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND THE VACCINES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES

SEGMENT. THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT INCLUDES HUMAN HEALTH

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY BY MERCK OR

THROUGH JOINT VENTURES. THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC

AND PREVENTIVE AGENTS, SOLD BY PRESCRIPTION, FOR THE TREATMENT

OF HUMAN DISORDERS. MERCK SELLS THESE HUMAN HEALTH

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND

RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS,

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THE VACCINES

AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENT INCLUDES HUMAN HEALTH VACCINE

AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY BY

MERCK OR, IN THE CASE OF VACCINES, ALSO THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE.

VACCINE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF PREVENTATIVE PEDIATRIC, ADOLESCENT

AND ADULT VACCINES, PRIMARILY ADMINISTERED AT PHYSICIAN OFFICES.

MERCK SELLS THESE HUMAN HEALTH VACCINES PRIMARILY TO PHYSICIANS,

WHOLESALERS, PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR

THE TREATMENT OF INFECTION SOLD PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS

AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THE

COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE

EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF ITS PHARMACEUTICAL AND

VACCINE PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE

PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

OVERVIEW

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO ADDRESS BUSINESS

CHALLENGES IN THE MIDST OF AN EVOLVING PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

ENVIRONMENT. REVENUE DECLINED BY 1% IN 2008 DRIVEN LARGELY BY

LOWER SALES OF

FOSAMAX

FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION

OF OSTEOPOROSIS.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

LOST

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FORMULATIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND APRIL 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND

AS A RESULT THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

SALES IN THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE

FOSAMAX

FRANCHISE.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE WERE LOWER SALES OF

ZOCOR,

THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL WHICH

LOST U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN 2006. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE

DECLINES WERE HIGHER SALES OF

JANUVIA

AND

JANUMET

FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND

ISENTRESS,

AN ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV INFECTION.

TO ADDRESS THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY CHALLENGES THAT MERCK

FACES, THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION AND CUSTOMER

VALUE IN ORDER TO DRIVE THE GROWTH OF ITS BUSINESS AND HELP

POSITION MERCK FOR FUTURE SUCCESS.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH RE-ENGINEERING

ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, THE

ROLL-OUT OF A NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL AND THE CONTINUATION OF

MERCKS SUPPLY STRATEGY. THESE ACTIVITIES SHOULD ENABLE THE

COMPANY TO OPTIMIZE ITS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND INVEST IN GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES, SUCH AS EMERGING MARKETS, MERCK BIOVENTURES AND

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.

MERCK CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE COMPANYS

SCIENTIFIC PORTFOLIO BOTH THROUGH INTERNAL PROGRAMS AND EXTERNAL

RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS. THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING

NOVEL,

BEST-IN-CLASS

OR FOLLOW-ON TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN PRIMARY CARE, SPECIALTY

CARE, AND HOSPITAL SETTINGS. ADDITIONALLY, MERCK RESEARCH

LABORATORIES IS PURSUING A PORTFOLIO OF TREATMENT MODALITIES

THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDES SMALL MOLECULES AND VACCINES, BUT ALSO

BIOLOGICS, PEPTIDES AND RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI).

FURTHER, MERCK IS MOVING TO DIVERSIFY ITS PORTFOLIO BY CREATING

A NEW DIVISION, MERCK BIOVENTURES, WHICH LEVERAGES A UNIQUE

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM FOR BOTH FOLLOW-ON AND NOVEL BIOLOGICS.

THE COMPANY HAS NUMEROUS ACTIVE CLINICAL PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

COMPANYS MAJOR RESEARCH FRANCHISES: BONE, RESPIRATORY,

IMMUNOLOGY AND ENDOCRINE; CARDIOVASCULAR; DIABETES AND OBESITY;

INFECTIOUS DISEASES; NEUROSCIENCE; ONCOLOGY AND VACCINES. THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NINE CANDIDATES IN PHASE III CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATES SUBMITTING TWO NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS

(NDA) WITH THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG

ADMINISTRATION (FDA) WITH RESPECT TO TWO OF THE

CANDIDATES IN 2009: MK-0974, TELCAGEPANT, AN INVESTIGATIONAL

COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINES, AND MK-7418,

ROLOFYLLINE, AN INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF

ACUTE HEART FAILURE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES

SUBMITTING AN NDA IN 2009 FOR MK-0653C, EZETIMIBE COMBINED WITH

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ATORVASTATIN, AN INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF

DYSLIPIDEMIA BEING DEVELOPED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINT

VENTURE. ALSO, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES REGULATORY ACTION IN 2009

ON TWO SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA.

ONE FOR

GARDASIL

, MERCKS HPV VACCINE, FOR USE IN

MALES; AND ONE FOR

ISENTRESS

, A

FIRST-IN-CLASS

INTEGRASE INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1 INFECTION, FOR AN

EXPANDED INDICATION FOR USE IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS.

ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE, THE COMPANY IS ROLLING OUT A MORE

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC SELLING MODEL THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, HELP BUILD TRUST WITH CUSTOMERS, AND

IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE STRATEGY EMPLOYS THE USE OF NEW

MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES TO COMPLEMENT A NEW, MORE

CUSTOMER-CENTERED APPROACH; AND MOVES AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL

FREQUENCY-BASED SALES AND MARKETING APPROACH; IT ALSO CREATES

EFFICIENCIES BY ELIMINATING REDUNDANCIES IN CORE FUNCTIONS AND

ACROSS THE SALES ORGANIZATION.

ON THE MANUFACTURING SIDE, MERCK HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE IT BEGAN RE-ENGINEERING TO CREATE A

LEAN, FLEXIBLE, COST-EFFECTIVE CAPABILITY. THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO ADDRESS ITS MANUFACTURING ISSUES AND IT IS WORKING TO BUILD

ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN VACCINES AND BIOLOGICS, AS WELL AS TO

SUPPORT MERCKS EXPANSION INTO EMERGING MARKETS. TO ASSIST

THIS GOAL, THE COMPANY IS SHIFTING INVESTMENTS FROM DEVELOPED

MARKETS INTO EMERGING MARKETS COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE AND

STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE OPPORTUNITY.

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM (THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM) TO REDUCE

ITS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MERCK IS ROLLING OUT A NEW,

MORE CUSTOMER-CENTRIC SELLING MODEL. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY

WILL MAKE GREATER USE OF OUTSIDE TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES,

CENTRALIZE COMMON SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AND

CONSOLIDATE AND STREAMLINE ITS OPERATIONS. MERCKS

MANUFACTURING DIVISION WILL FURTHER FOCUS ITS CAPABILITIES ON

CORE PRODUCTS AND OUTSOURCE NON-CORE MANUFACTURING. ALSO, MERCK

IS EXPANDING ITS ACCESS TO WORLDWIDE EXTERNAL SCIENCE THROUGH A

BASIC RESEARCH GLOBAL OPERATING STRATEGY, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE PIPELINE AND IS FOCUSED ON TRANSLATING

BASIC RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY INTO LATE-STAGE CLINICAL SUCCESS. TO

INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, BASIC RESEARCH OPERATIONS WILL

CONSOLIDATE WORK IN SUPPORT OF A GIVEN THERAPEUTIC AREA INTO ONE

OF FOUR LOCATIONS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF

RESEARCH FACILITIES AND RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF THREE BASIC

RESEARCH SITES LOCATED IN TSUKUBA, JAPAN; POMEZIA, ITALY; AND

SEATTLE BY THE END OF 2009. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,200

POSITIONS  6,800 ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND 400

VACANCIES  ACROSS ALL AREAS OF THE COMPANY WORLDWIDE

BY THE END OF 2011, APPROXIMATELY 1,750 OF WHICH THE COMPANY

ELIMINATED IN 2008. ABOUT 40% OF THE TOTAL REDUCTIONS WILL OCCUR

IN THE UNITED STATES. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM,

THE COMPANY IS STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT LAYERS BY REDUCING ITS

TOTAL NUMBER OF SENIOR AND MID-LEVEL EXECUTIVES GLOBALLY BY

APPROXIMATELY 25%. THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW

EMPLOYEES AS THE BUSINESS REQUIRES. THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2011 WITH THE

TOTAL PRETAX COSTS ESTIMATED TO BE $1.6 BILLION TO

$2.0 BILLION. IN 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED PRETAX

RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $921.3 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2008

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT TWO-THIRDS OF

THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS WILL RESULT IN FUTURE CASH OUTLAYS,

PRIMARILY FROM EMPLOYEE SEPARATION EXPENSE. APPROXIMATELY

ONE-THIRD OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH, RELATING

PRIMARILY TO THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF FACILITIES TO BE

CLOSED OR DIVESTED. MERCK EXPECTS THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

TO YIELD CUMULATIVE PRETAX SAVINGS OF $3.8 BILLION TO

$4.2 BILLION FROM 2008 TO 2013.

DURING 2008, IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH

ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP), THE COMPANY RECORDED AN

AGGREGATE PRETAX GAIN OF $2.2 BILLION WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET AND RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM AZLP

OF $2.6 BILLION. SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS) ASSUMING DILUTION

FOR 2008 WERE $3.64, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE GAIN ON

DISTRIBUTION FROM AZLP OF $0.66 PER SHARE AND RESTRUCTURING

COSTS OF $(0.44) PER SHARE. IN ADDITION, EPS IN 2008 REFLECTS

THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CERTAIN TAX ITEMS. ALL OF THESE ITEMS

ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMPETITION

AND THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT

THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS ARE

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS

TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE

ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS

BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER

2003. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING

ACCESS TO MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE

PRESERVING MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

INNOVATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES AND BY ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES.

THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED, AND MAY CONSIDER AGAIN,

PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENTS ROLE IN

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THESE PROPOSALS

MAY INCLUDE REMOVING THE CURRENT LEGAL PROHIBITION AGAINST THE

SECRETARY OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INTERVENING IN PRICE

NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT PROGRAM PLANS AND

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THEY MAY ALSO INCLUDE MANDATING THE

PAYMENT OF REBATES FOR SOME OR ALL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL

UTILIZATION IN MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT PLANS. IN ADDITION,

CONGRESS MAY AGAIN CONSIDER PROPOSALS TO ALLOW, UNDER CERTAIN

CONDITIONS, THE IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN ADDRESSING COST-CONTAINMENT PRESSURE, THE COMPANY HAS MADE A

CONTINUING EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES PROVIDE

VALUE TO PATIENTS AND THOSE WHO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE. IN

ADDITION, PRICING FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE COMPANYS PRODUCT

PORTFOLIO HAS ENCOURAGED GROWING USE OF ITS MEDICINES AND

MITIGATED THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IN DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS ENCUMBERED

BY GOVERNMENT COST-CONTAINMENT ACTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS WORKED

IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PAYERS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO ALLOCATE SCARCE

RESOURCES TO OPTIMIZE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES, LIMITING THE

POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON SALES

GROWTH AND ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE MEDICINES AND VACCINES, AND TO

SUPPORT THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO

BENEFIT PATIENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO IS WORKING WITH GOVERNMENTS

IN MANY EMERGING MARKETS IN EASTERN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA AND

ASIA TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO INCREASE THEIR INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH

AND THEREBY IMPROVE THEIR CITIZENS ACCESS TO MEDICINES. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, RECOGNIZING THE

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY, ARE

WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE

CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING MARKET DEREGULATION.

IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE RELATED POLICY DEBATE, THE EC LAUNCHED

THE HIGH LEVEL PHARMACEUTICAL FORUM (HLPF)

DURING THE PERIOD 2005 THROUGH 2008. THE INITIATIVE AIMED AT

IMPROVING THE PROSPECTS OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRY IN EUROPE AND THUS THE HEALTH PROSPECTS OF ALL PATIENTS

WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM INNOVATIVE THERAPIES. THROUGH AN ACTIVE

DIALOGUE AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (FROM

PAYERS TO PATIENTS), THIS INITIATIVE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO TACKLE

KEY POLICY ISSUES IN EUROPE: (I) PROMOTING GREATER PRICING

FLEXIBILITY FOR MEDICINES; (II) ENSURING THAT HEALTH

AUTHORITIES APPLY BEST PRACTICES FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE

RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICINES; AND (III) IMPROVING

GREATER ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS IN

EUROPE. THE COMPANY WAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE EC AND OTHER

STAKEHOLDERS AND WAS BROADLY IN AGREEMENT WITH THE

RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE HLPF.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE EC LAUNCHED A SECTOR INQUIRY IN THE

PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETS UNDER THE RULES OF EU COMPETITION LAW. AS

PART OF THIS INQUIRY, THE COMPANYS OFFICES IN GERMANY WERE

INSPECTED BY THE AUTHORITIES BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2008. THE

PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE EC WAS ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 28,

2008, IN WHICH THE EC STATED IT HAD CONFIRMED ITS ORIGINAL

HYPOTHESIS THAT COMPETITION IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR MAY BE

RESTRICTED OR DISTORTED, AS INDICATED BY A DECLINE IN INNOVATION

MEASURED BY THE NUMBER OF NOVEL MEDICINES REACHING THE MARKET,

AND BY ALLEGED INSTANCES OF DELAYED MARKET ENTRY OF GENERIC

MEDICINES. THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO THE

PRELIMINARY REPORT EXPIRED ON JANUARY 31, 2009, AND THE EC

HAS ISSUED FURTHER INQUIRIES IN RESPECT OF THE SUBJECT OF THE

INVESTIGATION. THE EC HAS NOT ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY OR ANY OF

ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL PRACTICES. THE

FINAL REPORT IS PLANNED FOR LATER IN 2009. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THE EC IN THIS SECTOR INQUIRY.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND

ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. THE

AFRICAN COMPREHENSIVE HIV/AIDS PARTNERSHIPS IN BOTSWANA, A

PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA, THE

BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION AND THE MERCK COMPANY

FOUNDATION/MERCK & CO., INC., IS SUPPORTING

BOTSWANAS RESPONSE TO HIV/AIDS THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE AND

SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO HIV PREVENTION, CARE, TREATMENT AND

SUPPORT.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO FURTHER CATALYZE ACCESS TO HIV MEDICINES IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES, UNDER PRICE REDUCTION GUIDELINES THAT THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED IN 2001, MERCK MAKES NO PROFIT ON THE SALE OF ITS

CURRENT HIV/AIDS MEDICINES IN THE WORLDS POOREST COUNTRIES

AND THOSE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC, AND OFFERS ITS HIV/AIDS

MEDICINES AT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PRICES TO MEDIUM-INCOME

COUNTRIES. IN FEBRUARY 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGAIN

REDUCED THE PRICE OF

STOCRIN

IN THE LEAST DEVELOPED

COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD AND THOSE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. BY

THE END OF 2008, APPROXIMATELY 725,000 PEOPLE LIVING WITH

HIV AND AIDS IN 125 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES WERE

ESTIMATED TO BE ON TREATMENT WITH ANTIRETROVIRAL REGIMENS

CONTAINING

CRIXIVAN, STOCRIN

OR ATRIPLA. THROUGH THESE

AND OTHER ACTIONS, MERCK IS WORKING INDEPENDENTLY AND WITH

PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS ALIKE TO FOCUS ON THE

MOST CRITICAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO MEDICINES IN THE DEVELOPING

WORLD: THE NEED FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCING, INCREASED

INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN

EDUCATION, TRAINING AND HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY IN

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

IN OCTOBER 2008, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT

ROTATEQ

HAS BEEN

AWARDED PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS BY THE WORLD HEALTH

ORGANIZATION (WHO). WHO PRE-QUALIFICATION ALLOWS FOR

EXPANDED ACCESS TO

ROTATEQ

AND PROVIDES A GREATER

OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PROTECT MILLIONS OF INFANTS FROM ROTAVIRUS

GASTROENTERITIS. BECAUSE

ROTATEQ

IS PRE-QUALIFIED BY THE

WHO, THE VACCINE IS ELIGIBLE FOR PROCUREMENT BY THE PAN AMERICAN

HEALTH ORGANIZATION, UNICEF AND OTHER UNITED NATIONS

AGENCIES FOR USE IN NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMS.

ROTATEQ

IS THE ONLY

READY-TO-USE

ORAL LIQUID ROTAVIRUS VACCINE TO RECEIVE WHO PRE-QUALIFICATION.

MERCK HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING

ROTATEQ

TO THE GLOBAL

ALLIANCE FOR VACCINES AND IMMUNIZATION-ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES AT

PRICES AT WHICH IT DOES NOT PROFIT.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS GLOBALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RECENTLY ENACTED

LAWS IN A MAJORITY OF U.S. STATES REQUIRING SECURITY BREACH

NOTIFICATION.

ALTHOUGH NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE AND OTHER

LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND ADVOCACY INITIATIVES, THE COMPANY IS

WELL POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING HEALTH CARE

ENVIRONMENT AND MARKET FORCES.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLDWIDE TREND TOWARD

COST-CONTAINMENT WILL CONTINUE, RESULTING IN ONGOING PRESSURES

ON HEALTH CARE BUDGETS. AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SUCCESSFULLY

LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS, CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH CARE DEBATES AND

MONITOR REFORMS, ITS NEW PRODUCTS, POLICIES AND STRATEGIES

SHOULD ENABLE IT TO MAINTAIN A STRONG POSITION IN THE CHANGING

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

ACQUISITIONS

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

NOVACARDIA, INC. (NOVACARDIA) FOR

$366.4 MILLION WHICH WAS PAID THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF MERCK

COMMON STOCK. NOVACARDIA IS A CLINICAL-STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL

COMPANY FOCUSED ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THIS ACQUISITION

ADDED ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418), NOVACARDIAS INVESTIGATIONAL

PHASE III COMPOUND FOR ACUTE HEART FAILURE, TO MERCKS

PIPELINE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $325.1 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH

ASSOCIATED WITH ROLOFYLLINE AS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE,

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE CHARGE WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE

FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO THE

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ROLOFYLLINE CONTINUES AND THE COSTS HAVE

NOT BEEN AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA

THERAPEUTICS, INC. (SIRNA) FOR APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION. SIRNA IS A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS

DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES BASED ON RNAI TECHNOLOGY,

WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE

OF $466.2 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH

SIRNAS COMPOUNDS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, WHICH

RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS FOR BOTH THE HEPATITIS

B AND HEPATITIS C VIRUSES, WHICH WERE IN PRECLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS LICENSING AGREEMENTS HELD BY SIRNA. THE

CHARGE WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY

WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

CONTINUES AND THE COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES. THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA HAS INCREASED MERCKS

ABILITY TO USE RNAI TECHNOLOGY TO TURN OFF A TARGETED GENE IN A

HUMAN CELL, POTENTIALLY RENDERING INOPERATIVE A GENE RESPONSIBLE

FOR TRIGGERING A SPECIFIC DISEASE.

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN JUNE 2006, MERCK ACQUIRED GLYCOFI, INC. (GLYCOFI)

A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE FIELD OF YEAST

GLYCOENGINEERING, WHICH IS THE ADDITION OF SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE

MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROTEINS IN YEAST, AND OPTIMIZATION OF

BIOLOGIC DRUG MOLECULES, FOR $373 MILLION IN CASH

($400 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE NET OF $25 MILLION OF

SHARES ALREADY OWNED AND NET TRANSACTION COSTS). THE COMPANY

RECORDED A $296.3 MILLION CHARGE FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION WHICH WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX

PURPOSES. IN MAY 2006, MERCK ACQUIRED ABMAXIS, INC.

(ABMAXIS) A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

DEDICATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND OPTIMIZATION OF MONOCLONAL

ANTIBODY PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN THERAPEUTICS AND DIAGNOSTICS, FOR

$80 MILLION IN CASH. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE

PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO AN INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATING TO

ABMAXIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. WHILE EACH OF THE

ACQUISITIONS HAS INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC MERITS, THE COMBINATION

OF THE GLYCOFI AND ABMAXIS PLATFORMS IS POTENTIALLY SYNERGISTIC,

GIVING MERCK THE ABILITY TO OPERATE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM

OF THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODY DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND

COMMERCIALIZATION.

SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE ACQUISITIONS.

OPERATING

RESULTS

SALES

WORLDWIDE SALES TOTALED $23.9 BILLION FOR 2008, A DECLINE

OF 1% COMPARED WITH 2007, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A 4% VOLUME

DECREASE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3% FAVORABLE EFFECT FROM FOREIGN

EXCHANGE. THE REVENUE DECLINE OVER 2007 LARGELY REFLECTS LOWER

SALES OF

FOSAMAX

FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF

OSTEOPOROSIS.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

LOST

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FORMULATIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND APRIL 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE WERE LOWER SALES OF

ZOCOR,

THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL WHICH

LOST U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN 2006, LOWER SALES OF

VASOTEC/VASERETIC

FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION

AND/OR

HEART

FAILURE WHICH LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN CERTAIN FOREIGN MARKETS

AND LOWER SALES OF CERTAIN VACCINES, INCLUDING HEPATITIS AND

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B (HIB) VACCINES.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE DECLINES WERE HIGHER SALES OF

JANUVIA

AND

JANUMET

FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2

ALLERGIC RHINITIS.

DOMESTIC SALES DECLINED 9% COMPARED WITH 2007, WHILE FOREIGN

SALES ROSE 10%. FOREIGN SALES REPRESENTED 44% OF TOTAL SALES IN

2008. THE DOMESTIC SALES DECLINE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER

SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D,

VACCINES AND

SINGULAIR

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES OF

JANUVIA, JANUMET

AND

ISENTRESS

. FOREIGN SALES

GROWTH REFLECTS THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

JANUVIA, JANUMET,

SINGULAIR, COZAAR/HYZAAR

AND

ISENTRESS,

PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF

VASOTEC/VASERETIC

AND

ZOCOR.

WORLDWIDE SALES FOR 2007 INCREASED 7% IN TOTAL COMPARED WITH

2006 REFLECTING A 4% VOLUME INCREASE, A 2% FAVORABLE EFFECT FROM

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND A LESS THAN 1% FAVORABLE EFFECT FROM PRICE

CHANGES. SALES GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GROWTH OF THE

COMPANYS VACCINES, INCLUDING

GARDASIL,

A VACCINE TO

HELP PREVENT CERVICAL, VULVAR AND VAGINAL CANCERS, PRECANCEROUS

OR DYSPLASTIC LESIONS, AND GENITAL WARTS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 6,

VARIVAX

, A VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT

CHICKENPOX,

ROTATEQ

AND

ZOSTAVAX

, A VACCINE TO

HELP PREVENT SHINGLES (HERPES ZOSTER). ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO

SALES GROWTH DURING THIS PERIOD WAS STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

SINGULAIR

, HIGHER SALES OF

JANUVIA

AND SALES OF

JANUMET

, AS WELL AS INCREASED SALES OF

COZAAR/HYZAAR

. SALES GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

SALES OF

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR

, A UROLOGY PRODUCT FOR

THE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC BENIGN PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT.

MERCKS U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

PROSCAR

EXPIRED IN JUNE 2006. ALSO OFFSETTING SALES GROWTH IN 2007

WERE LOWER REVENUES FROM THE COMPANYS RELATIONSHIP WITH

AZLP AND LOWER SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS

D.

FOREIGN SALES REPRESENTED 39% OF TOTAL SALES FOR 2007.

SEGMENT REVENUES

SALES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT DECLINED 1% IN 2008

PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN

FOSAMAX, ZOCOR

AND

VASOTEC/VASERETIC,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN

JANUVIA, JANUMET

AND

COZAAR/HYZAAR.

SALES OF THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT DECLINED 1% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER SALES OF

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR

POST PATENT

EXPIRATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN

SINGULAIR,

COZAAR/HYZAAR, JANUVIA

AND SALES OF

JANUMET.

WORLDWIDE SALES OF

SINGULAIR

GREW 2% REACHING

$4.3 BILLION IN 2008 AND ROSE 19% TO $4.3 BILLION IN

2007, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED DEMAND FOR ASTHMA AND SEASONAL

AND PERENNIAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS MEDICATIONS. SALES PERFORMANCE

IN 2008 BENEFITED FROM HIGHER SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING VOLUME GROWTH IN EUROPE AND JAPAN AND THE POSITIVE

EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE. SALES IN THE UNITED STATES DECLINED

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE SWITCH OF A COMPETING ALLERGIC

RHINITIS PRODUCT TO OVER-THE-COUNTER STATUS IN THE UNITED STATES

IN EARLY 2008, THE TIMING AND PUBLIC REACTION TO THE FDA EARLY

COMMUNICATION REGARDING A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF POST-MARKETING

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS WHICH CREATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE

MARKETPLACE, AND SMALLER SPRING AND FALL ALLERGY SEASONS.

SINGULAIR

CONTINUES TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PRESCRIBED

PRODUCT IN THE U.S. RESPIRATORY MARKET.

GLOBAL SALES OF

COZAAR

, AND ITS COMPANION AGENT

HYZAAR

(A COMBINATION OF

COZAAR

AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE),

INCREASED 6% TO $3.6 BILLION IN 2008 AND GREW 6% TO

$3.4 BILLION IN 2007. THE INCREASE IN 2008 WAS DRIVEN BY

STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

HYZAAR

IN JAPAN (MARKETED AS

PREMINENT

), AS WELL AS BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE.

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

ARE AMONG THE LEADING

MEDICINES IN THE ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKER CLASS.

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

WILL EACH LOSE PATENT PROTECTION

IN THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2010. THE COMPANY EXPECTS

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN U.S. SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS AFTER THAT

TIME.

WORLDWIDE SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

DECLINED 49% IN 2008 TO $1.6 BILLION AND DECREASED 3%

IN 2007 TO $3.0 BILLION. SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

FORMULATIONS OF THESE MEDICINES HAVE LOST U.S. MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY, THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

SALES IN THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE

FOSAMAX

FRANCHISE

AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS SUCH DECLINES TO CONTINUE.

GLOBAL SALES OF

JANUVIA

, MERCKS DIPEPTIDYL

PEPTIDASE-4 (DPP-4) INHIBITOR, WERE

$1.4 BILLION IN 2008, $667.5 MILLION IN 2007 AND

$42.9 MILLION IN 2006.

JANUVIA

WAS APPROVED BY THE

FDA IN OCTOBER 2006 AND BY THE EC IN MARCH 2007.

JANUVIA

CONTINUES TO BE THE SECOND LEADING BRANDED ORAL

ANTI-DIABETIC AGENT IN TERMS OF NEW PRESCRIPTION SHARE IN THE

UNITED STATES. DPP-4 INHIBITORS REPRESENT A CLASS OF

PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS THAT IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL IN

PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES BY ENHANCING A NATURAL BODY SYSTEM

CALLED THE INCRETIN SYSTEM, WHICH HELPS TO REGULATE GLUCOSE BY

AFFECTING THE BETA CELLS AND ALPHA CELLS IN THE PANCREAS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, NEW DATA PRESENTED AT THE 61ST ANNUAL

SCIENTIFIC MEETING OF THE GERONTOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

SHOWED

JANUVIA

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS

IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES AND WAS NOT ASSOCIATED

WITH HYPOGLYCEMIA (LOW BLOOD SUGAR). IN THIS STUDY OF

206 PATIENTS AGED 65 TO 96 YEARS, THERE

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WERE NO REPORTS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA IN EITHER THE

JANUVIA

OR

THE PLACEBO GROUPS. ADVANCED AGE CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISK OF

HYPOGLYCEMIA.

WORLDWIDE SALES OF

JANUMET

, MERCKS ORAL

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC AGENT THAT COMBINES SITAGLIPTIN (MERCKS

DPP-4 INHIBITOR,

JANUVIA)

WITH METFORMIN IN A SINGLE

TABLET TO TARGET ALL THREE KEY DEFECTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, WERE

$351.1 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED WITH $86.4 MILLION IN

2007.

JANUMET

, LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL

2007, WAS APPROVED, AS AN ADJUNCT TO DIET AND EXERCISE, TO

IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2

DIABETES WHO ARE NOT ADEQUATELY CONTROLLED ON METFORMIN OR

SITAGLIPTIN ALONE, OR IN PATIENTS ALREADY BEING TREATED WITH THE

COMBINATION OF SITAGLIPTIN AND METFORMIN. IN FEBRUARY 2008,

MERCK RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET

JANUMET

AS AN

INITIAL TREATMENT FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES WHEN TREATMENT WITH BOTH

SITAGLIPTIN AND METFORMIN IS APPROPRIATE. IN JULY 2008,

JANUMET

WAS APPROVED FOR MARKETING IN THE EU, ICELAND AND

NORWAY.

OTHER PRODUCTS EXPERIENCING GROWTH IN 2008 INCLUDE

MAXALT

TO TREAT ACUTE MIGRAINE PAIN,

EMEND

FOR THE

PREVENTION OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED AND POST-OPERATIVE NAUSEA AND

VOMITING,

ARCOXIA

FOR THE TREATMENT OF ARTHRITIS AND

PAIN, AND

PROPECIA

FOR MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS.

WORLDWIDE SALES OF

ZOCOR

DECLINED 25% IN 2008 AND 69% IN

2007.

ZOCOR

LOST U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN JUNE

2006 AND HAS ALSO LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN MANY INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH

DR. REDDYS LABORATORIES

(DR. REDDYS) THAT AUTHORIZED THE SALE OF

GENERIC SIMVASTATIN. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE

COMPANY WAS REIMBURSED ON A COST-PLUS BASIS BY

DR. REDDYS FOR SUPPLYING FINISHED GOODS AND RECEIVED

A SHARE OF THE NET PROFITS RECORDED BY DR. REDDYS. IN

2006, MERCK RECORDED $208.9 MILLION OF REVENUE ASSOCIATED

WITH THE DR. REDDYS ARRANGEMENT FOR SIMVASTATIN.

PROSCAR

LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN

JUNE 2006. MERCKS SALES OF

PROSCAR

DECLINED 21% IN

2008 AND 34% IN 2007. THE BASIC PATENT FOR

PROSCAR

ALSO

COVERS

PROPECIA

, HOWEVER,

PROPECIA

IS PROTECTED BY

ADDITIONAL PATENTS WHICH EXPIRE IN OCTOBER 2013.

THE PATENT THAT PROVIDED U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

COSOPT

AND

TRUSOPT

EXPIRED IN OCTOBER 2008 AND, AS

A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

U.S. SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS.

THE PATENT THAT PROVIDES U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

PRIMAXIN

EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2009. AFTER SUCH TIME, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S. SALES OF THIS

PRODUCT.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY DIVESTED ITS REMAINING OWNERSHIP OF

AGGRASTAT

IN FOREIGN MARKETS TO IROKO PHARMACEUTICALS.

ALSO DURING 2008, THE COMPANY AND AZLP ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT

WITH RANBAXY LABORATORIES LTD. (RANBAXY) TO SETTLE

PATENT LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

)

WHICH PROVIDES THAT RANBAXY WILL NOT BRING ITS GENERIC

ESOMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL

MAY 27, 2014. THE COMPANY FACES OTHER CHALLENGES WITH

RESPECT TO OUTSTANDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT MATTERS FOR

ESOMEPRAZOLE (SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS).

IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE COMPANY FORMALLY NOTIFIED THE EUROPEAN

MEDICINES AGENCY OF ITS DECISION TO WITHDRAW THE APPLICATION FOR

MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR VORINOSTAT, A HISTONE DEACETYLASE

INHIBITOR, FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED STAGE,

REFRATORY CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA (CTCL).

VORINOSTAT, WHICH IS MARKETED AS

ZOLINZA

IN THE UNITED

STATES, WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION BY THE EC FOR THE

TREATMENT OF CTCL IN 2004.

VACCINES

AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENT REVENUES

SALES OF THE VACCINES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENT WERE

$4.2 BILLION IN 2008, $4.3 BILLION IN 2007 AND

$2.2 BILLION IN 2006. THE DECLINE IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO LOWER SALES OF

GARDASIL

, HEPATITIS VACCINES, OTHER

VIRAL VACCINES, WHICH INCLUDE

VARIVAX, M-M-R

II AND

PROQUAD,

HIB VACCINES AND LOWER SALES OF

PRIMAXIN.

THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN

ISENTRESS,

ROTATEQ

AND

ZOSTAVAX

. THE INCREASE IN 2007 WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

GARDASIL

,

AS WELL AS BY

VARIVAX, ROTATEQ

AND

ZOSTAVA

X.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF VACCINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE

PRODUCTS INCLUDES TOTAL VACCINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE PRODUCT

SALES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE VACCINES AND

INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENT AND THE REMAINDER, REPRESENTING

SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS BY

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES,

ARE INCLUDED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEGMENT. THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT REFLECT SALES OF VACCINES SOLD IN

MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS THROUGH SANOFI PASTEUR MSD

(SPMSD), THE COMPANYS JOINT VENTURE WITH

SANOFI PASTEUR, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN EQUITY

INCOME FROM AFFILIATES (SEE SELECTED JOINT VENTURE AND

AFFILIATE INFORMATION BELOW). SUPPLY SALES TO SPMSD,

HOWEVER, ARE REFLECTED IN VACCINES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES

SEGMENT REVENUES.

WORLDWIDE SALES OF THE COMPANYS CERVICAL CANCER VACCINE

GARDASIL

, AS RECORDED BY MERCK, WERE $1.4 BILLION IN

2008, $1.5 BILLION IN 2007 AND $234.8 MILLION IN 2006.

GARDASIL

WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA IN JUNE 2006 AND IS THE

WORLDS TOP-SELLING HPV VACCINE AND ONLY HPV VACCINE

AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE

FDA APPROVED

GARDASIL

FOR THE PREVENTION OF VULVAR AND

VAGINAL CANCERS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 16 AND 18.

GARDASIL

CURRENTLY IS INDICATED FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN 9 THROUGH

26 YEARS OF AGE FOR THE PREVENTION OF CERVICAL, VULVAR AND

VAGINAL CANCERS, PRECANCEROUS OR DYSPLASTIC LESIONS, AND GENITAL

WARTS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND 18. SALES PERFORMANCE IN

2008 REFLECTS LOWER SALES DOMESTICALLY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

GROWTH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SALES GROWTH OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES WAS AIDED BY THE ADOPTION OF SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAMS

IN ALL CANADIAN PROVINCES. THE DECLINE IN THE UNITED STATES WAS

AFFECTED BY TWO FACTORS. FIRST, BECAUSE OF STRONG LAUNCH UPTAKE,

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE 11 TO 18 YEAR OLD ELIGIBLE

POPULATION HAS ALREADY BEEN VACCINATED. AS A RESULT, DESPITE

CONTINUED STRONG VACCINATION RATES IN THIS POPULATION, THE

NUMBER OF TOTAL VACCINATIONS HAS DECLINED. SECONDLY, THE NUMBER

OF TOTAL VACCINATIONS IN THE 19 TO 26 YEAR OLD AGE GROUP

HAS DECLINED AS COMPARED WITH 2007. SALES IN 2007 INCLUDE

INITIAL PURCHASES BY MANY STATES THROUGH THE U.S. CENTERS

FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) VACCINES

FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO CERTAIN THIRD

PARTY LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO

GARDASIL

(INCLUDING A CROSS-LICENSE AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH

GLAXOSMITHKLINE). AS A RESULT OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY

PAYS ROYALTIES ON WORLDWIDE

GARDASIL

SALES OF

APPROXIMATELY 24% TO 26% IN THE AGGREGATE, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN

MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS.

IN JANUARY 2009, THE FDA ISSUED A SECOND COMPLETE RESPONSE

LETTER REGARDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION

(SBLA) FOR THE USE OF

GARDASIL

IN WOMEN

AGES 27 THOUGH 45. THE AGENCY COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE

RESPONSE THAT MERCK PROVIDED IN JULY 2008 TO THE FDAS

FIRST COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER ISSUED IN JUNE 2008 AND HAS

RECOMMENDED THAT MERCK SUBMIT ADDITIONAL DATA WHEN THE

48 MONTH STUDY HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE INITIAL SBLA

INCLUDED DATA COLLECTED THROUGH AN AVERAGE OF 24 MONTHS

FROM ENROLLMENT INTO THE STUDY, WHICH IS WHEN THE NUMBER OF

PRE-SPECIFIED ENDPOINTS HAD BEEN MET. FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE

FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY, MERCK ANTICIPATES PROVIDING A

RESPONSE TO THE FDA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009. THE LETTER

DOES NOT AFFECT CURRENT INDICATIONS FOR

GARDASIL

IN

FEMALES AGES 9 THROUGH 26 NOR DOES THE LETTER RELATE TO THE

SBLA THAT WAS SUBMITTED IN DECEMBER 2008 FOR THE USE OF

GARDASIL

IN MALES.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, DATA PRESENTED AT THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH

ORGANIZATION ON GENITAL INFECTION AND NEOPLASIA INTERNATIONAL

MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONFERENCE SHOWED THAT

GARDASIL

PREVENTED 90% OF EXTERNAL GENITAL LESIONS CAUSED BY HPV

TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND 18 IN A PIVOTAL PHASE III STUDY IN MEN

AGED 16 TO 26. THESE ARE THE ONLY DATA EVALUATING EFFICACY OF

ANY HPV VACCINE IN PREVENTING DISEASE IN MALES. THE INITIAL

PLANNED ANALYSIS OF THIS STUDY, AN ANALYSIS OF MALE STUDY

PARTICIPANTS AGED 16 TO 26 WHO HAD NOT BEEN INFECTED WITH AT

LEAST ONE OF THE FOUR HPV TYPES BEFORE THE START OF THE STUDY

THROUGH ONE MONTH AFTER RECEIVING THEIR THIRD DOSE OF THE

VACCINE OR PLACEBO, HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THIS ANALYSIS WAS

PREDETERMINED IN THE STUDY PROTOCOL TO BE CONDUCTED AFTER AT

LEAST 32 CASES OF EXTERNAL GENITAL LESIONS WERE OBSERVED. THE

STUDY IS ONGOING, AND ADDITIONAL DATA WILL BE SUBMITTED TO

GLOBAL REGULATORY AGENCIES ONCE AVAILABLE. MERCK SUBMITTED AN

SBLA FOR

GARDASIL

IN DECEMBER 2008 WHICH HAS BEEN

ACCEPTED BY THE FDA FOR THE USE OF

GARDASIL

IN BOYS AND

MEN AGES 9 TO 26 FOR THE PREVENTION OF EXTERNAL GENITAL

LESIONS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND 18. OTHER REGULATORY

SUBMISSIONS AROUND THE WORLD WILL OCCUR AS PLANNED.

ROTATEQ

ACHIEVED WORLDWIDE SALES AS RECORDED BY MERCK OF

$664.5 MILLION IN 2008, $524.7 MILLION IN 2007 AND

$163.4 MILLION IN 2006. THE INCREASES IN 2008 AND 2007 WERE

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED UPTAKE IN THE UNITED STATES

AND SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES AROUND THE WORLD. THE FDA APPROVED

ROTATEQ

IN FEBRUARY 2006. SALES IN 2008 INCLUDED

PURCHASES OF $54 MILLION IN 2008 AND $78 MILLION IN

2007 TO SUPPORT THE CDC STOCKPILE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

DOMESTIC SALES IN 2009 WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE RECENT LAUNCH OF

A COMPETING PRODUCT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED AN ISSUE

RELATED TO THE BULK MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THE COMPANYS

VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS (VZV)-CONTAINING VACCINES.

THE COMPANY IS MANUFACTURING BULK VARICELLA AND IS PRODUCING

DOSES OF

VARIVAX

AND

ZOSTAVAX

. THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN

OTHER MARKETS TO INCREASE ITS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY FOR

VZV-CONTAINING VACCINES. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO ENSURE

ADEQUATE MARKET SUPPLY AND CONTINUED SUFFICIENT INVENTORY OF

VARIVAX

AND TO CLEAR BACK ORDERS

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND BUILD STABLE SUPPLY AND INVENTORY FOR

ZOSTAVAX.

PROQUAD

, ONE OF THE VZV-CONTAINING VACCINES, IS CURRENTLY

NOT AVAILABLE FOR ORDERING; HOWEVER, ORDERS HAVE BEEN

TRANSITIONED, AS APPROPRIATE, TO

M-M-R

II AND

VARIVAX

. TOTAL SALES AS RECORDED BY MERCK FOR

PROQUAD

WERE $9.5 MILLION IN 2008, $264.4 MILLION IN 2007

AND $234.8 MILLION IN 2006. MERCK ANTICIPATES THAT

PROQUAD

WILL NOT RETURN TO THE U.S. MARKET IN 2009.

MERCKS SALES OF

VARIVAX

WERE $924.6 MILLION IN

2008, $854.9 MILLION IN 2007 AND $327.9 MILLION IN

2006.

VARIVAX

IS THE ONLY VACCINE AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED

STATES TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST CHICKENPOX DUE TO THE

UNAVAILABILITY OF

PROQUAD

. IN 2007,

VARIVAX

BENEFITED FROM THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION

PRACTICES JUNE 2006 SECOND DOSE RECOMMENDATION. MERCKS

SALES OF

M-M-R

II WERE $334.4 MILLION IN 2008,

$227.8 MILLION IN 2007 AND $257.3 MILLION IN 2006.

SALES OF

VARIVAX

AND

M-M-R

II WERE AFFECTED BY THE

UNAVAILABILITY OF

PROQUAD

. COMBINED SALES OF

PROQUAD,

M-M-R

II AND

VARIVAX

DECLINED IN 2008 COMPARED WITH

2007.

SALES OF

ZOSTAVAX

RECORDED BY MERCK WERE

$312.4 MILLION IN 2008, $236.0 MILLION IN 2007 AND

$38.6 MILLION IN 2006. SALES IN 2008 AND 2007 WERE IMPACTED

BY BULK VACCINE SUPPLY ISSUES THAT CAUSED DELAYS IN THE

FULFILLMENT OF CUSTOMER ORDERS. THE COMPANY CLEARED THE MAJORITY

OF BACKORDERS IN DECEMBER 2008. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CLEAR

BACKORDERS THAT REMAINED AT THE END OF THE YEAR IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009 AND TO RETURN TO NORMAL SHIPPING TIMES IN

MID-2009. ONCE THE BACKORDERS ARE RESOLVED, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

TO HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLY TO MEET ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR

THE REMAINDER OF 2009. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES

LAUNCHING

ZOSTAVAX

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AFTER 2009.

ZOSTAVAX

WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA AS WELL AS BY REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES IN AUSTRALIA AND THE EU IN MAY 2006. THE VACCINE IS

THE FIRST AND ONLY MEDICAL OPTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF SHINGLES.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN WORKING TO RESOLVE MANUFACTURING ISSUES

RELATED TO ITS HIB-CONTAINING VACCINES,

PEDVAXHIB

AND

COMVAX

SINCE DECEMBER 2007. THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED THE

ORIGINAL ISSUE RELATED TO EQUIPMENT STERILIZATION, BUT HAS

IDENTIFIED OTHER UNRELATED MANUFACTURING PROCESS CHANGES THAT

WILL REQUIRE A REGULATORY FILING. MERCK ANTICIPATES THAT

PEDVAXHIB

AND

COMVAX

WILL RETURN TO THE

U.S. MARKET IN MID-TO-LATE 2009. TIMING OF PRODUCT

AVAILABILITY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS DEPENDENT UPON LOCAL

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

THE PEDIATRIC FORMULATION OF

VAQTA,

A VACCINE AGAINST

HEPATITIS A, BECAME AVAILABLE AGAIN IN DECEMBER OF 2008 AND THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE ADULT FORMULATION MAY BE AVAILABLE IN

THE SECOND HALF OF 2009. OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE

SUPPLY OF

VAQTA

IS LIMITED AND AVAILABILITY WILL VARY BY

REGION. IN ADDITION, DOSES OF THE ADULT AND DIALYSIS

FORMULATIONS OF THE COMPANYS HEPATITIS B VACCINE,

RECOMBIVAX HB

, WILL BE DEPLETED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2009 AFTER WHICH TIME THEY WILL BE UNAVAILABLE IN THE UNITED

STATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. THE PEDIATRIC/ADOLESCENT

FORMULATION OF

RECOMBIVAX HB

IS EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE

INTERMITTENT BACKORDERS IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGHOUT

2009. MERCK EXPECTS SUPPLIES OF THE PEDIATRIC/ADOLESCENT

FORMULATION OF

RECOMBIVAX HB

TO BE LIMITED THROUGHOUT

2009 AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO RETURN TO FULL SUPPLY OF

THE PEDIATRIC/ADOLESCENT FORMULATION OF

RECOMBIVAX HB

UNTIL SOME TIME IN 2010.

SALES OF

ISENTRESS

WERE $361.1 MILLION IN 2008 AND

$41.3 MILLION IN 2007. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE FDA GRANTED

ISENTRESS

ACCELERATED APPROVAL FOR USE IN COMBINATION

WITH OTHER ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1

INFECTION IN TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED ADULT PATIENTS WHO HAVE

EVIDENCE OF VIRAL REPLICATION AND HIV-1 STRAINS RESISTANT TO

MULTIPLE ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS.

ISENTRESS

IS THE FIRST

MEDICINE TO BE APPROVED IN THE CLASS OF ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS

CALLED INTEGRASE INHIBITORS.

ISENTRESS

WORKS BY

INHIBITING THE INSERTION OF HIV DNA INTO HUMAN DNA BY THE

INTEGRASE ENZYME. INHIBITING INTEGRASE FROM PERFORMING THIS

ESSENTIAL FUNCTION LIMITS THE ABILITY OF THE VIRUS TO REPLICATE

AND INFECT NEW CELLS. IN JANUARY 2009, THE FDA GRANTED

TRADITIONAL APPROVAL TO

ISENTRESS

FOLLOWING REVIEW OF THE

48 WEEK DATA FROM THE BENCHMRK 1 & 2 CLINICAL TRIALS.

MERCK IS ALSO CONDUCTING PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS OF

ISENTRESS

IN THE TREATMENT-NAÏVE (PREVIOUSLY

UNTREATED) HIV POPULATION. IN DECEMBER 2008, MERCK ANNOUNCED

THAT THE FDA HAD ACCEPTED THE SUPPLEMENTAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION

(SNDA) FILING FOR

ISENTRESS

TABLETS FOR

STANDARD REVIEW. THE COMPANY IS SEEKING U.S. MARKETING

APPROVAL OF

ISENTRESS

IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER HIV

MEDICINES FOR TREATMENT IN ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE PREVIOUSLY

UNTREATED (NAÏVE) FOR HIV. MERCK EXPECTS FDA ACTION IN JULY

2009.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, DATA ON SEVERAL PHASE III

ISENTRESS

STUDIES WERE PRESENTED AT THE 16TH CONFERENCE ON

RETROVIRUSES AND OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN MONTREAL, CANADA.

IN NEW SUBGROUP ANALYSES OF A PHASE III STUDY (STARTMRK)

THAT COMPARED

ISENTRESS

TO EFAVIRENZ (ONE OF THE LEADING

ANTIRETROVIRALS PRESCRIBED FOR PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED

(TREATMENT-NAÏVE) HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS),

ISENTRESS

WAS FOUND TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS EFAVIRENZ AT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUPPRESSING VIRAL LOAD AND PROVIDED IMPROVEMENTS IN IMMUNE

SYSTEM FUNCTION ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PATIENT

SUBPOPULATIONS THROUGH 48 WEEKS. THE USE OF

ISENTRESS

IN PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS IS AN

INVESTIGATIONAL USE OF THE DRUG. BOTH MEDICINES WERE TAKEN IN

COMBINATION WITH TENOFOVIR/EMTRICITABINE. IN ADDITION, RESULTS

FROM TWO PHASE III STUDIES (SWITCHMRK-1 AND -2) EVALUATING

THE EFFECT OF SWITCHING PATIENTS WHOSE HIV IS CONTROLLED ON A

LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR-BASED REGIMEN TO A REGIMEN CONTAINING

ISENTRESS

TABLETS SHOWED THAT

ISENTRESS

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES AND

NON-HDL-CHOLESTEROL. THE STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT

ISENTRESS

DID NOT DEMONSTRATE NON-INFERIOR VIROLOGIC EFFICACY AT

MAINTAINING VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION. AS A RESULT OF THE VIRAL

LOAD FINDINGS IN THESE TRIALS, MERCK DISCONTINUED THESE TWO

STUDIES.

OTHER VACCINES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENT PRODUCTS

EXPERIENCING GROWTH IN 2008 INCLUDE

INVANZ

FOR THE

TREATMENT OF INFECTION AND CANCIDAS, AN ANTI-FUNGAL PRODUCT.

IN 2008, THE FDA APPROVED AN EXPANDED LABEL FOR

CANCIDAS

,

WHICH MAKES IT THE FIRST AND ONLY ECHINOCANDIN THERAPY APPROVED

IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS

AGED THREE MONTHS TO 17 YEARS WITH INDICATED FUNGAL

INFECTIONS.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE FDA APPROVED

EMEND

(FOSAPREPITANT DIMEGLUMINE) FOR INJECTION, 115 MG, FOR

THE PREVENTION OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING.

EMEND

FOR INJECTION PROVIDES A NEW OPTION FOR DAY ONE, AS

A SUBSTITUTE FOR

EMEND

(125 MG) TAKEN ORALLY, AS

PART OF THE RECOMMENDED

THREE-DAY

REGIMEN. PRIOR TO THE FDA DECISION, THE EU ON JANUARY 11,

2008 GRANTED MARKETING APPROVAL FOR

EMEND

FOR INJECTION,

KNOWN AS

IVEMEND

IN THE EU, AN ACTION THAT APPLIES TO ALL

27 EU MEMBER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS NORWAY AND ICELAND.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NINE DRUG CANDIDATES IN PHASE III

DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATES MAKING NDA FILINGS WITH RESPECT TO

TWO OF THE CANDIDATES IN 2009 AS NOTED BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN 2009 FOR

MK-0653C, AN INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION COMBINING EZETIMIBE WITH

ATORVASTATIN FOR THE TREATMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA BEING DEVELOPED

BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINT VENTURE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA

IN 2009 FOR MK-7418, ROLOFYLLINE, A POTENTIAL

FIRST-IN-CLASS

SELECTIVE ADENOSINE A1 ANTAGONIST, WHICH IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL

DRUG BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE HEART FAILURE.

IN MARCH 2008, THE RESULTS OF A PHASE III PILOT

DOSE-RANGING STUDY OF PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED WITH ACUTE HEART

FAILURE SYNDROME AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT TREATED WITH ROLOFYLLINE

WERE PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC SESSION OF THE AMERICAN

COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY. ROLOFYLLINE ADMINISTERED WITH INTRAVENOUS

(IV) LOOP DIURETICS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED

DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH) AND PRESERVED RENAL FUNCTION

COMPARED TO TREATMENT WITH PLACEBO AND IV DIURETICS. IN

ADDITION, IN A POST-HOC ANALYSIS, TREATMENT WITH ROLOFYLLINE WAS

ASSOCIATED WITH A TREND TOWARDS REDUCED

60-DAY

MORTALITY OR HOSPITAL RE-ADMISSION FOR CARDIOVASCULAR OR RENAL

CAUSES. ROLOFYLLINE INCREASES RENAL BLOOD FLOW AND URINE

PRODUCTION BY BLOCKING ADENOSINE-MEDIATED VASOCONSTRICTION OF

THE AFFERENT ARTERIOLES OF THE KIDNEYS AND INHIBITING SALT AND

WATER REABSORPTION BY THE KIDNEY. IN THIS SMALL PILOT STUDY, THE

RATES OF ADVERSE EVENTS SEEN ACROSS TREATMENT GROUPS WERE

SIMILAR. THE CONFIRMATORY PHASE III STUDIES WITH

ROLOFYLLINE 30 MG ARE UNDERWAY.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE FILING AN NDA WITH THE

FDA IN 2009 FOR MK-0974, TELCAGEPANT, AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL

CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE RECEPTOR (CGRP)

ANTAGONIST, WHICH REPRESENTS A NEW MECHANISM FOR THE TREATMENT

OF MIGRAINE. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IN A

PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL TELCAGEPANT SIGNIFICANTLY RELIEVED

MODERATE-TO-SEVERE MIGRAINE ATTACKS, INCLUDING MIGRAINE PAIN AND

MIGRAINE-

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS, COMPARED TO PLACEBO. THE DATA WERE

PRESENTED IN LONDON, ENGLAND AT THE EUROPEAN HEADACHE/MIGRAINE

TRUST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS. THE REPORTED FINDINGS ARE

FROM A WORLDWIDE, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED

CLINICAL TRIAL IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MIGRAINE. ALSO IN

JUNE 2008, MERCK PRESENTED DATA AT THE AMERICAN HEADACHE SOCIETY

ANNUAL MEETING FROM A PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL WHICH SHOWED

TELCAGEPANT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED RELIEF OF MIGRAINE PAIN AND

MIGRAINE-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS TWO HOURS AFTER DOSING COMPARED TO

PLACEBO. IN ADDITION, THE EFFICACY RESULTS FOR TELCAGEPANT

300 MG WERE SIMILAR TO THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDED DOSE OF

ZOLMITRIPTAN, AN APPROVED MIGRAINE THERAPY, WITH A LOWER

INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH TELCAGEPANT IN THIS

STUDY. THIS TRIAL IS PART OF AN ONGOING PHASE III PROGRAM

EVALUATING TELCAGEPANT. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF SERIOUS ADVERSE

EVENTS IN THE TELCAGEPANT OR ZOLMITRIPTAN TREATMENT ARMS.

TELCAGEPANT IS AN ANTAGONIST OF THE RECEPTOR FOR CGRP, A POTENT

NEUROPEPTIDE THOUGHT TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE UNDERLYING

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MIGRAINE.

MK-8669, DEFOROLIMUS, IS A NOVEL MTOR (MAMMALIAN TARGET OF

RAPAMYCIN) INHIBITOR BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF

CANCER. THE DRUG CANDIDATE IS BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED AND

COMMERCIALIZED WITH ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., UNDER AN

AGREEMENT REACHED IN 2007. A PHASE III STUDY (SUCCEED) IN

PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC SOFT-TISSUE OR BONE SARCOMAS IS

UNDERWAY. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE FILING AN NDA WITH

THE FDA IN 2010.

MK-0431C COMBINES

JANUVIA

(SITAGLIPTIN) WITH

PIOGLITAZONE, ANOTHER TYPE 2 DIABETES THERAPY. THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN 2011.

V503 IS A NINE-VALENT HPV VACCINE IN DEVELOPMENT TO EXPAND

PROTECTION AGAINST CANCER-CAUSING HPV TYPES. THE PHASE III

CLINICAL PROGRAM IS UNDERWAY AND MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING A

BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION (BLA) WITH THE FDA IN

2012.

MK-0822, ODANACATIB, IS A HIGHLY SELECTIVE INHIBITOR OF THE

CATHEPSIN K ENZYME, WHICH IS BEING EVALUATED FOR THE TREATMENT

OF OSTEOPOROSIS. OSTEOPOROSIS IS A DISEASE WHICH REDUCES BONE

DENSITY AND STRENGTH AND RESULTS IN AN INCREASED RISK OF BONE

FRACTURES. THE CATHEPSIN K ENZYME IS BELIEVED TO PLAY A CENTRAL

ROLE IN OSTEOCLASTIC BONE RESORPTION, PARTICULARLY IN THE

DEGRADATION OF THE PROTEIN COMPONENT OF BONE. INHIBITION OF

CATHEPSIN K IS A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS

THAT DIFFERS FROM THOSE OF CURRENTLY APPROVED TREATMENTS. IN

SEPTEMBER 2008, TWO-YEAR DATA FROM A PHASE IIB STUDY OF

ODANACATIB WERE REPORTED AT THE 30TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE

AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH WHICH

DEMONSTRATED DOSE-DEPENDENT INCREASES IN BONE MINERAL DENSITY

(BMD) AT THE TOTAL HIP, LUMBAR SPINE AND FEMORAL

NECK FRACTURE SITES AND DECREASED INDICES OF BONE RESORPTION

COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH LOW BMD. THE

MULTI-CENTER, DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY

EVALUATED DOSES OF 3, 10, 25 OR 50 MG OF ODANACATIB

ADMINISTERED ORALLY, ONCE-WEEKLY AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE

TIMING OF MEALS OR THE PATIENTS PHYSICAL POSITION IN

POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH LOW BMD FOR 24 MONTHS. THE NUMBER

OF PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A DRUG-RELATED ADVERSE EXPERIENCE WAS

SIMILAR BETWEEN THE 50 MG ODANACATIB GROUP AND PLACEBO. THE

EFFECT OF ODANACATIB 50 MG ON VERTEBRAL, HIP AND

NON-VERTEBRAL FRACTURES IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN A LARGE,

GLOBAL PHASE III STUDY. MERCK CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE

FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN 2012.

MK-0524A IS A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES EXTENDED-RELEASE

(ER) NIACIN AND A NOVEL FLUSHING INHIBITOR,

LAROPIPRANT. MK-0524A HAS DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO LOWER

LDL-CHOLESTEROL (LDL-C OR BAD

CHOLESTEROL), RAISE HDL-CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C OR

GOOD CHOLESTEROL) AND LOWER TRIGLYCERIDES WITH

SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FLUSHING THAN TRADITIONAL EXTENDED RELEASE

NIACIN ALONE. HIGH LDL-C, LOW HDL-C AND ELEVATED TRIGLYCERIDES

ARE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES. IN

APRIL 2008, MERCK RECEIVED A NON-APPROVABLE ACTION LETTER FROM

THE FDA IN RESPONSE TO ITS NDA FOR MK-0524A. AT A MEETING TO THE

DISCUSS THE LETTER, THE FDA STATED THAT ADDITIONAL EFFICACY AND

SAFETY DATA WERE REQUIRED AND SUGGESTED THAT THE COMPANY WAIT

FOR THE RESULTS OF THE TREATMENT OF HDL TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE

OF VASCULAR EVENTS (HPS2-THRIVE) CARDIOVASCULAR

OUTCOMES STUDY, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN JANUARY

2012. MERCK ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA FOR MK-0524A

IN 2012. IN JULY 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT

TREDAPTIVE

(ALSO KNOWN AS MK-0524A) WAS APPROVED FOR MARKETING IN THE

27 COUNTRIES OF THE EU, ICELAND AND NORWAY.

TREDAPTIVE

IS

APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA, PARTICULARLY IN

PATIENTS WITH COMBINED MIXED DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHARACTERIZED BY

ELEVATED LEVELS OF LDL-C AND TRIGLYCERIDES AND LOW HDL-C) AND IN

PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (HETEROZYGOUS

FAMILIAL AND NON-FAMILIAL).

TREDAPTIVE

SHOULD BE USED IN

PATIENTS IN COMBINATION WITH STATINS, WHEN THE CHOLESTEROL

LOWERING

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFECTS OF STATIN MONOTHERAPY IS INADEQUATE.

TREDAPTIVE

CAN BE USED AS MONOTHERAPY ONLY IN PATIENTS IN WHOM STATINS

ARE CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE OR NOT TOLERATED. THE LAUNCH OF

TREDAPTIVE

IN EUROPE AND OTHER MARKETS HAS BEEN DELAYED

DUE TO A MANUFACTURING-RELATED ISSUE. MERCK IS COMMITTED TO

QUICKLY RESOLVING THE ISSUE AND TO MAKING

TREDAPTIVE

AVAILABLE IN EUROPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN OTHER COUNTRIES

AROUND THE WORLD, MERCK CONTINUES TO PURSUE REGULATORY APPROVALS

FOR MK-0524A.

MK-0524B IS A DRUG CANDIDATE THAT COMBINES THE NOVEL APPROACH TO

RAISING HDL-C AND LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES FROM ER NIACIN COMBINED

WITH LAROPIPRANT WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF SIMVASTATIN IN ONE

COMBINATION PRODUCT. MERCK WILL NOT SEEK APPROVAL FOR MK-0524B

IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL IT FILES ITS COMPLETE RESPONSE

RELATING TO MK-0524A.

MK-0859, ANACETRAPIB, IS AN INHIBITOR OF THE CHOLESTERYL ESTER

TRANSFER PROTEIN THAT HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN LIPID MANAGEMENT BY

RAISING HDL-C AND REDUCING LDL-C WITHOUT RAISING BLOOD PRESSURE.

A PHASE III STUDY WAS INITIATED IN 2008 AND ENROLLMENT IN A

CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES STUDY IS PLANNED TO BEGIN IN 2010. THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING AN NDA WITH THE FDA BEYOND 2014.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS COLLABORATION WITH

DYNAVAX TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (DYNAVAX) FOR THE

DEVELOPMENT OF V270, AN INVESTIGATIONAL HEPATITIS B VACCINE,

WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO IN 2007. IN OCTOBER 2008, MERCK AND

DYNAVAX RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE FDA REGARDING THE TWO

COMPANIES RESPONSE TO THE AGENCYS REQUEST FOR SAFETY

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE CLINICAL HOLD ON THE TWO

INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG (IND) APPLICATIONS FOR

V270. IN ISSUING THE CLINICAL HOLD IN MARCH 2008, THE FDA

REQUESTED A REVIEW OF CLINICAL AND SAFETY DATA INCLUDING ALL

AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT A SINGLE CASE OF WEGENERS

GRANULOMATOSIS, AN UNCOMMON DISEASE IN WHICH THE BLOOD VESSELS

ARE INFLAMED, REPORTED IN A PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL.

DYNAVAX AND MERCK HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED A RESPONSE TO THE FDA

IN SEPTEMBER 2008. IN ITS OCTOBER 2008 CORRESPONDENCE, THE FDA

ADVISED THE COMPANIES THAT THE BALANCE OF RISK VERSUS POTENTIAL

BENEFIT NO LONGER FAVORED CONTINUED CLINICAL EVALUATION OF V270

IN HEALTHY ADULTS AND CHILDREN.

IN OCTOBER 2008, MERCK ANNOUNCED IT WILL NOT SEEK REGULATORY

APPROVAL FOR TARANABANT, AN INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINE, TO TREAT

OBESITY AND HAS DISCONTINUED ITS PHASE III CLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR TARANABANT FOR OBESITY. AVAILABLE

PHASE III DATA SHOWED THAT BOTH EFFICACY AND ADVERSE EVENTS

WERE DOSE RELATED, WITH GREATER EFFICACY AND MORE ADVERSE EVENTS

IN THE HIGHER DOSES. THEREFORE, AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE

COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE OVERALL PROFILE OF TARANABANT DID

NOT SUPPORT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT FOR OBESITY.

MERCK CONTINUES TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON AUGMENTING ITS INTERNAL

EFFORTS BY CAPITALIZING ON GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL DRIVE

BOTH NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC

CATEGORIES, AS WELL AS EARLY-STAGE TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS.

MERCK IS ACTIVELY MONITORING THE LANDSCAPE FOR GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES THAT MEET THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC CRITERIA.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, MERCK ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH

INSMED INC. (INSMED) TO PURCHASE INSMEDS

PORTFOLIO OF FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES AND ITS

COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN BOULDER,

COLORADO. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL PAY

INSMED AN AGGREGATE OF $130 MILLION IN CASH TO ACQUIRE ALL

RIGHTS TO THE BOULDER FACILITIES AND INSMEDS PIPELINE OF

FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC CANDIDATES. INSMEDS FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS

PORTFOLIO INCLUDES TWO CLINICAL CANDIDATES: INS-19, AN

INVESTIGATIONAL RECOMBINANT GRANULOCYTE-COLONY STIMULATING

FACTOR (G-CSF) THAT WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ITS

ABILITY TO PREVENT INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING

CHEMOTHERAPY, AND INS-20, A PEGYLATED RECOMBINANT G-CSF DESIGNED

TO ALLOW FOR LESS FREQUENT DOSING. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR

INITIAL PAYMENTS OF UP TO $10 MILLION FOR INS-19 AND

INS-20. MERCK WILL PAY INSMED THE REMAINING BALANCE UPON CLOSING

OF THE TRANSACTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER MILESTONE OR ROYALTY

OBLIGATIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, MERCK AND JAPAN TOBACCO INC. (JT)

SIGNED A WORLDWIDE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP AND

COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305, AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL OSTEOANABOLIC

(BONE GROWTH STIMULATING) AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF

OSTEOPOROSIS. JTT-305 IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL CALCIUM SENSING

RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED BY JT IN

PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN JAPAN FOR ITS EFFECT ON

INCREASING BONE DENSITY AND IS IN PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS

OUTSIDE OF JAPAN. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MERCK GAINED

WORLDWIDE RIGHTS, EXCEPT FOR JAPAN,

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305 AND CERTAIN OTHER RELATED

COMPOUNDS. JT RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $85 MILLION,

WHICH THE COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE,

AND IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS UPON

ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF A DRUG CANDIDATE COVERED BY THE

AGREEMENT. JT WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ROYALTIES FROM

SALES OF ANY DRUG CANDIDATES THAT RECEIVE MARKETING APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL

AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MERCKS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS DESIGNED TO

INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS BY

PRIORITIZING THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESOURCES ON DISEASE AREAS OF UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, SCIENTIFIC

OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. MERCK IS MANAGING ITS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO ACROSS DIVERSE APPROACHES TO

DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT BY BALANCING INVESTMENTS APPROPRIATELY

ON NOVEL, INNOVATIVE TARGETS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A MAJOR

IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH, ON DEVELOPING

BEST-IN-CLASS

APPROACHES, AND ON DELIVERING MAXIMUM VALUE OF ITS NEW MEDICINES

AND VACCINES THROUGH NEW INDICATIONS AND NEW FORMULATIONS.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF MERCKS SCIENCE-BASED

DIVERSIFICATION IS BASED ON EXPANDING THE COMPANYS

PORTFOLIO OF MODALITIES TO INCLUDE NOT ONLY SMALL MOLECULES AND

VACCINES, BUT ALSO BIOLOGICS, PEPTIDES AND RNAI. FURTHER, MERCK

IS MOVING TO DIVERSIFY ITS PORTFOLIO BY CREATING A NEW DIVISION,

MERCK BIOVENTURES, WHICH LEVERAGES A UNIQUE PLATFORM FOR BOTH

FOLLOW-ON AND NOVEL BIOLOGICS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO

PURSUE APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A NEW MODEL FOR ITS

BASIC RESEARCH GLOBAL OPERATING STRATEGY. THE NEW MODEL WILL

ALIGN FRANCHISE AND FUNCTION THROUGH CLEAR ROLES AND

RESPONSIBILITIES, ALIGN RESOURCES WITH DISEASE AREA PRIORITIES

AND BALANCE CAPACITY ACROSS DISCOVERY PHASES AND ALLOW THE

COMPANY TO ACT UPON THOSE PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY

OF SUCCESS. ADDITIONALLY, THE STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE

COMPANYS ACCESS TO WORLDWIDE EXTERNAL SCIENCE AND

INCORPORATE EXTERNAL RESEARCH AS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE

COMPANYS EARLY DISCOVERY PIPELINE IN ORDER TO TRANSLATE

BASIC RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY INTO LATE-STAGE CLINICAL SUCCESS.

THE COMPANYS CLINICAL PIPELINE INCLUDES CANDIDATES IN

MULTIPLE DISEASE AREAS, INCLUDING ANEMIA, ATHEROSCLEROSIS,

CANCER, DIABETES, HEART FAILURE, HYPERTENSION, INFECTIOUS

DISEASES, MIGRAINE, NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, PSYCHIATRIC

DISEASES, OSTEOPOROSIS, PAIN, AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE. THE

COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS ITS INTERNAL RESEARCH WITH AN AGGRESSIVE

LICENSING AND EXTERNAL ALLIANCE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE ENTIRE

SPECTRUM OF COLLABORATIONS FROM EARLY RESEARCH TO LATE-STAGE

COMPOUNDS, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES. A CHART REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS CURRENT RESEARCH PIPELINE AS OF FEBRUARY 15,

2009 IS SET FORTH IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ABOVE.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE PURSUANT

TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

STATEMENT NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R), WHICH REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED

PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES BE EXPENSED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE

PERIOD BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS. TOTAL

PRETAX SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS $348.0 MILLION

IN 2008, $330.2 MILLION IN 2007 AND $312.5 MILLION IN

2006. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THERE WAS $444.1 MILLION

OF TOTAL PRETAX UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO

NONVESTED STOCK OPTION, RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AND PERFORMANCE

SHARE UNIT AWARDS WHICH WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE PERIOD OF 2.0 YEARS. FOR SEGMENT REPORTING,

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS ARE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES.

RESTRUCTURING

COSTS

RESTRUCTURING COSTS WERE $1.0 BILLION, $327.1 MILLION

AND $142.3 MILLION FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

OF THE RESTRUCTURING COSTS RECORDED IN 2008, $735.5 MILLION

RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM AND THE REMAINDER WERE

ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2005 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. IN 2008, 2007

AND 2006, MERCK INCURRED SEPARATION COSTS OF $957.3 MILLION

(OF WHICH $684.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM), $251.4 MILLION AND $113.7 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AS

WELL AS HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS THAT WERE PROBABLE AND COULD BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE COMPANY ELIMINATED 5,800 POSITIONS IN

2008 (OF WHICH 1,750 RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM),

2,400 POSITIONS IN 2007 AND 3,700 POSITIONS IN 2006. THESE

POSITION ELIMINATIONS ARE COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT

POSITIONS. ALSO INCLUDED IN RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE CURTAILMENT,

SETTLEMENT AND TERMINATION CHARGES ON THE

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

AND SHUTDOWN COSTS. FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, RESTRUCTURING COSTS

ARE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES.

EQUITY

INCOME FROM AFFILIATES

EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES REFLECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANYS JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS. IN 2008, THE

DECLINE IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES REFLECTS DECREASED

EQUITY INCOME FROM THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP AND

LOWER PARTNERSHIP RETURNS FROM AZLP, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

EQUITY INCOME FROM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL) AND

SPMSD. THE DECREASE IN EQUITY INCOME FROM THE

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINT VENTURE IS THE RESULT OF LOWER

REVENUES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

FOLLOWING THE

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE ENHANCE AND SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS. IN

ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE TERMINATION OF THE RESPIRATORY

JOINT VENTURE, THE COMPANY WAS OBLIGATED TO SCHERING-PLOUGH

CORPORATION (SCHERING-PLOUGH) IN THE AMOUNT OF

$105 MILLION AS SPECIFIED IN THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS.

THIS RESULTED IN A CHARGE OF $43 MILLION IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2008 WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES. THE REMAINING AMOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE

REMAINING PATENT LIFE OF

ZETIA

THROUGH 2016. THE LOWER

PARTNERSHIP RETURNS FROM AZLP ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

FIRST QUARTER 2008 PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF MERCKS INTEREST

IN CERTAIN AZLP PRODUCT RIGHTS, WHICH RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF

THE PRIORITY RETURN AND THE VARIABLE RETURNS WHICH WERE BASED,

IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS.

THE HIGHER EQUITY INCOME FROM MERIAL PRIMARILY REFLECTS HIGHER

SALES OF BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

SPMSD IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SALES OF

GARDASIL

IN JOINT VENTURE TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2007 AND 2006, THE INCREASE IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES

PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

THROUGH THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PARTNERSHIP. SEE SELECTED JOINT VENTURE AND AFFILIATE

INFORMATION BELOW.

U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT CHARGE

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT

COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PLAINTIFFS

STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS

COUNSEL IN STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND

FEDERAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC

STROKE (IS) CLAIMS ALREADY FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY

IN THE UNITED STATES. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT , THE

COMPANY WILL PAY AN AGGREGATE FIXED AMOUNT OF $4.85 BILLION

INTO TWO FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS CONSISTING OF

$4.0 BILLION FOR QUALIFYING MI CLAIMS AND $850 MILLION

FOR QUALIFYING IS CLAIMS THAT ENTER INTO THE RESOLUTION PROCESS

(SETTLEMENT PROGRAM), OF WHICH $750 MILLION WAS

PAID INTO SUCH FUNDS IN 2008. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF

$4.85 BILLION IN 2007. (SEE NOTE 10 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

THE CHANGE IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET DURING 2008 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN AGGREGATE GAIN IN 2008 FROM AZLP OF

$2.2 BILLION (SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS), THE IMPACT OF A $671 MILLION CHARGE IN 2007

RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN CIVIL GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AND A 2008 GAIN OF $249 MILLION RELATED TO

THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS REMAINING WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO

AGGRASTAT

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $300 MILLION

EXPENSE IN 2008 FOR A CONTRIBUTION TO THE MERCK COMPANY

FOUNDATION, AN INCREASE IN EXCHANGE LOSSES OF $202 MILLION,

HIGHER RECOGNIZED LOSSES OF $153 MILLION, NET, IN THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND A $58 MILLION

CHARGE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO

WHETHER THE COMPANY VIOLATED CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WITH

RESPECT TO THE SALES AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX

(SEE

NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE

FLUCTUATION IN EXCHANGE LOSSES (GAINS) IN 2008 FROM 2007 IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER COST OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

DUE TO LOWER U.S. INTEREST RATES AND UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS OF

PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON

NET LONG OR NET SHORT FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS, CONSIDERING

BOTH NET MONETARY ASSETS AND RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS.

THE CHANGE IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET DURING 2007 AS

COMPARED WITH 2006 PRIMARILY REFLECTS A $671 MILLION CHARGE

IN 2007 RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN CIVIL GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

SEGMENT PROFITS ARE COMPRISED OF SEGMENT REVENUES LESS CERTAIN

ELEMENTS OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS AND OPERATING

EXPENSES, INCLUDING COMPONENTS OF EQUITY INCOME (LOSS) FROM

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING PRESENTED TO THE CHIEF OPERATING

DECISION MAKER, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOCATE THE VAST MAJORITY

OF INDIRECT PRODUCTION COSTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS WELL AS THE COST OF

FINANCING THESE ACTIVITIES. SEPARATE DIVISIONS MAINTAIN

RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING AND MANAGING THESE COSTS,

INCLUDING DEPRECIATION RELATED TO FIXED ASSETS UTILIZED BY THESE

DIVISIONS AND, THEREFORE, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN SEGMENT

PROFITS. ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE DETERMINATION OF SEGMENT PROFITS

ARE THE GAIN ON DISTRIBUTION FROM AZLP, THE U.S.

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT CHARGE, TAXES PAID AT THE JOINT VENTURE

LEVEL AND A PORTION OF EQUITY INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, SEGMENT

PROFITS DO NOT REFLECT OTHER EXPENSES FROM CORPORATE AND

OTHER IN THE ABOVE TABLE. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER ARE

MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE PROFITS, OPERATING PROFITS RELATED TO

DIVESTED PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES, OTHER SUPPLY SALES AND

ADJUSTMENTS TO ELIMINATE THE EFFECT OF DOUBLE COUNTING CERTAIN

ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE.

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT PROFITS DECREASED 8% IN 2008 LARGELY

DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D,

ZOCOR

AND DECREASED EQUITY INCOME FROM THE

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH JOINT VENTURE AND FROM AZLP.

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT PROFITS INCREASED 8% IN 2007 REFLECTING

HIGHER EQUITY INCOME, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE

OF THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE LOSS OF U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR.

VACCINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENT PROFITS INCREASED 7% IN

2008 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED SUCCESSFUL ROLLOUT OF

ISENTRESS

AND THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

ROTATEQ

,

AS WELL AS HIGHER EQUITY INCOME FROM SPMSD. VACCINE AND

INFECTIOUS DISEASES SEGMENT PROFITS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN 2007 AS

COMPARED WITH 2006 DRIVEN BY THE LAUNCH OF THREE NEW VACCINES IN

THE LATTER PART OF 2006 AND THE SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF

VARIVAX.

TAXES ON

INCOME

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 20.4% IN 2008,

2.8% IN 2007 AND 28.7% IN 2006. THE 2008 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

REFLECTS A NET FAVORABLE IMPACT AS COMPARED WITH THE STATUTORY

RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHICH INCLUDES

FAVORABLE IMPACTS RELATING TO TAX SETTLEMENTS THAT RESULTED IN A

REDUCTION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, THE REALIZATION OF

FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND THE FAVORABLE TAX IMPACT OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, PARTICULARLY

THE STRENGTHENING OF THE JAPANESE YEN AGAINST THE US DOLLAR,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT RESULTING FROM THE

AZLP GAIN BEING FULLY TAXABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AT A COMBINED

FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 36.3%. IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY DECIDED TO DISTRIBUTE CERTAIN PRIOR

YEARS FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE UNITED STATES WHICH WILL

RESULT IN A UTILIZATION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. THESE FOREIGN

TAX CREDITS AROSE AS A RESULT OF TAX PAYMENTS MADE OUTSIDE OF

THE UNITED STATES IN PRIOR YEARS THAT BECAME REALIZABLE IN THE

FIRST QUARTER BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE COMPANYS DECISION

TO DISTRIBUTE THESE FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE 2007 EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE REFLECTS THE REDUCTION OF DOMESTIC PRETAX INCOME PRIMARILY

RESULTING FROM THE U.S.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PARTNERSHIP

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH (COLLECTIVELY, THE

PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE

EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED

STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT

AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY

PROVIDE FOR EQUAL SHARING OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND FOR

CO-PROMOTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS BY EACH COMPANY. IN 2001, THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO

INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN

2002, EZETIMIBE, THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES

AS

ZETIA

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES). IN 2004, A COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

WAS APPROVED

IN THE UNITED STATES AS

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES).

VYTORIN

IS THE ONLY

COMBINATION TABLET CHOLESTEROL TREATMENT TO PROVIDE LDL

CHOLESTEROL LOWERING THROUGH THE DUAL INHIBITION OF CHOLESTEROL

PRODUCTION AND ABSORPTION.

THE CHOLESTEROL AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE SHARING OF OPERATING

INCOME GENERATED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL

PARTNERSHIP (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP) BASED UPON

PERCENTAGES THAT VARY BY PRODUCT, SALES LEVEL AND COUNTRY. IN

THE U.S. MARKET, THE PARTNERS SHARE PROFITS ON

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

SALES EQUALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

FIRST $300 MILLION OF ANNUAL

ZETIA

SALES, ON WHICH

SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVES A GREATER SHARE OF PROFITS. OPERATING

INCOME INCLUDES EXPENSES THAT THE PARTNERS HAVE CONTRACTUALLY

AGREED TO SHARE, SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANUFACTURING COSTS,

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED PROMOTION COSTS (INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND DIRECT AND IDENTIFIABLE

OUT-OF-POCKET PROMOTION) AND OTHER AGREED UPON COSTS FOR

SPECIFIC SERVICES SUCH AS ON-GOING CLINICAL RESEARCH, MARKET

SUPPORT, MARKET RESEARCH, MARKET EXPANSION, AS WELL AS A

SPECIALTY SALES FORCE AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. EXPENSES

INCURRED IN SUPPORT OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP BUT NOT SHARED

BETWEEN THE

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARTNERS, SUCH AS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

(INCLUDING CERTAIN SALES FORCE COSTS), AS WELL AS CERTAIN

MANUFACTURING COSTS, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES. HOWEVER, THESE COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE OVERALL

RESULTS OF THE COMPANY. CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY SHARED EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER

ADJUSTING FOR EARNED MILESTONES.

ZETIA

DECLINED IN

2008.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

THE RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE

SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS

IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA

(ENHANCE) CLINICAL TRIAL, AN IMAGING TRIAL IN

720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES VERY

HIGH LEVELS OF LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL AND GREATLY

INCREASES THE RISK FOR PREMATURE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN

10/80 MG (

VYTORIN

) SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL

BAD CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN SIMVASTATIN 80 MG

ALONE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT

WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE

PRE-SPECIFIED PRIMARY ENDPOINT, A CHANGE IN THE THICKNESS OF

CAROTID ARTERY WALLS OVER TWO YEARS AS MEASURED BY ULTRASOUND.

THERE ALSO WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT

WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ON THE FOUR

PRE-SPECIFIED KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: PERCENT OF PATIENTS

MANIFESTING REGRESSION IN THE AVERAGE CAROTID ARTERY

INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS (CA IMT); PROPORTION OF

PATIENTS DEVELOPING NEW CAROTID ARTERY PLAQUES >1.3 MM;

CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM CA IMT; AND CHANGES IN THE

AVERAGE CA IMT PLUS IN THE AVERAGE COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY IMT. IN

ENHANCE, WHEN COMPARED TO SIMVASTATIN ALONE,

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL BAD

CHOLESTEROL, AS WELL AS TRIGLYCERIDES AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN

(CRP). EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR

THE REDUCTION OF CRP. IN THE ENHANCE STUDY, THE OVERALL SAFETY

PROFILE OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN WAS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH

THE PRODUCT LABEL. THE ENHANCE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED NOR

POWERED TO EVALUATE CARDIOVASCULAR CLINICAL EVENTS. THE IMPROVED

REDUCTION IN HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS PRESENTING WITH ACUTE CORONARY

SYNDROME (IMPROVE-IT) TRIAL IS UNDERWAY AND IS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES DATA FOR

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME.

NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN ON

CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT

DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN MARCH

2008, THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE WERE REPORTED AT THE ANNUAL

SCIENTIFIC SESSION OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY.

ON JULY 21, 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE

SIMVASTATIN AND EZETIMIBE IN AORTIC STENOSIS (SEAS)

STUDY WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER

INTENSIVE LIPID LOWERING WITH

VYTORIN

10/40 MG

WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK

OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO IN

PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO

HAD NO INDICATION FOR STATIN THERAPY.

VYTORIN

FAILED TO

MEET ITS PRIMARY END POINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. THERE ALSO WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF AORTIC VALVE EVENTS; HOWEVER,

THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS TAKING

VYTORIN

COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF

ISCHEMIC CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS.

VYTORIN

IS NOT INDICATED

FOR THE TREATMENT OF AORTIC STENOSIS. NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF

VYTORIN

ON CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER

AND ABOVE THAT DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN

ESTABLISHED. IN THE STUDY, PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

10/40 MG HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF CANCER

THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO. THERE WAS ALSO A NONSIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM CANCER IN PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

VERSUS THOSE WHO TOOK PLACEBO. CANCER AND CANCER

DEATHS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL MAJOR ORGAN SYSTEMS. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THE CANCER FINDING IN SEAS IS LIKELY TO BE AN

ANOMALY THAT, TAKEN IN LIGHT OF ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, DOES NOT

SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION WITH

VYTORIN

. IN AUGUST 2008, THE

FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING THE RESULTS FROM THE

SEAS TRIAL. IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THE FDA ALSO CITED INTERIM

DATA FROM TWO LARGE ONGOING

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS OF

VYTORIN

 THE STUDY OF

HEART AND RENAL PROTECTION (SHARP) AND THE

IMPROVE-IT CLINICAL TRIALS  IN WHICH THERE WAS NO

INCREASED RISK OF CANCER WITH THE COMBINATION OF SIMVASTATIN

PLUS EZETIMIBE. THE SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN

2010. THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION AROUND

2012. THE FDA DETERMINED THAT, AS OF THAT TIME, THESE FINDINGS

IN THE SEAS TRIAL PLUS THE INTERIM DATA FROM ONGOING TRIALS

SHOULD NOT PROMPT PATIENTS TO STOP TAKING

VYTORIN

OR ANY

OTHER CHOLESTEROL LOWERING DRUG.

THE COMPANY, THROUGH THE MSP PARTNERSHIP, IS COMMITTED TO

WORKING WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE

AVAILABLE DATA AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE DATA; HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGES IN THE CLINICAL USE OF

VYTORIN

ARE WARRANTED.

THE RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AGREEMENTS PROVIDED FOR THE JOINT

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE

PARTNERS OF A ONCE-DAILY, FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING

THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE.

MONTELUKAST SODIUM, A LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IS SOLD

BY MERCK AS

SINGULAIR

AND LORATADINE, AN ANTIHISTAMINE,

IS SOLD BY SCHERING-PLOUGH AS CLARITIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

INDICATED FOR THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS.

DURING 2008, THE PARTNERS RECEIVED A NOT-APPROVABLE LETTER FROM

THE FDA FOR THE PROPOSED FIXED COMBINATION OF

LORATADINE/MONTELUKAST AND SUBSEQUENTLY ANNOUNCED THE WITHDRAWAL

OF THE NDA FOR THE COMBINATION TABLET. THE COMPANIES ALSO

TERMINATED THE RESPIRATORY JOINT VENTURE. THIS ACTION HAD NO

IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS OF THE CHOLESTEROL JOINT VENTURE. AS A

RESULT OF THE TERMINATION OF THE RESPIRATORY JOINT VENTURE, THE

COMPANY WAS OBLIGATED TO SCHERING-PLOUGH IN THE AMOUNT OF

$105 MILLION AS SPECIFIED IN THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS.

THIS RESULTED IN A CHARGE OF $43 MILLION DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2008 WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES. THE REMAINING AMOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE

REMAINING PATENT LIFE OF

ZETIA

THROUGH 2016.

THE RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE MSP

PARTNERSHIP ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES. MERCK

RECOGNIZED EQUITY INCOME OF $1.5 BILLION IN 2008,

$1.8 BILLION IN 2007 AND $1.2 BILLION IN 2006.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ARE INCLUDED IN

ITEM 15. (A) (2) FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULES BELOW.

ASTRAZENECA

LP

IN 1982, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRAS PRODUCTS

UNDER A ROYALTY-BEARING LICENSE. IN 1993, THE COMPANYS

TOTAL SALES OF ASTRA PRODUCTS REACHED A LEVEL THAT TRIGGERED THE

FIRST STEP IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT VENTURE BUSINESS

CARRIED ON BY ASTRA MERCK INC. (AMI), IN WHICH MERCK

AND ASTRA EACH OWNED A 50% SHARE. THIS JOINT VENTURE, FORMED IN

1994, DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW

PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING

PRILOSEC

, THE FIRST OF A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM

THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, MERCK AND ASTRA COMPLETED THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE

OWNERSHIP AND OPERATIONS OF THE JOINT VENTURE WHEREBY THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN AMI, RENAMED KBI INC.

(KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED KBIS OPERATING ASSETS

TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS

L.P. (THE PARTNERSHIP), IN EXCHANGE FOR A 1% LIMITED

PARTNER INTEREST. ASTRA CONTRIBUTED THE NET ASSETS OF ITS WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ASTRA USA, INC., TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN

EXCHANGE FOR A 99% GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP,

RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP) UPON ASTRAS 1999

MERGER WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC (THE ASTRAZENECA

MERGER), BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS

FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS.

WHILE MAINTAINING A 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN AZLP, MERCK

HAS CONSENT AND PROTECTIVE RIGHTS INTENDED TO PRESERVE ITS

BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

POWER OF THE GENERAL PARTNER TO MAKE CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS OR

DISPOSITIONS. FURTHERMORE, IN LIMITED EVENTS OF DEFAULT,

ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WILL BE GRANTED TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING

POWERS TO DIRECT THE ACTIONS OF, OR REMOVE AND REPLACE, THE

PARTNERSHIPS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER. MERCK EARNS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT

AND FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS AND SUCH REVENUE WAS $1.6 BILLION,

$1.7 BILLION AND $1.8 BILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM,

AS

WELL AS

PRILOSEC

. IN ADDITION, MERCK EARNS CERTAIN

PARTNERSHIP RETURNS, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES. SUCH RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR

IN THE PARTNERSHIP

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF

CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL

RETURN REPRESENTING MERCKS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED AZLP

GAAP EARNINGS. THESE RETURNS AGGREGATED $598.4 MILLION,

$820.1 MILLION AND $783.7 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER TRIGGERED A PARTIAL

REDEMPTION IN MARCH 2008 OF MERCKS INTEREST IN CERTAIN

AZLP PRODUCT RIGHTS. UPON THIS REDEMPTION, MERCK RECEIVED

$4.3 BILLION FROM AZLP. THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED PRIMARILY ON

A MULTIPLE OF MERCKS AVERAGE ANNUAL VARIABLE RETURNS

DERIVED FROM SALES OF THE FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS FOR

THE THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THE REDEMPTION (THE LIMITED

PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE). MERCK RECORDED A

$1.5 BILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE PARTIAL REDEMPTION IN 2008.

THE PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF MERCKS INTEREST IN THE PRODUCT

RIGHTS DID NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN MERCKS 1% LIMITED

PARTNER INTEREST.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, ASTRA PURCHASED AN

OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS DEFERRED INCOME, TO

BUY MERCKS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE

GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

(THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS). THE ASSET OPTION IS

EXERCISABLE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010 AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL

TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 OF PROJECTED

FUTURE PRETAX REVENUE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FROM THE

NON-PPI PRODUCTS (THE APPRAISED VALUE). MERCK ALSO

HAD THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008

AT THE APPRAISED VALUE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ADVISED

AZLP THAT IT WOULD NOT EXERCISE THE ASSET OPTION, THUS THE

$443.0 MILLION REMAINS DEFERRED. IN ADDITION, IN 1998, THE

COMPANY GRANTED ASTRA AN OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION)

TO BUY MERCKS COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI AND, THEREFORE,

MERCKS INTEREST IN

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

,

EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS EXERCISE OF THE ASSET

OPTION. ASTRA CAN ALSO EXERCISE THE SHARES OPTION IN 2017 OR IF

COMBINED ANNUAL SALES OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL BELOW A MINIMUM

AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG AS

ASTRAZENECAS ASSET OPTION HAS BEEN EXERCISED IN 2010. THE

EXERCISE PRICE FOR THE SHARES OPTION IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT

VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE, SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN

TRUE-UP

MECHANISMS.

THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER CONSTITUTED A TRIGGER EVENT UNDER THE KBI

RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN EXCHANGE

FOR MERCKS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA

PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT THE

TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4 MILLION (THE

ADVANCE PAYMENT). THE ADVANCE PAYMENT WAS DEFERRED

AS IT REMAINED SUBJECT TO A

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION (THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT) THAT WAS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE FAIR MARKET

VALUE IN MARCH 2008 OF THE ASTRA PRODUCT RIGHTS RETAINED BY THE

COMPANY. THE CALCULATED

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT OF $243.7 MILLION WAS RETURNED TO AZLP IN MARCH 2008

AND MERCK RECOGNIZED A PRETAX GAIN OF $723.7 MILLION

RELATED TO THE RESIDUAL ADVANCE PAYMENT BALANCE.

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS,

BECAUSE A TRIGGER EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE SUM OF THE LIMITED

PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE, THE APPRAISED VALUE AND THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT WAS GUARANTEED TO BE A MINIMUM OF $4.7 BILLION.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE LESS

PAYMENT OF THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT RESULTED IN CASH RECEIPTS TO MERCK OF $4.0 BILLION

AND AN AGGREGATE PRETAX GAIN OF $2.2 BILLION WHICH IS

INCLUDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. ASTRAZENECAS

PURCHASE OF MERCKS INTEREST IN THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS IS

CONTINGENT UPON THE EXERCISE OF THE ASSET OPTION BY ASTRAZENECA

IN 2010 AND, THEREFORE, PAYMENT OF THE APPRAISED VALUE MAY OR

MAY NOT OCCUR. ALSO, IN MARCH 2008, THE $1.38 BILLION

OUTSTANDING LOAN FROM ASTRA PLUS INTEREST THROUGH THE REDEMPTION

DATE WAS SETTLED. AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM AZLP OF $2.6 BILLION.

$2.1 BILLION RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH A PARTIAL

REDEMPTION OF THE COMPANYS PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN AZLP

DISCUSSED ABOVE, REPRESENTING A DISTRIBUTION OF THE

COMPANYS ACCUMULATED EARNINGS ON ITS INVESTMENT IN AZLP

SINCE INCEPTION. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2008

WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY A $675 MILLION PAYMENT MADE IN

CONNECTION WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED RESOLUTION OF

INVESTIGATIONS OF CIVIL CLAIMS BY FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES

RELATING TO CERTAIN PAST MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES AND

$750 MILLION OF PAYMENTS INTO THE

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT

FUNDS. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2007 REFLECTS

THE PAYMENT MADE UNDER A PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED SETTLEMENT WITH

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS).

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 WAS $1.8 BILLION

COMPARED WITH $2.8 BILLION IN 2007. THE LOWER USE OF CASH

BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTS A DISTRIBUTION FROM

AZLP IN 2008 REPRESENTING A RETURN OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT IN AZLP AND A $1.1 BILLION PAYMENT IN 2007 IN

CONNECTION WITH THE DECEMBER 2006 ACQUISITION OF SIRNA

THERAPEUTICS, INC., PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET PURCHASES OF

SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

AND AN INCREASE IN RESTRICTED ASSETS. CASH USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES WAS $5.5 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED WITH

$4.9 BILLION IN 2007 REFLECTING HIGHER PURCHASES OF

TREASURY STOCK, LOWER PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE STOCK OPTIONS

AND HIGHER PAYMENTS ON DEBT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF

A NOTE DUE TO ASTRA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET INCREASE IN

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE TOTAL OF WORLDWIDE CASH AND

INVESTMENTS WAS $12.0 BILLION, INCLUDING $5.5 BILLION

OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND

$6.5 BILLION OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY HAS $6.3 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS RESTRICTED

UNDER CERTAIN COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET THE

OPERATING REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY. THE INCREASE IN WORKING

CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET CASH RECEIPTS FROM

AZLP AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN SELECTED JOINT VENTURE AND

AFFILIATE INFORMATION. THE RATIOS OF TOTAL DEBT TO TOTAL

LIABILITIES AND EQUITY AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS TO TOTAL

DEBT REFLECT THE STRENGTH OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH

FLOWS AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO COVER ITS CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS.

IN AUGUST 2008, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A $4.1 BILLION LETTER

OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH

SATISFIED CERTAIN CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE COMPANY PLEDGED COLLATERAL TO THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OF APPROXIMATELY $5.1 BILLION

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT.

ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL IS SET BY

THE LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT AND SUCH ASSETS ARE HELD IN

CUSTODY BY A THIRD PARTY, THE ASSETS ARE

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE ASSETS PLEDGED

UNDER THE LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT TO BE RESTRICTED. AS A

RESULT, $2.1 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION OF CASH AND

INVESTMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLASSIFIED AS RESTRICTED CURRENT

ASSETS AND $1.6 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS

RESTRICTED NON-CURRENT ASSETS. THE LETTER OF CREDIT AMOUNT AND

REQUIRED COLLATERAL BALANCES WILL DECLINE AS PAYMENTS (AFTER THE

FIRST $750 MILLION) UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE

MADE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, $3.8 BILLION WAS

RECORDED WITHIN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS

AND $1.3 BILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS.

ADDITIONALLY, DURING 2008, THE COMPANY PAID $750 MILLION

INTO THE

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT FUNDS PURSUANT TO THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE IRS HAS COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION

OF THE COMPANYS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1993 TO 2001. AS

A RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION, THE COMPANY MADE AN AGGREGATE

PAYMENT OF $2.79 BILLION IN FEBRUARY 2007. THIS PAYMENT WAS

OFFSET BY (I) A TAX REFUND OF $165 MILLION RECEIVED IN

2007 FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID FOR THESE MATTERS AND

(II) A FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY

$360 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT,

RESULTING IN A NET CASH COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION IN 2007. THE IMPACT FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO

2001 FOR ITEMS REVIEWED AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION WAS INCLUDED

IN THE PAYMENT ALTHOUGH THOSE YEARS REMAIN OPEN IN ALL OTHER

RESPECTS. THE CLOSING OF THE IRS EXAMINATION DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

2007 AS THESE AMOUNTS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED FOR.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN OCTOBER 2006, THE CRA ISSUED THE

COMPANY A NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT CONTAINING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED

TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS. IN FEBRUARY 2009, MERCK

AND THE CRA NEGOTIATED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN REGARD TO THESE

MATTERS. THE SETTLEMENT CALLS FOR MERCK TO PAY ADDITIONAL TAX OF

APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) AND INTEREST

OF APPROXIMATELY $360 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) WITH NO

ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OR PENALTIES DUE ON THIS ASSESSMENT. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF

FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

(FIN 48)

,

THE SETTLEMENT WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2009. THE COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THESE

MATTERS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TAXES PAID IS EXPECTED TO

BE CREDITABLE FOR U.S. TAX PURPOSES. THE RESOLUTION OF

THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, OTHER THAN WITH

RESPECT TO THE ASSOCIATED COLLATERAL AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2008, THE CRA PROPOSED

ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS FOR 1999 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING

TO OTHER INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS. THE ADJUSTMENTS WOULD

INCREASE CANADIAN TAX DUE BY APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION

(U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS $240 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS)

OF INTEREST. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CRA WILL PROPOSE SIMILAR

ADJUSTMENTS FOR LATER YEARS. THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE

POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE CRA AND BELIEVES THEY ARE WITHOUT MERIT.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTEST THE ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE CRA

APPEALS PROCESS AND THE COURTS IF NECESSARY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS, DURING 2007, THE COMPANY

PLEDGED COLLATERAL TO TWO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ONE OF WHICH

PROVIDED A GUARANTEE TO THE CRA AND THE OTHER TO THE QUEBEC

MINISTRY OF REVENUE REPRESENTING A PORTION OF THE TAX AND

INTEREST ASSESSED. THE COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED INCOME

TAXES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$1.2 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE GUARANTEES WILL BE REDUCED AND

THE RELATED COLLATERAL RELEASED FOLLOWING PAYMENTS TO THE CRA

AND QUEBEC MINISTRY OF REVENUE, CAUSING THE RESTRICTED AMOUNTS

TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO CASH AND INVESTMENTS AS APPROPRIATE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE IRS IS EXAMINING THE COMPANYS 2002 TO 2005 FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN TAX

EXAMINATIONS ARE IN PROGRESS. TAX YEARS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO

EXAMINATION BY MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS INCLUDE GERMANY FROM

1999, ITALY FROM 2000 AND JAPAN FROM 2002.

INCLUDING $1.20 BILLION REFLECTED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY,

LARGELY REFLECTING AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE

CANADIAN REVENUE AGENCY AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. DUE TO THE HIGH

DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH

OUTFLOWS OF LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BEYOND ONE

YEAR, A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD OF CASH SETTLEMENT FOR

YEARS BEYOND 2009 CAN NOT BE MADE.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GOODS AND SERVICES

THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING AND INCLUDE OBLIGATIONS

FOR MINIMUM INVENTORY CONTRACTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

ADVERTISING. AMOUNTS REFLECTED FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OBLIGATIONS DO NOT INCLUDE CONTINGENT MILESTONE PAYMENTS. LOANS

PAYABLE AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ALSO REFLECTS

$322.2 MILLION OF LONG-DATED NOTES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

REPAYMENT AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

REQUIRED FUNDING OBLIGATIONS FOR 2009 RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATES CONTRIBUTING $600.0 MILLION AND

$60.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO ITS PENSION PLANS AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS DURING 2009.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANYS EXISTING SHELF REGISTRATION

FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC) EXPIRED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO FILE A NEW

SHELF REGISTRATION IN 2009.

IN APRIL 2008, THE COMPANY EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF ITS

$1.5 BILLION,

5-YEAR

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FROM APRIL 2012 TO APRIL 2013. THE

FACILITY PROVIDES BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR THE COMPANYS

COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING FACILITY AND IS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE

PURPOSES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DRAWN FUNDING FROM THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY

MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE AND STANDARD &

POORS ARE AA3 WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK AND AA- WITH A STABLE

OUTLOOK, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RATINGS CONTINUE TO ALLOW ACCESS TO

THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND FLEXIBILITY IN OBTAINING FUNDS ON

COMPETITIVE TERMS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A

CONSERVATIVE FINANCIAL PROFILE. TOTAL CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF

$12.0 BILLION EXCEED THE SUM OF LOANS PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM

DEBT OF $6.2 BILLION. THE COMPANY PLACES ITS CASH AND

INVESTMENTS IN INSTRUMENTS THAT MEET HIGH CREDIT QUALITY

STANDARDS, AS SPECIFIED IN ITS INVESTMENT POLICY GUIDELINES.

THESE GUIDELINES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY

ONE ISSUER. DESPITE THIS STRONG FINANCIAL PROFILE, CERTAIN

CONTINGENT EVENTS, IF REALIZED, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY

AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING UNCONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES THAT PROVIDE FINANCING OR POTENTIALLY EXPOSE THE

COMPANY TO UNRECORDED FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.

IN JULY 2002, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED PURCHASES OVER

TIME OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF MERCK SHARES. TOTAL TREASURY

STOCK PURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN 2008 WAS

$2.7 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

$2.4 BILLION REMAINS UNDER THE 2002 STOCK REPURCHASE

AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY THE MERCK BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

WHILE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. MERCK RELIES ON SUSTAINED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM

FOREIGN SOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THE EXTENT

THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CASH FLOWS IS DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF A

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND

RESEARCH AND OTHER DOLLAR-BASED STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AT A

CONSISTENT LEVEL MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO

PROTECT AGAINST VOLATILITY OF FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS

AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR LONGER-TERM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TO DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, PRIMARILY

THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE

COMPANY WILL PARTIALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED THIRD-PARTY SALES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER ITS PLANNING CYCLE, TYPICALLY NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL LAYER IN

HEDGES OVER TIME, INCREASING THE PORTION OF SALES HEDGED AS IT

GETS CLOSER TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUCH THAT

IT IS PROBABLE THE HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. THE PORTION OF

SALES HEDGED IS BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF COST-BENEFIT PROFILES

THAT CONSIDER NATURAL OFFSETTING EXPOSURES, REVENUE AND EXCHANGE

RATE VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, AND THE COST OF HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS. THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES ARE A SPECIFIED

COMPONENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF SIMILARLY DENOMINATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY-BASED SALES TRANSACTIONS, EACH OF WHICH RESPONDS TO THE

HEDGED RISK IN THE SAME MANNER. MERCK MANAGES ITS ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY

PUT OPTIONS, WHICH PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A RIGHT, BUT NOT AN

OBLIGATION, TO SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT A

PREDETERMINED PRICE. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS

RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, TOTAL

CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS OFFSET THE DECLINE IN

THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED

FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENS, THE OPTIONS VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO, BUT THE

COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE

ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. WHILE A WEAKER

U.S. DOLLAR WOULD RESULT IN A NET BENEFIT, THE MARKET VALUE

OF THE COMPANYS HEDGES WOULD HAVE DECLINED BY

$194.7 MILLION AND $69.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FROM A

UNIFORM 10% WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007. THE MARKET VALUE WAS DETERMINED

USING A FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION PRICING MODEL AND HOLDING ALL

FACTORS EXCEPT EXCHANGE RATES CONSTANT. BECAUSE MERCK

PRINCIPALLY USES PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS, A UNIFORM

WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL YIELD THE LARGEST OVERALL

POTENTIAL LOSS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS. THE

SENSITIVITY MEASUREMENT ASSUMES THAT A CHANGE IN ONE FOREIGN

CURRENCY RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WOULD NOT AFFECT OTHER

FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH

NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A 10%

THRESHOLD REFLECTS REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN

MERCKS MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF CASH FLOWS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS FROM THE EFFECTS OF

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEIR

CONVERSION TO U.S. DOLLARS. MERCK PRINCIPALLY UTILIZES

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO BUY AND

SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

AND ECONOMICALLY OFFSET THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS DERIVED

FROM THE NET ASSETS. MERCK ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS TO

OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES DENOMINATED IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRY CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE

YEN. FOR EXPOSURES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CURRENCIES, THE COMPANY

WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE

EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES WHEN IT IS DEEMED ECONOMICAL TO

DO SO BASED ON A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE

MAGNITUDE OF THE EXPOSURE, THE VOLATILITY OF THE EXCHANGE RATE

AND THE COST OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO

MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE ON MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES BY MANAGING OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND NET ASSET

POSITIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS

TO HEDGE THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO CHANGES IN THE VALUE

OF THE U.S. DOLLAR ON FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

DERIVATIVES, INVESTMENTS AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

INDICATED THAT IF THE U.S. DOLLAR UNIFORMLY WEAKENED BY 10%

AGAINST ALL CURRENCY EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, INCOME BEFORE TAXES WOULD HAVE

DECLINED BY $15.8 MILLION AND

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$24.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE MERCK IS IN A NET

SHORT POSITION RELATIVE TO ITS MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES AFTER

CONSIDERATION OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, A UNIFORM WEAKENING OF THE

U.S. DOLLAR WILL YIELD THE LARGEST OVERALL POTENTIAL NET

LOSS IN EARNINGS DUE TO EXCHANGE. THIS MEASUREMENT ASSUMES THAT

A CHANGE IN ONE FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR WOULD NOT AFFECT OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES

RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN

NATURE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN MERCKS MAJOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE

CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

IN ADDITION TO THE REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY MAY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONTRACTS ON CERTAIN INVESTING AND BORROWING TRANSACTIONS TO

MANAGE ITS NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND TO REDUCE

ITS OVERALL COST OF BORROWING. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE

LEVERAGED SWAPS AND, IN GENERAL, DOES NOT LEVERAGE ANY OF ITS

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD PUT PRINCIPAL CAPITAL AT RISK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY TO TWO

PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

MATURING IN 2011 WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $125 MILLION EACH

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE

NOTES. THE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS

TO FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS. IN 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED

FOUR INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

$250 MILLION EACH, AND TERMINATED ONE INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONTRACT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION. THESE

SWAPS HAD EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED ITS $1.0 BILLION, 4.75%

FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE 2015 AND ITS $500 MILLION, 4.375%

FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE 2013 TO VARIABLE RATE DEBT. AS A RESULT OF

THE SWAP TERMINATIONS, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $128.3 MILLION

IN CASH, EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL. THE

CORRESPONDING GAINS RELATED TO THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT OF THE DEBT

ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATED SWAP CONTRACTS WERE DEFERRED AND

ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE NOTES. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS

ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, THE MARKET VALUES OF

WHICH ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES. THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS MEDIUM- TO

LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS IS MODESTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES

IN U.S. INTEREST RATES. CHANGES IN MEDIUM- TO LONG-TERM

U.S. INTEREST RATES HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS, WHICH

GENERALLY HAVE LONGER MATURITIES. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO

MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS, DEBT AND RELATED SWAP CONTRACTS FROM

A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007

WOULD HAVE POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE NET AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS BY $98.9 MILLION AND $62.1 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 WOULD HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

THE NET AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE BY $156.3 MILLION AND

$114.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS DEBT WAS DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS

REFLECTING ONE PERCENTAGE POINT SHIFTS IN THE APPROPRIATE YIELD

CURVES. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS WERE

DETERMINED USING A COMBINATION OF PRICING AND DURATION MODELS.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER MATTERS

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE

CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING SUCH

ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, DEPRECIABLE

AND AMORTIZABLE LIVES, RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN

PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR

CONTINGENCIES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER RESERVES,

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS,

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ASSUMPTIONS, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN

CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, IMPAIRMENTS

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS, AND TAXES ON INCOME.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. APPLICATION OF THE

FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES RESULT IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

REVENUES FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF

DELIVERY AND WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ALSO REQUIRES REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF

COLLECTION OF SALES PROCEEDS AND COMPLETION OF ALL PERFORMANCE

OBLIGATIONS. DOMESTICALLY, SALES DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED TO

CUSTOMERS AS DIRECT

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCOUNTS AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE

OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALER, KNOWN AS

CHARGEBACKS, OR INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF REBATES. ADDITIONALLY,

SALES ARE GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF RETURN UNDER

CERTAIN CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF PROVISIONS FOR

SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME

OF SALE.

THE PROVISION FOR AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS COVERS

CHARGEBACKS AND REBATES. CHARGEBACKS ARE DISCOUNTS THAT OCCUR

WHEN A CONTRACTED CUSTOMER PURCHASES DIRECTLY THROUGH AN

INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALER. THE CONTRACTED CUSTOMER GENERALLY

PURCHASES PRODUCT AT ITS CONTRACTED PRICE PLUS A

MARK-UP

FROM

THE WHOLESALER. THE WHOLESALER, IN TURN, CHARGES THE COMPANY

BACK FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE INITIALLY PAID BY THE

WHOLESALER AND THE CONTRACT PRICE PAID TO THE WHOLESALER BY THE

CUSTOMER. THE PROVISION FOR CHARGEBACKS IS BASED ON EXPECTED

SELL-THROUGH LEVELS BY THE COMPANYS WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS TO

CONTRACTED CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS ESTIMATED WHOLESALER INVENTORY

LEVELS. REBATES ARE AMOUNTS OWED BASED UPON DEFINITIVE

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH PRIVATE SECTOR

AND PUBLIC SECTOR (MEDICAID AND MEDICARE

PART D) BENEFIT PROVIDERS, AFTER THE FINAL DISPENSING

OF THE PRODUCT BY A PHARMACY TO A BENEFIT PLAN PARTICIPANT. THE

PROVISION IS BASED ON EXPECTED PAYMENTS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY

PATIENT USAGE AND CONTRACT PERFORMANCE BY THE BENEFIT PROVIDER

CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY ASSUMES A

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT MOVEMENT OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR

PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING ITS AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNT

ACCRUAL. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL CUSTOMER

SEGMENT MIX, ADJUSTED FOR OTHER KNOWN EVENTS, IN ORDER TO

ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PROVISION. AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR AGGREGATE

INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS ARE EVALUATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS

THROUGH COMPARISON OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE WHOLESALERS

AND OTHER CUSTOMERS TO THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED. ADJUSTMENTS ARE

RECORDED WHEN TRENDS OR SIGNIFICANT EVENTS INDICATE THAT A

CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED PROVISION IS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS PROVISION FOR AGGREGATE

INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS

TO ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER

DISCOUNT PROVISION IN 2008, 2007 OR 2006.

SUMMARIZED INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN THE AGGREGATE INDIRECT

CUSTOMER DISCOUNT ACCRUAL IS AS FOLLOWS.

INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT

LIABILITIES WERE $55.6 MILLION AND $560.7 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND $82.5 MILLION

AND $616.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RETURNS POLICY THAT ALLOWS ITS CUSTOMERS

TO RETURN PRODUCT WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD PRIOR TO AND

SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXPIRATION DATE (GENERALLY, SIX MONTHS BEFORE

AND TWELVE MONTHS AFTER PRODUCT EXPIRATION). THE ESTIMATE OF THE

PROVISION FOR RETURNS IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH

ACTUAL RETURNS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS FACTORS SUCH

AS LEVELS OF INVENTORY IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, PRODUCT

DATING AND EXPIRATION PERIOD, WHETHER PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

DISCONTINUED, ENTRANCE IN THE MARKET OF ADDITIONAL GENERIC

COMPETITION, CHANGES IN FORMULARIES OR LAUNCH OF

OVER-THE-COUNTER

PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS. THE PRODUCT RETURNS PROVISION, AS WELL

AS ACTUAL RETURNS, WERE LESS THAN 1.0% OF NET SALES IN 2008,

2007 AND 2006.

THROUGH ITS DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH U.S. WHOLESALERS, THE

COMPANY ENCOURAGES WHOLESALERS TO ALIGN PURCHASES WITH

UNDERLYING DEMAND AND MAINTAIN INVENTORIES BELOW SPECIFIED

LEVELS. THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM ALLOW THE WHOLESALERS TO EARN

FEES UPON PROVIDING VISIBILITY INTO THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS AS

WELL AS BY ACHIEVING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS, SUCH AS,

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, REDUCING SHORTAGE

CLAIMS AND REDUCING PRODUCT RETURNS. INFORMATION PROVIDED

THROUGH THE WHOLESALER DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM INCLUDES ITEMS SUCH

AS SALES TRENDS, INVENTORY ON-HAND, ON-ORDER QUANTITY AND

PRODUCT RETURNS.

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHOLESALERS GENERALLY PROVIDE ONLY THE ABOVE MENTIONED DATA TO

THE COMPANY, AS THERE IS NO REGULATORY REQUIREMENT TO REPORT LOT

LEVEL INFORMATION TO MANUFACTURERS, WHICH IS THE LEVEL OF

INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE REMAINING SHELF LIFE AND

ORIGINAL SALE DATE OF INVENTORY. GIVEN CURRENT WHOLESALER

INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN A MONTH, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT COLLECTION OF ORDER LOT INFORMATION ACROSS

ALL WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE LIMITED USE IN ESTIMATING

SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS.

INVENTORIES

PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR

PRODUCT LAUNCHES SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT INITIAL MARKET DEMAND.

TYPICALLY, CAPITALIZATION OF SUCH INVENTORY DOES NOT BEGIN UNTIL

THE RELATED PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE IN PHASE III CLINICAL

TRIALS AND ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF

REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE STATUS OF EACH

RESPECTIVE PRODUCT WITHIN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT DISCLOSE SPECIFIC TIMING

FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC

RISKS OR CONTINGENCIES OTHER THAN THE NORMAL REGULATORY APPROVAL

PROCESS OR IF THERE ARE ANY SPECIFIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING

THE RESEARCH PROCESS RELATING TO SAFETY, EFFICACY,

MANUFACTURING, MARKETING OR LABELING, THE RELATED INVENTORY

WOULD GENERALLY NOT BE CAPITALIZED. EXPIRY DATES OF THE

INVENTORY ARE IMPACTED BY THE STAGE OF COMPLETION. THE COMPANY

MANAGES THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY AT EACH STAGE TO OPTIMIZE THE

SHELF LIFE OF THE INVENTORY IN RELATION TO ANTICIPATED MARKET

DEMAND IN ORDER TO AVOID PRODUCT EXPIRY ISSUES. FOR INVENTORIES

THAT ARE CAPITALIZED, ANTICIPATED FUTURE SALES AND SHELF LIVES

SUPPORT THE REALIZATION OF THE INVENTORY VALUE AS THE INVENTORY

SHELF LIFE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET INITIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH

REQUIREMENTS. INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT

LAUNCHES CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT.

CONTINGENCIES

AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS

WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS. (SEE

NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.) THE

COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY

AS ASSESSMENTS CHANGE OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, A PORTION OF THE

OVERALL ACCRUAL IS ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED AND CONSIDERS SUCH

FACTORS AS PAST EXPERIENCE, NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND

ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. INDIVIDUALLY

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LOSSES ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD AN

AGGREGATE RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $5.372 BILLION (THE



VIOXX

RESERVE) FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND

THE COMPANYS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED

TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION) (SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). DURING 2008, THE COMPANY SPENT

APPROXIMATELY $305 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$62 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY PAID AN ADDITIONAL

$250 MILLION INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AFTER HAVING PAID $500 MILLION INTO

THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. CONSEQUENTLY,

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.379 BILLION. IN

ADDING TO THE

VIOXX

RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THE SAME FACTORS THAT IT

CONSIDERED WHEN IT PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS

CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WERE AS

FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY; THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND

STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION,

INCLUDING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT

CERTAIN LAWSUITS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF

CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES

OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING

ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL

ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LIGATION. THE AMOUNT

OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008

ALLOCATED SOLELY TO DEFENSE COSTS REPRESENTS THE COMPANYS

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE

INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL

TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT

COULD ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD

AFFECT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF DEFENSE

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS TO BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE

TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF

THE ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO

SO.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2009. EXCEPT

WITH RESPECT TO A PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIAL SCHEDULED TO BE HELD

IN AUSTRALIA, THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER

TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF

THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS

SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. IN

EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO

RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN SUCH

CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A REMAINING

RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. DURING

2008, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION AND ADDED

$40 MILLION TO ITS RESERVE. CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD A RESERVE OF

APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION; THE NUMBER OF CASES

BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION,

THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE

COMPLETION OF THE FIRST THREE FEDERAL TRIALS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. WHEN A LEGITIMATE CLAIM FOR CONTRIBUTION

IS ASSERTED, A LIABILITY IS INITIALLY ACCRUED BASED UPON THE

ESTIMATED TRANSACTION COSTS TO MANAGE THE SITE. ACCRUALS ARE

ADJUSTED AS SITE INVESTIGATIONS, FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND RELATED

COST ASSESSMENTS OF REMEDIAL TECHNIQUES ARE COMPLETED, AND AS

THE EXTENT TO WHICH OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO

MAY BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE CAN BE EXPECTED TO

CONTRIBUTE IS DETERMINED.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES

AND TAKES AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE

COSTS. A WORLDWIDE SURVEY WAS INITIALLY PERFORMED TO ASSESS ALL

SITES FOR POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL

ACTIVITIES. WHERE ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT PHYSICAL

INVESTIGATION WAS WARRANTED, SUCH INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED,

PROVIDING A BETTER EVALUATION OF THE NEED FOR REMEDIAL ACTION.

WHERE SUCH NEED WAS IDENTIFIED, REMEDIAL ACTION WAS THEN

INITIATED. ESTIMATES OF THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION AT EACH SITE

WERE INITIALLY MADE AT THE PRE-INVESTIGATION STAGE AND

LIABILITIES FOR THE POTENTIAL COST OF REMEDIATION WERE ACCRUED

AT THAT TIME. AS MORE DEFINITIVE INFORMATION BECAME AVAILABLE

DURING THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATIONS

AND/OR

REMEDIAL EFFORTS AT EACH SITE, ESTIMATES WERE REFINED AND

ACCRUALS WERE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. THESE ESTIMATES AND RELATED

ACCRUALS CONTINUE TO BE REFINED ANNUALLY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE

$34.5 MILLION IN 2008, AND ARE ESTIMATED AT

$47.1 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2009 THROUGH 2013. IN

MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN

ACCRUED AND TOTALED $89.5 MILLION AND $109.6 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT

CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM OTHER PARTIES AND WILL BE

PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPLICABLE SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE

NEXT 15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY

POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE

LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $70.0 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE. MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION COST IN ACCORDANCE WITH

FAS 123R, WHICH REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO

EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, TO BE EXPENSED

OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON THE GRANT DATE FAIR

VALUE OF THE AWARDS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN SHARE-BASED AWARDS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES

OPTION-PRICING MODEL WHICH USES BOTH HISTORICAL AND CURRENT

MARKET DATA TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE. THIS METHOD INCORPORATES

VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE,

EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD AND EXPECTED LIFE

OF THE OPTIONS.

PENSIONS

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST TOTALED

$376.6 MILLION IN 2008, $489.3 MILLION IN 2007 AND

$563.7 MILLION IN 2006. THE DECREASE OF $112.7 MILLION

IN 2008 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOWER AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL

NET LOSSES AND HIGHER EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WHICH WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN TERMINATION BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN INFORMATION FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS CALCULATED USING ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING A DISCOUNT RATE FOR PLAN BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND AN EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS.

THE COMPANY REASSESSES ITS BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS ON A REGULAR

BASIS. FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS EVALUATED ON MEASUREMENT DATES AND

MODIFIED TO REFLECT THE PREVAILING MARKET RATE OF A PORTFOLIO OF

HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE

THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS NEEDED TO PAY THE BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS THEY COME DUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. PENSION

PLANS AND U.S. OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS RANGED

FROM 6.0% TO 6.40% COMPARED WITH A RANGE OF 5.75% TO 6.50% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE RATE OF

RETURN TO BE EARNED ON PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PERIOD THE BENEFITS

INCLUDED IN THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION ARE TO BE PAID. IN DEVELOPING

THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM

COMPOUND ANNUALIZED RETURNS OF HISTORICAL MARKET DATA AS WELL AS

ACTUAL RETURNS ON THE COMPANYS PLAN ASSETS. USING THIS

REFERENCE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DEVELOPS FORWARD-LOOKING

RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH ASSET CATEGORY AND A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR A TARGET PORTFOLIO

ALLOCATED ACROSS THESE INVESTMENT CATEGORIES. THE EXPECTED

PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE REFLECTS THE CONTRIBUTION OF ACTIVE

MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE. AS A RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS, FOR

2009, THE COMPANYS EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN OF 8.75%

REMAINED UNCHANGED FROM 2008 FOR ITS U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

THE TARGET INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF THE COMPANYS

U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IS

ALLOCATED 45% TO 60% IN U.S. EQUITIES, 20% TO 30% IN

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, 15% TO 25% IN FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS,

AND UP TO 8% IN CASH AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE PORTFOLIOS

EQUITY WEIGHTING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE

PLANS BENEFIT OBLIGATION. THE EXPECTED ANNUAL STANDARD

DEVIATION OF RETURNS OF THE TARGET PORTFOLIO, WHICH APPROXIMATES

13%, REFLECTS BOTH THE EQUITY ALLOCATION AND THE DIVERSIFICATION

BENEFITS AMONG THE ASSET CLASSES IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO INVESTS.

THE ACTUAL RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FOR PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS REFLECTS THE ALLOCATION TO GLOBAL

EQUITY MARKETS WHICH DELIVERED SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE RETURNS

DURING 2008.

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT. A REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE OF PLUS

(MINUS) 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION,

WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE AN ESTIMATED

$35.2 MILLION FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE) IMPACT ON ITS

U.S. NET PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. A

REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE OF PLUS (MINUS) 25 BASIS POINTS

IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, WITH OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE AN ESTIMATED

$13.0 MILLION FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE) IMPACT ON ITS

U.S. NET PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAVE A MINIMUM PENSION FUNDING

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIREMENT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE DURING 2009. THE

PRECEDING HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED

RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS WOULD NOT IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

NET LOSS AMOUNTS, WHICH REFLECT EXPERIENCE DIFFERENTIALS

PRIMARILY RELATING TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPECTED AND ACTUAL

RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. EXPECTED RETURNS FOR

PENSION PLANS ARE BASED ON A CALCULATED MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF

ASSETS. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, ASSET GAINS/LOSSES RESULTING

FROM ACTUAL RETURNS THAT DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

RETURNS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS

RATABLY OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. ALSO, NET LOSS AMOUNTS IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN

THRESHOLDS ARE AMORTIZED INTO NET PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE

LIFE OF EMPLOYEES. AMORTIZATION OF NET LOSSES FOR THE

COMPANYS U.S. PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 IS

EXPECTED TO INCREASE NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT COST BY APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION ANNUALLY FROM

2009 THROUGH 2013.

ACQUISITIONS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE PURCHASE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. ANY EXCESS OF THE

PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ACQUIRED COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WHICH HAS NOT

COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE ACQUISITION WILL

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WOULD NOT BE

RECORDED. THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING

ACQUIRED RESEARCH, IS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND ACCORDINGLY, FOR SIGNIFICANT ITEMS, THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY OBTAINS ASSISTANCE FROM THIRD PARTY VALUATION

SPECIALISTS. AMOUNTS ARE ALLOCATED TO ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND

EXPENSED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION IF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY

HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTS.

FOR PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH

PROCESS THAT HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES, THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND AMORTIZES THEM OVER AN

APPROPRIATE USEFUL LIFE. THE VALUATIONS AND USEFUL LIFE

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE NEAR THE

ACQUISITION DATE AND ARE BASED ON EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT ARE DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT. THE JUDGMENTS MADE IN

DETERMINING ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED

AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AS WELL AS ASSET LIVES, CAN MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING ACQUIRED RESEARCH, THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY USES THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE

BASED ON EACH PROJECTS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS. FUTURE CASH

FLOWS ARE PREDOMINATELY BASED ON A NET INCOME FORECAST OF EACH

PROJECT, CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL PRICING, MARGINS AND EXPENSE

LEVELS OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS. REVENUES ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON

RELEVANT MARKET SIZE AND GROWTH FACTORS, EXPECTED INDUSTRY

TRENDS, INDIVIDUAL PROJECT LIFE CYCLES, AND THE LIFE OF EACH

RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERLYING PATENT, IF ANY. EXPECTED

REVENUES ARE THEN ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF TECHNICAL AND

MARKETING SUCCESS AND THE RESULTING CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED AT

A RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STATEMENT

NO. 141R,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(FAS 141R), WHICH CHANGES THE WAY ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS. SEE

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BELOW.

RESTRUCTURING

COSTS

THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED RESTRUCTURING COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH

ITS GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS MADE ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS REGARDING ITS FUTURE PLANS, INCLUDING FUTURE

TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER EXIT COSTS TO BE INCURRED WHEN

THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS TAKE PLACE. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

ACTIONS, MANAGEMENT ALSO ASSESSES THE RECOVERABILITY OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, ASSET LIVES HAVE BEEN SHORTENED BASED ON CHANGES IN

THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF THE AFFECTED ASSETS. SEVERANCE AND

OTHER RELATED COSTS ARE REFLECTED WITHIN RESTRUCTURING COSTS.

ASSET-RELATED CHARGES ARE REFLECTED WITHIN MATERIALS AND

PRODUCTION COSTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DEPENDING

UPON THE NATURE OF THE ASSET.

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPAIRMENTS

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY ASSESSES CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MAKES

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN EVALUATING

THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES WHETHER CURRENT FACTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ITS

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED ARE RECOVERABLE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR

THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

. IF SUCH

CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DETERMINED TO EXIST, AN ESTIMATE OF THE

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THESE ASSETS, OR APPROPRIATE

ASSET GROUPINGS, IS COMPARED TO THE CARRYING VALUE TO DETERMINE

WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE ASSET IS DETERMINED TO BE

IMPAIRED, THE LOSS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE AND ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF QUOTED

MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY WILL ESTIMATE FAIR

VALUE USING A DISCOUNTED VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

APPROACH.

THE COMPANY TESTS ITS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

USING A FAIR VALUE BASED TEST.

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF ACQUISITION COSTS OVER THE

FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED AND IS ASSIGNED

TO REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE COMPANYS SEGMENTS. OTHER

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES ARE RECORDED AT COST. WHEN EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVIEW, THE COMPANY WILL ASSESS

RECOVERABILITY FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS OF OTHER INTANGIBLES USING

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM THE LOWEST APPROPRIATE

ASSET GROUPINGS, GENERALLY THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL. IMPAIRMENTS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING RESULTS TO THE EXTENT THAT CARRYING

VALUES EXCEED FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE NET

PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS.

IMPAIRMENTS

OF INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON THE

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT BELOW THE CARRYING VALUE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENTS OF ITS INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE DURATION AND

EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST AND THE

COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENTS.

FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STATEMENT

NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157) WHICH CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION OF

FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE,

AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

FAS 157 ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH REQUIRES

AN ENTITY TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZE

THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WHEN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.

FAS 157 DESCRIBES THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED

TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE (SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

COMPANYS LEVEL 3 ASSETS OF $96.6 MILLION

PRIMARILY INCLUDE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES,

AS WELL AS CERTAIN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS FOR WHICH THERE WAS

A DECREASE IN THE OBSERVABILITY OF MARKET PRICING FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS. ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD

$1,273.1 MILLION INVESTED IN A SHORT-TERM FIXED INCOME FUND

(THE FUND). DUE TO MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS, CASH

REDEMPTIONS FROM THE FUND WERE RESTRICTED. AS A RESULT OF THIS

RESTRICTION ON CASH REDEMPTIONS, THE COMPANY DID NOT CONSIDER

THE FUND TO BE TRADED IN AN ACTIVE MARKET WITH OBSERVABLE

PRICING ON JANUARY 1, 2008 AND THESE AMOUNTS WERE

CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3. ON JANUARY 7, 2008, THE

COMPANY ELECTED TO BE

REDEEMED-IN-KIND

FROM THE FUND AND RECEIVED ITS SHARE OF THE UNDERLYING

SECURITIES OF THE FUND. AS A RESULT, $1,099.7 MILLION OF

THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WERE TRANSFERRED OUT OF LEVEL 3

AS IT WAS DETERMINED THESE SECURITIES HAD OBSERVABLE MARKETS. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, $96.6 MILLION OF THE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

REDEMPTION-IN-KIND

REMAINED CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 (APPROXIMATELY 0.9% OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT SECURITIES) AS THE SECURITIES

CONTAINED AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT INPUT WHICH WAS UNOBSERVABLE

(ALL OF WHICH WERE PLEDGED UNDER CERTAIN COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS

(SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)).

THESE SECURITIES ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTIRE BALANCE OF THE

COMPANYS LEVEL 3 ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THESE SECURITIES WERE VALUED PRIMARILY USING PRICING MODELS FOR

WHICH MANAGEMENT UNDERSTANDS THE METHODOLOGIES. THESE MODELS

INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS SUCH AS CONTRACTUAL TERMS,

MATURITY, TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH INFLOWS, AS WELL AS

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF

MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TAXES ON

INCOME

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON PRETAX INCOME,

STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN

THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. AN

ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR A YEAR IS APPLIED TO THE

COMPANYS QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS. IN THE EVENT THAT

THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNUSUAL OR ONE-TIME ITEM RECOGNIZED, OR

EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED, IN THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY

OPERATING RESULTS, THE TAX ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT ITEM WOULD BE

SEPARATELY CALCULATED AND RECORDED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE

UNUSUAL OR ONE-TIME ITEM. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RESOLUTION

OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS TO BE SUCH ITEMS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT

IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE COMPANYS TAX PROVISION AND

IN EVALUATING ITS TAX POSITIONS. THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

OF A TAX POSITION IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST JUDGMENT

GIVEN THE FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE

REPORTING DATE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 48, THE COMPANY

EVALUATES TAX POSITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE BENEFITS OF TAX

POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT

BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX POSITION. FOR TAX

POSITIONS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON

AUDIT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT

THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT

ARE NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PORTION OF THE BENEFIT IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD IS

NOT MET IN THE PERIOD FOR WHICH A TAX POSITION IS TAKEN, THE

COMPANY MAY SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZE THE BENEFIT OF THAT TAX

POSITION IF THE TAX MATTER IS EFFECTIVELY SETTLED, THE STATUTE

OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRES, OR IF THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD

IS MET IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD. (SEE NOTE 15 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE TAX RETURN

AT DIFFERENT TIMES THAN THE ITEMS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. TIMING DIFFERENCES CREATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GENERALLY REPRESENT ITEMS THAT

CAN BE USED AS A TAX DEDUCTION OR CREDIT IN THE TAX RETURN IN

FUTURE YEARS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY RECORDED THE TAX

BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES

VALUATION ALLOWANCES FOR ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN THE AMOUNT

OF EXPECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IS NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE

USE OF THE DEDUCTION OR CREDIT. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES

GENERALLY REPRESENT TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR WHICH PAYMENT HAS BEEN DEFERRED OR EXPENSE FOR

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY TAKEN A DEDUCTION ON THE TAX

RETURN, BUT HAS NOT YET RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, FOREIGN EARNINGS OF

$22.0 BILLION HAVE BEEN RETAINED INDEFINITELY BY SUBSIDIARY

COMPANIES FOR REINVESTMENT, THEREFORE NO PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE

FOR INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF

SUCH EARNINGS.

RECENTLY

ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 141R WHICH EXPANDS

THE SCOPE OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS UNDER

WHICH CONTROL OF A BUSINESS IS OBTAINED. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES

AN ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES WITH LIMITED

EXCEPTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FAS 141R REQUIRES THAT CONTINGENT

CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, THAT ACQUIRED

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BE CAPITALIZED AND RECORDED

AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND ALSO REQUIRES

TRANSACTION COSTS AND COSTS TO RESTRUCTURE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY

BE EXPENSED. FAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE, ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS,

JANUARY 1, 2009 AND FUTURE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE ACCOUNTED

FOR UNDER THIS STANDARD.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51

(FAS 160) WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THE

ACCOUNTING, REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

AND REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

BE RECORDED AS EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAS 160 IS EFFECTIVE, ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS,

JANUARY 1, 2009 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PRESENTATION AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 160 WHICH MUST BE APPLIED

RETROSPECTIVELY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD WILL RESULT IN

THE RECLASSIFICATION OF $2.4 BILLION OF MINORITY INTERESTS

(NOW REFERRED TO AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) TO A SEPARATE

COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET. ADDITIONALLY, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WILL BE SHOWN SEPARATELY FROM PARENT

NET INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED THE CONSENSUS REACHED BY THE

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ON ISSUE

NO. 07-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

(EITF 07-1).

EITF 07-1,

WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, IS APPLIED

RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED FOR ALL

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS EXISTING AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE.

EITF 07-1

DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTABLISHES REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS FOR

83

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS IN A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT

AND BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THIRD PARTIES.

THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF

EITF 07-1

IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 161,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES

(FAS 161), WHICH IS EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2009. FAS 161 REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES

ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES TO ALLOW FOR

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR EFFECTS ON AN ENTITYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. AMONG

OTHER THINGS, FAS 161 REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE FAIR

VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED GAINS AND LOSSES

IN A TABULAR FORMAT. SINCE FAS 161 REQUIRES ONLY ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, THE ADOPTION OF FAS 161 WILL NOT AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITION

EITF 03-6-1,

DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES

(FSP

EITF 03-6-1),

WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

CLARIFIES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT ENTITLE HOLDERS

TO RECEIVE NONFORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS BEFORE THEY VEST WILL BE

CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND THEREFORE INCLUDED IN

THE BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION

OF FSP

EITF 03-6-1

IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED

EITF 08-6,

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS

(EITF 08-6).

EITF 08-6

CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND IMPAIRMENT

CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.

EITF 08-6

IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, AND WILL BE APPLIED ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO FUTURE TRANSACTIONS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED

EITF 08-7,

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(EITF 08-7).

EITF 08-7

CLARIFIES THAT A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING AND SHOULD BE ASSIGNED A

USEFUL LIFE THAT REFLECTS THE ENTITYS CONSUMPTION OF THE

EXPECTED BENEFITS RELATED TO THE ASSET.

EITF 08-7

IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, AND WILL BE APPLIED ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO FUTURE TRANSACTIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITION

FAS 132(R)-1,

EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS

(FSP

FAS 132(R)-1), WHICH IS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31,

2009. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 AMENDS FASB STATEMENT NO. 132R,

EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT PENSIONS AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON AN

EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT PLAN ASSETS OF A DEFINED

PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN. FSP FAS 132(R)-1

REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT PLAN ASSETS INCLUDING HOW INVESTMENT

ALLOCATION DECISIONS ARE MADE, THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PLAN

ASSETS, THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE

FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3) ON

CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PERIOD, AND SIGNIFICANT

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS. SINCE FSP

FAS 132(R)-1 REQUIRES ONLY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE

COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS, THE

ADOPTION OF FSP FAS 132(R)-1 WILL NOT AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

SUMMARY

OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ALL

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS

MAINTAINED. INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS ARE

ELIMINATED. CONTROLLING INTEREST IS DETERMINED BY MAJORITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST AND THE ABSENCE OF SUBSTANTIVE THIRD-PARTY

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS OR, IN THE CASE OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES, BY MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO EXPECTED LOSSES, RESIDUAL

RETURNS OR BOTH. FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE MERCK

OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100%, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS

INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN

AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT

NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST, SUCH AS INTERESTS IN ENTITIES OWNED

EQUALLY BY THE COMPANY AND A THIRD PARTY THAT ARE UNDER SHARED

CONTROL, ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

THE

U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

CASH EQUIVALENTS 

CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE

COMPRISED OF CERTAIN HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

INVENTORIES 

INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE

LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE COST OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DOMESTIC

INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED USING THE

LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD FOR BOTH BOOK AND TAX

PURPOSES. THE COST OF ALL OTHER INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED USING

THE

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD. INVENTORIES CONSIST OF

CURRENTLY MARKETED PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN PRODUCTS AWAITING

REGULATORY APPROVAL. IN EVALUATING THE RECOVERABILITY OF

INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABILITY THAT REVENUE WILL BE OBTAINED

FROM THE FUTURE SALE OF THE RELATED INVENTORY TOGETHER WITH THE

STATUS OF THE PRODUCT WITHIN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS.

INVESTMENTS 

INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT

AND EQUITY SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

STATEMENT NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157), WHICH CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION OF

FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND

EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. FAS 157

DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE EXCHANGE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED

FOR AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY (AN EXIT PRICE) IN

THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET FOR THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS

ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FAS 157 ALSO ESTABLISHES A FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF

OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

WHEN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.

89

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IS DETERMINED USING

QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES OR QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES

OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. FOR DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE THAT ARE

CONSIDERED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY,

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE CHARGED TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.

DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE THAT ARE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY, TO THE

EXTENT NOT HEDGED, ARE REPORTED NET OF TAX IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI). THE COMPANY CONSIDERS

AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF ITS

INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR

VALUE IS LESS THAN COST AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND

INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

REVENUES FROM SALES OF

PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY AND WHEN TITLE

AND RISK OF LOSS PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE

ALSO REQUIRES REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COLLECTION OF SALES

PROCEEDS AND COMPLETION OF ALL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.

DOMESTICALLY, SALES DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS AS DIRECT

DISCOUNTS AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE

OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALER, KNOWN AS

CHARGEBACKS, OR INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF REBATES. ADDITIONALLY,

SALES ARE GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF RETURN UNDER

CERTAIN CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF PROVISIONS FOR

SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME

OF SALE. ACCRUALS FOR CHARGEBACKS ARE REFLECTED AS A DIRECT

REDUCTION TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUALS FOR REBATES ARE

RECORDED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE ACCRUED BALANCES RELATIVE

TO THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUED

AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES WERE $55.6 MILLION AND

$560.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

$82.5 MILLION AND $616.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF VACCINES TO THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PLACEMENT INTO STOCKPILES RELATED TO THE

PEDIATRIC VACCINE STOCKPILE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) INTERPRETATION

,

COMMISSION GUIDANCE REGARDING ACCOUNTING FOR SALES OF VACCINES

AND BIOTERROR COUNTERMEASURES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR

PLACEMENT INTO THE PEDIATRIC VACCINE STOCKPILE OR THE STRATEGIC

NATIONAL STOCKPILE.

DEPRECIATION 

DEPRECIATION IS PROVIDED OVER

THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. FOR TAX PURPOSES, ACCELERATED METHODS ARE

USED. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO

50 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, AND FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS FOR

MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND OFFICE FURNISHINGS.

SOFTWARE CAPITALIZATION 

THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING

OR DEVELOPING INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIRECT

COSTS OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES, AND PAYROLL COSTS FOR EMPLOYEES

DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN ACCORDANCE

98-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR

OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE

. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ARE

INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND AMORTIZED

BEGINNING WHEN THE ASSET IS SUBSTANTIALLY READY FOR USE.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS

MULTI-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE RESOURCE

PLANNING SYSTEM ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER 7 TO 10 YEARS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY

$330 MILLION AND $200 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

REMAINING UNAMORTIZED CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THIS INITIATIVE. ALL OTHER CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ARE BEING

AMORTIZED OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS. COSTS

INCURRED DURING THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE AND

POST-IMPLEMENTATION STAGE, AS WELL AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING

COSTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ACQUISITIONS 

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 141,

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

LIABILITIES ASSUMED BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AT

THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE

OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS

RECORDED AS GOODWILL. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ACQUIRED

COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WHICH HAS NOT COMMENCED

ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE ACQUISITION WILL BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WOULD NOT BE

RECORDED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 4,

APPLICABILITY OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 2 TO BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PURCHASE METHOD

, THE

COMPANY ALLOCATES AMOUNTS TO ACQUIRED RESEARCH WHICH ARE

EXPENSED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION IF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY

HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTS.

FOR PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH

PROCESS THAT HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES, THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND AMORTIZES THEM OVER AN

APPROPRIATE USEFUL LIFE. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS OF THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION. ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB

STATEMENT NO. 141R,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH

CHANGES THE WAY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. SEE

RECENTLY

ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BELOW.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES 

GOODWILL

REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF ACQUISITION COSTS OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED. GOODWILL IS ASSIGNED TO

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE COMPANYS SEGMENTS AND EVALUATED

FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, USING A FAIR VALUE

BASED TEST. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES ARE RECORDED AT COST AND

ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS (SEE NOTE 7).

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVIEW, THE COMPANY WILL

ASSESS RECOVERABILITY FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS OF OTHER

INTANGIBLES USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM THE

LOWEST APPROPRIATE ASSET GROUPINGS, GENERALLY THE SUBSIDIARY

LEVEL. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING RESULTS TO THE

EXTENT THAT CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS

DETERMINED BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT IS EXPENSED AS INCURRED. UPFRONT AND MILESTONE

PAYMENTS DUE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS PRIOR TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PAYMENTS DUE TO THIRD PARTIES UPON OR

SUBSEQUENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED

OVER THE SHORTER OF THE REMAINING LICENSE OR PRODUCT PATENT

LIFE. ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED EMERGING

ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO. 07-3,

ACCOUNTING FOR ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES

RECEIVED FOR USE IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES,

WHICH REQUIRES THAT NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS

AND SERVICES THAT WILL BE USED IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES BE EXPENSED WHEN THE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN

PERFORMED OR WHEN THE GOODS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED RATHER THAN WHEN

THE PAYMENT IS MADE. SEE

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BELOW.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

THE COMPANY EXPENSES

ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS, OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON THE

GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS 

THE COMPANY RECORDS

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING COSTS FOR ONE-TIME

TERMINATION BENEFITS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT

NO. 146

INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR

CONTINGENCIES.

TAXES ON INCOME 

DEFERRED TAXES ARE RECOGNIZED

FOR THE FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND

RATES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES TAX POSITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

THE BENEFITS OF TAX POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX

POSITION. FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF

BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE LARGEST

AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING

REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR TAX POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING

SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PORTION

OF THE BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

USE OF ESTIMATES 

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP) AND,

ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE

USED IN DETERMINING SUCH ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS

AND RETURNS, DEPRECIABLE AND AMORTIZABLE LIVES, RECOVERABILITY

OF INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES,

AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR CONTINGENCIES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

AND OTHER RESERVES, PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS 

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS

HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT

YEAR PRESENTATION.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

IN

2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STATEMENT NO. 157,

AND FIN 46(R)-8).

ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 157, WHICH

CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK

FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED STAFF

POSITION

157-2,

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157

(FSP 157-2),

THAT DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FAS 157 FOR ONE YEAR

FOR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE

ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 157

FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE ON

A RECURRING BASIS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (SEE

NOTE 5). THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF

FSP 157-2

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE

FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITION

157-3,

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE

MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE

(FSP 157-3),

WHICH CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF FAS 157 IN A MARKET THAT

IS NOT ACTIVE.

FSP 157-3

WAS EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE AND THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WAS

NOT MATERIAL.

ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 159, WHICH

PERMITS COMPANIES TO MAKE AN IRREVOCABLE ELECTION TO MEASURE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR

VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED ARE REPORTED IN EARNINGS AT EACH

SUBSEQUENT REPORTING DATE. THE COMPANY DID NOT ELECT THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION UNDER FAS 159 FOR ANY OF ITS FINANCIAL ASSETS

OR LIABILITIES UPON ADOPTION OR IN ANY SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 162,

WHICH IDENTIFIES THE SOURCES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THE

FRAMEWORK FOR SELECTING THE PRINCIPLES USED (ORDER OF AUTHORITY)

IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE PRESENTED IN

CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 162 ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS NOT MATERIAL.

ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

EITF 07-03,

WHICH IS BEING APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY FOR NEW CONTRACTS.

EITF 07-3

ADDRESSES NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES

THAT WILL BE USED OR RENDERED FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

EITF 07-3

REQUIRES THAT THESE PAYMENTS BE DEFERRED AND CAPITALIZED AND

RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE AS THE RELATED GOODS ARE DELIVERED OR

THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF

EITF 07-3

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS WAS NOT MATERIAL.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FSP

FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8 WHICH AMENDS FASB STATEMENT NO. 140,

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND EXTINGUISHMENT OF LIABILITIES,

TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. FSP

FAS 140-4

FIN 46(R)-8

ALSO AMENDS FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46R,

CONSOLIDATION

, TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES ABOUT A PUBLIC ENTITYS INVOLVEMENT WITH

FAS 141R EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING TO ALL

TRANSACTIONS UNDER WHICH CONTROL OF A BUSINESS IS OBTAINED. THIS

STANDARD REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED

AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES WITH

LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FAS 141R REQUIRES THAT

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE,

THAT ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BE CAPITALIZED

AND RECORDED AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND

ALSO REQUIRES TRANSACTION COSTS AND COSTS TO RESTRUCTURE THE

ACQUIRED COMPANY BE EXPENSED. FAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE, ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS, JANUARY 1, 2009 AND FUTURE TRANSACTIONS

WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THIS STANDARD.

FAS 160 PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THE ACCOUNTING, REPORTING AND

DISCLOSURE OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THAT NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS BE RECORDED AS EQUITY IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAS 160 IS

EFFECTIVE, ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS, JANUARY 1, 2009 WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF FAS

160 WHICH MUST BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

STANDARD WILL RESULT IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF

$2.4 BILLION OF MINORITY INTERESTS (NOW REFERRED TO AS

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) TO A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

ADDITIONALLY, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS WILL BE SHOWN SEPARATELY FROM PARENT NET INCOME IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

FAS 161, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, REQUIRES

ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES TO ALLOW FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR EFFECTS

ON AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,

AND CASH FLOWS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, FAS 161 REQUIRES

DISCLOSURE OF THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

ASSOCIATED GAINS AND LOSSES IN A TABULAR FORMAT. SINCE

RESTRUCTURING

2008

GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM (THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM) TO REDUCE

ITS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,200 POSITIONS

 6,800 ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND 400 VACANCIES 

ACROSS ALL AREAS OF THE COMPANY WORLDWIDE BY THE END OF 2011.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 1,750

POSITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROGRAM, COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE

SEPARATIONS AND THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT

POSITIONS. ABOUT 40% OF THE TOTAL REDUCTIONS WILL OCCUR IN THE

UNITED STATES. AS PART OF THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, THE

COMPANY IS STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT LAYERS BY REDUCING ITS TOTAL

NUMBER OF SENIOR AND MID-LEVEL EXECUTIVES GLOBALLY BY

APPROXIMATELY 25%. THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW

EMPLOYEES AS THE BUSINESS REQUIRES. MERCK IS ROLLING OUT A NEW,

MORE CUSTOMER-CENTRIC SELLING MODEL DESIGNED TO PROVIDE MERCK

WITH A MEANINGFUL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND HELP PHYSICIANS,

PATIENTS AND PAYERS IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE COMPANY ALSO

WILL MAKE GREATER USE OF OUTSIDE TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES,

CENTRALIZE COMMON SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AND

CONSOLIDATE AND STREAMLINE ITS OPERATIONS. MERCKS

MANUFACTURING DIVISION WILL FURTHER FOCUS ITS CAPABILITIES ON

CORE PRODUCTS AND OUTSOURCE NON-CORE MANUFACTURING. ALSO, MERCK

IS EXPANDING ITS ACCESS TO WORLDWIDE EXTERNAL SCIENCE THROUGH A

BASIC RESEARCH GLOBAL OPERATING STRATEGY, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE PIPELINE AND IS FOCUSED ON TRANSLATING

BASIC RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY INTO LATE-STAGE CLINICAL SUCCESS. TO

INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, BASIC RESEARCH OPERATIONS WILL

CONSOLIDATE WORK IN SUPPORT OF A GIVEN THERAPEUTIC AREA INTO ONE

OF FOUR LOCATIONS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF

RESEARCH FACILITIES AND RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF THREE BASIC

RESEARCH SITES LOCATED IN TSUKUBA, JAPAN; POMEZIA, ITALY; AND

SEATTLE BY THE END OF 2009.

SEPARATION COSTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER FAS 112 AND

FAS 146. IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM,

SEPARATION COSTS UNDER THE COMPANYS EXISTING SEVERANCE

PROGRAMS WORLDWIDE WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER FAS 112 AND

RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 TO THE EXTENT SUCH COSTS

WERE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY COMMENCED ACCRUING

COSTS RELATED TO ONE-TIME TERMINATION BENEFITS OFFERED TO

EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008 AS THAT IS WHEN THE NECESSARY CRITERIA UNDER

FAS 146 WERE MET. THE COMPANY RECORDED PRETAX RESTRUCTURING

COSTS OF $921.3 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM IN 2008. THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO

BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2011 WITH THE TOTAL PRETAX COSTS

ESTIMATED TO BE $1.6 BILLION TO $2.0 BILLION. THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS

WILL RESULT IN FUTURE CASH OUTLAYS, PRIMARILY FROM EMPLOYEE

SEPARATION EXPENSE. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE CUMULATIVE

PRETAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH, RELATING PRIMARILY TO THE ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION OF FACILITIES TO BE CLOSED OR DIVESTED.

2005

GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM (THE 2005 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM) DESIGNED TO

REDUCE THE COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY

AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS. AS PART OF THE 2005 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM, MERCK HAS SOLD OR CLOSED FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES AND

TWO PRECLINICAL SITES AND SINCE INCEPTION ELIMINATED 11,250

POSITIONS COMPANY-WIDE COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS AND THE

ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS

ALSO SOLD OR CLOSED CERTAIN OTHER FACILITIES AND SOLD RELATED

ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2005 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. SINCE

INCEPTION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAS

RECORDED TOTAL PRETAX ACCUMULATED COSTS OF $2.5 BILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2005 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WHICH IS

SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE.

FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES ARE UNALLOCATED

EXPENSES.

MERCK WAS REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION OF THE SITE ASSETS

RATHER THAN WRITE THEM OFF IMMEDIATELY. THE SITE ASSETS INCLUDE

MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.

OTHER ACTIVITY IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006 INCLUDES

$29.4 MILLION, $39.4 MILLION AND $25.0 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS THAT WERE NO

RESEARCH

COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS

MERCK CONTINUES ITS STRATEGY OF ESTABLISHING STRONG EXTERNAL

ALLIANCES TO COMPLEMENT ITS SUBSTANTIAL INTERNAL RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS,

LICENSING PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS AND TECHNOLOGY

TRANSFERS TO DRIVE BOTH NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, MERCK ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH

INSMED INC. (INSMED) TO PURCHASE INSMEDS

PORTFOLIO OF FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES AND ITS

COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN BOULDER,

COLORADO. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL PAY

INSMED AN AGGREGATE OF $130 MILLION IN CASH TO ACQUIRE ALL

RIGHTS TO THE BOULDER FACILITIES AND INSMEDS PIPELINE OF

FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGIC CANDIDATES. INSMEDS FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS

PORTFOLIO INCLUDES TWO CLINICAL CANDIDATES: INS-19, AN

INVESTIGATIONAL RECOMBINANT GRANULOCYTE-COLONY STIMULATING

FACTOR (G-CSF) THAT WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ITS

ABILITY TO PREVENT INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING

CHEMOTHERAPY AND INS-20, A PEGYLATED RECOMBINANT G-CSF DESIGNED

TO ALLOW FOR LESS FREQUENT DOSING. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR

INITIAL PAYMENTS OF UP TO $10 MILLION FOR INS-19 AND

INS-20. MERCK WILL PAY INSMED THE REMAINING BALANCE UPON CLOSING

OF THE TRANSACTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER MILESTONE OR ROYALTY

OBLIGATIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, MERCK AND JAPAN TOBACCO INC. (JT)

SIGNED A WORLDWIDE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP AND

COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305, AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL OSTEOANABOLIC

(BONE GROWTH STIMULATING) AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF

OSTEOPOROSIS, A DISEASE WHICH REDUCES BONE DENSITY AND STRENGTH

AND RESULTS IN AN INCREASED RISK OF BONE FRACTURES. JTT-305 IS

AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL CALCIUM SENSING RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST THAT

IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED BY JT IN PHASE II CLINICAL

TRIALS IN JAPAN FOR ITS EFFECT ON INCREASING BONE DENSITY AND IS

IN PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS OUTSIDE OF JAPAN. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE AGREEMENT, MERCK GAINED WORLDWIDE RIGHTS, EXCEPT FOR JAPAN,

TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE JTT-305 AND CERTAIN OTHER RELATED

COMPOUNDS. JT RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $85 MILLION,

WHICH THE COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE,

AND IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS

96

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF A DRUG CANDIDATE COVERED BY THIS

AGREEMENT. JT WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ROYALTIES FROM

SALES OF ANY DRUG CANDIDATES THAT RECEIVE MARKETING APPROVAL.

THE LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN MERCK AND JT WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT

UNTIL EXPIRATION OF ALL ROYALTY AND MILESTONE OBLIGATIONS, AND

MAY BE TERMINATED IN THE EVENT OF AN UNCURED MATERIAL BREACH BY

THE OTHER PARTY. THE AGREEMENT MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED BY MERCK

WITHOUT CAUSE BEFORE INITIAL COMMERCIAL SALE OF JTT-305 BY

GIVING SIX MONTHS PRIOR NOTICE TO JT, AND THEREAFTER BY GIVING

ONE YEAR PRIOR NOTICE THEREOF TO JT. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY

ALSO BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY BY MERCK IF MERCK DETERMINES DUE

TO SAFETY

AND/OR

EFFICACY CONCERNS BASED ON AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO

CEASE DEVELOPMENT OF JTT-305

AND/OR

TO

WITHDRAW JTT-305 FROM THE MARKET ON A PERMANENT BASIS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS COLLABORATION WITH

FOXHOLLOW TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (FOXHOLLOW) FOR

ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE ANALYSIS. THE COLLABORATION WAS ENTERED

INTO IN 2005 AND EXPANDED IN 2006 WHEREBY MERCK ACQUIRED AN

EQUITY INTEREST IN FOXHOLLOW.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS COLLABORATION WITH

DYNAVAX TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF V270, AN

INVESTIGATIONAL HEPATITIS B VACCINE, WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO IN

2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

NOVACARDIA, INC. (NOVACARDIA), A PRIVATELY HELD

CLINICAL-STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE. THIS ACQUISITION ADDED ROLOFYLLINE (MK-7418),

NOVACARDIAS INVESTIGATIONAL PHASE III COMPOUND FOR

ACUTE HEART FAILURE, TO MERCKS PIPELINE. MERCK ACQUIRED

ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF NOVACARDIA FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE

PRICE OF $366.4 MILLION (INCLUDING $16.4 MILLION OF

CASH AND INVESTMENTS ON HAND AT CLOSING), WHICH WAS PAID THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF 7.3 MILLION SHARES OF MERCK COMMON STOCK TO

THE FORMER NOVACARDIA SHAREHOLDERS BASED ON MERCKS AVERAGE

CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO CLOSING OF THE

ACQUISITION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $325.1 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH

ASSOCIATED WITH ROLOFYLLINE AS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE,

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE CHARGE, WHICH IS NOT

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, WAS RECORDED IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE PRESENT

VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM THIS

TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF ITS TECHNICAL AND

MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING AN INCOME APPROACH REFLECTING AN

APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 22.0%. THE ONGOING

ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ROLOFYLLINE

CONTINUES AND THE COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES. THE REMAINING PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO CASH AND

INVESTMENTS OF $16.4 MILLION, A DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATING

TO A NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD OF $23.9 MILLION AND

OTHER NET ASSETS OF $1.0 MILLION. BECAUSE NOVACARDIA WAS A

DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS PLANNED

PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN

ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND,

THEREFORE, GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED. NOVACARDIAS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE.

ALSO IN 2007, MERCK AND GTX, INC. (GTX) ENTERED INTO

AN AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL

STRATEGIC COLLABORATION FOR SELECTIVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR

MODULATORS (SARMS), A NEW CLASS OF DRUGS WITH THE

POTENTIAL TO TREAT AGE-RELATED MUSCLE LOSS (SARCOPENIA) AS WELL

AS OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. ALSO IN 2007, MERCK AND

ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (ARIAD) ENTERED INTO A

GLOBAL COLLABORATION TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

DEFOROLIMUS (MK-8669), ARIADS NOVEL MTOR INHIBITOR, FOR

USE IN CANCER. THESE COLLABORATIONS GENERALLY CONTINUE IN EFFECT

UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF ALL ROYALTY AND MILESTONE PAYMENT

OBLIGATIONS. THESE COLLABORATIONS MAY GENERALLY BE TERMINATED IN

THE EVENT OF INSOLVENCY OR A MATERIAL UNCURED BREACH BY EITHER

PARTY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN MERCK

AND GTX MAY BE TERMINATED BY MERCK UPON NINETY DAYS NOTICE TO

GTX AT ANY TIME AFTER DECEMBER 18, 2009. THE COLLABORATION

AGREEMENT BETWEEN MERCK AND ARIAD MAY BE TERMINATED BY MERCK

UPON THE FAILURE OF MK-8669 TO MEET CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTAL AND

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS OR IN THE EVENT MERCK CONCLUDES IT IS NOT

ADVISABLE TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MK-8669 FOR USE IN A

CANCER INDICATION. IN ADDITION, MERCK MAY TERMINATE THE ARIAD

COLLABORATION AGREEMENT ON OR AFTER THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE

EFFECTIVE DATE BY PROVIDING AT LEAST 12 MONTHS PRIOR

WRITTEN NOTICE. UPON TERMINATION OF THE ARIAD COLLABORATION

AGREEMENT, DEPENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PARTIES HAVE

VARYING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTINUED

DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MK-8669 AND CONTINUING

ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS.

ON DECEMBER 29, 2006, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

SIRNA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (SIRNA) FOR $13 PER SHARE

IN CASH, FOR A TOTAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION,

WHICH INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF ALL OUTSTANDING SIRNA

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHARES, WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS. THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE

OF $1.1 BILLION WAS PAID ON JANUARY 3, 2007. SIRNA WAS

A PUBLICLY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS DEVELOPING A NEW

CLASS OF MEDICINES BASED ON RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI)

TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF

DISEASE. RNAI-BASED THERAPEUTICS SELECTIVELY CATALYZE THE

DESTRUCTION OF THE RNA TRANSCRIBED FROM AN INDIVIDUAL GENE. THE

ACQUISITION OF SIRNA HAS INCREASED MERCKS ABILITY TO USE

RNAI TECHNOLOGY TO TURN OFF A TARGETED GENE IN A HUMAN CELL,

POTENTIALLY RENDERING INOPERATIVE A GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR

TRIGGERING A SPECIFIC DISEASE. THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

,

IN WHICH THE

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM SIRNA AT THE

DATE OF ACQUISITION WERE RECORDED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR

VALUES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE IN THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR

VALUES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED NET ASSETS WAS RECORDED AS GOODWILL OF

$369.2 MILLION. THE GOODWILL WAS FULLY ALLOCATED TO THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.

ALSO, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $466.2 MILLION FOR

ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH SIRNAS COMPOUNDS

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, FOR WHICH, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE,

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE

RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS FOR BOTH THE HEPATITIS

B AND HEPATITIS C VIRUSES, WHICH WERE IN PRECLINICAL

DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS LICENSING AGREEMENTS HELD BY SIRNA. THE

CHARGE, WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, WAS RECORDED

IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED

UPON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF NEW

PRODUCT CANDIDATES RESULTING FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR

THE PROBABILITY OF ITS TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING

AN INCOME APPROACH REFLECTING APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT

RATES OF 27.0% TO 30.0%. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO

EACH OF THESE COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES AND THE

COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THE ALLOCATION

OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALSO RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF AN

INTANGIBLE ASSET OF $357.8 MILLION AND A RELATED DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITY OF $146.3 MILLION, AS WELL AS OTHER ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES - NET OF $89.3 MILLION. THE INTANGIBLE

ASSET RELATES TO SIRNAS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE

USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND HAS

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES. THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING

AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER A SEVEN YEAR USEFUL LIFE. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL

INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE SIRNAS HISTORICAL

FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON

DECEMBER 29, 2006, AND ACCORDINGLY, SIRNAS OPERATING

RESULTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2007.

IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY

OF GLYCOFI, INC. (GLYCOFI) FOR APPROXIMATELY

$373 MILLION IN CASH ($400 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE NET

OF $25 MILLION IN SHARES ALREADY OWNED AND NET TRANSACTION

COSTS). GLYCOFI WAS A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN

THE FIELD OF YEAST GLYCOENGINEERING, WHICH IS THE ADDITION OF

SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROTEINS IN YEAST,

AND OPTIMIZATION OF BIOLOGIC DRUG MOLECULES. GLYCOFIS

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GLYCOPROTEINS,

AS WELL AS THE OPTIMIZATION OF A GLYCOPROTEIN TARGET. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE

OF $296.3 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH

GLYCOFIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO BE USED IN THE RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, FOR WHICH, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE,

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THIS CHARGE IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE

FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE TECHNOLOGY IS CURRENTLY BEING UTILIZED IN

MERCKS PIPELINE OF BIOLOGICS. THE CHARGE WAS RECORDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON

THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF NEW PRODUCT

CANDIDATES RESULTING FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR THE

PROBABILITY OF ITS TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING AN

INCOME APPROACH REFLECTING THE APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED

DISCOUNT RATE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A $99.4 MILLION

INTANGIBLE ASSET ($57.6 MILLION NET OF DEFERRED TAXES)

RELATED TO GLYCOFIS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE USED

IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND HAS

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES. THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING

AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER A FIVE YEAR USEFUL LIFE. THE REMAINING NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED IN THIS TRANSACTION WERE NOT MATERIAL. BECAUSE GLYCOFI

WAS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS

PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR

AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS

COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED.

GLYCOFIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE EQUITY OF ABMAXIS,

INC. (ABMAXIS) FOR APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION IN

CASH. ABMAXIS WAS A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

DEDICATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND OPTIMIZATION OF MONOCLONAL

ANTIBODY (MAB) PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN THERAPEUTICS AND

DIAGNOSTICS. ABMAXIS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A BREAKTHROUGH

ANTIBODY ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, ABMAXIS

IN-SILICO

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMMUNIZATION, WHICH HAS ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES TO THE COMPANY

WITH NO SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL OR ENGINEERING RISKS AT THE

DATE OF ACQUISITION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE

COMPANY ALLOCATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO

ABMAXIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND RECORDED AN INTANGIBLE

ASSET OF $135.3 MILLION ($78.5 MILLION NET OF DEFERRED

TAXES). THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A FIVE YEAR

USEFUL LIFE. THE REMAINING NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THIS

TRANSACTION WERE NOT MATERIAL. BECAUSE ABMAXIS WAS A DEVELOPMENT

STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL

OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION

OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE,

GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED. ABMAXIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

WHILE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. MERCK RELIES ON SUSTAINED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM

FOREIGN SOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THE EXTENT

THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CASH FLOWS IS DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF A

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND

RESEARCH AND OTHER DOLLAR-BASED STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AT A

CONSISTENT LEVEL MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO

PROTECT AGAINST VOLATILITY OF FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS

AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR LONGER-TERM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TO DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, PRIMARILY

THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE

COMPANY WILL PARTIALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED THIRD-PARTY SALES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER ITS PLANNING CYCLE, TYPICALLY NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL LAYER IN

HEDGES OVER TIME, INCREASING THE PORTION OF SALES HEDGED AS IT

GETS CLOSER TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUCH THAT

IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. THE

PORTION OF SALES HEDGED IS BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF COST-BENEFIT

PROFILES THAT CONSIDER NATURAL OFFSETTING EXPOSURES, REVENUE AND

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, AND THE COST OF

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES ARE A

SPECIFIED COMPONENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF SIMILARLY DENOMINATED

FOREIGN CURRENCY-BASED SALES TRANSACTIONS, EACH OF WHICH

RESPONDS TO THE HEDGED RISK IN THE SAME MANNER. MERCK MANAGES

ITS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH PURCHASED

LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS, WHICH PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A

RIGHT, BUT NOT AN OBLIGATION, TO SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE

FUTURE AT A PREDETERMINED PRICE. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED

SALES, TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS OFFSET THE

DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS OF

THE HEDGED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE

U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS, THE OPTIONS VALUE REDUCES TO

ZERO, BUT THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF

THE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.

THE DESIGNATED HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON TOTAL CHANGES IN

THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ENTIRE FAIR VALUE

CHANGE IN THE OPTIONS IS DEFERRED IN AOCI AND RECLASSIFIED INTO

SALES WHEN THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE

HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS

IS

DE MINIMIS

. THE FAIR VALUES OF PURCHASED CURRENCY

OPTIONS ARE REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OR OTHER ASSETS. THE

CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS FROM THE EFFECTS OF

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEIR

CONVERSION TO U.S. DOLLARS. MERCK PRINCIPALLY UTILIZES

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO BUY AND

SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

AND ECONOMICALLY OFFSET THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS DERIVED

FROM THE NET ASSETS. MERCK ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS TO

OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES DENOMINATED IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRY CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE

YEN. FOR EXPOSURES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CURRENCIES, THE COMPANY

WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE

EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES WHEN IT IS DEEMED ECONOMICAL TO

DO SO BASED ON A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE

MAGNITUDE OF THE EXPOSURE, THE VOLATILITY OF THE EXCHANGE RATE

AND THE COST OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO

MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE ON MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES BY MANAGING OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND NET ASSET

POSITIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

REMEASURED AT SPOT RATES IN EFFECT ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

WITH THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SPOT RATES REPORTED IN OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. THE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED

AS HEDGES AND ARE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH OTHER (INCOME)

EXPENSE, NET. ACCORDINGLY, FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

CONTRACTS HELP MITIGATE THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE

REMEASURED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE

SPOT-FORWARD DIFFERENCES. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT

DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS, WHICH TYPICALLY

HAVE AVERAGE MATURITIES AT INCEPTION OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR.

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

SECURITIES DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN SPOT RATES ARE OFFSET IN OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, BY THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

CONTRACTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPOT RATE FLUCTUATIONS. HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL DURING 2008, 2007 OR 2006.

CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTS FAIR VALUE DUE TO SPOT-FORWARD

DIFFERENCES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DESIGNATED HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

AND RECOGNIZED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. THESE AMOUNTS

WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008,

2007 OR 2006.

THE FAIR VALUES OF FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED IN

THE FOLLOWING FOUR BALANCE SHEET LINE ITEMS: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

(CURRENT PORTION OF GAIN POSITION), OTHER ASSETS (NON-CURRENT

PORTION OF GAIN POSITION), ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

(CURRENT PORTION OF LOSS POSITION), OR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND

NONCURRENT LIABILITIES (NON-CURRENT PORTION OF LOSS POSITION).

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ON CERTAIN

INVESTING AND BORROWING TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE ITS NET EXPOSURE

TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND TO REDUCE ITS OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE LEVERAGED SWAPS AND, IN

GENERAL, DOES NOT LEVERAGE ANY OF ITS INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT

WOULD PUT PRINCIPAL CAPITAL AT RISK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY TO TWO

PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

MATURING IN 2011 WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $125 MILLION EACH

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE

NOTES. THE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS

TO FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE

NOTES ARE OFFSET IN INTEREST EXPENSE BY THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES

IN THE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OTHER ASSETS, ACCRUED AND OTHER

CURRENT LIABILITIES, OR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND NONCURRENT

LIABILITIES. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED FOUR INTEREST

RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $250 MILLION

EACH, AND TERMINATED ONE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT WITH A

NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION. THESE SWAPS HAD

EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED ITS $1.0 BILLION, 4.75% FIXED-RATE

NOTES DUE 2015 AND ITS $500 MILLION, 4.375% FIXED-RATE

NOTES DUE 2013 TO VARIABLE RATE DEBT. AS A RESULT OF THE SWAP

TERMINATIONS, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $128.3 MILLION IN CASH,

EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL. THE

CORRESPONDING GAINS RELATED TO THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT OF THE DEBT

ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATED SWAP CONTRACTS WERE DEFERRED AND

ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE NOTES. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS

ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 157, WHICH

CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK

FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED

FSP 157-2

THAT DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FAS 157 FOR ONE YEAR

FOR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE

ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED

FSP 157-3,

WHICH CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF FAS 157 IN A MARKET THAT

IS NOT ACTIVE. FAS 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE EXCHANGE

PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY (AN EXIT PRICE) IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS

MARKET FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

FAS 157 ALSO ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH

REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND

MINIMIZE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WHEN MEASURING FAIR

VALUE. FAS 157 DESCRIBES THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE

USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.

LEVEL 1

 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR

IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE COMPANYS LEVEL 1

ASSETS INCLUDE EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN AN ACTIVE

EXCHANGE MARKET.

LEVEL 2

 OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN

LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES; OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE

CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE

FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE COMPANYS

LEVEL 2 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE DEBT

SECURITIES WITH QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE TRADED LESS FREQUENTLY

THAN EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS, CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS,

U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, CERTAIN

MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, MUNICIPAL

SECURITIES, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WHOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED

USING PRICING MODELS WITH INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE

MARKET OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED BY

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

LEVEL 3

 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE

SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY AND THAT ARE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS,

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGIES, OR SIMILAR TECHNIQUES, AS

WELL AS INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR ESTIMATION. THE COMPANYS

LEVEL 3 ASSETS MAINLY INCLUDE MORTGAGE-BACKED AND

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN CORPORATE NOTES AND

BONDS WITH LIMITED MARKET ACTIVITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

$96.6 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 0.9%, OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3 FAIR

VALUE ASSETS (ALL OF WHICH WERE PLEDGED UNDER CERTAIN COLLATERAL

ARRANGEMENTS (SEE NOTE 15)). ALL OF THE ASSETS CLASSIFIED

AS LEVEL 3 AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WERE ACQUIRED WHEN THE

COMPANY ELECTED TO BE

REDEEMED-IN-KIND

FROM A SHORT-TERM FIXED INCOME FUND THAT RESTRICTED CASH

REDEMPTIONS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

IF THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES FALL WITHIN MORE THAN ONE LEVEL DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE

CATEGORIZATION IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT.

ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD $1,273.1 MILLION

INVESTED IN A SHORT-TERM FIXED INCOME FUND (THE

FUND). DUE TO MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS, CASH

REDEMPTIONS FROM THE FUND WERE RESTRICTED. AS A RESULT OF THIS

RESTRICTION ON CASH REDEMPTIONS, THE COMPANY DID NOT CONSIDER

THE FUND TO BE TRADED IN AN ACTIVE MARKET WITH OBSERVABLE

PRICING ON JANUARY 1, 2008 AND THESE AMOUNTS WERE

CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3. ON JANUARY 7, 2008, THE

COMPANY ELECTED TO BE

REDEEMED-IN-KIND

FROM THE FUND AND RECEIVED ITS SHARE OF THE UNDERLYING

SECURITIES OF THE FUND. AS A RESULT, $1,099.7 MILLION OF

THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WERE TRANSFERRED OUT OF LEVEL 3

AS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THESE SECURITIES HAD OBSERVABLE

MARKETS. ON DECEMBER 31, 2008, $96.6 MILLION OF THE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

REDEMPTION-IN-KIND

WERE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 AS THE SECURITIES CONTAINED AT

LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT INPUT WHICH WAS UNOBSERVABLE. THESE

SECURITIES ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTIRE BALANCE OF THE COMPANYS

LEVEL 3 ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

SOME OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS BUT ARE RECORDED AT

AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THEIR LIQUID OR

SHORT-TERM NATURE, SUCH AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS LOANS PAYABLE AND

LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT PORTION) AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 WAS $6,294.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF

$6,240.4 MILLION AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE WAS $5,815.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH A CARRYING

AMOUNT OF $5,739.4 MILLION. FAIR VALUE WAS ESTIMATED USING

QUOTED DEALER PRICES.

LETTER OF

CREDIT

IN AUGUST 2008, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A $4.1 BILLION LETTER

OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH

SATISFIED CERTAIN CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE U.S.

VIOXX

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 10). THE COMPANY PLEDGED

COLLATERAL TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OF APPROXIMATELY

$5.1 BILLION PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT

AGREEMENT. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL

IS SET BY THE LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT AND SUCH ASSETS ARE

HELD IN CUSTODY BY A THIRD PARTY, THE ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE ASSETS PLEDGED UNDER THE

LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT TO BE RESTRICTED. AS A RESULT,

$2.1 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLASSIFIED AS RESTRICTED CURRENT ASSETS AND

$1.6 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS RESTRICTED

NON-CURRENT ASSETS. THE LETTER OF CREDIT AMOUNT AND REQUIRED

COLLATERAL BALANCES WILL DECLINE AS PAYMENTS (AFTER THE FIRST

$750 MILLION) UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ARE MADE. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, $3.8 BILLION WAS RECORDED WITHIN

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND

$1.3 BILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS.

CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT RISK

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY MONITORS CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CORPORATE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES AND

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS. CREDIT

EXPOSURE LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED TO LIMIT A CONCENTRATION WITH

ANY SINGLE ISSUER OR INSTITUTION. CASH AND INVESTMENTS ARE

PLACED IN INSTRUMENTS THAT MEET HIGH CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS,

AS SPECIFIED IN THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICY GUIDELINES.

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) (COLLECTIVELY THE

PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE

EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED

STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT

AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY

PROVIDE FOR EQUAL SHARING OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND FOR

CO-PROMOTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS BY EACH COMPANY. IN 2001, THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO

INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN

2002, EZETIMIBE, THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES

AS

ZETIA

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES). IN 2004, A COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

, WAS APPROVED

IN THE UNITED STATES AS

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES).

THE CHOLESTEROL AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE SHARING OF OPERATING

INCOME GENERATED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL

PARTNERSHIP (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP) BASED UPON

PERCENTAGES THAT VARY BY PRODUCT, SALES LEVEL AND COUNTRY. IN

THE U.S. MARKET, THE PARTNERS SHARE PROFITS ON

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

SALES EQUALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

FIRST $300 MILLION OF ANNUAL

ZETIA

SALES ON WHICH

SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVES A GREATER SHARE OF PROFITS. OPERATING

INCOME INCLUDES EXPENSES THAT THE PARTNERS HAVE CONTRACTUALLY

AGREED TO SHARE, SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANUFACTURING COSTS,

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED PROMOTION COSTS (INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND DIRECT AND IDENTIFIABLE

OUT-OF-POCKET PROMOTION) AND OTHER AGREED UPON COSTS FOR

SPECIFIC SERVICES SUCH AS ON-GOING CLINICAL RESEARCH, MARKET

SUPPORT, MARKET RESEARCH, MARKET EXPANSION, AS WELL AS A

SPECIALTY SALES FORCE AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. EXPENSES

INCURRED IN SUPPORT OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP BUT NOT SHARED

BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, SUCH AS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES (INCLUDING CERTAIN SALES FORCE COSTS), AS WELL AS

CERTAIN MANUFACTURING COSTS, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME

FROM AFFILIATES. HOWEVER, THESE COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE

105

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVERALL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY. CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY SHARED EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER

ADJUSTING FOR EARNED MILESTONES.

SEE NOTE 10 FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO LITIGATION

INVOLVING THE MSP PARTNERSHIP AND THE PARTNERS RELATED TO THE

SALE AND PROMOTION OF

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN.

THE RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AGREEMENTS PROVIDED FOR THE JOINT

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE PARTNERS

OF A ONCE-DAILY, FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENTS MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE. MONTELUKAST

SODIUM, A LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IS SOLD BY MERCK AS

SINGULAIR

AND LORATADINE, AN ANTIHISTAMINE, IS SOLD BY

SCHERING-PLOUGH AS CLARITIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE INDICATED FOR THE

RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS. DURING 2008, THE

PARTNERS RECEIVED A NOT-APPROVABLE LETTER FROM THE

U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOR THE

PROPOSED FIXED COMBINATION OF LORATADINE/MONTELUKAST AND

SUBSEQUENTLY ANNOUNCED THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE NEW DRUG

APPLICATION FOR THE COMBINATION TABLET. THE COMPANIES ALSO

TERMINATED THE RESPIRATORY JOINT VENTURE. THIS ACTION HAD NO

IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS OF THE CHOLESTEROL JOINT VENTURE. AS A

RESULT OF THE TERMINATION OF THE RESPIRATORY JOINT VENTURE, THE

COMPANY WAS OBLIGATED TO SCHERING-PLOUGH IN THE AMOUNT OF

$105 MILLION AS SPECIFIED IN THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS.

THIS RESULTED IN A CHARGE OF $43 MILLION DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2008 WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES. THE REMAINING AMOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE

REMAINING PATENT LIFE OF

ZETIA

THROUGH 2016.

ASTRAZENECA

LP

IN 1982, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRAS PRODUCTS

UNDER A ROYALTY-BEARING LICENSE. IN 1993, THE COMPANYS

TOTAL SALES OF ASTRA PRODUCTS REACHED A LEVEL THAT TRIGGERED THE

FIRST STEP IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT VENTURE BUSINESS

CARRIED ON BY ASTRA MERCK INC. (AMI), IN WHICH MERCK

AND ASTRA EACH OWNED A 50% SHARE. THIS JOINT VENTURE, FORMED IN

1994, DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW

PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING

PRILOSEC,

THE FIRST OF A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM

THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, MERCK AND ASTRA COMPLETED THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE

OWNERSHIP AND OPERATIONS OF THE JOINT VENTURE WHEREBY THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN AMI, RENAMED KBI INC.

(KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED KBIS OPERATING ASSETS

TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS

L.P. (THE PARTNERSHIP), IN EXCHANGE FOR A 1% LIMITED

PARTNER INTEREST. ASTRA CONTRIBUTED THE NET ASSETS OF ITS WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ASTRA USA, INC., TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN

EXCHANGE FOR A 99% GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP,

RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP) UPON ASTRAS 1999

MERGER WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC (THE ASTRAZENECA

MERGER), BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS

FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS.

106

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE MAINTAINING A 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN AZLP, MERCK

HAS CONSENT AND PROTECTIVE RIGHTS INTENDED TO PRESERVE ITS

BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

POWER OF THE GENERAL PARTNER TO MAKE CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS OR

DISPOSITIONS. FURTHERMORE, IN LIMITED EVENTS OF DEFAULT,

ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WILL BE GRANTED TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING

POWERS TO DIRECT THE ACTIONS OF, OR REMOVE AND REPLACE, THE

PARTNERSHIPS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER. MERCK EARNS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT

AND FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS AND SUCH REVENUE WAS $1.6 BILLION,

$1.7 BILLION AND $1.8 BILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM,

AS

WELL AS

PRILOSEC

. IN ADDITION, MERCK EARNS CERTAIN

PARTNERSHIP RETURNS WHICH ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM

AFFILIATES AS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. SUCH RETURNS INCLUDE

A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT,

VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER

ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING

MERCKS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED AZLP GAAP EARNINGS. THE

ASTRAZENECA MERGER TRIGGERED A PARTIAL REDEMPTION IN MARCH 2008

OF MERCKS INTEREST IN CERTAIN AZLP PRODUCT RIGHTS. UPON

THIS REDEMPTION, MERCK RECEIVED $4.3 BILLION FROM AZLP.

THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED PRIMARILY ON A MULTIPLE OF MERCKS

AVERAGE ANNUAL VARIABLE RETURNS DERIVED FROM SALES OF THE FORMER

ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS FOR THE THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THE

REDEMPTION (THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED

VALUE). MERCK RECORDED A $1.5 BILLION PRETAX GAIN ON

THE PARTIAL REDEMPTION IN 2008. THE PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF

MERCKS INTEREST IN THE PRODUCT RIGHTS DID NOT RESULT IN A

CHANGE IN MERCKS 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, ASTRA PURCHASED AN

OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS DEFERRED INCOME, TO

BUY MERCKS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE

GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

(THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS). THE ASSET OPTION IS

EXERCISABLE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010 AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL

TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 OF PROJECTED

FUTURE PRETAX REVENUE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FROM THE

NON-PPI PRODUCTS (THE APPRAISED VALUE). MERCK ALSO

HAD THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008

AT THE APPRAISED VALUE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ADVISED

AZLP THAT IT WOULD NOT EXERCISE THE ASSET OPTION, THUS THE

$443.0 MILLION REMAINS DEFERRED. IN ADDITION, IN 1998 THE

COMPANY GRANTED ASTRA AN OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION)

TO BUY MERCKS COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI, AND,

THEREFORE, MERCKS INTEREST IN

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

, EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS

EXERCISE OF THE ASSET OPTION. ASTRA CAN ALSO EXERCISE THE SHARES

OPTION IN 2017 OR IF COMBINED ANNUAL SALES OF THE TWO PRODUCTS

FALL BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG

AS ASTRAZENECAS ASSET OPTION HAS BEEN EXERCISED IN 2010.

THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR THE SHARES OPTION IS BASED ON THE NET

PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE, SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN

TRUE-UP

MECHANISMS.

THE ASTRAZENECA MERGER CONSTITUTED A TRIGGER EVENT UNDER THE KBI

RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN EXCHANGE

FOR MERCKS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA

PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT THE

TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4 MILLION (THE

ADVANCE PAYMENT). THE ADVANCE PAYMENT WAS DEFERRED

AS IT REMAINED SUBJECT TO A

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION (THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT) THAT WAS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE FAIR MARKET

VALUE IN MARCH 2008 OF THE ASTRA PRODUCT RIGHTS RETAINED BY THE

COMPANY. THE CALCULATED

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT OF $243.7 MILLION WAS RETURNED TO AZLP IN MARCH 2008

AND MERCK RECOGNIZED A PRETAX GAIN OF $723.7 MILLION

RELATED TO THE RESIDUAL ADVANCE PAYMENT BALANCE.

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS,

BECAUSE A TRIGGER EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE SUM OF THE LIMITED

PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE, THE APPRAISED VALUE AND THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT WAS GUARANTEED TO BE A MINIMUM OF $4.7 BILLION.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE LESS

PAYMENT OF THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT RESULTED IN CASH RECEIPTS TO MERCK OF $4.0 BILLION

AND AN AGGREGATE PRETAX GAIN OF $2.2 BILLION WHICH IS

INCLUDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. ASTRAZENECAS

PURCHASE OF MERCKS INTEREST IN THE NON-PPI PRODUCTS IS

CONTINGENT UPON THE EXERCISE OF THE ASSET OPTION BY ASTRAZENECA

IN 2010 AND, THEREFORE, PAYMENT OF THE APPRAISED VALUE MAY OR

MAY NOT OCCUR. ALSO, IN MARCH 2008, THE $1.38 BILLION

OUTSTANDING LOAN FROM ASTRA PLUS INTEREST THROUGH THE REDEMPTION

DATE WAS SETTLED. AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM AZLP OF $2.6 BILLION.

CONTINGENCIES

AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS

WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS. THE

COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY

AS ASSESSMENTS CHANGE OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, A PORTION OF THE

OVERALL ACCRUAL IS ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED AND CONSIDERS SUCH

FACTORS AS PAST EXPERIENCE, NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND

ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. INDIVIDUALLY

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LOSSES ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE

INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

THE COMPANYS DECISION TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE IS

DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING COST AND AVAILABILITY,

EXISTING AT THE TIME SUCH DECISIONS ARE MADE. AS A RESULT OF A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE HAS BECOME LESS

AVAILABLE WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE

COMPANY HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST

OF OBTAINING PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY

BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS AVAILABLE AND AS SUCH, HAS NO

INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE

AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD

AFTER THAT DATE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS

INSURANCE NEEDS AND THE COSTS, AVAILABILITY AND BENEFITS OF

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE.

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM),

JUDGE HIGBEE HAS DISMISSED THESE CASES WITHOUT PREJUDICE FOR

ADMINISTRATIVE REASONS.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH

THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE

PLAINTIFFS STEERING COMMITTEE (PSC) OF THE

FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA

STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC STROKE

(IS) CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED

STATES. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED

CLAIMS, WAS SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH

THREE OF THE FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE

THAN 95% OF THE U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY TO

U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI OR

IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL PAY A FIXED AGGREGATE

AMOUNT OF $4.85 BILLION INTO TWO FUNDS ($4.0 BILLION

FOR MI CLAIMS AND $850 MILLION FOR IS CLAIMS) FOR

QUALIFYING CLAIMS THAT ENTER INTO THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WILL BE EXAMINED BY ADMINISTRATORS OF THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM TO DETERMINE QUALIFICATION BASED ON

OBJECTIVE, DOCUMENTED FACTS PROVIDED BY CLAIMANTS, INCLUDING

RECORDS SUFFICIENT FOR A SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF INDEPENDENT

RISK FACTORS. THE CONDITIONS IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ALSO

REQUIRE CLAIMANTS TO PASS THREE GATES: AN INJURY GATE, A

DURATION GATE, AND A PROXIMITY GATE (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT).

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT MERCK DOES NOT ADMIT

CAUSATION OR FAULT. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDED THAT

MERCKS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE TRIGGERED ONLY IF,

AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS, (1) LAW FIRMS ON THE FEDERAL AND

STATE PSCS AND FIRMS THAT HAVE TRIED CASES IN THE COORDINATED

PROCEEDINGS ELECT TO RECOMMEND ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM TO 100%

OF THEIR CLIENTS WHO ALLEGE EITHER MI OR IS, AND (2) BY

JUNE 30, 2008, PLAINTIFFS ENROLL IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM

AT LEAST 85% OF EACH OF ALL CURRENTLY PENDING AND TOLLED

(I) MI CLAIMS, (II) IS CLAIMS, (III) ELIGIBLE MI

AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH INVOLVE DEATH, AND

(IV) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH ALLEGE MORE

THAN 12 MONTHS OF USE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, MERCK COULD EXERCISE A RIGHT TO WALK AWAY FROM THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IF THE THRESHOLDS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS

WERE NOT MET. THE COMPANY WAIVED THAT RIGHT AS OF AUGUST 4,

2008. THE WAIVER OF THAT RIGHT TRIGGERED MERCKS OBLIGATION

TO PAY A FIXED TOTAL OF $4.85 BILLION. PAYMENTS WILL BE

MADE IN INSTALLMENTS INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS. THE FIRST

PAYMENT OF $500 MILLION WAS MADE IN AUGUST 2008 AND AN

ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OF $250 MILLION WAS MADE IN OCTOBER

2008. INTERIM PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO

ALLEGED THAT THEY SUFFERED AN MI AND THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES

THAT INTERIM PAYMENTS TO IS CLAIMANTS WILL BEGIN SHORTLY.

ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE ON A PERIODIC BASIS GOING

FORWARD, WHEN AND AS NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS OF CLAIMS AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

MERCKS TOTAL PAYMENT FOR BOTH FUNDS OF $4.85 BILLION

IS A FIXED AMOUNT TO BE ALLOCATED AMONG QUALIFYING CLAIMANTS

BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION. THE DISTRIBUTION OF

INTERIM PAYMENTS TO QUALIFIED CLAIMANTS BEGAN IN AUGUST 2008 AND

WILL CONTINUE ON A ROLLING BASIS UNTIL ALL CLAIMANTS WHO QUALIFY

FOR AN INTERIM PAYMENT ARE PAID. FINAL PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE

AFTER THE EXAMINATION OF ALL OF THE ELIGIBLE CLAIMS HAS BEEN

COMPLETED.

AFTER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 9,

2007, JUDGES IN THE FEDERAL MDL, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS AND NEW

JERSEY STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS ENTERED A SERIES OF ORDERS.

THE ORDERS: (1) TEMPORARILY STAYED THEIR RESPECTIVE

LITIGATIONS; (2) REQUIRED PLAINTIFFS TO REGISTER THEIR

CLAIMS BY JANUARY 15, 2008; (3) REQUIRED PLAINTIFFS

WITH CASES PENDING AS OF NOVEMBER 9, 2007 TO PRESERVE AND

PRODUCE RECORDS AND SERVE EXPERT REPORTS; AND (4) REQUIRED

PLAINTIFFS WHO FILE THEREAFTER TO MAKE SIMILAR PRODUCTIONS ON AN

ACCELERATED SCHEDULE. THE CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA AND WASHOE

COUNTY, NEVADA COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS WERE ALSO GENERALLY

STAYED.

AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2008, THE DEADLINE FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM, MORE THAN 48,100 OF THE APPROXIMATELY 48,325

INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND

WHOSE CLAIMS WERE NOT 1) DISMISSED, 2) EXPECTED TO BE

DISMISSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, OR 3) TOLLED CLAIMS THAT

APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED

111

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HAD SUBMITTED SOME OR ALL OF THE MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR

ENROLLMENT IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THIS REPRESENTS

APPROXIMATELY 99.8% OF THE ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY

REGISTERED WITH THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

ON APRIL 14, 2008 AND JUNE 3, 2008, TWO GROUPS OF

VARIOUS PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS FILED SUIT

AGAINST BROWNGREER, THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM (THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR), AND

U.S. BANCORP, ESCROW AGENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM (THE

AVMED AND GREATER NEW YORK BENEFIT FUND

SUITS). THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS CLAIM

TO HAVE PAID HEALTHCARE COSTS ON BEHALF OF SOME OF THE ENROLLING

CLAIMANTS AND SEEK TO ENJOIN THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR FROM

PAYING ENROLLED CLAIMANTS UNTIL THEIR CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

FROM THE ENROLLED CLAIMANTS ARE RESOLVED. EACH GROUP SOUGHT

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS. JUDGE

FALLON DENIED THESE REQUESTS. IN AVMED, THE DEFENDANTS MOVED TO

SEVER THE CLAIMS OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS AND, IN GREATER NEW

YORK BENEFIT FUND, TO STRIKE THE CLASS ALLEGATIONS. JUDGE FALLON

GRANTED THESE MOTIONS. AVMED APPEALED BOTH OF THESE DECISIONS.

THE FIFTH CIRCUIT HEARD ARGUMENT ON AVMEDS APPEAL ON

NOVEMBER 4, 2008. ON NOVEMBER 17, 2008, THE COURT OF

APPEALS AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURTS RULING THAT DENIED

THE TWO MOTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. GREATER NEW

YORK BENEFIT FUND HAS SERVED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. ON

JANUARY 22, 2009, THE PSC AND COUNSEL FOR CERTAIN PRIVATE

INSURERS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THE

AGREEMENT PROVIDES A PROGRAM FOR RESOLUTION OF LIENS ASSERTED BY

PRIVATE INSURERS AGAINST PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY CERTAIN CLAIMANTS

WHO HAVE ENROLLED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THE AGREEMENT CAN

BE TERMINATED BY THE PRIVATE INSURERS IF FEWER THAN 90% OF

ELIGIBLE CLAIMANTS PARTICIPATE. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE AVMED AND

GREATER NEW YORK BENEFIT FUND LAWSUITS HAVE AGREED TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT.

THERE ARE TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2009. THE COMPANY HAS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THE OUTCOMES OF SEVERAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT WERE TRIED PRIOR TO 2008.

JURIES HAVE NOW DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY TWELVE TIMES AND

IN PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FIVE TIMES. ONE MERCK VERDICT WAS SET

ASIDE BY THE COURT AND HAS NOT BEEN RETRIED. ANOTHER MERCK

VERDICT WAS SET ASIDE AND RETRIED, LEADING TO ONE OF THE FIVE

PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO UNRESOLVED

MISTRIALS. WITH RESPECT TO THE FIVE PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS,

MERCK FILED AN APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE

CASES. IN ONE OF THOSE FIVE, AN INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT

OVERTURNED THE TRIAL VERDICT AND DIRECTED THAT JUDGMENT BE

ENTERED FOR MERCK, AND IN ANOTHER, AN INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE

COURT OVERTURNED THE TRIAL VERDICT, ENTERING JUDGMENT FOR MERCK

ON ONE CLAIM AND ORDERING A NEW TRIAL ON THE REMAINING CLAIMS.

ALL BUT THE FOLLOWING THREE CASES THAT WENT TO TRIAL ARE NOW

RESOLVED: MCDARBY V. MERCK, ERNST V. MERCK, AND

GARZA V. MERCK.

THE FIRST, MCDARBY, WAS ORIGINALLY TRIED ALONG WITH A SECOND

PLAINTIFF, CONA, IN APRIL 2006, IN SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY,

LAW DIVISION, ATLANTIC COUNTY. THE JURY RETURNED A SPLIT

VERDICT. THE JURY DETERMINED THAT

VIOXX

DID NOT

SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEART ATTACK OF MR. CONA,

BUT DID SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEART ATTACK OF

MR. MCDARBY. THE JURY ALSO CONCLUDED THAT, IN EACH CASE,

MERCK VIOLATED NEW JERSEYS CONSUMER FRAUD STATUTE, WHICH

ALLOWS PLAINTIFFS TO RECEIVE THEIR EXPENSES FOR PURCHASING THE

DRUG, TREBLED, AS WELL AS REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES. THE

JURY AWARDED $4.5 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO

MR. MCDARBY AND HIS WIFE, WHO ALSO WAS A PLAINTIFF IN THAT

CASE, AS WELL AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $9 MILLION. ON

JUNE 8, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE DENIED MERCKS MOTION FOR A

NEW TRIAL. ON JUNE 15, 2007, JUDGE HIGBEE AWARDED

APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN

ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE

JUDGMENTS IN BOTH CASES AND THE APPELLATE DIVISION HELD ORAL

ARGUMENT ON BOTH CASES ON JANUARY 16, 2008. ON MAY 29,

2008, THE NEW JERSEY APPELLATE DIVISION VACATED THE CONSUMER

FRAUD AWARDS IN BOTH CASES ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE PRODUCT

LIABILITY ACT PROVIDES THE SOLE REMEDY FOR PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS. THE APPELLATE DIVISION ALSO VACATED THE MCDARBY PUNITIVE

DAMAGE AWARD ON THE GROUND OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND VACATED THE

ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS AWARDED UNDER THE CONSUMER FRAUD

ACT IN BOTH CASES. THE COURT UPHELD THE MCDARBY COMPENSATORY

AWARD. THE COMPANY HAS FILED WITH THE SUPREME COURT OF

NEW JERSEY A PETITION TO APPEAL THOSE PARTS OF THE TRIAL

COURTS RULINGS THAT THE APPELLATE DIVISION AFFIRMED.

PLAINTIFFS FILED A CROSS-PETITION TO APPEAL THOSE PARTS OF THE

TRIAL COURTS RULINGS THAT THE APPELLATE DIVISION REVERSED.

ON OCTOBER 8, 2008, THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY GRANTED

MERCKS PETITION FOR CERTIFICATION OF APPEAL, LIMITED

SOLELY TO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND

COSMETIC ACT PREEMPTS STATE LAW TORT CLAIMS PREDICATED ON THE

ALLEGED INADEQUACY OF WARNINGS CONTAINED IN

VIOXX

LABELING THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA. THE COURT DENIED THE

PLAINTIFFS CROSS-PETITION. ON DECEMBER 4, 2008, THE

NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT GRANTED MERCKS MOTION TO STAY THE

APPEAL PENDING THE ISSUANCE OF A DECISION FROM UNITED STATES

SUPREME COURT IN WYETH V. LEVINE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN SEPTEMBER 2006, MERCK FILED A NOTICE

OF APPEAL OF THE AUGUST 2005 JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE

PLAINTIFF IN THE TEXAS STATE COURT CASE, ERNST V. MERCK. ON

MAY 29, 2008, THE TEXAS COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE TRIAL

COURTS JUDGMENT AND ISSUED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MERCK.

THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND THE EVIDENCE TO BE LEGALLY

INSUFFICIENT ON THE ISSUE OF CAUSATION. PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A

MOTION FOR REHEARING

EN BANC

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS.

MERCK FILED A RESPONSE IN OCTOBER 2008. IN JANUARY 2009,

PLAINTIFFS FILED A REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REHEARING MOTION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN APRIL 2006, IN GARZA V. MERCK, A JURY

IN STATE COURT IN RIO GRANDE CITY, TEXAS RETURNED A VERDICT IN

FAVOR OF THE FAMILY OF DECEDENT LEONEL GARZA. THE JURY AWARDED A

TOTAL OF $7 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO

MR. GARZAS WIDOW AND THREE SONS. THE JURY ALSO

PURPORTED TO AWARD $25 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES EVEN

THOUGH UNDER TEXAS LAW, IN THIS CASE, POTENTIAL PUNITIVE DAMAGES

WERE CAPPED AT $750,000. ON MAY 14, 2008, THE

SAN ANTONIO COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE JUDGMENT AND

RENDERED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MERCK. ON DECEMBER 10,

2008, THE COURT OF APPEALS, ON REHEARING, VACATED ITS PRIOR

RULING AND ISSUED A REPLACEMENT. IN THE NEW RULING, THE COURT

ORDERED A TAKE-NOTHING JUDGMENT FOR MERCK ON THE DESIGN DEFECT

CLAIM, BUT REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL AS TO THE

STRICT LIABILITY CLAIM BECAUSE OF JUROR MISCONDUCT. ON

JANUARY 26, 2009, MERCK FILED A PETITION FOR REVIEW WITH

THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT.

MERCK VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

FROM THE MARKET ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. MOST STATES HAVE STATUTES OF

LIMITATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS OF NO MORE THAN THREE

YEARS, WHICH REQUIRE THAT CLAIMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS LEARNED OR COULD HAVE

LEARNED OF THEIR POTENTIAL CAUSE OF ACTION. AS A RESULT, SOME

MAY VIEW SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AS A SIGNIFICANT DEADLINE FOR

FILING

VIOXX

CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, HOWEVER,

THAT THE LAW REGARDING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS CAN BE COMPLEX

AND VARIABLE, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND APPLICABLE LAW. SOME

STATES HAVE LONGER STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS. THERE ARE ALSO

ARGUMENTS THAT THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS BEGAN RUNNING BEFORE

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE HIGBEE

AND FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FALLON HAVE ISSUED ORDERS IN

CASES FROM NEW JERSEY AND EIGHT OTHER JURISDICTIONS RULING THAT

THE STATUTORY PERIOD FOR MAKING

VIOXX

PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS HAS PASSED. JUDGE HIGBEES ORDER WAS ISSUED ON

OCTOBER 15, 2007 AND JUDGE FALLONS WAS ISSUED ON

NOVEMBER 8, 2007.

OTHER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 29, 2005, A NEW JERSEY

STATE TRIAL COURT CERTIFIED A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS (SUCH AS UNIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS) THAT PAID IN

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE

VIOXX

USED BY THEIR PLAN MEMBERS

OR INSUREDS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE SOUGHT RECOVERY OF

CERTAIN

VIOXX

PURCHASE COSTS (PLUS PENALTIES) BASED ON

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE PURPORTED CLASS MEMBERS PAID MORE FOR

VIOXX

THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY KNOWN OF THE

PRODUCTS ALLEGED RISKS. ON MARCH 31, 2006, THE NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, AFFIRMED THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE CERTIFICATION OF A NATIONWIDE CLASS

ACTION OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, FINDING THAT THE SUIT DOES NOT

MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CLASS ACTION. CLAIMS OF CERTAIN

INDIVIDUAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REMAIN PENDING IN THE NEW JERSEY

COURT, AND COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF

THIRD-PARTY PAYORS HAVE FILED ADDITIONAL SUCH ACTIONS. JUDGE

HIGBEE LIFTED THE STAY IN THESE CASES AND THE CASES ARE

CURRENTLY IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE. A STATUS CONFERENCE WITH THE

COURT TOOK PLACE IN JANUARY 2009 TO DISCUSS SCHEDULING ISSUES IN

THESE CASES, INCLUDING THE SELECTION OF EARLY TRIAL POOL CASES.

THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS

MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION IN MARTIN-KLEINMAN V. MERCK,

WHICH IS A PUTATIVE CONSUMER CLASS ACTION, ON DECEMBER 5,

2008.

THERE ARE ALSO PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL

PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND CLAIMING EITHER

REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS OR AN ENTITLEMENT TO

MEDICAL MONITORING. THE MAJORITY OF THESE CASES ARE AT EARLY

PROCEDURAL STAGES. ON JUNE 12, 2008, A MISSOURI STATE COURT

CERTIFIED A CLASS OF MISSOURI PLAINTIFFS SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT

FOR OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS RELATING TO

VIOXX.

THE PLAINTIFFS

DO NOT ALLEGE ANY PERSONAL INJURIES FROM TAKING

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW ON

JUNE 23, 2008, WHICH WAS GRANTED ON JULY 30, 2008.

BRIEFING IS NOW COMPLETE. DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE APPEAL,

DISCOVERY IS PROCEEDING IN THE LOWER COURT. ON FEBRUARY 3,

2009, JUDGE FALLON DISMISSED THE MASTER PERSONAL INJURY/WRONGFUL

DEATH CLASS ACTION MASTER COMPLAINT AND THE MEDICAL MONITORING

CLASS ACTION MASTER COMPLAINT IN THE MDL.

113

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PLAINTIFFS ALSO HAVE FILED A CLASS ACTION IN CALIFORNIA STATE

COURT SEEKING CLASS CERTIFICATION OF CALIFORNIA THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS AND END-USERS. THE PARTIES ARE ENGAGED IN CLASS

CERTIFICATION DISCOVERY AND BRIEFING. THE COURT HEARD ORAL

ARGUMENT ON THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUE ON FEBRUARY 19,

2009.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN EIGHTEEN

SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF TEN STATES,

FIVE COUNTIES, THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AND PRIVATE CITIZENS (WHOM

HAVE BROUGHT

QUI TAM

AND TAXPAYER DERIVATIVE SUITS). ONE

OF THE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE COUNTIES IS A CLASS ACTION FILED

BY SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF ALL

SIMILARLY SITUATED CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE

THAT THE COMPANY MISREPRESENTED THE SAFETY OF

VIOXX

AND

SEEK (I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED OR

REIMBURSED BY THE STATE AND ITS AGENCIES;

(II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE STATE AND ITS

AGENCIES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS

INJURED BY

VIOXX

; (III) DAMAGES UNDER VARIOUS COMMON

LAW THEORIES;

AND/OR

(IV) REMEDIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE STATUTORY THEORIES,

INCLUDING STATE CONSUMER FRAUD

AND/OR

FAIR

BUSINESS PRACTICES OR MEDICAID FRAUD STATUTES, INCLUDING CIVIL

PENALTIES.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A CASE FILED BY THE TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL

(WHICH REMAINS IN TEXAS STATE COURT AND IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED

FOR TRIAL IN NOVEMBER 2009), A CASE FILED BY THE MICHIGAN

ATTORNEY GENERAL (WHICH WAS ORDERED REMANDED TO STATE COURT IN

JANUARY 2009), A CASE RECENTLY FILED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA

ATTORNEY GENERAL (WHICH HAS BEEN REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT BUT IS

THE SUBJECT OF A PENDING MOTION TO REMAND), AND ONE CASE WHICH

HAS NOT BEEN REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT, THE REST OF THE ACTIONS

DESCRIBED IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE

FEDERAL MDL AND ARE IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE.

SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, THE COMPANY AND VARIOUS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ALL OF THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED BY THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION

(THE JPML) TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R.

CHESLER FOR INCLUSION IN A NATIONWIDE MDL (THE SHAREHOLDER

MDL). JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTION, WHICH REQUESTED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF PURCHASERS OF

COMPANY STOCK BETWEEN MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29,

2004, ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF

SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

1934, AND SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS

OF SUIT, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO

ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE ACT AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES

OF MERCK STOCK AND UNDER SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS BASED ON

STATEMENTS IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES

FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERCK STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN, A

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN. ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE

CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS

DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT. ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION REVERSING JUDGE CHESLERS ORDER AND REMANDING THE

CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT. ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2008, MERCK

FILED A PETITION SEEKING REHEARING

EN BANC,

WHICH WAS

DENIED. THE CASE WAS REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT IN OCTOBER

2008, AND PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED THEIR CONSOLIDATED AND FIFTH

AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT. MERCK FILED A PETITION FOR

A WRIT OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ON

JANUARY 15, 2009. MERCK EXPECTS TO FILE A MOTION TO DISMISS

THE FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT.

IN OCTOBER 2005, A DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER

GOVERNING THE SHAREHOLDER MDL, THE CASE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE

SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, WAS

CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS.

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PENSION FUNDS

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 3, 2007. IN SEPTEMBER 2007,

THE DUTCH PENSION FUND FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT RATHER THAN

RESPONDING TO DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS. IN ADDITION IN

2007, SIX NEW COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN THE DISTRICT OF NEW

JERSEY ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALSO

ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AS WELL AS

VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OFFICERS. DEFENDANTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THESE

COMPLAINTS UNTIL AFTER JUDGE CHESLER RESOLVES ANY MOTION TO

DISMISS IN THE CONSOLIDATED SECURITIES ACTION.

114

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL

AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). ON MAY 5,

2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS

AND DENIED PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR

COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, ARGUING THAT JUDGE CHESLER ERRED

IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITH

MATERIALS ACQUIRED DURING DISCOVERY. ON JULY 18, 2007, THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED

THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION ON THE GROUNDS THAT JUDGE

CHESLER SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED PLAINTIFFS TO MAKE USE OF THE

DISCOVERY MATERIAL TO TRY TO ESTABLISH DEMAND FUTILITY, AND

REMANDED THE CASE FOR THE DISTRICT COURTS CONSIDERATION OF

WHETHER, EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WOULD STILL BE FUTILE.

PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THEIR REQUEST FOR

LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2007. THE COURT

DENIED THE MOTION IN JUNE 2008 AND CLOSED THE CASE. PLAINTIFFS

HAVE APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE



VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS)

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED

FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE LAWSUITS MAKE

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. ON JULY 11, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER

GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. IN OCTOBER 2007, PLAINTIFFS MOVED

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

PARTICIPANTS IN AND BENEFICIARIES OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AT ANY TIME BETWEEN OCTOBER 1,

1998 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND WHOSE PLAN ACCOUNTS

INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN THE MERCK COMMON STOCK FUND

AND/OR

MERCK

COMMON STOCK. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2009, THE COURT DENIED THE

MOTION FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS AS TO ONE COUNT AND GRANTED

THE MOTION AS TO THE REMAINING COUNTS. THE COURT ALSO LIMITED

THE CLASS TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PARTICIPANTS IN AND

BENEFICIARIES OF THE COMPANYS RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS WHO

SUFFERED A LOSS DUE TO THEIR INVESTMENTS IN MERCK STOCK THROUGH

THE PLANS AND WHO DID NOT EXECUTE A SETTLEMENT RELEASING THEIR

CLAIMS. ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION FOR

JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THE COMPLAINT. ON

DECEMBER 24, 2008, PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION FOR PARTIAL

SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS. BOTH

MOTIONS ARE PENDING. DISCOVERY IS ONGOING IN THIS LITIGATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO

INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON THE COMPANYS

BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND GILMARTIN,

FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER

INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH

RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN S. MARTIN, JR. OF

DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ALLEGATIONS SET FORTH

IN THE DEMAND. JUDGE MARTINS REPORT WAS MADE PUBLIC IN

SEPTEMBER 2006. BASED ON THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES

RECOMMENDATION MADE AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE MARTIN

REPORT AND THE IMPACT THAT DERIVATIVE LITIGATION WOULD HAVE ON

THE COMPANY, THE BOARD REJECTED THE DEMAND. ON OCTOBER 11,

2007, THE SHAREHOLDERS FILED A LAWSUIT IN STATE COURT IN

ATLANTIC COUNTY, NEW JERSEY AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER

EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE

BOARDS REJECTION OF THEIR DEMAND WAS UNREASONABLE AND

IMPROPER, AND THAT THE DEFENDANTS BREACHED VARIOUS DUTIES TO THE

COMPANY IN ALLOWING

VIOXX

TO BE MARKETED. THE CURRENT AND

FORMER EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR DEFENDANTS FILED MOTIONS TO

DISMISS THE COMPLAINT IN JUNE 2008. ON OCTOBER 30, 2008,

PROCEEDINGS IN THE CASE WERE STAYED THROUGH MARCH 1, 2009.

ON NOVEMBER 21, 2008, THE PENDING MOTIONS TO DISMISS WERE

DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

INTERNATIONAL

CANADA, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, AND ISRAEL.

ON MAY 30, 2008, THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF QUEENS BENCH

IN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA ENTERED AN ORDER CERTIFYING A CLASS OF

QUALITY, DEFECTIVE OR NOT FIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANAGING PAIN

ASSOCIATED WITH APPROVED INDICATIONS; OR INGESTORS WHO CLAIM

VIOXX

CAUSED OR EXACERBATED A CARDIOVASCULAR OR

GASTROINTESTINAL CONDITION. ON JUNE 17, 2008, THE COURT OF

APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN GRANTED THE COMPANY LEAVE TO APPEAL THE

CERTIFICATION ORDER. THAT APPEAL WAS ARGUED BEFORE THAT COURT,

AND THE COURT HAS RESERVED DECISION. ON JULY 28, 2008, THE

SUPERIOR COURT IN ONTARIO DENIED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO

STAY CLASS PROCEEDINGS IN ONTARIO, WHICH HAD BEEN BASED ON THE

EARLIER CERTIFICATION ORDER ENTERED IN SASKATCHEWAN, AND DECIDED

TO CERTIFY AN OVERLAPPING CLASS OF

VIOXX

USERS IN CANADA,

EXCEPT THOSE IN QUEBEC AND SASKATCHEWAN, WHO ALLEGE NEGLIGENCE

AND AN ENTITLEMENT TO ELECT TO WAIVE THE TORT. ON

NOVEMBER 24, 2008, THE ONTARIO DIVISIONAL COURT GRANTED THE

COMPANYS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL THE SUPERIOR

COURTS DECISION DENYING THE STAY OF THE ONTARIO CLASS

PROCEEDINGS AND DENIED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO APPEAL THE

CERTIFICATION ORDER. THE COMPANYS APPEAL WAS HEARD BY THE

ONTARIO DIVISIONAL COURT IN FEBRUARY 2009. ON FEBRUARY 13,

2009, THE DIVISIONAL COURT DECLINED TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER

DENYING THE STAY. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SEEK LEAVE TO APPEAL

FROM THE ONTARIO COURT OF APPEAL. EARLIER, IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE

SUPERIOR COURT IN QUEBEC AUTHORIZED THE INSTITUTION OF A CLASS

ACTION ON BEHALF OF ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO, IN QUEBEC, CONSUMED

VIOXX

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT INSTITUTED

AN ACTION BASED UPON THAT AUTHORIZATION.

A TRIAL IN A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN AUSTRALIA IS SCHEDULED TO

COMMENCE ON MARCH 30, 2009, IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF

AUSTRALIA. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO ALLEGES HE SUFFERED AN MI,

SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHERS IN AUSTRALIA WHO INGESTED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED AN MI, THROMBOTIC STROKE, UNSTABLE ANGINA,

TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. ON

NOVEMBER 24, 2008, THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION FOR AN ORDER

THAT THE PROCEEDING NO LONGER CONTINUE AS A REPRESENTATIVE

PROCEEDING. DURING A HEARING ON DECEMBER 5, 2008, THE COURT

DISMISSED THAT MOTION AND, ON JANUARY 9, 2009, ISSUED ITS

REASONS FOR THAT DECISION. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2009, THE

COMPANYS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL THAT DECISION WAS

DENIED AND THE PARTIES WERE DIRECTED TO PREPARE PROPOSED LISTS

OF ISSUES TO BE TRIED.

ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS

BASED ON MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER SOURCES, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) MAY BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$630 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-INSURANCE. THIS

INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

POTENTIAL DAMAGE AMOUNTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THROUGH AN ARBITRATION

PROCEEDING AND NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENTS, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN

AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY $590 MILLION IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY INSURANCE PROCEEDS RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, PLUS APPROXIMATELY

$45 MILLION IN FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS

NO ADDITIONAL INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO

THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS

DEFENSE COSTS AND LOSSES.

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE COVERAGE

APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF

APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS FIDUCIARY AND

OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS WITH STATED

UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF

THE ARBITRATION, ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS

SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE, IF NEEDED, UNDER UPPER-LEVEL EXCESS

POLICIES THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE

DISPUTES WITH THE INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE CLAIMS AND

THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL DISPUTES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY

RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE

LESS THAN THE STATED UPPER LIMITS.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS

ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN

INFORMAL INQUIRY CONCERNING

VIOXX.

ON JANUARY 28,

2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE SEC

ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION. ALSO, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE

DOJ) REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES SUBPOENAS

FOR WITNESSES TO APPEAR BEFORE A GRAND JURY. IN ADDITION, AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

116

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY

CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS (THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN

POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL DISPOSITIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON MAY 20, 2008, THE COMPANY

REACHED CIVIL SETTLEMENTS WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 29 STATES

AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO FULLY RESOLVE PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED INVESTIGATIONS UNDER STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS

RELATED TO PAST ACTIVITIES FOR

VIOXX.

AS PART OF THE

CIVIL RESOLUTION OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, MERCK PAID A TOTAL OF

$58 MILLION TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE 29 STATES AND THE DISTRICT

OF COLUMBIA. THE AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES COMPLIANCE MEASURES

THAT SUPPLEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED

BY THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006

FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS

AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON

CALIFORNIAS MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007, MERCK ENTERED INTO

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT COMPRISE THE

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PSC OF THE FEDERAL

VIOXX

MDL

AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN THE

TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS

TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MI AND IS CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT

DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO

APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER

SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE

COORDINATION OF MORE THAN 95% OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY

TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE THAT THEIR MI

OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 2007, AS A RESULT OF

ENTERING INTO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

PRETAX CHARGE OF $4.85 BILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIXED

AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO PLAINTIFFS QUALIFYING FOR PAYMENT

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2009. EXCEPT

WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIAL SCHEDULED TO BE HELD

IN AUSTRALIA, THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER

TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF

THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS

SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. IN

EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO

RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN SUCH

CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD AN

AGGREGATE RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $5.372 BILLION (THE



VIOXX

RESERVE) FOR THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AND

THE COMPANYS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $305 MILLION

IN THE AGGREGATE, IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO

(I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

CHARGE OF $62 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER THE COMPANY PAID AN ADDITIONAL

$250 MILLION INTO THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM AFTER HAVING PAID $500 MILLION INTO

THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.379 BILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED

IN ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET. IN ADDING TO THE

VIOXX

RESERVE SOLELY FOR

ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THE SAME

FACTORS THAT IT CONSIDERED WHEN IT PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED

RESERVES FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE REVIEW OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE

COMPANY; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

117

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF

THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION THAT CERTAIN LAWSUITS

WILL CONTINUE TO BE PENDING; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT

AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS

AND THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND

TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. THE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 ALLOCATED

SOLELY TO DEFENSE COSTS REPRESENTS THE COMPANYS BEST

ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE INCURRED

IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD ARISE IN THE

COURSE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE ULTIMATE

AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE

TO INCREASE THE

VIOXX

RESERVE AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE

IF, BASED UPON THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE

APPROPRIATE TO DO SO.

OTHER

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY 779 CASES, WHICH INCLUDE

APPROXIMATELY 1,158 PLAINTIFF GROUPS HAD BEEN FILED AND WERE

PENDING AGAINST MERCK IN EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT,

INCLUDING ONE CASE WHICH SEEKS CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS

WELL AS DAMAGES

AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW,

GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE DENTAL PROCEDURES, SUCH AS

TOOTH EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS

AND/OR

DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX.

ON AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS NATIONWIDE

SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION (THE 

FOSAMAX

MDL) FOR COORDINATED

PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL HAS BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE JOHN KEENAN IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AS A RESULT OF THE

JPML ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 645 OF THE CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE

KEENAN. JUDGE KEENAN HAS ISSUED A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER (AND

VARIOUS AMENDMENTS THERETO) SETTING FORTH A SCHEDULE GOVERNING

THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSED PRIMARILY UPON RESOLVING THE CLASS

ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS IN 2007 AND COMPLETING FACT

DISCOVERY IN AN INITIAL GROUP OF 25 CASES BY OCTOBER 1,

2008. BRIEFING AND ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS FOR

CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL MONITORING CLASSES WERE COMPLETED IN

2007 AND JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING THE MOTIONS ON

JANUARY 3, 2008. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, JUDGE KEENAN

ISSUED A FURTHER ORDER DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE ALL CLASS

CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE FIRST FOUR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED

AGAINST MERCK THAT SOUGHT PERSONAL INJURY DAMAGES

AND/OR

MEDICAL MONITORING RELIEF ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS. IN OCTOBER

2008, JUDGE KEENAN ISSUED AN ORDER REQUIRING THAT

DAUBERT

MOTIONS BE FILED IN MAY 2009 AND SCHEDULING TRIALS IN THE

FIRST THREE CASES IN THE MDL FOR AUGUST 2009, OCTOBER 2009, AND

JANUARY 2010, RESPECTIVELY. A TRIAL IS SCHEDULED IN ALABAMA

STATE COURT LATER IN 2009.

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2008, AN APPLICATION WAS MADE BY THE

ATLANTIC COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY REQUESTING THAT ALL

OF THE

FOSAMAX

CASES PENDING IN NEW JERSEY BE CONSIDERED

FOR MASS TORT DESIGNATION AND CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT BEFORE ONE

JUDGE IN NEW JERSEY. ON OCTOBER 6, 2008, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT ORDERED THAT ALL PENDING AND FUTURE ACTIONS FILED

IN NEW JERSEY ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF

FOSAMAX

AND

SEEKING DAMAGES FOR EXISTING DENTAL AND JAW-RELATED INJURIES,

INCLUDING OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW, BUT NOT SOLELY SEEKING

MEDICAL MONITORING, BE DESIGNATED AS A MASS TORT FOR CENTRALIZED

MANAGEMENT PURPOSES BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE IN ATLANTIC COUNTY

SUPERIOR COURT. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME

COURTS ORDER, APPROXIMATELY 100 CASES WERE COORDINATED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE, WHO IS EXPECTED

TO BEGIN SETTING VARIOUS CASE MANAGEMENT DEADLINES DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

DISCOVERY IS ONGOING IN BOTH THE

FOSAMAX

MDL LITIGATION

AS WELL AS IN VARIOUS STATE COURT CASES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A REMAINING

RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. DURING

2008, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION AND ADDED

$40 MILLION TO ITS RESERVE. CONSEQUENTLY, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD A RESERVE OF

APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

118

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST

THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, THE COMPANY

IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE COMPLETION OF THE

FIRST THREE FEDERAL TRIALS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO

THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING

LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE

SOMETIMES USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE

TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO

FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS

PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND

ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH,

LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING

CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED THE

COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE

COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE

COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR

COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURT BROUGHT

INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

FIFTY OF THE COUNTY CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN NEW YORK

STATE COURT. THE COMPANY WAS DISMISSED FROM THE SUFFOLK COUNTY

CASE, WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE

FILED. IN ADDITION TO THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY WAS A DEFENDANT IN STATE

CASES BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF ELEVEN STATES, ALL OF

WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED. IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE KANSAS ATTORNEY

GENERAL FILED SUIT AGAINST MERCK AND SEVERAL OTHER

MANUFACTURERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ARIZONA

VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED MERCK FROM ITS CASE IN FEBRUARY 2009. THE

COURT IN THE AWP CASES PENDING IN HAWAII LISTED MERCK AND OTHERS

TO BE SET FOR TRIAL IN MID-2010.

GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO

SETTLE FEDERAL AND STATE CIVIL CASES ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE

MEDICAID REBATE STATUTE, AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE FALSE

CLAIMS ACTS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS

AND SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES BETWEEN 1994 AND 2001. IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE SETTLEMENTS, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

MERCK ENTERED INTO A CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENT

(CIA) WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL (HHS-OIG) FOR A

FIVE-YEAR TERM. THE CIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT MERCK

MAINTAIN ITS ETHICS TRAINING PROGRAM AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

GOVERNING PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES AND MEDICAID PRICE REPORTING.

FURTHER, AS REQUIRED BY THE CIA, MERCK HAS RETAINED AN

INDEPENDENT REVIEW ORGANIZATION (IRO) TO CONDUCT A

SYSTEMS REVIEW OF ITS PROMOTIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND TO

CONDUCT, ON A SAMPLE BASIS, TRANSACTIONAL REVIEWS OF

MERCKS PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS AND CERTAIN MEDICAID PRICING

CALCULATIONS. MERCK IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTS

AND CERTIFICATIONS TO THE HHS-OIG REGARDING ITS COMPLIANCE WITH

THE CIA. THE IRO IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING THE REQUIRED REVIEWS.

MERCK IS SCHEDULED TO SUBMIT ITS FIRST ANNUAL REPORT TO THE

HHS-OIG IN MAY 2009.

VYTORIN/ZETIA

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY AND ITS JOINT VENTURE

PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

ADDRESSED TO BOTH COMPANIES FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY

AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS

(O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE

SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF

WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF

ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND

PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY

CORPORATE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE AUGUST 2008, THE

COMPANIES HAVE RECEIVED THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM O&I,

INCLUDING ONE DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING CERTAIN

INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL. AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANIES HAVE EACH RECEIVED SUBPOENAS

FROM THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY

119

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OFFICES AND A LETTER FROM THE

CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND

DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED FIVE CIVIL

INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CIDS) FROM A MULTISTATE GROUP

OF 35 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO ARE JOINTLY INVESTIGATING

WHETHER THE COMPANIES VIOLATED STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS

WHEN MARKETING

VYTORIN

. FINALLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE DOJ

INFORMING IT THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE

COMPANIES CONDUCT RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS

AND WORKING WITH SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED WITH

APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON

LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MSP

PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

. CERTAIN OF THOSE LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURIES

AND/OR

SEEK

MEDICAL MONITORING. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED IN OR

TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT, ARE COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT

COURT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE DENNIS M. CAVANAUGH.

THE PARTIES ARE PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN MOTIONS PRACTICE AND

BRIEFING.

ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON APRIL 3, 2008, A MERCK

SHAREHOLDER FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL

COURT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING THAT

MERCK AND ITS CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

RICHARD T. CLARK, VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. THIS

SUIT HAS SINCE BEEN WITHDRAWN AND RE-FILED IN THE DISTRICT OF

NEW JERSEY AND HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH ANOTHER FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWSUIT UNDER THE CAPTION IN RE MERCK &

CO., INC.

VYTORIN

SECURITIES LITIGATION. AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON OCTOBER 6, 2008 AND

NAMES AS DEFENDANTS MERCK; MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC; AND CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS OFFICERS

AND DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT MERCK

DELAYED RELEASING UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF A CLINICAL STUDY

REGARDING THE EFFICACY OF

VYTORIN

AND THAT MERCK MADE

FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT EXPECTED EARNINGS, KNOWING

THAT ONCE THE RESULTS OF THE

VYTORIN

STUDY WERE RELEASED,

SALES OF

VYTORIN

WOULD DECLINE AND MERCKS EARNINGS

WOULD SUFFER. ON APRIL 22, 2008, A MEMBER OF A MERCK ERISA

PLAN FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY

AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ALLEGING THEY BREACHED

THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES UNDER ERISA. SINCE THAT TIME, THERE HAVE

BEEN OTHER SIMILAR ERISA LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY, AND ALL OF THOSE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION IN RE MERCK & CO., INC.

VYTORIN

ERISA LITIGATION. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 5, 2009, AND NAMES AS

DEFENDANTS MERCK AND VARIOUS MEMBERS OF MERCKS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AND MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES OF MERCKS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE ERISA PLANS

INVESTMENT IN COMPANY STOCK WAS IMPRUDENT BECAUSE THE

COMPANYS EARNINGS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS

OF ITS CHOLESTEROL DRUG

VYTORIN

AND THAT DEFENDANTS KNEW

OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE RESULTS OF A SCIENTIFIC STUDY

WOULD CAUSE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO TURN TO LESS EXPENSIVE

DRUGS FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND

THE LAWSUITS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION VIGOROUSLY. UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR THE

CIVIL LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY

DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE

RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE

COMPANY IN 2007 TO RESOLVE CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

DELIVERED ANOTHER LETTER TO THE BOARD DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD

OR A SUBCOMMITTEE THEREOF COMMENCE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE

MATTERS RAISED BY VARIOUS CIVIL SUITS AND GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO

VYTORIN.

VACCINE

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO INDIVIDUAL

AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE

UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G., HEPATITIS B

VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE USED IN

VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING

PEDIATRIC VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FALL OF 2001.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 230

THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS PENDING IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS A

DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE LAWSUITS ARE NOT

CURRENTLY ACTIVE. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE

MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING

THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE

ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY

HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO

THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC VACCINES. THERE ARE NO CASES CURRENTLY

SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL. THE COMPANY WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE

LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

120

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE

EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS

PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE

VACCINE ACT). THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON

FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR

VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE

VACCINE COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING

A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE PETITIONER

MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN

VACCINE COURT AND THEN TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A

CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT

TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE

COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE

PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 5,000 CASES

PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES

AND/OR

THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. NOT ALL

OF THE THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE VACCINE

COURT PROCEEDING ARE COMPANY VACCINES. THE COMPANY IS THE SOLE

SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE DOMESTICALLY. THE SPECIAL

MASTERS PRESIDING OVER THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD

HEARINGS IN THREE TEST CASES INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT THE

COMBINATION OF

M-M-R

II VACCINE AND THIMEROSAL IN

VACCINES CAUSES AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. ON FEBRUARY 12,

2009, THE SPECIAL MASTERS ISSUED DECISIONS IN EACH OF THOSE

CASES, FINDING THAT THE THEORY WAS UNSUPPORTED BY VALID

SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THAT THE PETITIONERS IN THE THREE CASES

WERE THEREFORE NOT ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. THE SPECIAL MASTERS

HAVE HELD SIMILAR HEARINGS IN THREE DIFFERENT TEST CASES

INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT THIMEROSAL IN VACCINES ALONE CAUSES

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. DECISIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED IN

THIS SECOND SET OF TEST CASES. THE SPECIAL MASTERS HAD

PREVIOUSLY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD SIMILAR HEARINGS

INVOLVING THE THEORY THAT

M-M-R

II ALONE CAUSES AUTISM

SPECTRUM DISORDERS, BUT THEY HAVE STATED THAT THEY NO LONGER

INTEND TO DO SO. THE VACCINE COURT HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS

TO USE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THESE TEST CASE HEARINGS TO

GUIDE THE ADJUDICATION OF THE REMAINING AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER

CASES.

PATENT

LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS

(ANDAS) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC

FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

FOSAMAX,

NEXIUM, SINGULAIR, PRIMAXIN

AND

EMEND

PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS (AND ASTRAZENECAS IN THE

CASE OF

NEXIUM

) PATENTS CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, AN ANDA HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

ZETIA

PRIOR

TO THE EXPIRATION OF SCHERING-PLOUGHS PATENT CONCERNING

THAT PRODUCT. THE GENERIC COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY

INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, INVALIDITY AND

UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. THE COMPANY HAS FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING

ANDAS FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE (

FOSAMAX

),

MONTELUKAST (

SINGULAIR

), IMIPENEM/CILASTATIN

(

PRIMAXIN

) AND ASTRAZENECA AND THE COMPANY HAVE FILED

PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES

FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

OTHER

LITIGATION

IN FEBRUARY 2008, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMANDING THAT THE

BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO

RECOVER THE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY IN 2007 TO RESOLVE

CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH

SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO HEALTH), THE COMPANY AND

MEDCO HEALTH AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS, A SERIES

OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA (THE GRUER

CASES). THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A

NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS,

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY AGREED TO

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT COST

AND DISTRACTION OF PROLONGED LITIGATION. THE PROPOSED CLASS

SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES

FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A

TOTAL OF $42.5 MILLION, AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO

MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TO CONTINUE CERTAIN

SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE

FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE

SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO

HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME SINCE

DECEMBER 17, 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD HEARINGS TO HEAR

OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND

APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE

NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL ONLY

IF AND WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. CERTAIN CLASS MEMBER

PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH PLANS AND TWO

INDIVIDUALS REMAIN PENDING IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES HAVE ASSERTED CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS

WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR

SIMILAR TO THE CLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS

MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES. THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH ARE

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES.

THREE NOTICES OF APPEAL WERE FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT HEARD

ORAL ARGUMENT IN MAY 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE APPELLATE COURT

ISSUED A DECISION VACATING THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT

AND REMANDING THE CASES TO THE DISTRICT COURT TO ALLOW THE

DISTRICT COURT TO RESOLVE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. A

HEARING WAS HELD TO ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES IN FEBRUARY 2006. THE

DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A RULING IN AUGUST 2006 RESOLVING SUCH

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES IN FAVOR OF THE SETTLING PLAINTIFFS. THE

CLASS MEMBERS AND THE OTHER PARTY THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEALED

THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT RENEWED THEIR APPEALS. IN

OCTOBER 2007, THE RENEWED APPEALS WERE AFFIRMED IN PART AND

VACATED IN PART BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS. THE APPEALS

COURT REMANDED THE CLASS SETTLEMENT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN

THE DISTRICT COURT.

THE DISTRICT COURT PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THE AMENDED SETTLEMENT

IN MAY 2008. HOWEVER, PLAINTIFFS THAT HAD INITIALLY OPTED OUT OF

THE SETTLEMENT CLASS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE SETTLEMENT. THE

DISTRICT COURT ORDERED BRIEFING ON THE OBJECTIONS AND HEARD

ARGUMENT IN OCTOBER 2008. THE DISTRICT COURT HAS NOT YET ISSUED

ITS RULING ON THOSE OBJECTIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS

DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING THREE PARAGRAPHS. THESE CASES ARE

BEING DEFENDED BY MEDCO HEALTH.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY,

WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS

NOTE, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE

EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR

WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED IN THIS NOTE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE

OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS

OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE

GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY

TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP

COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF

CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE

RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE

COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO

SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN

DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES

OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, SUCH

PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH

WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND

PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY

REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM

FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, APPROXIMATELY 2,200 PLAINTIFFS HAVE

FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT AGAINST MERCK AND 12 OTHER DEFENDANTS

IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

ASSERTING CLAIMS UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE RESOURCE

CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT, AS WELL AS NEGLIGENCE AND

NUISANCE. THE SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURY, DIMINUTION

OF PROPERTY VALUE, MEDICAL MONITORING AND OTHER ALLEGED REAL AND

PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH GROUNDWATER AND SOIL

CONTAMINATION FOUND AT THE SITE OF A FORMER MERCK SUBSIDIARY IN

MERCED, CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST

THESE CLAIMS.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE

HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND TOTALED $89.5 MILLION AND

$109.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT

CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM OTHER PARTIES AND WILL BE

PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE

SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE NEXT

15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY

POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE

LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $70.0 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE. MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY

OTHER PAID-IN CAPITAL INCREASED BY $304.2 MILLION IN 2008,

$848.4 MILLION IN 2007 AND $266.5 MILLION IN 2006. THE

INCREASES IN ALL PERIODS REFLECT SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

ACTIVITY, INCLUDING THE RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

AND THE IMPACT OF SHARES ISSUED AND RELATED INCOME TAX BENEFITS.

THE INCREASE IN 2007 ALSO REFLECTS THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES

RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF NOVACARDIA (SEE NOTE 4).

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER WHICH

EMPLOYEES, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANYS EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES MAY BE GRANTED

OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK AT THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT. IN ADDITION TO STOCK OPTIONS,

THE COMPANY GRANTS PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (PSUS)

AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) TO CERTAIN

MANAGEMENT LEVEL EMPLOYEES. THESE PLANS WERE APPROVED BY THE

COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

126.8 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS

UNDER THE COMPANYS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE

COMPANY SETTLES EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

PRIMARILY WITH TREASURY SHARES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMPANY

STOCK AT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT. THESE

AWARDS GENERALLY VEST ONE-THIRD EACH YEAR OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERIOD, WITH A CONTRACTUAL TERM OF 10 YEARS. RSUS ARE STOCK

AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AND ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARDS VEST, AS WELL AS

NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

AWARDS IS DETERMINED AND FIXED ON THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE

COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. PSUS ARE STOCK AWARDS WHERE THE

ULTIMATE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED WILL BE CONTINGENT ON THE

COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AGAINST A PRE-SET OBJECTIVE OR SET OF

OBJECTIVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH PSU IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE

OF GRANT BASED ON THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. OVER THE

PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED WILL BE ADJUSTED BASED ON THE PROBABILITY

OF ACHIEVEMENT OF A PERFORMANCE TARGET AND FINAL COMPENSATION

EXPENSE WILL BE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ULTIMATE NUMBER OF

SHARES ISSUED. BOTH PSU AND RSU PAYOUTS WILL BE IN SHARES OF

COMPANY STOCK AFTER THE END OF THE VESTING OR PERFORMANCE

PERIOD, GENERALLY THREE YEARS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS APPLICABLE

TO SUCH AWARDS.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE

PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT,

WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN NET INCOME, WHICH THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE

PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF FASB

STAFF POSITION 123R-3,

TRANSITION ELECTION RELATED TO

ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

AWARDS

, WHICH PROVIDED THE COMPANY AN OPTIONAL SHORT-CUT

METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE HISTORICAL POOL OF WINDFALL TAX

BENEFITS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY FOR

AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR OVER THE

PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE TO THE DATE RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY IS

ACHIEVED. THIS APPROACH IS KNOWN AS THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING

PERIOD APPROACH. TOTAL PRETAX SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST

RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN 2008, 2007,

AND 2006 WAS $348.0 MILLION, $330.2 MILLION AND

$312.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WITH RELATED INCOME TAX

BENEFITS OF $107.5 MILLION, $104.1 MILLION AND

$98.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL FOR

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTION GRANTS. IN APPLYING THIS

MODEL, THE COMPANY USES BOTH HISTORICAL DATA AND CURRENT MARKET

DATA TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS OPTIONS. THE

BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL REQUIRES SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, VOLATILITY,

AND TERM OF THE OPTIONS. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD IS BASED ON

HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. THE RISK-FREE RATE IS

BASED ON THE RATE AT GRANT DATE OF ZERO-COUPON

U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH A TERM EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED TERM

OF THE OPTION. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED USING A BLEND OF

HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE HISTORICAL COMPONENT IS

BASED ON HISTORICAL MONTHLY PRICE CHANGES. THE IMPLIED

VOLATILITY IS OBTAINED

ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS REFLECTS THE PORTFOLIOS ALLOCATION TO GLOBAL EQUITY

MARKETS WHICH DELIVERED SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE RETURNS DURING 2008.

AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN PLAN ASSETS NOTED ABOVE, THE

COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $765.9 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

WAS $414.5 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $880.0 MILLION AND

$405.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 106 AND 132R

(FAS 158), EXCEPT FOR THE REQUIREMENT TO

MEASURE PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE

COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR END, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008. FAS 158 REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO

FULLY RECOGNIZE THE FUNDED STATUS OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS. EACH

OVERFUNDED PLAN IS RECOGNIZED AS AN ASSET AND EACH UNDERFUNDED

THE FLUCTUATION IN EXCHANGE LOSSES (GAINS) IN 2008 FROM 2007 IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER COST OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

DUE TO LOWER U.S. INTEREST RATES AND UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS OF

PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON

NET LONG OR NET SHORT FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS, CONSIDERING

BOTH NET MONETARY ASSETS AND RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS.

THE CHANGE IN OTHER, NET FOR 2008 PRIMARILY REFLECTS AN

AGGREGATE GAIN IN 2008 FROM AZLP OF $2.2 BILLION (SEE

NOTE 8), THE IMPACT OF A $671 MILLION CHARGE IN 2007

RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN CIVIL GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AND A 2008 GAIN OF $249 MILLION RELATED TO

THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS REMAINING WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO

AGGRASTAT

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $300 MILLION

EXPENSE FOR A CONTRIBUTION TO THE MERCK COMPANY FOUNDATION,

HIGHER RECOGNIZED LOSSES OF $153 MILLION, NET, IN THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND A $58 MILLION

CHARGE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO

WHETHER THE COMPANY VIOLATED CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WITH

RESPECT TO THE SALES AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX

(SEE

NOTE 10). THE CHANGE IN OTHER, NET FOR 2007 PRIMARILY

REFLECTS A CHARGE IN 2007 RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN

CIVIL GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

FAVORABLE IMPACT OF 2007 GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS AND PRODUCT

DIVESTITURES, AS WELL AS A NET GAIN ON THE SETTLEMENTS OF

CERTAIN PATENT DISPUTES. INTEREST PAID WAS $247.0 MILLION

IN 2008, $406.4 MILLION IN 2007 AND $387.5 MILLION IN

2006.

THE COMPANY HAS NET OPERATING LOSS (NOL)

CARRYFORWARDS IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

OF WHICH IS THE UNITED KINGDOM WITH NOL CARRYFORWARDS OF

$76.5 MILLION WHICH HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE. THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCE IN BOTH YEARS PRIMARILY RELATES TO CERTAIN CANADIAN

NOL CARRYFORWARDS RESULTING FROM A LEGAL ENTITY REORGANIZATION.

INCOME TAXES PAID IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE $1.8 BILLION,

$3.5 BILLION AND $2.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. STOCK

OPTION EXERCISES REDUCED INCOME TAXES PAID BY

$138.4 MILLION IN 2007. STOCK OPTION EXERCISES DID NOT HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON TAXES PAID IN 2008 OR 2006.

ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

(FIN 48), WHICH RESULTED IN

THE RECOGNITION OF AN $81 MILLION DECREASE IN THE

COMPANYS EXISTING LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS,

WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE TO THE JANUARY 1, 2007

RETAINED EARNINGS BALANCE. AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

FIN 48, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANYS

LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $5.01 BILLION,

BELOW.

IF THE COMPANY WERE TO RECOGNIZE THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

OF $3.66 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE INCOME TAX

PROVISION WOULD REFLECT A FAVORABLE NET IMPACT OF

$2.91 BILLION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST, PENALTIES AND EXCHANGE GAINS

AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS A

COMPONENT OF TAXES ON INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITIONS AMOUNTED TO $101 MILLION IN 2008 AND

$270 MILLION IN 2007. LIABILITIES FOR ACCRUED INTEREST AND

PENALTIES INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WERE

$1.68 BILLION, $1.60 BILLION AND $2.40 BILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

JANUARY 1, 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE IRS HAS COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION

OF THE COMPANYS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1993 TO 2001. AS

A RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION, THE COMPANY MADE AN AGGREGATE

PAYMENT OF $2.79 BILLION IN FEBRUARY 2007. THIS PAYMENT WAS

OFFSET BY (I) A TAX REFUND OF $165 MILLION RECEIVED IN

2007 FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID FOR THESE MATTERS AND

(II) A FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY

$360 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT,

RESULTING IN A NET CASH COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION IN 2007. THE IMPACT FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO

2001 FOR ITEMS REVIEWED AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION WAS INCLUDED

IN THE PAYMENT ALTHOUGH THOSE YEARS REMAIN OPEN IN ALL OTHER

RESPECTS. THE CLOSING OF THE IRS EXAMINATION DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

2007 AS THESE AMOUNTS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR.

THE COMPANY REPORTED THE RESULTS OF THE IRS ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE

YEARS 1993 THROUGH 2001 TO VARIOUS STATE TAX AUTHORITIES. THIS

RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL TAX, AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTY

PAYMENTS OF $20 MILLION AND $9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

IN 2008 AND $57 MILLION AND $67 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

IN 2007, AND AN EQUIVALENT REDUCTION IN THE BALANCES OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES.

THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL CHANGE IN THE NEXT

12 MONTHS DUE TO THE ANTICIPATED CLOSURE OF VARIOUS FOREIGN

AND STATE TAX EXAMINATIONS, INCLUDING THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE

CANADA REVENUE AGENCY (CRA) DISCUSSED BELOW. THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE CHANGE COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN OCTOBER 2006, THE CRA ISSUED THE

COMPANY A NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT CONTAINING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED

TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS. IN FEBRUARY 2009, MERCK

AND THE CRA NEGOTIATED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN REGARD TO THESE

MATTERS. THE SETTLEMENT CALLS FOR MERCK TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL TAX

OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) AND

INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY $360 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS)

WITH NO ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OR PENALTIES DUE ON THIS ASSESSMENT.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 48, THE SETTLEMENT WILL BE ACCOUNTED

FOR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. THE COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY

ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THESE MATTERS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE TAXES PAID IS EXPECTED TO BE CREDITABLE FOR U.S. TAX

PURPOSES. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSOCIATED COLLATERAL

AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2008, THE CRA PROPOSED

ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS FOR 1999 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING

TO OTHER INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS. THE ADJUSTMENTS WOULD

INCREASE CANADIAN TAX DUE BY APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION

(U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS $240 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS)

OF INTEREST. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CRA WILL PROPOSE SIMILAR

ADJUSTMENTS FOR LATER YEARS. THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE

POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE CRA AND BELIEVES THEY ARE WITHOUT MERIT.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTEST THE ASSESSMENTS THROUGH THE CRA

APPEALS

134

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROCESS AND THE COURTS IF NECESSARY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS, DURING 2007, THE COMPANY

PLEDGED COLLATERAL TO TWO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ONE OF WHICH

PROVIDED A GUARANTEE TO THE CRA AND THE OTHER TO THE QUEBEC

MINISTRY OF REVENUE REPRESENTING A PORTION OF THE TAX AND

INTEREST ASSESSED. THE COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED INCOME

TAXES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$1.2 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE GUARANTEES WILL BE REDUCED AND

THE RELATED COLLATERAL RELEASED FOLLOWING PAYMENTS TO THE CRA

AND QUEBEC MINISTRY OF REVENUE, CAUSING THE RESTRICTED AMOUNTS

TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO CASH AND INVESTMENTS AS APPROPRIATE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE IRS IS EXAMINING THE COMPANYS 2002 TO 2005 FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN TAX

EXAMINATIONS ARE IN PROGRESS. TAX YEARS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO

EXAMINATION BY MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS INCLUDE GERMANY FROM

1999, ITALY FROM 2000 AND JAPAN FROM 2002.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, FOREIGN EARNINGS OF

$22.0 BILLION HAVE BEEN RETAINED INDEFINITELY BY SUBSIDIARY

COMPANIES FOR REINVESTMENT, THEREFORE NO PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE

FOR INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE UPON THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF

SUCH EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSIDIARIES

OPERATING IN PUERTO RICO AND SINGAPORE UNDER TAX INCENTIVE

GRANTS THAT EXPIRE IN 2028 AND 2026, RESPECTIVELY.

REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

SHAREHOLDERS OF MERCK & CO., INC..

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, OF RETAINED EARNINGS, OF

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF MERCK &

CO., INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND

THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR

OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT UNDER

ITEM 9A. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A

MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN

AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE

ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS IN

2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN 2007.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS

IN MAY 2000, MERCK & CO., INC. (MERCK) AND

SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION (SCHERING-PLOUGH)

(COLLECTIVELY THE PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS

(THE AGREEMENTS) TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES, SCHERING-PLOUGHS THEN INVESTIGATIONAL

CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITOR (CAI) EZETIMIBE

(MARKETED TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES AS ZETIA AND AS EZETROL IN

MOST OTHER COUNTRIES) (THE CHOLESTEROL

COLLABORATION) AND A FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING

THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE (THE

RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION). MONTELUKAST SODIUM, A

LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IS SOLD BY MERCK AS SINGULAIR

AND LORATADINE, AN ANTIHISTAMINE, IS SOLD BY SCHERING-PLOUGH AS

CLARITIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE INDICATED FOR THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS

OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS. THE RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION WAS

TERMINATED IN 2008 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS,

FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF A NOT-APPROVABLE LETTER FROM THE

U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOR THE

FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET.

THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION IS FORMALLY REFERRED TO AS THE

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL PARTNERSHIP (THE

DRUG, AND



EZETIMIBE AND SIMVASTATIN (MERCKS EXISTING ZOCOR STATIN

CHOLESTEROL MODIFYING MEDICINE) COMBINED INTO ONE TABLET

(MARKETED TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES AS VYTORIN AND AS INEGY IN

MOST OTHER COUNTRIES).

VYTORIN AND ZETIA WERE APPROVED BY THE FDA IN JULY 2004 AND

OCTOBER 2002, RESPECTIVELY. TOGETHER, THESE PRODUCTS, WHETHER

MARKETED AS VYTORIN, ZETIA OR UNDER OTHER TRADEMARKS LOCALLY,

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS.

PROPERTY AND TO FUND AND OVERSEE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES OF THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION. IN

ALL OTHER MARKETS EXCEPT LATIN AMERICA, SUBSIDIARIES OF MERCK OR

SCHERING-PLOUGH PERFORM MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR THE CHOLESTEROL

CONSEQUENTLY, SELLING, PROMOTION AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES FOR

THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS WITHIN LATIN AMERICA ARE NOT INCLUDED

OF MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH. THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGAL ENTITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND MOST

ACTIVITIES ARE PERFORMED BY EMPLOYEES OF EITHER MERCK OR

SCHERING-PLOUGH UNDER SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH THE PARTNERSHIP.

ARRANGEMENTS IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, ARE GENERALLY

DEFINED AS NET SALES MINUS (1) AGREED UPON MANUFACTURING

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE PARTNERS AND INVOICED TO THE

PARTNERSHIP, (2) DIRECT PROMOTION EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE

DEPENDENT ON THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS. ANY EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE MARKET FOR THOSE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE PARTNERSHIPS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH

FLOWS. THESE EVENTS COULD INCLUDE LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION,

INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING, INCREASED

COMPETITION FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE

TREATMENTS, EXCLUSION FROM GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS,

DISCONTINUATION OR REMOVAL FROM THE MARKET OF A PRODUCT FOR

SAFETY OR OTHER REASON, AND THE RESULTS OF FUTURE CLINICAL OR

OUTCOMES STUDIES (NOTE 5).

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED BALANCE SHEETS AND COMBINED STATEMENTS

OF NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES, CASH FLOWS AND

PARTNERS CAPITAL (DEFICIT) INCLUDE THE CHOLESTEROL AND

RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES.

THE RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY PERTAINED TO

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT WORK AND PRE-LAUNCH MARKETING ACTIVITIES.

SPENDING ON RESPIRATORY-RELATED ACTIVITIES CEASED IN 2008

FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF THE COLLABORATION, AND IS NOT MATERIAL

TO THE INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THE YEARS PRESENTED.

NET SALES INCLUDE THE NET SALES OF THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS SOLD

BY THE COMBINED COMPANIES. EXPENSES INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT MERCK

AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO DIRECTLY

INVOICE TO THE PARTNERSHIP, OR ARE SHARED THROUGH THE

CONTRACTUAL PROFIT SHARING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, AS

DESCRIBED ABOVE.

THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED FOR

THE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN RULES AND REGULATIONS OF

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND REFLECT THE

ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL

AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTNERS. SUCH COMBINED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE ONLY THE EXPENSES AGREED BY THE PARTNERS TO

BE SHARED OR INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF PROFITS UNDER THE

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTNERSHIP, AND ARE NOT INTENDED

TO BE A COMPLETE PRESENTATION OF ALL OF THE COSTS AND EXPENSES

THAT WOULD BE INCURRED BY A STAND-ALONE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

FOR THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION AND

MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.

UNDER THE CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, CERTAIN

ACTIVITIES ARE CHARGED TO THE PARTNERSHIP BY THE PARTNERS BASED

ON CONTRACTUALLY AGREED UPON ALLOCATIONS OF PARTNER-INCURRED

EXPENSES AS DESCRIBED BELOW. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ANY

ALLOCATIONS OF EXPENSES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE MADE ON A BASIS THAT

REASONABLY REFLECTS THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF SUPPORT PROVIDED. ALL

OTHER EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES OF THE PARTNERS AND ARE REFLECTED IN

THEIR SEPARATE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PROFIT SHARING ARRANGEMENTS UNDER THE

CHOLESTEROL COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT ONLY CERTAIN

PARTNER-INCURRED COSTS AND EXPENSES BE INVOICED TO THE

PARTNERSHIP BY THE PARTNERS AND THEREFORE BECOME PART OF THE

PROFIT SHARING CALCULATION. THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS LIST THE

TYPICAL CATEGORIES OF COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT ARE GENERALLY

INCURRED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE,

DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF THE CHOLESTEROL PRODUCTS AND

PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF HOW SUCH COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE TREATED

IN THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET SALES AND

CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES, AND IN DETERMINING PROFITS UNDER THE

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS.

SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES

OF COMBINATION

THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED BALANCE SHEETS AND COMBINED STATEMENTS

OF NET SALES AND CONTRACTUAL EXPENSES, CASH FLOWS AND

PARTNERS CAPITAL (DEFICIT) INCLUDE THE CHOLESTEROL AND

RESPIRATORY COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES.

INTERPARTNERSHIP BALANCES AND PROFITS ARE ELIMINATED.

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED BASED ON

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE,

AND INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING

SUCH ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS AND

GOVERNMENT AND MANAGED CARE REBATES. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY

INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

OF THESE OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN PARTNERS CAPITAL, AND

ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID

MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF LESS THAN

THREE MONTHS. IN 2007, THE PARTNERSHIP CHANGED CERTAIN CASH

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CASH HELD BY THE

PARTNERSHIP. THE PARTNERSHIPS CASH, WHICH IS PRIMARILY

INVESTED IN HIGHLY LIQUID MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, IS USED TO

FUND TRADE OBLIGATIONS COMING DUE IN THE MONTH AND FOR

DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTNERS. INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION TO SELLING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE IN THE ACCOMPANYING COMBINED

IN THE UNITED STATES, SALES DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS AS

DIRECT DISCOUNTS AT THE POINT-OF-SALE OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN

INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALE PURCHASER, KNOWN AS CHARGEBACKS, OR

INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF REBATES. ADDITIONALLY, SALES ARE

GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF RETURN UNDER CERTAIN

CONDITIONS. SALES ARE RECORDED NET OF PROVISIONS FOR SALES

DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS FOR WHICH RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE

AT THE TIME OF SALE. RESERVES FOR CHARGEBACKS, DISCOUNTS AND

RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ARE REFLECTED AS A DIRECT REDUCTION TO

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND AMOUNTED TO $34 MILLION AND

$44 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. ACCRUALS FOR REBATES ARE REFLECTED AS REBATES

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE PARTNERSHIP HAD $49 MILLION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COMPRISED SOLELY OF NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS (NOLS) GENERATED BY A BRANCH OF A

LEGAL ENTITY OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THESE NOLS EXPIRE BETWEEN 2009

AND 2015, AND CARRY A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN JANUARY 2007,

THE PARTNERSHIP ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

LEGAL AND

OTHER MATTERS

THE PARTNERSHIP MAY BECOME PARTY TO CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE PARTNERSHIP RECORDS A

LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MATTERS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE A

LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND AN AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND

INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE PARTNERSHIP MAINTAINS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH DEDUCTIBLES

AND SELF-INSURANCE AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS COST BENEFICIAL.

THE PARTNERSHIP SELF-INSURES ALL OF ITS RISK AS IT RELATES TO

PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ACCRUES AN ESTIMATE OF PRODUCT LIABILITY

CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM

GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC. USA (GLENMARK), A

GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN

ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION (ANDA) FOR A

GENERIC FORM OF ZETIA AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE

U.S. PATENTS THAT ARE LISTED FOR ZETIA. IN MARCH 2007,

SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE PARTNERSHIP FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT

SUIT AGAINST GLENMARK AND ITS PARENT COMPANY. THE LAWSUIT

AUTOMATICALLY STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF GLENMARKS ANDA UNTIL

THE EARLIER OF OCTOBER 2010 OR AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF

ANY. SCHERING-PLOUGH AND THE PARTNERSHIP INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY

DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH THEY BELIEVE ARE VALID, AGAINST

INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS

PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY

LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE OUTCOMES WHICH, IF

ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF

EXCLUSIVITY.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE PARTNERS ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE

EFFECT OF COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS.

SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS

WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA

(ENHANCE) CLINICAL TRIAL, AN IMAGING TRIAL IN

720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES VERY

HIGH LEVELS OF LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL AND GREATLY

INCREASES THE RISK FOR PREMATURE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

DESPITE THE FACT THAT EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG (VYTORIN)

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN

SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND

SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE PRE-SPECIFIED PRIMARY ENDPOINT, A

CHANGE IN THE THICKNESS OF CAROTID ARTERY WALLS OVER TWO YEARS

AS MEASURED BY ULTRASOUND. THERE ALSO WERE NO SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND

SIMVASTATIN ON THE FOUR PRE-SPECIFIED KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINTS.

PERCENT OF PATIENTS MANIFESTING REGRESSION IN THE AVERAGE

CAROTID ARTERY INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS (CA IMT);

PROPORTION OF PATIENTS DEVELOPING NEW CAROTID ARTERY PLAQUES

>1.3 MM; CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM CA IMT; AND CHANGES

IN THE AVERAGE CA IMT PLUS IN THE AVERAGE COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY

IMT. IN ENHANCE, WHEN COMPARED TO SIMVASTATIN ALONE,

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED LDL BAD

CHOLESTEROL, AS WELL AS TRIGLYCERIDES AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN

(CRP). EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR

THE REDUCTION OF CRP. IN THE ENHANCE STUDY, THE OVERALL SAFETY

PROFILE OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN WAS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH

THE PRODUCT LABEL. THE ENHANCE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED NOR

POWERED TO EVALUATE CARDIOVASCULAR CLINICAL EVENTS. THE IMPROVED

REDUCTION IN HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS PRESENTING WITH ACUTE CORONARY

SYNDROME (IMPROVE-IT) TRIAL IS UNDERWAY AND IS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES DATA FOR

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME.

NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN ON

CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT

DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN MARCH

2008, THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE WERE REPORTED AT THE ANNUAL

SCIENTIFIC SESSION OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY. IN

JANUARY 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS REVIEW

OF THE FINAL CLINICAL STUDY REPORT OF ENHANCE. THE FDA STATED

THAT THE RESULTS FROM ENHANCE DID NOT CHANGE ITS POSITION THAT

AN ELEVATED LDL CHOLESTEROL IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE AND THAT LOWERING LDL CHOLESTEROL REDUCES THE RISK FOR

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE FDA ALSO STATED THAT, BASED ON

CURRENT AVAILABLE DATA, PATIENTS SHOULD NOT STOP TAKING VYTORIN

OR OTHER CHOLESTEROL LOWERING MEDICATIONS AND SHOULD TALK TO

THEIR DOCTOR IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT VYTORIN, ZETIA, OR

THE ENHANCE TRIAL.

155

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON JULY 21, 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE

SIMVASTATIN AND EZETIMIBE IN AORTIC STENOSIS (SEAS)

STUDY WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER

INTENSIVE LIPID LOWERING WITH VYTORIN 10/40 MG WOULD REDUCE THE

NEED FOR AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR

MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH

ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO HAD NO

INDICATION FOR STATIN THERAPY. VYTORIN FAILED TO MEET ITS

PRIMARY END POINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR

EVENTS. THERE ALSO WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE KEY

SECONDARY END POINT OF AORTIC VALVE EVENTS; HOWEVER, THERE WAS A

REDUCTION IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS TAKING VYTORIN COMPARED TO

PLACEBO IN THE KEY SECONDARY END POINT OF ISCHEMIC

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. VYTORIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR THE

TREATMENT OF AORTIC STENOSIS. NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF VYTORIN

ON CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT

DEMONSTRATED FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN THE STUDY,

PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK VYTORIN 10/40 MG HAD A HIGHER

INCIDENCE OF CANCER THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO. THERE WAS

ALSO A NONSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM CANCER IN PATIENTS

IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK VYTORIN VERSUS THOSE WHO TOOK PLACEBO.

CANCER AND CANCER DEATHS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL MAJOR ORGAN

SYSTEMS. THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP BELIEVE THE CANCER

FINDING IN SEAS IS LIKELY TO BE AN ANOMALY THAT, TAKEN IN LIGHT

OF ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION WITH

VYTORIN. IN AUGUST 2008, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS

INVESTIGATING THE RESULTS FROM THE SEAS TRIAL. IN THIS

ANNOUNCEMENT, THE FDA ALSO CITED INTERIM DATA FROM TWO LARGE

ONGOING CARDIOVASCULAR TRIALS OF VYTORIN  THE STUDY

OF HEART AND RENAL PROTECTION (SHARP) AND THE

IMPROVE-IT CLINICAL TRIALS  IN WHICH THERE WAS NO

INCREASED RISK OF CANCER WITH THE COMBINATION OF SIMVASTATIN

PLUS EZETIMIBE. THE SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN

2010. THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION AROUND

2012. THE FDA DETERMINED THAT, AS OF THAT TIME, THESE FINDINGS

IN THE SEAS TRIAL PLUS THE INTERIM DATA FROM ONGOING TRIALS

SHOULD NOT PROMPT PATIENTS TO STOP TAKING VYTORIN OR ANY OTHER

CHOLESTEROL LOWERING DRUG.

THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

REGULATORY AGENCIES TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE AVAILABLE DATA AND

INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE DATA, AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGES

IN THE CLINICAL USE OF VYTORIN ARE WARRANTED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE DECEMBER 2007, MERCK AND

SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS ADDRESSED TO BOTH

COMPANIES FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, ITS

SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS

(O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE

SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF

WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF

ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND

PROMOTION OF VYTORIN, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE

OFFICERS OF MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH. IN ADDITION, SINCE AUGUST

2008, THE PARTNERS HAVE RECEIVED THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS FROM

O&I, INCLUDING ONE DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2009, SEEKING

CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SEAS CLINICAL

TRIAL. ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE PARTNERS AND THE

PARTNERSHIP HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK AND NEW

JERSEY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OFFICES AND A LETTER FROM THE

CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND

DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP HAVE

RECEIVED FIVE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CIDS)

FROM A MULTISTATE GROUP OF 35 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO ARE

JOINTLY INVESTIGATING WHETHER VIOLATIONS OF STATE CONSUMER

PROTECTION LAWS OCCURRED WHEN MARKETING VYTORIN. FINALLY, IN

SEPTEMBER 2008, MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

(DOJ) INFORMING THEM THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING

WHETHER THE COMPANIES CONDUCT RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH

CARE PROGRAMS. THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP ARE COOPERATING

WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND RESPONDING TO THE INQUIRIES. IN

ADDITION, THE PARTNERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP HAVE BECOME AWARE OF

OR BEEN SERVED WITH APPROXIMATELY 145 CIVIL CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS ALLEGING COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN AND ZETIA. CERTAIN OF THOSE LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL

INJURIES

AND/OR

SEEK

MEDICAL MONITORING. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED IN OR

TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT, ARE COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT

COURT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE DENNIS M. CAVANAUGH.

THE PARTIES ARE PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN MOTIONS PRACTICE AND

BRIEFING.

WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE

INVESTIGATIONS OR LAWSUITS ARISING FROM THE ENHANCE AND SEAS

CLINICAL TRIALS, UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PARTNERSHIPS FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.
