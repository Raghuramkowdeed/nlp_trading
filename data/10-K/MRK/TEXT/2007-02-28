ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

DATA BELOW.

OVERVIEW

 DURING 2006, MERCK CONTINUED TO

EXECUTE ITS STRATEGY TO RECLAIM ITS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. THIS WAS MADE EVIDENT THROUGH THE

SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES OF FIVE NOVEL MEDICINES AND VACCINES IN

AREAS SUCH AS CANCER PREVENTION AND DIABETES, THE ADVANCEMENT OF

DRUG CANDIDATES THROUGH EVERY PHASE OF THE COMPANYS

PIPELINE AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF ITS NEWER AND IN-LINE

PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS DEVELOPING A NEW

COMMERCIAL MODEL WHICH IS DESIGNED TO BROADEN ITS ENGAGEMENT

WITH CUSTOMERS AND SCIENTIFIC LEADERS, LEVERAGE ALTERNATIVE

CHANNELS TO COMPLEMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS SALES FORCE, AND

DRIVE GROWTH IN KEY MARKETS.

DURING 2006, FIVE PRODUCTS RECEIVED U.S. FOOD AND DRUG

ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVAL.

GARDASIL

[QUADRIVALENT HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (TYPES 6,

11, 16, 18) RECOMBINANT VACCINE], THE FIRST VACCINE

FOR THE PREVENTION OF CERVICAL CANCER AND GENITAL WARTS CAUSED

BY CERTAIN TYPES OF HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV);

JANUVIA

(SITAGLIPTIN PHOSPHATE), THE FIRST MEDICINE OF

ITS CLASS THAT ENHANCES A NATURAL BODY SYSTEM TO IMPROVE BLOOD

SUGAR CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES;

ZOSTAVAX

[ZOSTER VACCINE LIVE (OKA/MERCK)], THE FIRST VACCINE FOR

ADULTS 60 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF

SHINGLES, A DISEASE WHICH EVERY YEAR AFFLICTS AN ESTIMATED ONE

MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE;

ROTATEQ

(ROTAVIRUS VACCINE, LIVE, ORAL PENTAVALENT), A PEDIATRIC

VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND

CHILDREN, THE EFFECTS OF WHICH TAKE THE LIVES OF NEARLY

600,000 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE WORLDWIDE EVERY

YEAR; AND

ZOLINZA

(VORINOSTAT), A NOVEL MEDICINE TO TREAT

PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ADVANCED CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA

(CTCL).

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS THREE DRUG CANDIDATES CURRENTLY

UNDER FDA REVIEW.

JANUMET

(PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS

MK-0431A), AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL MEDICINE COMBINING

SITAGLIPTIN PHOSPHATE WITH METFORMIN FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES THAT IS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR PATIENTS

WHO NEED MORE THAN ONE ORAL AGENT TO HELP CONTROL THEIR BLOOD

SUGAR;

EMEND

FOR INJECTION (MK-0517), AN INTRAVENOUS

THERAPY FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING

(CINV); AND

ARCOXIA

, MERCKS SELECTIVE

COX-2 INHIBITOR FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES FILING THREE NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS (NDA)

WITH THE FDA IN 2007: MK-0518, A

FIRST-IN-CLASS HIV

INTEGRASE INHIBITOR; GABOXADOL, A NOVEL COMPOUND FROM

MERCKS ALLIANCE WITH H. LUNDBECK A/S FOR THE TREATMENT OF

INSOMNIA; AND MK-0524A, AN EXTENDED-RELEASE (ER)

NIACIN COMBINED WITH LAROPIPRANT (A NOVEL FLUSHING PATHWAY

INHIBITOR) FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, BY MID-YEAR

2007, MERCK EXPECTS TO HAVE FOUR PRODUCTS IN PHASE III

DEVELOPMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, TARGETED ACQUISITIONS MADE DURING THE YEAR OF

SIRNA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (SIRNA), GLYCOFI, INC.

(GLYCOFI) AND ABMAXIS, INC. (ABMAXIS),

AS WELL AS OTHER ALLIANCES AND COLLABORATIONS, WILL COMPLEMENT

2

MERCKS STRONG INTERNAL RESEARCH CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD

CONTINUE TO HELP THE COMPANY BUILD A PIPELINE THAT WILL SUPPORT

ITS LONG-TERM GROWTH.

MERCK IS WORKING TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED

PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. THE COMPANY

HAS SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED LATE DEVELOPMENT PRODUCT CYCLE TIMES

AND ANTICIPATES FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN THE COMING YEAR.

ADDITIONALLY, MERCKS NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL IS EXPECTED TO

LOWER SPENDING PER PRIMARY CARE BRAND BY 15% TO 20% IN THE

UNITED STATES FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010 (AN INTERIM TARGETED 9%

REDUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE END OF

2007) WHILE STILL APPROPRIATELY SUPPORTING PRODUCT

LAUNCHES, AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF FIVE NEW

PRODUCTS IN 2006. THROUGH REDEPLOYMENT, THE LAUNCHES WERE

ACHIEVED WITH NO INCREASE IN SALES FORCE.

THE INITIAL PHASE OF A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO

REDUCE THE COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY

AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS IS UNDERWAY. THE INITIAL STEPS

INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK

MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER,

MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, IN 2005,

MERCK ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SELL OR CLOSE FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES

AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES BY THE END OF 2008 (THREE OF THE

MANUFACTURING SITES WERE CLOSED, SOLD OR HAD CEASED OPERATIONS

AND THE TWO PRECLINICAL SITES WERE CLOSED BY THE END OF 2006),

AND ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,000 POSITIONS COMPANY-WIDE (OF

WHICH APPROXIMATELY 4,800 POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED BY THE END

OF 2006 COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AND THE

ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS). HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES AS THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS REQUIRES IT. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO SOLD CERTAIN OTHER

FACILITIES AND RELATED ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THE PRE-TAX COSTS OF THIS RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM WERE $935.5 MILLION IN 2006 (COMPRISED OF

$793.2 MILLION PRIMARILY REPRESENTING ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT COSTS AND $142.3 MILLION

OF SEPARATION AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS) AND ARE

EXPECTED TO BE $300 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN 2007.

THROUGH THE END OF 2008, WHEN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURING STRATEGY IS

EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, THE CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX

COSTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM

$1.9 BILLION TO $2.2 BILLION. MERCK CONTINUES TO

EXPECT THE INITIAL PHASE OF ITS COST REDUCTION PROGRAM TO YIELD

CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX SAVINGS OF $4.5 TO $5.0 BILLION FROM

2006 THROUGH 2010.

WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, TO DATE IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, OF THE 29 PLAINTIFFS

WHOSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN

WERE DISMISSED, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE WITHDRAWN FROM THE

TRIAL CALENDAR BY PLAINTIFFS, AND JURIES HAVE DECIDED IN

MERCKS FAVOR NINE TIMES AND IN PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FOUR

TIMES. IN ADDITION, IN THE RECENT CALIFORNIA TRIAL INVOLVING TWO

PLAINTIFFS, THE JURY COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT FOR EITHER

PLAINTIFF AND A MISTRIAL WAS DECLARED. A NEW JERSEY STATE JUDGE

SET ASIDE ONE OF THE NINE MERCK VERDICTS. WITH RESPECT TO THE

FOUR PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK ALREADY HAS FILED AN

APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE CASES, AND IN

ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD

SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. IN ADDITION, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL WITH TWO

PLAINTIFFS IS CURRENTLY ONGOING IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN

NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE CAROL E. HIGBEE AND

ANOTHER TRIAL HAS COMMENCED IN STATE COURT IN ILLINOIS. DURING

2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE,

INCLUDING $175 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

RECORDED CHARGES OF $673 MILLION TO INCREASE THE RESERVE

SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 THE BALANCE OF THE

RESERVE WAS $858 MILLION. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY

BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2008. THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION IS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION FOR 2006 WERE $2.03,

INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM OF

$0.28 PER SHARE, THE ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO

THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA OF $0.21 PER SHARE AND THE

ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF GLYCOFI

OF $0.14 PER SHARE (AS DISCUSSED IN

ACQUISITIONS BELOW), ADDITIONAL RESERVES ESTABLISHED

SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR

VIOXX

LITIGATION (AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS BELOW) AND THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING A NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARD REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS (AS

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF VIOXX

 ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MERCK ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY WORLDWIDE

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN

MEDICATION. THE COMPANYS DECISION, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE

IMMEDIATELY, WAS BASED ON NEW THREE-YEAR DATA FROM A

PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL,

APPROVE (ADENOMATOUS POLYP PREVENTION ON

VIOXX

).

THE TRIAL, WHICH WAS STOPPED, WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE

EFFICACY OF

VIOXX

25 MG IN PREVENTING THE RECURRENCE

OF COLORECTAL POLYPS IN PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF COLORECTAL

ADENOMAS AND, IN COMBINATION WITH TWO OTHER TRIALS, TO FURTHER

ASSESS THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY OF

VIOXX.

IN THIS STUDY,

THERE WAS AN INCREASED RELATIVE RISK FOR CONFIRMED

CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, SUCH AS HEART ATTACK AND STROKE, WHICH

BECAME APPARENT BEGINNING AFTER ABOUT 18 MONTHS OF

TREATMENT IN THE PATIENTS TAKING

VIOXX

COMPARED TO THOSE

TAKING PLACEBO. FOR APPROXIMATELY THE FIRST 18 MONTHS OF

THE APPROVE STUDY THE

VIOXX

AND PLACEBO CURVES APPEARED

TO BE SIMILAR AND, IN THIS RESPECT, THE APPROVE RESULTS WERE

SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS OF TWO PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDIES

DESCRIBED IN THE U.S. LABELING FOR

VIOXX

AS OF THE

TIME OF WITHDRAWAL.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE 105 MILLION

U.S. PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN FOR

VIOXX

FROM MAY 1999

THROUGH AUGUST 2004. BASED ON THIS ESTIMATE, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES THAT THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN

VIOXX

IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE ITS 1999 LAUNCH IS APPROXIMATELY

20 MILLION. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES WHO HAVE TAKEN

VIOXX

IS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM SENATOR

CHARLES GRASSLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE,

REQUESTING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY ALSO RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

FROM OTHER CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. THE COMPANY HAS COOPERATED

WITH THESE INQUIRIES AND HAS CONTINUED TO DESCRIBE THE REASONS

FOR THE COMPANYS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

AND

TO ANSWER ANY

5

QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DEVELOPMENT AND

EXTENSIVE TESTING OF THE MEDICINE AND ITS DISCLOSURES OF THE

RESULTS OF ITS STUDIES.

ON FEBRUARY

16-18,

2005,

THE FDA HELD A JOINT MEETING OF THE ARTHRITIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE

AND THE DRUG SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE

COMMITTEES DISCUSSED THE OVERALL

BENEFIT-TO-RISK

CONSIDERATIONS (INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL

SAFETY CONCERNS) FOR COX-2 SELECTIVE NONSTEROIDAL

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND RELATED AGENTS. ON FEBRUARY 18,

2005, THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES WERE ASKED TO VOTE ON

WHETHER THE OVERALL RISK VERSUS BENEFIT PROFILE FOR

VIOXX

SUPPORTS MARKETING IN THE UNITED STATES. THE MEMBERS OF THE

COMMITTEES VOTED 17 TO 15 IN SUPPORT OF THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX

IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY LOOKS FORWARD TO

FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES ABOUT

VIOXX.

AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY

APPOINTED A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE COMPANYS

ACTIONS PRIOR TO ITS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX,

TO

ACT FOR THE BOARD IN RESPONDING TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION

MATTERS RELATED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF

ACQUISITIONS

 IN MAY 2006, MERCK ACQUIRED

ABMAXIS, A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY DEDICATED TO

THE DISCOVERY AND OPTIMIZATION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY (MAB)

PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN THERAPEUTICS AND DIAGNOSTICS, FOR

APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION.

IN JUNE 2006, MERCK ACQUIRED GLYCOFI, A PRIVATELY-HELD

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY, A LEADER IN THE FIELD OF YEAST

GLYCOENGINEERING, WHICH IS THE ADDITION OF SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE

MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROTEINS IN YEAST, AND OPTIMIZATION OF

BIOLOGIC DRUG MOLECULES, FOR APPROXIMATELY $373 MILLION.

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK ACQUIRED SIRNA, A PUBLICLY-HELD

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND A LEADER IN DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF

MEDICINES BASED ON RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI)

TECHNOLOGY FOR A TOTAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION.

THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE MERCKS

ABILITY TO USE RNAI TECHNOLOGY TO TURN OFF A TARGETED GENE IN A

HUMAN CELL, POTENTIALLY RENDERING INOPERATIVE A GENE RESPONSIBLE

FOR TRIGGERING A SPECIFIC DISEASE.

JOINT VENTURES

 THE COMPANY HAS A NUMBER OF

JOINT VENTURES RELATING TO ITS PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINES

SEGMENTS.

PHARMACEUTICAL

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE

SEPARATE EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE

UNITED STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. IN

DECEMBER 2001, THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD,

EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN OCTOBER 2002,

ZETIA (

EZETIMIBE)

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), THE

FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS

LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JULY 2004,

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES), A

COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR,

WAS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN EQUALLY

OWNED JOINT VENTURE THAT DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF

ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC

, THE FIRST IN A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS

KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF

ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA RESTRUCTURED THE JOINT VENTURE

WHEREBY THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN THE JOINT

VENTURE, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED

KBIS OPERATING ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE

PARTNERSHIP), IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A

LIMITED

6

PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP,

BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH KBI

RETAINED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY EARNS CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP RETURNS

AS WELL AS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE

KBI PRODUCTS. THE PARTNERSHIP RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN

PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS

BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC.

PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED PARTNERSHIP GAAP EARNINGS.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, ASTRA PURCHASED AN OPTION TO BUY THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTED

ASTRA AN OPTION (THE SHARES OPTION) TO BUY THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI, AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES

OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

IN APRIL 1999, ASTRA MERGED WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC, FORMING

ASTRAZENECA AB (ASTRAZENECA). AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPANYS RELINQUISHMENT OF

RIGHTS TO FUTURE ASTRA PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING

U.S. PATENTS AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID

$967.4 MILLION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE MERGER ALSO TRIGGERS A PARTIAL

REDEMPTION OF THE COMPANYS LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN

2008. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, ASTRAZENECAS

OPTION TO BUY THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS IS

EXERCISABLE IN 2010 AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE

ASTRAZENECA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008. IN ADDITION, THE

SHARES OPTION IS EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS

PURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS. THE

EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION BY ASTRA IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR IN THE

YEAR 2017 OR IF COMBINED ANNUAL SALES OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL

BELOW A MINIMUM AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG AS

EITHER THE MERCK OPTION IN 2008 OR ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN

2010 HAS BEEN EXERCISED. THE EXERCISE PRICE IS BASED ON THE

PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE.

IN 1989, THE COMPANY FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH

JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO DEVELOP AND MARKET A BROAD RANGE

OF NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS 50%

OWNED JOINT VENTURE WAS EXPANDED INTO EUROPE IN 1993, AND INTO

CANADA IN 1996. SIGNIFICANT JOINT VENTURE PRODUCTS ARE

PEPCID

AC

(FAMOTIDINE), AN

OVER-THE-COUNTER

FORM OF THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION

PEPCID

(FAMOTIDINE), AS WELL AS

PEPCID COMPLETE,

AN

OVER-THE-COUNTER

PRODUCT WHICH COMBINES THE COMPANYS ULCER MEDICATION WITH

ANTACIDS (CALCIUM CARBONATE AND MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE). IN MARCH

2004, THE COMPANY SOLD TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON ITS

INTEREST IN THE EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE.

VACCINES

IN 1992, THE COMPANY AND CONNAUGHT LABORATORIES, INC. (NOW

SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.) AGREED TO COLLABORATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT

AND MARKETING OF COMBINATION PEDIATRIC VACCINES AND TO PROMOTE

SELECTED VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES. WHILE COMBINATION

VACCINE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS CONTINUE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NO

VACCINES ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROMOTED.

IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW

SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.) FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET HUMAN

VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE THEN EXISTING EU

AND THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY AND SANOFI

PASTEUR CONTRIBUTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEIR EUROPEAN VACCINE

BUSINESSES FOR EQUAL SHARES IN THE JOINT VENTURE, KNOWN AS

PASTEUR MÉRIEUX MSD, S.N.C. (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR MSD,

S.N.C.). THE JOINT VENTURE MAINTAINS A PRESENCE, DIRECTLY OR

THROUGH AFFILIATES OR BRANCHES IN BELGIUM, ITALY, GERMANY,

SPAIN, FRANCE, AUSTRIA, IRELAND, SWEDEN, PORTUGAL, THE

NETHERLANDS, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THROUGH

DISTRIBUTORS IN THE REST OF ITS TERRITORY.

OTHER

IN 1997, THE COMPANY AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW

SANOFI-AVENTIS S.A.) COMBINED THEIR RESPECTIVE ANIMAL HEALTH AND

POULTRY GENETICS BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED

(MERIAL), A FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY,

WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH

PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS

AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE

OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL SPECIES.

COMPETITION

 THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY

REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT

CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

7

SUCH COMPETITION INVOLVES AN INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO MARKET THESE INNOVATIONS

EFFECTIVELY. WITH ITS LONG-STANDING EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANY IS WELL PREPARED TO COMPETE IN THE

SEARCH FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

MEET COMPETITION INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL, FLEXIBILITY TO MEET

CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS, AN EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND A

STRONG TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVE IN

ACQUIRING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND

LICENSES AND HAS BEEN REFINING ITS SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS

TO FURTHER ADDRESS CHANGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS. TO ENHANCE ITS

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE EXTERNAL

ALLIANCES, FROM EARLY-STAGE TO LATE-STAGE PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES,

INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES AND TARGETED ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES BY COMPETITORS MAY

RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS AND PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS, EVEN FOR

PRODUCTS PROTECTED BY PATENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBER OF

COMPOUNDS AVAILABLE TO TREAT DISEASES TYPICALLY INCREASES OVER

TIME AND HAS RESULTED IN SLOWING THE GROWTH IN SALES OF CERTAIN

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS,

ALLOWS, ENCOURAGES OR, IN A FEW INSTANCES, IN THE ABSENCE OF

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN, MANDATES

THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS (THOSE CONTAINING THE

SAME ACTIVE CHEMICAL AS AN INNOVATORS PRODUCT) RATHER THAN

BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS. GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER

PRESSURES TOWARD THE DISPENSING OF GENERIC PRODUCTS HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY PATENTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR,

WHICH LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE U.S. IN 2006 AND

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES THEREAFTER.

DISTRIBUTION

 THE COMPANY SELLS ITS HUMAN

HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND

RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONS. HUMAN HEALTH VACCINES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO

PHYSICIANS, WHOLESALERS, PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT

ENTITIES. THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES

COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY AND VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE PRODUCTS TO HEALTH

CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES AND

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW

DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FOR U.S. WHOLESALERS TO MODERATE THE

FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES CAUSED BY WHOLESALER INVESTMENT BUYING AND

IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF COMPANY

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE NEW PROGRAM LOWERED PREVIOUS LIMITS

ON AVERAGE MONTHLY PURCHASES OF COMPANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS

BY U.S. CUSTOMERS. FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

PROGRAM, FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES CAUSED BY WHOLESALER INVESTMENT

BUYING SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATED.

RAW MATERIALS

 RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE

PURCHASED WORLDWIDE AND ARE NORMALLY AVAILABLE IN QUANTITIES

ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMPANYS PHARMACEUTICAL

AND VACCINES SEGMENTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND INVESTIGATION

 THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL REGULATION BY

REGIONAL, COUNTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. OF PARTICULAR

IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ADMINISTERS

REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY,

EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. IN 1997, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

MODERNIZATION ACT (THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT) WAS

PASSED AND WAS THE CULMINATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE

REFORM EFFORT DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE REGULATORY PROCEDURES

WITHIN THE FDA AND TO IMPROVE THE REGULATION OF DRUGS, MEDICAL

DEVICES AND FOOD. THE LEGISLATION WAS PRINCIPALLY DESIGNED TO

ENSURE THE TIMELY AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS AND

BIOLOGICS BY EXPEDITING THE PREMARKET REVIEW PROCESS FOR NEW

PRODUCTS. A KEY PROVISION OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE

RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT OF 1992,

WHICH PERMITS THE CONTINUED COLLECTION OF USER FEES FROM

PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO AUGMENT FDA RESOURCES

EARMARKED FOR THE REVIEW OF HUMAN DRUG APPLICATIONS. THIS HELPS

PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PROMPT APPROVAL OF

SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NEW DRUGS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS

BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER

2003. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING

ACCESS TO MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE

PRESERVING MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

INNOVATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE

8

PRESSURES AND BY ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES.

IN ADDRESSING COST-CONTAINMENT PRESSURE, THE COMPANY HAS MADE A

CONTINUING EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP

SAVE COSTS IN OVERALL PATIENT HEALTH CARE.

FOR MANY YEARS, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER

FEDERAL AND STATE OVERSIGHT WITH THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR NEW

DRUGS, DRUG SAFETY, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, DRUG PURCHASING

AND REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND FORMULARIES VARIOUSLY UNDER

REVIEW. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW DRUGS

TO THE MARKET, IN THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. ONE TYPE OF

FEDERAL INITIATIVE TO CONTAIN FEDERAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING IS

THE PROSPECTIVE OR CAPITATED PAYMENT SYSTEM, FIRST

IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE

REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS. SUCH A SYSTEM ESTABLISHES IN ADVANCE

A FLAT RATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE PATIENTS

FOR WHOM THE PAYOR IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. THIS TYPE OF PAYMENT

SYSTEM AND OTHER COST CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS ARE NOW WIDELY USED BY

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYORS AND HAVE CAUSED HOSPITALS, HEALTH

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY TO

BE MORE COST-CONSCIOUS IN THEIR TREATMENT DECISIONS, INCLUDING

DECISIONS REGARDING THE MEDICINES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR

PATIENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO WORK WITH PRIVATE AND FEDERAL

EMPLOYERS TO SLOW INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. FURTHER, THE

COMPANYS EFFORTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN

HELP SAVE COSTS IN OTHER AREAS HAVE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF THE

COMPANYS MEDICINES AND HAVE HELPED OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF

INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

ALSO, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED METHODS TO

DIRECTLY REDUCE THE COST OF DRUGS AND VACCINES FOR WHICH THEY

PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PAY

SPECIFIED REBATES FOR MEDICINES REIMBURSED BY MEDICAID, TO

PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR OUTPATIENT MEDICINES PURCHASED BY CERTAIN

PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ENTITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATE

SHARE HOSPITALS (HOSPITALS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA), AND

TO PROVIDE MINIMUM DISCOUNTS OF 24% OFF OF A DEFINED

NON-FEDERAL AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE FOR PURCHASES

BY CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

INITIATIVES IN SOME STATES SEEK REBATES BEYOND THE MINIMUM

REQUIRED BY MEDICAID LEGISLATION, IN SOME CASES FOR PATIENTS

BEYOND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. UNDER THE FEDERAL

VACCINES FOR CHILDREN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM, THE CDC FUNDS AND

PURCHASES RECOMMENDED PEDIATRIC VACCINES AT A PUBLIC SECTOR

PRICE FOR THE IMMUNIZATION OF MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE, UNINSURED,

NATIVE AMERICAN AND CERTAIN UNDERINSURED CHILDREN. THE COMPANY

WAS AWARDED A CDC CONTRACT IN APRIL 2006 WHICH IS IN EFFECT

UNTIL MARCH 2007 FOR THE SUPPLY OF PEDIATRIC VACCINES FOR THE

VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM THAT HAD AN AGGREGATE ESTIMATED

VALUE OF $550 MILLION AT SIGNING. AS OF JANUARY 1,

2006, PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID WHO ARE ALSO

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES (65 YEARS AND OLDER OR DISABLED)

LEFT THE STATE-ADMINISTERED MEDICAID SYSTEM TO BE COVERED BY THE

NEW MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ENCOUNTERS SIMILAR

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE

IT DOES BUSINESS. THERE, TOO, THE PRIMARY THRUST OF GOVERNMENTAL

INQUIRY AND ACTION IS TOWARD DETERMINING DRUG SAFETY AND

EFFECTIVENESS, OFTEN WITH MECHANISMS FOR CONTROLLING THE PRICES

OF OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE PROFITS OF

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES. THE EU HAS ADOPTED DIRECTIVES

CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION, LABELING, ADVERTISING, WHOLESALE

DISTRIBUTION AND APPROVAL FOR MARKETING OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

FOR HUMAN USE. THE COMPANYS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE

ALREADY CONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE DIRECTIVES;

CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND IS, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE

ACTIONS. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE SEIZURES OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

COMPANY ON ITS OWN MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT

RECALLS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, RECOGNIZING THE

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY, ARE

WORKING WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION (EC) ON PROPOSALS TO COMPLETE THE

SINGLE MARKET IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND IMPROVE THE

COMPETITIVE CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING MARKET

DEREGULATION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS GLOBALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

9

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

 PATENT

PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH

PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS.

PATENTS MAY COVER PRODUCTS

PER SE

, PHARMACEUTICAL

FORMULATIONS, PROCESSES FOR OR INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS OR THE USES OF PRODUCTS. PROTECTION FOR

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTENDS FOR VARYING PERIODS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE LEGAL LIFE OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE

PROTECTION AFFORDED, WHICH MAY ALSO VARY FROM COUNTRY TO

COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT AND ITS SCOPE OF

COVERAGE.

PATENT PORTFOLIOS DEVELOPED FOR PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE

COMPANY NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. BASIC PATENTS ARE

IN EFFECT FOR THE FOLLOWING MAJOR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES.

CANCIDAS, COMVAX

(

HAEMOPHILUS

B CONJUGATE AND

HEPATITIS B [RECOMBINANT] VACCINE)

, COSOPT, COZAAR,

CRIXIVAN

,

EMEND, FOSAMAX, GARDASIL, HYZAAR

,

INVANZ

(ERTAPENEM SODIUM),

MAXALT, PRIMAXIN, PROPECIA,

RECOMBIVAX HB

(HEPATITIS B VACCINE [RECOMBINANT])

,

ROTATEQ, SINGULAIR, JANUVIA

,

TRUSOPT, ZOLINZA

AND

ZOSTAVAX.

BASIC PATENTS ARE ALSO IN EFFECT IN THE UNITED

STATES FOR

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

, WHICH WERE DEVELOPED

BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP. A BASIC PATENT IS ALSO

IN EFFECT FOR

SUSTIVA/STOCRIN (EFAVIRENZ).

BRISTOL-MYERS

SQUIBB (BMS), UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE FROM THE

COMPANY, SELLS

SUSTIVA

IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND

CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY MARKETS

STOCRIN

IN OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE BASIC PATENT

FOR

AGGRASTAT

(TIROFIBAN HYDROCHLORIDE) IN THE UNITED

STATES WAS DIVESTED WITH THE PRODUCT IN 2003. THE COMPANY

RETAINS BASIC PATENTS FOR

AGGRASTAT

OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES.

THE FDA MODERNIZATION ACT INCLUDES A PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY

PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INDICATIONS OF NEW OR

CURRENTLY MARKETED DRUGS IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON PEDIATRIC

STUDIES ARE COMPLETED BY THE APPLICANT. THESE EXCLUSIVITY

PROVISIONS WERE RE-AUTHORIZED UNTIL OCTOBER 1, 2007 BY THE

BEST PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT PASSED IN

JANUARY 2002. IN 2005, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS

OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

INVANZ

UNTIL AUGUST 2013. IN 2004, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL

SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

TRUSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008. IN 2002, THE FDA GRANTED AN

ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES

TO

COZAAR/HYZAAR

UNTIL FEBRUARY 2010. IN 2005, THE FDA

GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE

UNITED STATES TO

SINGULAIR

UNTIL AUGUST 2012. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS, SEE

PATENT LITIGATION ON PAGE 32.

WHILE THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT NORMALLY RESULTS IN A

LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR THE COVERED PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCT, COMMERCIAL BENEFITS MAY CONTINUE TO BE DERIVED FROM.

(I) LATER-GRANTED PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES

RELATED TO THE MOST ECONOMICAL METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF SUCH PRODUCT; (II) PATENTS RELATING TO

THE USE OF SUCH PRODUCT; (III) PATENTS RELATING TO NOVEL

COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS; AND (IV) IN THE UNITED

STATES, MARKET EXCLUSIVITY THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER FEDERAL

LAW. THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRATION ON PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON MANY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE NATURE

OF THE MARKET AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT, THE GROWTH

OF THE MARKET, THE COMPLEXITIES AND ECONOMICS OF THE PROCESS FOR

MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF THE PRODUCT AND THE

REQUIREMENTS OF NEW DRUG PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG

AND COSMETIC ACT OR SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES.

ADDITIONS TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ARE SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES

AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH ALL RELEVANT LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS

INCREASING PATENT LIFE. SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF INCREASES IN

PATENT LIFE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GENERAL INCREASE IN

THE NUMBER OF, INCENTIVES FOR AND USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS ARE

SOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH REFORM

OF PATENT AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF

INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

IN JUNE 2006,

ZOCOR

LOST ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE

UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE

IN U.S.

ZOCOR

SALES AFTER THAT TIME.

IN JUNE 2006, THE BASIC PATENT IN THE UNITED STATES COVERING

PROSCAR

EXPIRED. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN U.S.

PROSCAR

SALES AFTER THAT

TIME. THE BASIC PATENT FOR

PROSCAR

ALSO COVERS

PROPECIA;

HOWEVER,

PROPECIA

IS PROTECTED BY

ADDITIONAL PATENTS WHICH EXPIRE IN OCTOBER 2013.

IN 2003, THE FDA GRANTED AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO

FOSAMAX

UNTIL

FEBRUARY 2008, AND

FOSAMAX

ONCE WEEKLY UNTIL JANUARY

2019. HOWEVER, ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND

THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION

OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL

OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED ON THE COURT OF

APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008.

10

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE ITS U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

IN APRIL 2008. THE COMPANY EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN EACH

PRODUCTS SALES AFTER EACH PRODUCTS RESPECTIVE LOSS

OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

WORLDWIDE, ALL OF THE COMPANYS IMPORTANT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD

UNDER TRADEMARKS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME

COUNTRIES AS LONG AS USED; IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS LONG AS

REGISTERED. REGISTRATION IS FOR FIXED TERMS AND CAN BE RENEWED

INDEFINITELY.

ROYALTIES RECEIVED DURING 2006 ON PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES

AND OTHER RIGHTS AMOUNTED TO $83.8 MILLION. THE COMPANY

ALSO PAID ROYALTIES AMOUNTING TO $900.5 MILLION IN 2006

UNDER PATENT AND KNOW-HOW LICENSES IT HOLDS.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE INTRODUCTION

OF NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH A

STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY

11,400 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THE COMPANYS RESEARCH

ACTIVITIES. EXPENDITURES FOR THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WERE $4.8 BILLION IN 2006,

$3.8 BILLION IN 2005 AND $4.0 BILLION IN 2004. THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ONGOING COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH OVER A

BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT IN

SUPPORT OF NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL

AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MERCKS NEW RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS DESIGNED TO

INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS BY

PRIORITIZING THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESOURCES ON NINE PRIORITY DISEASE AREAS 

ALZHEIMERS DISEASE, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE, DIABETES, NOVEL VACCINES, OBESITY, ONCOLOGY (TARGETED

THERAPIES), PAIN AND SLEEP DISORDERS. THESE THERAPEUTIC AREAS

WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN BASED ON A SET OF CRITERIA INCLUDING UNMET

MEDICAL NEEDS, SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL

OPPORTUNITY. WITHIN THESE THERAPEUTIC AREAS, MERCK WILL COMMIT

RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE RESEARCH BREADTH AND DEPTH AND TO DEVELOP

BEST-IN-CLASS

TARGETED AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT ARE VALUED HIGHLY BY

PATIENTS, PAYERS AND PHYSICIANS.

THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MAKE FOCUSED INVESTMENTS TO PURSUE

SPECIFIC MECHANISMS IN THE FOLLOWING SELECTED DISEASE AREAS.

ANTIBIOTICS, ANTIFUNGALS, ANTIVIRALS (HEPATITIS C VIRUS,

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS), ASTHMA, CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE

PULMONARY DISEASE, NEURODEGENERATION, OPHTHALMOLOGY,

OSTEOPOROSIS, SCHIZOPHRENIA AND STROKE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

WILL CAPITALIZE ON SELECTED OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE THESE AREAS BY

CONTINUING TO COMMERCIALIZE ATTRACTIVE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT

CANDIDATES IN THE PIPELINE AND BY PURSUING APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL

LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS, INDUSTRY PRACTICE

AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST

FOREIGN COUNTRIES PROVIDE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVENESS

AND SAFETY OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THROUGH PRECLINICAL TESTS

AND CONTROLLED CLINICAL EVALUATION. BEFORE A NEW DRUG MAY BE

MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES, RECORDED DATA ON PRECLINICAL AND

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ARE INCLUDED IN THE NDA OR THE BIOLOGICS

LICENSE APPLICATION TO THE FDA FOR THE REQUIRED APPROVAL. THE

DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COVERING SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN THE

UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

ONCE THE COMPANYS SCIENTISTS DISCOVER A NEW COMPOUND THAT

THEY BELIEVE HAS PROMISE TO TREAT A MEDICAL CONDITION, THE

COMPANY COMMENCES PRECLINICAL TESTING WITH THAT COMPOUND.

PRECLINICAL TESTING INCLUDES LABORATORY TESTING AND ANIMAL

SAFETY STUDIES TO GATHER DATA ON CHEMISTRY, PHARMACOLOGY AND

TOXICOLOGY. PENDING ACCEPTABLE PRECLINICAL DATA, THE COMPANY

WILL INITIATE CLINICAL TESTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ESTABLISHED

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE CLINICAL TESTING BEGINS WITH

PHASE I STUDIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ASSESS SAFETY,

TOLERABILITY, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND PRELIMINARY PHARMACODYNAMIC

ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUND IN HUMANS. IF FAVORABLE, ADDITIONAL,

LARGER PHASE II STUDIES ARE INITIATED TO DETERMINE THE

EFFICACY OF THE COMPOUND IN THE AFFECTED POPULATION, DEFINE

APPROPRIATE DOSING FOR THE COMPOUND, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY ANY

ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT COULD LIMIT THE COMPOUNDS USEFULNESS.

IF DATA FROM THE PHASE II TRIALS ARE SATISFACTORY, THE

COMPANY COMMENCES LARGE-SCALE PHASE III TRIALS TO CONFIRM

THE COMPOUNDS EFFICACY AND SAFETY. UPON COMPLETION OF

THOSE TRIALS, IF SATISFACTORY, THE COMPANY SUBMITS REGULATORY

FILINGS WITH THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AROUND THE

WORLD TO HAVE THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE APPROVED FOR MARKETING.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A COMPOUND THAT IS THE RESULT OF

ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM WILL OBTAIN THE REGULATORY APPROVALS

NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE MARKETED.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS BEGINS ONCE A

COMPLETE NDA IS SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED BY THE FDA. PURSUANT TO

THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT, THE FDA REVIEW PERIOD

TARGETS FOR NDAS OR SUPPLEMENTAL NDAS IS EITHER SIX MONTHS, FOR

PRIORITY REVIEW, OR TEN MONTHS, FOR A STANDARD REVIEW. WITHIN

60 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF AN NDA, THE FDA DETERMINES IF THE

APPLICATION IS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETE TO PERMIT A SUBSTANTIVE

REVIEW. THE FDA ALSO ASSESSES, AT THAT TIME, WHETHER THE

APPLICATION WILL BE GRANTED A PRIORITY REVIEW OR STANDARD

REVIEW. ONCE THE REVIEW TIMELINES ARE DEFINED, THE FDA WILL ACT

UPON THE APPLICATION WITHIN THOSE TIMELINES, UNLESS A MAJOR

AMENDMENT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED (EITHER AT THE COMPANYS OWN

INITIATIVE OR THE FDAS REQUEST) TO THE PENDING

APPLICATION. IF THIS OCCURS, THE FDA MAY EXTEND THE REVIEW

PERIOD TO ALLOW FOR REVIEW OF THE NEW INFORMATION, BUT BY NO

MORE THAN 180 DAYS. EXTENSIONS TO THE REVIEW PERIOD ARE

COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY. THE FDA CAN ACT ON AN APPLICATION

BY ISSUING AN APPROVAL LETTER, A NON-APPROVABLE LETTER, OR AN

APPROVABLE LETTER. BASED ON FDA STATISTICS, DRUG DEVELOPMENT

TIME FROM INITIATION OF PRECLINICAL TESTING TO NDA APPROVAL CAN

RANGE FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 8.5 YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS THREE DRUG CANDIDATES CURRENTLY UNDER FDA REVIEW.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW AN NDA FOR

MK-0517, THE INTRAVENOUS PRODRUG OF

EMEND,

FOR THE

TREATMENT OF CINV. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES A DECISION ON THE NDA

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007.

IN JULY 2006, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW THE NDA FOR

JANUMET

, THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL MEDICINE

COMBINING

JANUVIA

WITH METFORMIN, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS NEEDING MORE THAN

ONE ORAL AGENT TO HELP CONTROL BLOOD SUGAR FOR TREATMENT OF TYPE

2 DIABETES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS FDA ACTION ON THE NDA BY THE END

OF MARCH 2007. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MOVING FORWARD AS PLANNED

WITH REGULATORY FILINGS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

ARCOXIA

, THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATIONAL SELECTIVE

COX-2 INHIBITOR, REMAINS UNDER STANDARD REVIEW BY THE FDA IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN RESPONSE TO THE FDAS APPROVABLE LETTER,

MERCK INCLUDED RESULTS OF THE MEDAL (MULTINATIONAL ETORICOXIB

AND DICLOFENAC ARTHRITIS LONG-TERM) PROGRAM THAT SHOWED THE RATE

OF CONFIRMED THROMBOTIC CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS WAS SIMILAR

BETWEEN

ARCOXIA

AND DICLOFENAC, THE MOST WIDELY USED

NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG IN THE WORLD. THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES FDA ACTION IN APRIL 2007. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT

AN FDA ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING WILL BE HELD PRIOR TO FDA

ACTION.

ARCOXIA

IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN MORE THAN 60

COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND

MIDDLE EAST/NORTHERN AFRICA.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING THREE NDAS WITH THE FDA IN 2007.

THE COMPANY PLANS TO FILE AN NDA FOR MK-0518 WITH THE FDA IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 AND HAS RECEIVED FAST TRACK DESIGNATION

FOR AN INDICATION IN TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS.

INTERIM 16-WEEK DATA FROM THE DOSE-RANGING PHASE II TRIAL

OF MK-0518, THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATIONAL HIV INTEGRASE

INHIBITOR, IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HIV INFECTION WERE

PRESENTED AT THE

13

TH

ANNUAL

CONFERENCE ON RETROVIRUSES AND OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN

FEBRUARY 2006. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ORAL INVESTIGATIONAL

MEDICATION AT ALL THREE DOSES STUDIED IN COMBINATION WITH

OPTIMIZED BACKGROUND THERAPY (OBT) HAD GREATER

ANTIRETROVIRAL ACTIVITY THAN OBT ALONE. STUDY RESULTS ALSO

SHOWED THAT MK-0518 IN COMBINATION WITH OBT WAS GENERALLY WELL

TOLERATED IN THESE PATIENTS WHO WERE FAILING ANTIRETROVIRAL

THERAPY (ART), WHO WERE RESISTANT TO AT LEAST ONE

DRUG OF EACH OF THE THREE AVAILABLE CLASSES OF ORAL ARTS, AND

WHO HAD LIMITED ACTIVE ARTS AS OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT. AT THE

AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGYS 46TH ANNUAL

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND

CHEMOTHERAPY IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY PRESENTED INTERIM

24-WEEK DATA FROM THIS ONGOING STUDY IN TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED

PATIENTS, WHICH DEMONSTRATED

MK-0518

MAINTAINING VIRAL LOAD REGRESSION.

IN AUGUST 2006 AT THE

16

TH

INTERNATIONAL

AIDS CONFERENCE, THE COMPANY PRESENTED INTERIM

24-WEEK

DATA

FROM THE PHASE II DOSE-RANGING TRIAL OF

MK-0518

CONDUCTED IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE, HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS. THE

DATA SHOWED THAT MK-0518 TWICE DAILY, WHEN USED IN COMBINATION

WITH TENOFOVIR AND LAMIVUDINE, ACHIEVED A COMPARABLE VIRAL LOAD

REDUCTION TO EFAVIRENZ COMBINED WITH THE SAME AGENTS IN

PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED PATIENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2006 AT THE AMERICAN

SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGYS 46TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL

CONFERENCE ON ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY, THE COMPANY

PRESENTED ADDITIONAL INTERIM

24-WEEK

DATA

FROM THIS PHASE II DOSE-RANGING STUDY IN

TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS THAT DEMONSTRATED NO INCREASE IN

LIPID LEVELS IN PATIENTS TAKING MK-0518 WITH TENOFOVIR AND

LAMIVUDINE.

12

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS WITH

MK-0524A AND TO SUPPORT MK-0524B, INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPIES FOR

LIPID MANAGEMENT. MK-0524A REPRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH TO

LOWERING LDL-C, RAISING HDL-C AND LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES.

MK-0524B COMBINES MK-0524A WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF

SIMVASTATIN TO POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE RISK OF CORONARY HEART

DISEASE BEYOND WHAT STATINS PROVIDE ALONE. THE COMPANY PLANS TO

FILE MK-0524A WITH THE FDA IN 2007 AND TO FILE MK-0524B IN 2008.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY PRESENTED DATA FROM A

PHASE II STUDY AT THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATIONS

SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS 2006 IN CHICAGO THAT SHOWED

CO-ADMINISTRATION OF MK-0524 WITH ER NIACIN SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCED FLUSHING IN PATIENTS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIA COMPARED TO THOSE

PATIENTS WHO TOOK ER NIACIN ALONE. FLUSHING, CHARACTERIZED BY

REDNESS OF THE SKIN WITH WARMING OR BURNING ON THE FACE AND NECK

CAUSED BY THE DILATION OF BLOOD VESSELS NEAR THE SKIN, IS A

COMMON NIACIN-INDUCED SIDE EFFECT THAT CAN CAUSE DISCOMFORT TO

PATIENTS AND IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION

OF NIACIN THERAPY.

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE COMPANY AND H. LUNDBECK A/S OF DENMARK

ANNOUNCED THAT THE SUBMISSION OF AN NDA FOR GABOXADOL, A NOVEL

INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT FOR THE

TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA, WILL OCCUR IN MID-2007. PHASE II

CLINICAL STUDIES OF GABOXADOL SHOWED IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY AS

WELL AS INCREASED SLOW-WAVE SLEEP WITHOUT SUPPRESSING REM SLEEP.

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT GABOXADOL WILL LIKELY BE

A SCHEDULED COMPOUND.

ALSO, BY MID-YEAR 2007, MERCK EXPECTS TO HAVE FOUR PRODUCTS IN

PHASE III DEVELOPMENT (INCLUDING MK-0524B DISCUSSED

ABOVE).

THE COMPANY HAS INITIATED A TARGETED PHASE III PROGRAM WITH

ITS INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY,

MK-0364, WHICH IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR

INVERSE AGONIST. RESULTS OF EARLY CLINICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT

MK-0364 DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT-LOSS EFFICACY VERSUS

PLACEBO AND WAS GENERALLY SAFE AND WELL-TOLERATED, HOWEVER, AS

REPORTED WITH ANOTHER CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR INVERSE AGONIST,

SOME PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED.

AS ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY PLANS TO START

PHASE III TESTING OF MK-0974, THE CALCITONIN GENE RELATED

PEPTIDE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST FOR THE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE

HEADACHES. THE PHASE III PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN

FIRST QUARTER 2007.

ALSO ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

MK-0822, A CATHEPSIN K INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF

OSTEOPOROSIS, WILL ENTER PHASE III TESTING IN MID-2007.

THE COMPANYS CLINICAL PIPELINE INCLUDES CANDIDATES IN EACH

OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS: ARTHRITIS, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CANCER,

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, ENDOCRINE DISORDERS, GLAUCOMA,

INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INSOMNIA, NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE,

OBESITY, OSTEOPOROSIS, PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, PAIN, RESPIRATORY

DISEASE AND UROGENITAL DISORDERS. THE COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS ITS

INTERNAL RESEARCH WITH AN AGGRESSIVE LICENSING AND EXTERNAL

ALLIANCE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF

COLLABORATIONS FROM EARLY RESEARCH TO LATE-STAGE COMPOUNDS, AS

WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY COMPLETED 53 TRANSACTIONS

IN 2006, INCLUDING TARGETED ACQUISITIONS, RESEARCH

COLLABORATIONS, PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS, AND

TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC

CATEGORIES.

IN MARCH 2006, NEUROMED PHARMACEUTICALS LTD.

(NEUROMED) AND MERCK SIGNED A RESEARCH COLLABORATION

DISORDERS, INCLUDING NEUROMEDS LEAD COMPOUND, NMED-160

(MK-6721), WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE II DEVELOPMENT FOR

THE TREATMENT OF PAIN.

ALSO IN MARCH 2006, MERCK SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH NICOX S.A.

(NICOX) TO COLLABORATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS USING NICOXS PROPRIETARY NITRIC

OXIDE-DONATING TECHNOLOGY.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD EXPANDED

THE SCOPE OF ITS EXISTING STRATEGIC COLLABORATION WITH FOXHOLLOW

TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (FOXHOLLOW) FOR ATHEROSCLEROTIC

PLAQUE ANALYSIS. IN ADDITION, MERCK ACQUIRED A STAKE IN

FOXHOLLOW WITH THE PURCHASE OF $95 MILLION IN COMMON STOCK.

IN OCTOBER 2006, AMBRILIA BIOPHARMA INC. (AMBRILIA),

A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE THERAPEUTICS

IN THE FIELDS OF CANCER AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AND MERCK

ANNOUNCED THAT AMBRILIA HAS ENTERED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSING

AGREEMENT GRANTING MERCK THE WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO AMBRILIAS

HIV/AIDS PROTEASE INHIBITOR PROGRAM.

13

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE J. DAVID GLADSTONE INSTITUTES AND MERCK

ANNOUNCED A MAJOR COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS TO TREAT NEURODEGENERATIVE

DISEASES, INCLUDING ALZHEIMERS DISEASE, THAT ARE LINKED TO

APOE-REGULATED MECHANISMS IN THE BODY.

ALSO IN NOVEMBER 2006, ADVINUS THERAPEUTICS (P) LTD.

(ADVINUS) AND MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE FORMED

A DRUG DISCOVERY AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION IN THE

AREA OF METABOLIC DISORDERS. ADVINUS AND MERCK WILL WORK

TOGETHER TO DEVELOP CLINICALLY VALIDATED DRUG CANDIDATES FOR

METABOLIC DISORDERS, WITH MERCK RETAINING THE RIGHT TO ADVANCE

THE MOST PROMISING OF THESE CANDIDATES INTO LATE-STAGE CLINICAL

TRIALS.

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK AND IDERA PHARMACEUTICALS

(IDERA) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE FORMED A BROAD

COLLABORATION TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

IDERAS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR AGONISTS BY INCORPORATING THEM

IN THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC VACCINES BEING DEVELOPED BY

MERCK FOR ONCOLOGY, INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND ALZHEIMERS

DISEASE.

EMPLOYEES

AT THE END OF 2006, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 60,000

EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 31,800 EMPLOYED IN THE

UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO. APPROXIMATELY 21% OF

WORLDWIDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY ARE REPRESENTED BY VARIOUS

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS.

AS PART OF A COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER 2003

AND COMPLETED AT THE END OF 2004, THE COMPANY HAD ELIMINATED

5,100 POSITIONS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN 2005

WITH 900 POSITIONS BEING ELIMINATED THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2005.

ON NOVEMBER 28, 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST PHASE

OF A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY, AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. THE INITIAL STEPS WILL INCLUDE THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK

MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER,

MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

AS A RESULT, MERCK WILL INCUR CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT

OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES. AS PART OF THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,000

POSITIONS IN MANUFACTURING AND OTHER DIVISIONS WORLDWIDE,

REPRESENTING ABOUT 11% OF ITS GLOBAL WORK FORCE, BY THE END OF

2008. ABOUT HALF OF THE POSITION REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO

OCCUR IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE REMAINDER IN OTHER

COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE HAVE BEEN

APPROXIMATELY 4,800 POSITIONS ELIMINATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY

SINCE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM (APPROXIMATELY 3,700 OF WHICH

WERE ELIMINATED DURING 2006 COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT

POSITIONS). HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES

AS THE COMPANYS BUSINESS REQUIRES IT. MERCK INTENDS TO

SELL OR CLOSE FIVE OF ITS 31 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WORLDWIDE

AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES AND TO REDUCE OPERATIONS AT A NUMBER

OF OTHER SITES. THROUGH THE END OF 2006, THREE OF THE

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CLOSED, SOLD, OR HAD CEASED

OPERATIONS, AND THE TWO PRECLINICAL SITES WERE CLOSED. THE

COMPANY HAS ALSO SOLD CERTAIN OTHER FACILITIES AND RELATED

ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THE

REMAINING SITES IDENTIFIED FOR SALE/CLOSURE ARE EXPECTED TO BE

CLOSED BY THE END OF 2008, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS.

THE PRETAX COSTS OF THE RESTRUCTURING WERE $935.5 MILLION

IN 2006, $401.2 MILLION IN 2005 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE

$300 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN 2007. THROUGH THE END

OF 2008, WHEN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS

SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS OF THE

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2005 ARE

EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $1.9 BILLION TO $2.2 BILLION.

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE CUMULATIVE PRETAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH,

RELATING PRIMARILY TO ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION FOR THOSE

FACILITIES SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN

2006, THE COMPANY INCURRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY

$7.9 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FACILITIES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES.

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE

$12.6 MILLION IN 2006, AND ARE ESTIMATED AT

$94.2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2007 THROUGH 2011. THESE

AMOUNTS DO NOT CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM INSURERS OR

OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN

IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND, IN

MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS WHICH ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN

ACCRUED AND TOTALED $129.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2006. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

OUTCOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY

POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE

LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $62.0 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE. MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

15

EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

GEOGRAPHIC

AREA INFORMATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE

CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES. SALES WORLDWIDE BY

SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE 39% OF SALES IN

2006, 42% OF SALES IN 2005 AND 41% OF SALES IN 2004.

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AND OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ABROAD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REGARD

THESE RISKS AS A DETERRENT TO FURTHER EXPANSION OF ITS

OPERATIONS ABROAD. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CLOSELY REVIEWS ITS

METHODS OF OPERATIONS AND ADOPTS STRATEGIES RESPONSIVE TO

CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPANDING ITS OPERATIONS

IN COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA,

EASTERN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC WHERE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT

POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE

COMPANY TO EARN FAIR RETURNS. BUSINESS IN THESE DEVELOPING

AREAS, WHILE SOMETIMES LESS STABLE, OFFERS IMPORTANT

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH OVER TIME.

THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION, FROM THE

MARKET WORLDWIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY

27,400 PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY

46,100 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING

FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX,

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 264 PURPORTED CLASS

ACTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF

VIOXX.

(ALL OF THESE SUITS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS.) IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND

INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY

ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE

SECURITIES LAWS (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION,

VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER

16

EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT

(ERISA). (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS.) IN ADDITION,

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FILED AND

DISMISSED ARE NOW ON APPEAL AND SEVERAL SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED

DEMANDS WITH THE COMPANY ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD

MEMBERS AND COMPANY OFFICERS. (ALL OF THESE SUITS AND DEMANDS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED

AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

BEEN SUED BY FOUR STATES WITH RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

RELATING TO

VIOXX

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANY

CONCERNING

VIOXX.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS

ISSUED A SUBPOENA REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS

BY CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

EUROPE. A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM THIRTY-ONE STATES AND

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS SALES AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY

IS COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

(ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.) THE COMPANY CAN NOT

PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER,

THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

TO DATE, IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, OF

THE 29 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL,

THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE DISMISSED, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE

WITHDRAWN FROM THE TRIAL CALENDAR BY PLAINTIFFS, AND JURIES HAVE

DECIDED IN MERCKS FAVOR NINE TIMES AND IN PLAINTIFFS

FAVOR FOUR TIMES. IN ADDITION, IN THE RECENT CALIFORNIA TRIAL

INVOLVING TWO PLAINTIFFS, THE JURY COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT FOR

EITHER PLAINTIFF AND A MISTRIAL WAS DECLARED. A NEW JERSEY STATE

JUDGE SET ASIDE ONE OF THE NINE MERCK VERDICTS. WITH RESPECT TO

THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK ALREADY HAS FILED AN

APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE CASES, AND IN

ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD

SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. IN ADDITION, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL WITH TWO

PLAINTIFFS IS CURRENTLY ONGOING IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN

NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE AND ANOTHER TRIAL

HAS COMMENCED IN STATE COURT IN ILLINOIS. THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION IS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW

IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

THE OUTCOMES OF THESE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS

SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED TO INDICATE ANY TREND OR WHAT OUTCOME

MAY BE LIKELY IN FUTURE

VIOXX

TRIALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2007. A TRIAL IN

THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2007, BUT THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND

ANY LOSSES.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION, INCLUDING

$175 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN THE AGGREGATE IN

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE VIOXX SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND

(IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $598 MILLION AND IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER IT RECORDED ANOTHER CHARGE OF

$75 MILLION, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION FROM

$685 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 TO $858 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2008.

THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY AMOUNT OF

DAMAGES THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. THESE

PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS, ARE

CURRENTLY AT AN EARLY STAGE AND THE COMPANY HAS VERY LITTLE

INFORMATION AS TO THE COURSE THE PROCEEDINGS WILL TAKE. IN VIEW

OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE

CLAIMANTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO

PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT

REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH

RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

17

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY

POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING IN THE PAYMENT OF

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION

AND PROSPECTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND, WHEN THAT OCCURS,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE

MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS

PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAVE

RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION

FROM LOWER PRICE GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR

ONE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO A RAPID

LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED GENERIC VERSIONS

OF THAT DRUG BECOME AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT

CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPANYS SALES, THE LOSS

OF PATENT PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2006,

ZOCOR,

THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR

MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL, LOST ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE

UNITED STATES.

ZOCOR

HAD ALREADY LOST ITS BASIC

PATENT PROTECTION IN MANY MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE

COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES. WORLDWIDE SALES OF

ZOCOR

WERE

$2.8 BILLION IN 2006, COMPARED TO $4.4 BILLION IN

2005. WORLDWIDE SALES OF

ZOCOR

ARE EXPECTED TO BE

$0.6 BILLION TO $0.9 BILLION IN 2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY APPEALED A DECISION OF THE

OPPOSITION DIVISION (THE OPPOSITION DIVISION) OF THE

EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (THE EPO) THAT REVOKED THE

COMPANYS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY

ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. THAT DECISION WAS UPHELD AND,

THEREFORE, PRESENTLY THE COMPANY IS NOT ENTITLED TO MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR

FOSAMAX

IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS

AFTER 2007. IN ADDITION, MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE

USE OF ALENDRONATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ADVERSE DECISIONS IN

GERMANY, HOLLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE DECISION IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM WAS UPHELD ON APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED

THE DECISIONS IN GERMANY AND HOLLAND. THE COMPANY EXPECTS A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EUROPEAN SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AFTER

LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES IN 2006 HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE SODIUM PRODUCTS IN

SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND GERMANY.

ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE

COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS

TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS

DECISION,

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND

APRIL 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER EACH PRODUCTS RESPECTIVE

LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT

SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND THE

COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS; IN CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST

PATENT PROTECTION.

LIKE OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS

EACH YEAR. DECLINES IN SALES OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

MEAN THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE

SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

NEW PRODUCTS WHICH IT DEVELOPS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND

PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH LICENSE OR

ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMPANY COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL

EFFORT, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES, AND THROUGH VARIOUS

COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THE COMPANY MUST MAKE ONGOING, SUBSTANTIAL

EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFORTS IT IS

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN A COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT. THE

COMPANY MUST ALSO COMMIT SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS, FUNDS AND OTHER

RESOURCES TO RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGH QUALITY SCIENTISTS

AND OTHER PERSONNEL WITH PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPERTISE.

18

BASED ON FDA STATISTICS, DRUG DEVELOPMENT TIME FROM INITIATION

OF PRECLINICAL TESTING TO NDA APPROVAL CAN RANGE FROM 5 TO

20 YEARS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 8.5 YEARS. FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, SEE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ABOVE. EACH PHASE OF

TESTING IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A

SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER SERIOUS

OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE

COMPANY MAY ABANDON A PRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY. SOME OF THE RISKS

ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND MAY YIELD

DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL

SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ITS

INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A

NEW DRUG; OR SALES OF A NEW PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

THE COMPANY CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF

ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL BE LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT

WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE COMPOUNDS,

PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE

LAUNCHED, WILL BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND

SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING

PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER ITS SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS

PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

,

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING PRODUCTS OR

THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS THE COMPANY OBTAINS AND

MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL

TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING ITS

PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE FDA IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY, AS

IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL,

SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO IS

PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY

CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

TESTING, TO DELAY OR WITHHOLD REGISTRATION AND MARKETING

APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT

WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND

UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE

OBTAINED, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS

TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE APPROVAL

IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL,

SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, OR ITS FAILURE TO

MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM

SELLING THE NEW PRODUCTS IN THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS

OBTAINED, IF EVER. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE

REVENUES FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT

DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS

PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS

WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN

HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN

MARKETS. PATENTS COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED

NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SEEKS

PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS

WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND WHERE MEANINGFUL

PATENT PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS

PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES OR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE

OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT

APPLICATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TO

DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN

PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO ITS PATENTS OR

INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS ITS IMPORTANT PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS  PATENT

19

LITIGATION BELOW. IN PARTICULAR, MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW

DRUG APPLICATIONS (ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

NORMALLY RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS PATENT, INCLUDING

BY FILING LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT

LITIGATION AND OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS

ARE COSTLY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE THE COMPANY OF

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES,

THIRD PARTY PATENTS MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING AND

SELLING A PRODUCT IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN

PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO

DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE

PRODUCTS BECOMING AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST SALES UNLESS

AND UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY

SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC

PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM

LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS

PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN

SOME COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN

IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICAL

PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO

LEGISLATION WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS

PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE

EMERGENCE OF GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED

PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES, REDUCING THE COMPANYS

SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR

THE COMPANYS DRUGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION, PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR

LEGISLATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND RAPID APPROVAL OF

GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED INTO LAW COULD

WORSEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION MAY INCREASE AS NEW

PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE SAFER OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR

MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION,

THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE SOLD

AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

AS A RESULT, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE

POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY FACES PRICING PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO ITS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICE

PRESSURES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN THE

UNITED STATES. THESE INCLUDE (I) PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE

GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASERS AND

(II) U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, INCLUDING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003

ACT).

THE 2003 ACT INCLUDED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR

INDIVIDUALS WHICH FIRST WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1,

2006. THE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE

ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD RESULT IN FURTHER

PRICING PRESSURES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PRICING PRESSURES TO

INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS.

ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, PRICING, SALES,

LITIGATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND AGENCY REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN

IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS

SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS,

WILL, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS,

PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN

ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY

TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO

ADDRESS THE COMPANYS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT POTENTIAL, AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH

STATEMENT AND SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF OTHER RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE

NOT. NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL

FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ASSUME

THE OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. THE

COMPANY CAUTIONS YOU NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.



SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.



COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AS THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION.



INCREASED BRAND COMPETITION IN THERAPEUTIC AREAS

IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.



THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A CANDIDATE CAN

FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE LATE-STAGE

PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL.

NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING IN DEVELOPMENT BUT

FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS,

THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE

DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE

AND/OR

THE

INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF

OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE

DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.



PRICING PRESSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD,

INCLUDING RULES AND PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS, JUDICIAL

DECISIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM, PHARMACEUTICAL

REIMBURSEMENT AND PRICING IN GENERAL.



CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT

THEREOF AFFECTING THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.



EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO MARKETED PRODUCTS,

WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED, LEADING TO PRODUCT

RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS OR DECLINING SALES.



LEGAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, ANTITRUST

LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING TAX

DISPUTES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND PATENT DISPUTES WITH

BRANDED AND GENERIC COMPETITORS, ANY OF WHICH COULD PRECLUDE

COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING PRODUCTS.



LOST MARKET OPPORTUNITY RESULTING FROM DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTIES

IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS OF THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.



INCREASED FOCUS ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO THE TAXATION OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS.



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS PROMULGATED BY

STANDARD-SETTING OR REGULATORY BODIES, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD AND THE SEC, THAT ARE ADVERSE TO THE

COMPANY.

21



ECONOMIC FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL,

INCLUDING CHANGES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS

WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS.

VIOXX

LITIGATION

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, INDIVIDUAL AND PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY

AND/OR

ECONOMIC LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASE OR USE OF

VIOXX

. ALL SUCH ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT ARE

COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA

(THE MDL) BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE ELDON E. FALLON. A

NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS FILED IN STATE COURT ARE COORDINATED IN

SEPARATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS IN STATE COURTS IN NEW JERSEY,

CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, AND THE COUNTIES OF PHILADELPHIA,

PENNSYLVANIA AND CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN SERVED OR WAS AWARE THAT IT HAD BEEN

NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 27,400 LAWSUITS, WHICH

INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 46,100 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL

INJURIES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

, AND IN

APPROXIMATELY 264 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGING PERSONAL

INJURIES

AND/OR

ECONOMIC LOSS. (ALL OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH

ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS.) OF THESE LAWSUITS, APPROXIMATELY

8,300 LAWSUITS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 23,700 PLAINTIFF

GROUPS ARE OR ARE SLATED TO BE IN THE FEDERAL MDL AND

APPROXIMATELY 16,800 LAWSUITS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 16,800

PLAINTIFF GROUPS ARE INCLUDED IN A COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE CAROL E. HIGBEE.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CLAIMS OF OVER 4,025 PLAINTIFFS HAD BEEN

DISMISSED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. OF THESE, THERE HAVE

BEEN OVER 1,225 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS WERE

22

DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE (I.E., THEY CANNOT BE BROUGHT AGAIN)

EITHER BY PLAINTIFFS THEMSELVES OR BY THE COURTS. OVER 2,800

ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS HAVE HAD THEIR CLAIMS DISMISSED WITHOUT

PREJUDICE (I.E., THEY CAN BE BROUGHT AGAIN).

IN THE MDL, JUDGE FALLON IN JULY 2005 INDICATED THAT HE WOULD

SCHEDULE FOR TRIAL A SERIES OF CASES DURING THE PERIOD NOVEMBER

2005 THROUGH 2006, IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: (I) HEART

ATTACK WITH SHORT TERM USE; (II) HEART ATTACK WITH LONG

TERM USE; (III) STROKE; AND (IV) CARDIOVASCULAR INJURY

INVOLVING A PRESCRIPTION WRITTEN AFTER APRIL 2002 WHEN THE

LABELING FOR

VIOXX

WAS REVISED TO INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF

THE VIGOR TRIAL. THESE TRIALS BEGAN IN NOVEMBER 2005 AND

CONCLUDED IN DECEMBER 2006. THE NEXT SCHEDULED TRIAL IN THE MDL

IS A RE-TRIAL IN BARNETT V. MERCK ON THE ISSUE OF DAMAGES

AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

SEVERAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS ARE CURRENTLY

SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2007. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A LIST OF

SUCH TRIALS AT ITS WEBSITE AT

WWW.MERCK.COM

WHICH IT WILL

PERIODICALLY UPDATE AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY HAS INCLUDED ITS

WEBSITE ADDRESS ONLY AS AN INACTIVE TEXTUAL REFERENCE AND DOES

NOT INTEND IT TO BE AN ACTIVE LINK TO ITS WEBSITE NOR DOES IT

INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.

MERCK HAS ENTERED INTO A TOLLING AGREEMENT (THE TOLLING

AGREEMENT) WITH THE MDL PLAINTIFFS STEERING

COMMITTEE THAT ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE TO HALT THE RUNNING OF

THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS (TOLLING) AS TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF

CLAIMS ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

BY NON-NEW

JERSEY CITIZENS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT APPLIES TO INDIVIDUALS

WHO HAVE NOT FILED LAWSUITS AND MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY FILE

LAWSUITS AND ONLY TO THOSE CLAIMANTS WHO SEEK TO TOLL CLAIMS

ALLEGING INJURIES RESULTING FROM A THROMBOTIC CARDIOVASCULAR

EVENT THAT RESULTS IN A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION OR ISCHEMIC

STROKE. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT PROVIDES COUNSEL ADDITIONAL TIME

TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL CLAIMS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT REQUIRES ANY

TOLLED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN FEDERAL COURT. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY 14,180 CLAIMANTS HAD

ENTERED INTO TOLLING AGREEMENTS.

MERCK VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

FROM THE MARKET ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. MANY STATES HAVE A TWO-YEAR STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, REQUIRING THAT CLAIMS

MUST BE FILED WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS LEARNED OR

COULD HAVE LEARNED OF THEIR POTENTIAL CAUSE OF ACTION. AS A

RESULT, SOME MAY VIEW SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AS A DEADLINE FOR

FILING

VIOXX

CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, HOWEVER,

THAT THE LAW REGARDING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS CAN BE COMPLEX,

VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE, CAN BE FACT-SPECIFIC, AND IN SOME

CASES, MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE EXISTENCE OF PENDING CLASS

ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME STATES HAVE THREE YEAR STATUTES OF

LIMITATIONS AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

IS EVEN LONGER. MERCK EXPECTS THAT THERE WILL BE LEGAL ARGUMENTS

CONCERNING THE PROPER APPLICATION OF THESE STATUTES, AND THE

DECISIONS WILL BE UP TO THE JUDGES PRESIDING IN INDIVIDUAL CASES

IN STATE AND FEDERAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THE OUTCOMES OF SEVERAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT WERE TRIED PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 (SEE CHART BELOW).

IN AUGUST 2006, IN BARNETT V. MERCK, A CASE BEFORE JUDGE FALLON

IN THE MDL, A JURY IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA RETURNED A

PLAINTIFF VERDICT IN THE SECOND FEDERAL

VIOXX

CASE TO GO

TO TRIAL. THE JURY AWARDED $50 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES AND $1 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON

AUGUST 30, 2006, JUDGE FALLON OVERTURNED AS EXCESSIVE THE

DAMAGES PORTION OF THE VERDICT AND ORDERED A NEW TRIAL ON

DAMAGES. JUDGE FALLON HAS SET RE-TRIAL FOR OCTOBER 29, 2007

ON THE ISSUE OF DAMAGES. MERCK HAS FILED MOTIONS FOR A NEW TRIAL

ON ALL ISSUES AND FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, BOTH OF WHICH

ARE CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE COURT. PLAINTIFF HAS OPPOSED

MERCKS MOTION AND HAS ASKED THE JUDGE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT

OF THE AWARD RATHER THAN RE-TRY THE CASE.

JURIES FOUND IN FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS IN THE FOURTH AND

FIFTH CASES TO GO TO TRIAL IN THE MDL. THE JURY RETURNED ITS

VERDICT FOR MERCK IN MASON V. MERCK ON NOVEMBER 8,

2006 AND IN DEDRICK V. MERCK ON DECEMBER 13, 2006.

ON NOVEMBER 22, 2006, JUDGE FALLON DENIED A MOTION FILED IN

THE MDL TO CERTIFY A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF ALL PERSONS WHO

ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF TAKING

VIOXX.

ON DECEMBER 15, 2006, THE JURY IN ALBRIGHT V. MERCK, A CASE

TRIED IN STATE COURT IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT

FOR MERCK ON ALL COUNTS.

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THAT IN APRIL 2006, IN

GARZA V. MERCK, A JURY IN RIO GRANDE CITY, TEXAS RETURNED A

VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE TEXAS

STATE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS REQUEST TO INVESTIGATE

POSSIBLE JURY BIAS BECAUSE A JUROR ADMITTED THAT HE HAD, PRIOR

TO THE TRIAL, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS

BORROWED MONEY FROM THE PLAINTIFF. ON DECEMBER 21, 2006,

THE COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR PLAINTIFF IN THE AMOUNT OF

$7.75 MILLION, PLUS INTEREST, REDUCED FROM THE ORIGINAL

AWARD OF $32 MILLION BECAUSE OF THE TEXAS STATE CAP ON

PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE COMPANY IS SEEKING A NEW TRIAL AND WILL

APPEAL THE VERDICT IF THE COURT DOES NOT GRANT A NEW TRIAL.

ON OCTOBER 31, 2006, IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT IN LOS

ANGELES, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL BEGAN IN THE CASES APPELL V.

MERCK AND ARRIGALE V. MERCK. ON JANUARY 18, 2007,

JUDGE VICTORIA CHANEY DECLARED A MISTRIAL AS TO BOTH PLAINTIFFS

AFTER THE JURY REPORTED THAT IT WAS DEADLOCKED.

ON OCTOBER 5, 2006, IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT, JUDGE HIGBEE DISMISSED CLAIMS OF THE

UNITED KINGDOM PLAINTIFFS. THESE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED.

THE FIRST CASE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN THE TEXAS COORDINATED

PROCEEDING, RIGBY V. MERCK, WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN TRIAL ON

NOVEMBER 7, 2006. THE RIGBY CASE WAS VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED

ON OCTOBER 23, 2006 WHEN THE PLAINTIFF FILED A NOTICE OF

NON-SUIT WITH THE COURT.

A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL, HERMANS V. MERCK AND HUMESTON V.

MERCK, BEGAN ON JANUARY 17, 2007, IN THE COORDINATED

PROCEEDING IN NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE.

HUMESTON V. MERCK WAS FIRST TRIED IN 2005, BUT JUDGE HIGBEE

SET ASIDE THE NOVEMBER 2005 JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF MERCK AND

ORDERED A NEW TRIAL ON THE GROUNDS OF NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE.

THE HERMANS/HUMESTON TRIAL IS SEPARATED INTO TWO PHASES: A

GENERAL PHASE REGARDING MERCKS CONDUCT AND A

PLAINTIFF-SPECIFIC PHASE. THERE WILL BE JURY QUESTIONS AND A

DELIBERATION AFTER PHASE I REGARDING MERCKS  CONDUCT.

IF THE JURY ANSWERS ANY OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THE

CASE WILL MOVE TO PHASE II. IN PHASE II EACH PLAINTIFF

WILL PRESENT HIS OR HER SPECIFIC CASE. AT THE END OF

PHASE II, THE JURY WILL DELIBERATE AND WILL ANSWER

QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE TWO PLAINTIFFS. THE JURY

WILL ANSWER SEPARATE VERDICT SHEETS BUT IN THE COURSE OF ONLY

ONE DELIBERATION. IF THE CASE MOVES TO A PUNITIVE PHASE, THERE

WILL BE A SINGLE PRESENTATION FOR EACH SIDE AND ONE JURY

DELIBERATION FOR BOTH PLAINTIFFS.

THE FIRST CASE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN THE PHILADELPHIA

COORDINATED PROCEEDING, MCCOOL V. MERCK, WAS SCHEDULED TO

BEGIN TRIAL ON FEBRUARY 26, 2007. THE PLAINTIFF VOLUNTARILY

DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE HER CASE ON JANUARY 16, 2007.

ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2006, THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT,

APPELLATE DIVISION, HEARD ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS APPEAL OF

JUDGE HIGBEES DISMISSAL OF THE SINCLAIR V. MERCK

CASE. THIS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION WAS ORIGINALLY FILED IN

DECEMBER 2004 AND SOUGHT THE CREATION OF A MEDICAL MONITORING

FUND. JUDGE HIGBEE HAD GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO

DISMISS IN MAY 2005. ON JANUARY 16, 2007, THE APPELLATE

DIVISION REVERSED THE DECISION AND REMANDED THE CASE BACK TO

JUDGE HIGBEE FOR FURTHER FACTUAL INQUIRY. THE COMPANY HAS

PETITIONED THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT FOR REVIEW OF THE

APPELLATE DIVISIONS DECISION.

TO DATE IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, OF THE

29 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL, THE

CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE DISMISSED, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE

WITHDRAWN FROM THE TRIAL CALENDAR BY PLAINTIFFS, AND JURIES HAVE

DECIDED IN MERCKS FAVOR NINE TIMES AND IN PLAINTIFFS

FAVOR FOUR TIMES. IN ADDITION, IN THE RECENT CALIFORNIA TRIAL

INVOLVING TWO PLAINTIFFS, THE JURY COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT FOR

EITHER PLAINTIFF AND A MISTRIAL WAS DECLARED. A NEW JERSEY STATE

JUDGE SET ASIDE ONE OF THE NINE MERCK VERDICTS. WITH RESPECT TO

THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK ALREADY HAS FILED AN

APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE CASES, AND IN

ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD

SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. IN ADDITION, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL WITH TWO

PLAINTIFFS IS CURRENTLY ONGOING IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN

NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE AND ANOTHER TRIAL,

SCHWALLER V. MERCK, HAS COMMENCED IN STATE COURT IN MADISON

COUNTY, ILLINOIS.

OTHER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 29, 2005, A NEW JERSEY

STATE TRIAL COURT CERTIFIED A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS (SUCH AS UNIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS) THAT PAID IN

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE

VIOXX

USED BY THEIR PLAN MEMBERS

OR INSUREDS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE SEEKS RECOVERY OF

CERTAIN

VIOXX

PURCHASE COSTS (PLUS PENALTIES) BASED ON

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE PURPORTED CLASS MEMBERS PAID MORE FOR

VIOXX

THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY KNOWN OF THE

PRODUCTS ALLEGED RISKS. MERCK BELIEVES THAT THE CLASS WAS

IMPROPERLY CERTIFIED. THE TRIAL COURTS RULING IS

PROCEDURAL ONLY; IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGATIONS, WHICH THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

DEFEND VIGOROUSLY. ON MARCH 31, 2006, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPERIOR COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, AFFIRMED THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON JULY 19, 2006, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT DECIDED TO EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION TO HEAR THE

COMPANYS APPEAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISIONS DECISION.

ON AUGUST 24, 2006, THE APPELLATE DIVISION ORDERED A STAY

OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN SUPERIOR COURT PENDING A RULING BY THE

SUPREME COURT. ORAL ARGUMENT BEFORE THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT

IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN MARCH 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

OF ALASKA, LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, MONTANA, TEXAS AND UTAH.

THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPANY MISREPRESENTED THE SAFETY

OF

VIOXX

AND SEEK (I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED OR REIMBURSED BY THE STATE AND ITS

AGENCIES; (II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE STATE

AND ITS AGENCIES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF

PERSONS INJURED BY

VIOXX

; (III) DAMAGES UNDER

VARIOUS COMMON LAW THEORIES; AND/OR (IV) REMEDIES UNDER

VARIOUS STATE STATUTORY THEORIES, INCLUDING STATE CONSUMER FRAUD

AND/OR FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR MEDICAID FRAUD STATUTES,

INCLUDING CIVIL PENALTIES.

SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, THE COMPANY AND VARIOUS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ALL OF THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED BY THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION

(THE JPML) TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R.

CHESLER FOR INCLUSION IN A NATIONWIDE MDL (THE SHAREHOLDER

MDL). JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. PLAINTIFFS REQUEST

CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF PURCHASERS OF COMPANY STOCK BETWEEN

MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29, 2004. THE COMPLAINT

ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND

20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF SUIT,

INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ASSERTS A

CLAIM UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT

AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES OF MERCK

STOCK. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS UNDER

SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 THAT

CERTAIN DEFENDANTS MADE INCOMPLETE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN

A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES FILED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE MERCK STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN, A DIVIDEND

REINVESTMENT PLAN. DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE

COMPLAINT. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE MOTION TO DISMISS IS SCHEDULED

TO TAKE PLACE IN MARCH 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 15, 2005, A COMPLAINT

WAS FILED IN OREGON STATE COURT BY THE STATE OF OREGON THROUGH

THE OREGON STATE TREASURER ON BEHALF OF THE OREGON PUBLIC

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUND AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT

AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS

BROUGHT UNDER OREGON SECURITIES LAW, ALLEGES THAT PLAINTIFF HAS

SUFFERED DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PURCHASES OF MERCK

COMMON STOCK AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES DUE TO THE

COMPANYS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF LAW RELATED TO DISCLOSURES

ABOUT

VIOXX

. THE CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND

DIRECTORS HAVE ENTERED INTO A TOLLING AGREEMENT AND, ON

JUNE 30, 2006, WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE FROM THE

CASE. ON JULY 19, 2006, THE COURT DENIED THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT, BUT REQUIRED PLAINTIFF TO AMEND

THE COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ON

SEPTEMBER 21, 2006. MERCK FILED A MOTION TO REQUIRE

PLAINTIFFS TO MAKE THE COMPLAINT MORE DEFINITE AND CERTAIN,

WHICH WAS DENIED BY THE COURT. MERCK FILED AN ANSWER TO THE

COMPLAINT IN JANUARY 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL

AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). THE CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT AROSE OUT OF SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FACTUAL

ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE MADE IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS. THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS, WHICH WERE

PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT TO ASSERT RIGHTS OF THE COMPANY, ASSERT

CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD PAST AND PRESENT AND

CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY

26

DUTY, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, ABUSE OF

CONTROL AND GROSS MISMANAGEMENT. ON MAY 5, 2006, JUDGE

CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENIED

PLAINTIFFS REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT.

PLAINTIFFS APPEAL OF THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION

REFUSING THEM LEAVE TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT IS CURRENTLY PENDING

BEFORE THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO

INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND

GILMARTIN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO

THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

IN JULY 2006, THE BOARD RECEIVED ANOTHER

SHAREHOLDER LETTER DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION

AGAINST THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT OF MERCK FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING

DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY RELATING TO THE COMPANYS ALLEGEDLY

IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

IN DECEMBER 2006, EACH OF

THESE DEMANDS WAS REJECTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPOINTED A

SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE COMPANYS ACTIONS PRIOR TO

ITS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, TO ACT FOR THE BOARD

IN RESPONDING TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION MATTERS RELATED TO THE

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, AND TO ADVISE THE BOARD WITH RESPECT

TO ANY ACTION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW. IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN

S. MARTIN, JR. OF DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO

CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENTS

CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY PROFILE OF

VIOXX

DURING THE PERIOD

VIOXX

WAS DEVELOPED AND

MARKETED. THE REVIEW WAS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006

AND THE FULL REPORT (INCLUDING APPENDICES) WAS MADE PUBLIC IN

SEPTEMBER 2006. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A COPY OF THE FULL

REPORT AND APPENDICES AT ITS WEBSITE AT

WWW.MERCK.COM/NEWSROOM/VIOXX/MARTIN_REPORT.HTML

. THE

COMPANY HAS INCLUDED ITS WEBSITE ADDRESS ONLY AS AN INACTIVE

TEXTUAL REFERENCE AND DOES NOT INTEND IT TO BE AN ACTIVE LINK TO

ITS WEBSITE NOR DOES IT INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE INFORMATION

CONTAINED THEREIN.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE



VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS)

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED

FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE LAWSUITS MAKE

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. ON OCTOBER 7, 2005, DEFENDANTS

MOVED TO DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. ON JULY 11, 2006,

JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS.

INTERNATIONAL

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LITIGATION

RELATING TO

VIOXX

IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS) IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS

CANADA, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, AND ISRAEL.

ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS

BASED ON MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER SOURCES, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$630 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-INSURANCE. THIS

INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

POTENTIAL DAMAGE AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE INCURRED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE EXTENDS TO

ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT MAY BE

FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

INSURANCE COVERAGE APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER

LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS

FIDUCIARY AND OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA

LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$275 MILLION. ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE

CLAIMS MAY ALSO BE AVAILABLE UNDER UPPER-LEVEL EXCESS POLICIES

THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY

27

OF RISKS. THERE ARE DISPUTES WITH CERTAIN INSURERS ABOUT THE

AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THERE

ARE LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL DISPUTES. THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS

WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS

INSURERS (WHICH PROVIDE EXCESS INSURANCE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE

TO ALL OF THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) HAVE COMMENCED AN

ARBITRATION SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO CANCEL THOSE

POLICIES, TO VOID ALL OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THOSE POLICIES

AND TO RAISE OTHER COVERAGE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. MERCK INTENDS TO CONTEST VIGOROUSLY THE

INSURERS CLAIMS AND WILL ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS

UNDER APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY

RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION MAY BE

LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS

ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN

INFORMAL INQUIRY CONCERNING

VIOXX.

ON JANUARY 28,

2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE SEC

ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION. ALSO, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE

DOJ) REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY

CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS (THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL DISPOSITIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF

CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CID) FROM A GROUP OF

ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 31 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA WHO ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANY VIOLATED

STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VIOXX

. THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN RESPONDING

TO THE CIDS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006

FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS

AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON

CALIFORNIAS MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED THROUGHOUT 2007. A

TRIAL IN THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2007, BUT

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY

RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS,

INCLUDING FOR THOSE CASES IN WHICH VERDICTS OR JUDGMENTS HAVE

BEEN ENTERED AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND ARE NOW IN POST-VERDICT

PROCEEDINGS OR ON APPEAL. IN EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT HAS STRONG POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE

THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN SUCH CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION (AS DEFINED

BELOW) COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD A

RESERVE OF $685 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE, INCLUDING $175 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS

(COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE

THIRD QUARTER AND FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED

CHARGES OF $598 MILLION AND $75 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

28

LITIGATION TO $858 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN

INCREASING THE RESERVE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THE SAME FACTORS

THAT IT CONSIDERED WHEN IT PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR

THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT NOW BELIEVES IT HAS A

BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPENSES AND CAN

REASONABLY ESTIMATE SUCH COSTS THROUGH 2008. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND ONGOING

REVIEW OF THE RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY; THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND

STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION;

THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS

AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE MOST CURRENT

INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EVENTS SUCH AS

SCHEDULED TRIALS, THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT 2007 AND

INTO 2008, AND THE INHERENT INABILITY TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOMES OF SUCH TRIALS, LIMIT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS LEGAL COSTS BEYOND THE END OF 2008.

WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL NEED TO

INCREASE THE RESERVE EVERY QUARTER, IT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE ITS RESERVES

FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO

SO.

OTHER

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 104 CASES HAD BEEN FILED AGAINST MERCK

IN EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT, INCLUDING 4 CASES WHICH SEEK

CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS WELL AS DAMAGES AND MEDICAL

MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW,

GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE DENTAL PROCEDURES SUCH AS TOOTH

EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS,

AND/OR

DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX.

ON AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS

NATIONWIDE SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE

MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (THE 

FOSAMAX

MDL)

FOR COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL

HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE JOHN KEENAN IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AS A

RESULT OF THE JPML ORDER, OVER 80 CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE KEENAN.

JUDGE KEENAN HAS ISSUED A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER SETTING FORTH A

SCHEDULE GOVERNING THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSES PRIMARILY UPON

RESOLVING THE CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS IN 2007. THE

COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A RESERVE

OF APPROXIMATELY $48 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST

THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, THE COMPANY

IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE END OF 2008.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL

LITIGATION

BEGINNING IN 1993, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A NUMBER OF

ANTITRUST SUITS, CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE CERTIFIED AS CLASS

ACTIONS, INSTITUTED BY MOST OF THE NATIONS RETAIL

PHARMACIES AND CONSUMERS IN SEVERAL STATES. THE COMPANY SETTLED

THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTION, WHICH REPRESENTED THE SINGLE LARGEST

GROUP OF CLAIMS AND HAS SETTLED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

REMAINING CASES ON SATISFACTORY TERMS. THE FEW REMAINING CASES

HAVE BEEN INACTIVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ENGAGED IN ANY CONSPIRACY AND NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING WAS

MADE OR INCLUDED IN ANY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING

LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE

SOMETIMES USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE

TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO

FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS

PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT

29

ACTIONS AND ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE

SOME WHICH, LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY

PRIOR PENDING CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE

COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION

AND DISMISSED THE COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. SUBSEQUENT

TO THE COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE

COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR

COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURT BROUGHT

INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS ARE AWAITING THE FINAL

RULING ON THEIR MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE SUFFOLK COUNTY CASE,

WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE FILED. IN

ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY WAS A

DEFENDANT IN STATE CASES BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF

KENTUCKY, ILLINOIS, ALABAMA, WISCONSIN, MISSISSIPPI, ARIZONA,

HAWAII AND ALASKA, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN ANTITRUST CASES IN FEDERAL COURT IN MINNESOTA AND

IN STATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA, EACH ALLEGING AN UNLAWFUL

CONSPIRACY AMONG DIFFERENT SETS OF PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

TO PROTECT HIGH PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES BY IMPEDING

IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF LOWER-PRICED

PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CANADA. THE COURT DISMISSED THE FEDERAL

CLAIMS IN THE MINNESOTA CASE WITH PREJUDICE AND THE PLAINTIFFS

FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

EIGHTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF THE FEDERAL CLAIMS. THE

STATE CLAIMS IN THAT ACTION WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE,

BUT HAVE NOT BEEN REFILED IN ANY JURISDICTION.

IN THE CALIFORNIA ANTITRUST ACTION, THE PARTIES ENGAGED IN

DISCOVERY AND THE DEFENDANT MANUFACTURERS FILED FOR SUMMARY

JUDGMENT. IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT

IN FAVOR OF MERCK AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS AND DISMISSED THE

CASE. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL IN THE

CALIFORNIA STATE APPEALS COURT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, A SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN ALABAMA BY

TWO PROVIDERS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO NEEDY PATIENTS ALLEGES THAT

15 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OVERCHARGED THE PLAINTIFFS AND A

CLASS OF THOSE SIMILARLY SITUATED, FOR PHARMACEUTICALS PURCHASED

BY THE PLAINTIFFS UNDER THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY

SECTION 340B OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. THE COMPANY

AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

ON NUMEROUS GROUNDS WHICH WAS RECENTLY DENIED BY THE COURT.

AFTER DENIAL OF THE MOTION TO DISMISS, THE CASE WAS DISMISSED

VOLUNTARILY BY THE PARTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2003, THE DOJ NOTIFIED THE

FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO

INTERVENE AT THAT TIME IN A PENDING FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT

CASE THAT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL IN DECEMBER 1999 AGAINST THE

COMPANY. THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER UNSEALING THE COMPLAINT,

WHICH WAS FILED BY A PHYSICIAN IN LOUISIANA, AND ORDERED THAT

THE COMPLAINT BE SERVED. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH ALLEGED THAT THE

COMPANYS DISCOUNTING OF

PEPCID

IN CERTAIN LOUISIANA

HOSPITALS LED TO INCREASES IN COSTS TO MEDICAID, WAS DISMISSED.

AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL AND THE CASE HAS BEEN

ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED BY THE COURT UNTIL THE SEAL IS LIFTED.

THE STATE OF LOUISIANA HAS FILED ITS OWN AMENDED COMPLAINT,

INCORPORATING THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED AMENDED

COMPLAINT. THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED AMENDED

COMPLAINT ARE UNKNOWN.

IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A QUI TAM LAWSUIT UNDER

THE NEVADA FALSE CLAIMS ACT. THE SUIT, IN WHICH THE NEVADA

ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS INTERVENED, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY

INAPPROPRIATELY OFFERED NOMINAL PRICING AND OTHER MARKETING AND

PRICING INDUCEMENTS TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND ALSO FAILED TO

COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MEDICAID BEST PRICE SCHEME

RELATED TO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION WAS DENIED BY THE DISTRICT COURT.

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING AGAINST THIS LAWSUIT.

GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A SUBPOENA

FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND SAMPLES. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

REPORTED THAT IT HAS RECEIVED A CID FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

TEXAS REGARDING THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING

ACTIVITIES RELATING TO TEXAS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED ANOTHER CID FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS

ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS

MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO TEXAS, INCLUDING

WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF ITS NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND

SAMPLES. IN APRIL 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE

OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN

CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS

INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,

MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA. IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

LETTER REQUEST FROM THE

30

DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS

PRICING OF

PEPCID.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE

SUBPOENA SEEKS INFORMATION RELATED TO REPACKAGING OF

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY RELATING TO MERCK IN

THE ILLINOIS MATTER IN 2006.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE DOJ ADVISING IT OF THE EXISTENCE OF A QUI TAM COMPLAINT

ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY VIOLATED CERTAIN RULES RELATED TO ITS

CALCULATIONS OF BEST PRICE AND OTHER FEDERAL PRICING BENCHMARK

CALCULATIONS, CERTAIN OF WHICH MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

MEDICAID REBATE OBLIGATION. THE DOJ HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY

THAT IT DOES NOT INTEND TO INTERVENE IN THIS ACTION AND HAS

CLOSED ITS INVESTIGATION. THE LAWSUIT CONTINUES, HOWEVER.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS;

HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FROM

TIME TO TIME, OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN REGULATORS OR

AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK INFORMATION ABOUT PRACTICES IN THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY OR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES

IN INQUIRIES OTHER THAN THE INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS

SECTION. IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH

INQUIRIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON FEBRUARY 23, 2004, THE ITALIAN

ANTITRUST AUTHORITY (ICA) ADOPTED A MEASURE

COMMENCING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF MERCK SHARP &

DOHME (ITALIA) S.P.A. (MSD ITALY) AND THE COMPANY

UNDER ARTICLE 14 OF THE ITALIAN COMPETITION LAW AND

ARTICLE 82 EC TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE COMPANY AND MSD

ITALY COMMITTED AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION BY REFUSING TO

GRANT TO ACS DOBFAR S.P.A. (DOBFAR), AN ITALIAN

COMPANY, A VOLUNTARY LICENSE UNDER THE COMPANYS ITALIAN

SUPPLEMENTARY PROTECTION CERTIFICATE (SPC), PURSUANT

TO DOMESTIC LEGISLATION PASSED IN 2002, TO PERMIT DOBFAR TO

MANUFACTURE IMIPENEM AND CILASTATIN (I&C), THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN

TIENAM

, IN ITALY FOR SALE OUTSIDE

ITALY IN COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION HAD EXPIRED OR NEVER

EXISTED. A HEARING BEFORE THE ICA WAS HELD ON MAY 2, 2005

AND ON JUNE 17, 2005, THE ICA FOUND, ON A PRELIMINARY

BASIS, THAT THE COMPANYS REFUSAL TO GRANT THE LICENSE WAS

AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION, AND IMPOSED INTERIM MEASURES

REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO GRANT A LICENSE TO MANUFACTURE I&C

IN ITALY FOR STOCKPILING PURPOSES ONLY, UNTIL EXPIRATION OF THE

SPC. ON NOVEMBER 16, 2005, THE ITALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

DENIED THE COMPANYS APPEAL OF THE ICAS ORDER. THE

COMPANYS SPC EXPIRED IN JANUARY 2006. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE

THE ICA CONTINUED ON THE MERITS OF THE ARTICLE 82

INVESTIGATION AND, IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE MATTER, THE

COMPANY OFFERED A COMMITMENT TO THE ICA PURSUANT TO WHICH THE

COMPANY WOULD GRANT NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSES UNDER ITS ITALIAN SPC

FOR FINASTERIDE WITH RESPECT TO FINASTERIDE 5 MG FOR THE

TREATMENT OF BENIGN PROSTATE HYPERPLASIA. THE DEADLINE FOR THE

ICA TO ADOPT ITS FINAL DECISION AS TO WHETHER THE COMPANYS

COMMITMENT WARRANTS THE CLOSURE OF THE CASE IS MARCH 16,

2007.

VACCINE

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A PARTY IN CLAIMS

BROUGHT UNDER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1987 IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, WHICH ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A

VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING VACCINATED WITH

VARIOUS BIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES AND RUBELLA

AND/OR

TRIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS

M-M-R

II. THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE

AUTISM, WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, EPILEPSY,

ENCEPHALITIS, ENCEPHALOPATHY, GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME AND

TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. THERE ARE NOW 6 CLAIMANTS PROCEEDING OR, TO

THE COMPANYS KNOWLEDGE, INTENDING TO PROCEED AGAINST THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS ALSO A PARTY TO

INDIVIDUAL AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G.,

HEPATITIS B VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE

USED IN VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING PEDIATRIC VACCINES IN THE UNITED STATES

SINCE THE FALL OF 2001. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WERE

APPROXIMATELY 250 ACTIVE THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS WITH

APPROXIMATELY 670 PLAINTIFFS. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER

VACCINE MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING

THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE

ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY

HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO

THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC VACCINES. TWO CASES SCHEDULED FOR

TRIAL IN 2006 WERE DISMISSED  ONE, A STATE COURT CASE

IN OHIO VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED BY THE PLAINTIFFS, AND THE SECOND,

A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT CASE IN TEXAS IN WHICH THE COURT

ENTERED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANTS IN 2005 AND

PLAINTIFFS ULTIMATELY VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED

31

THEIR APPEAL. THE COMPANY WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS;

HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE

EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS

PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE

VACCINE ACT). THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON

FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR

VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE

VACCINE COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING

A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE PETITIONER

MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN

VACCINE COURT AND THEN TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A

CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT

TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE

COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE

PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THE CASES WITH TRIAL DATES REFERRED

TO IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH AS HAVING BEEN DISMISSED WERE

BROUGHT BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE MADE A TIMELY

WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR VACCINE COURT PETITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 4,700 CASES

PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES

AND/OR

THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS.

NOT ALL OF THE THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE

VACCINE COURT PROCEEDING ARE COMPANY VACCINES. THE COMPANY IS

THE SOLE SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE

DOMESTICALLY. IN JUNE 2007, THE SPECIAL MASTERS PRESIDING OVER

THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN A HEARING

IN WHICH BOTH PETITIONERS AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL PRESENT

EVIDENCE ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THESE VACCINES CAN CAUSE AUTISM

SPECTRUM DISORDERS. THAT HEARING IS EXPECTED TO LAST A NUMBER OF

WEEKS. SINCE IT IS NOT A PARTY, THE COMPANY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE

IN THE PROCEEDINGS.

PATENT

LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS FILE ANDAS WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC

FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

FOSAMAX,

PRILOSEC, NEXIUM, PROPECIA, TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

PRIOR

TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS (AND ASTRAZENECAS

IN THE CASE OF

PRILOSEC

AND

NEXIUM

) PATENTS

CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. THE GENERIC COMPANIES

ANDAS GENERALLY INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT,

INVALIDITY AND UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE PATENTS. GENERIC

MANUFACTURERS HAVE RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A GENERIC

FORM OF

PRILOSEC.

THE COMPANY HAS FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES FILING

ANDAS FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE (

FOSAMAX

),

FINASTERIDE (

PROPECIA

), DORZOLAMIDE (

TRUSOPT

) AND

DORZOLAMIDE/TIMOLOL (

COSOPT

), AND ASTRAZENECA AND THE

COMPANY HAVE FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT

AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC OMEPRAZOLE

(

PRILOSEC

) AND ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

). SIMILAR

PATENT CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE

COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT

BELIEVES ARE VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES

ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF

SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE

PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING PLOUGH RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A

GENERIC COMPANY INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ZETIA

AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS

THAT ARE LISTED FOR

ZETIA

. MERCK AND SCHERING PLOUGH

MARKET

ZETIA

THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE AND THEY ARE

CONSIDERING THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A

GENERIC COMPANY INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

MONTELUKAST AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENT THAT IS

LISTED FOR

SINGULAIR

. THE COMPANY IS CONSIDERING THE

APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN

WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE

COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005.

BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED

STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND APRIL 2008, RESPECTIVELY AND THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

U.S.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES AFTER

EACH PRODUCTS RESPECTIVE LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

32

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A

DECISION REFUSING TO BAR THE APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON

THE GROUND THAT MERCKS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS

LIKELY INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC

ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA IN JUNE 2005. IN JULY 2005,

MERCK WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX SEEKING

DAMAGES FOR LOST SALES OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DUE TO THE

PATENT PROCEEDING.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY APPEALED

A DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE EPO THAT REVOKED

THE COMPANYS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY

ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. ON MARCH 14, 2006, THE BOARD

OF APPEAL OF THE EPO UPHELD THE DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION

DIVISION. THUS, PRESENTLY THE COMPANY IS NOT ENTITLED TO MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR

FOSAMAX

IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS

AFTER 2007. IN ADDITION, MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE

USE OF ALENDRONATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ADVERSE DECISIONS IN

GERMANY, HOLLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE DECISION IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM WAS UPHELD ON APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED

THE DECISIONS IN GERMANY AND HOLLAND.

IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY FILED LAWSUITS IN FEDERAL COURT

AGAINST BARR LABORATORIES, INC. AND TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRIES LTD. (TEVA) ASSERTING THAT THEIR

RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES FOR MAKING THEIR ALENDRONATE

PRODUCTS WOULD INFRINGE ONE OR MORE PROCESS PATENTS OF THE

COMPANY.

ON OCTOBER 5, 2004, IN AN ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CHALLENGING

THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS AUSTRALIAN PATENT FOR THE

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE, THE PATENT WAS FOUND

TO BE INVALID. THAT DECISION WAS UPHELD ON APPEAL.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JAPAN A PROCEEDING HAS

BEEN FILED CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS

JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

ALENDRONATE.

ON JANUARY 18, 2006, THE COMPANY SUED HI-TECH PHARMACAL

CO., INC. (HI-TECH) OF AMITYVILLE, NEW YORK FOR

PATENT INFRINGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO HI-TECHS APPLICATION TO

THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC VERSION OF MERCKS

OPHTHALMIC DRUGS

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

, WHICH ARE

USED FOR TREATING ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN PEOPLE WITH

OCULAR HYPERTENSION OR GLAUCOMA. IN THE LAWSUIT, MERCK SUED TO

ENFORCE A PATENT COVERING AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT DORZOLAMIDE,

WHICH IS PRESENT IN BOTH

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

. IN

THAT CASE, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT IN MERCKS

FAVOR AND HI-TECH APPEALED. A HEARING OF THE APPEAL WAS

CONDUCTED IN DECEMBER 2006 AND A DECISION IS PENDING. MERCK HAS

ELECTED NOT TO ENFORCE TWO U.S. PATENTS LISTED WITH THE FDA

WHICH COVER THE COMBINATION OF DORZOLAMIDE AND TIMOLOL, THE TWO

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN

COSOPT

. THIS LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY

STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF HI-TECHS ANDAS FOR

30 MONTHS FROM JANUARY 2006 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT

DECISION, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE PATENT COVERING

DORZOLAMIDE PROVIDES EXCLUSIVITY FOR

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008 (INCLUDING SIX MONTHS OF

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY). AFTER SUCH TIME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS TO DECLINE.

IN THE CASE OF OMEPRAZOLE, THE TRIAL COURT IN THE UNITED STATES

RENDERED AN OPINION IN OCTOBER 2002 UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF

THE COMPANYS AND ASTRAZENECAS PATENTS COVERING THE

STABILIZED FORMULATION OF OMEPRAZOLE AND RULING THAT ONE

DEFENDANTS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT DID NOT INFRINGE THOSE

PATENTS. THE OTHER THREE DEFENDANTS PRODUCTS WERE FOUND TO

INFRINGE THE FORMULATION PATENTS. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE

DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS

PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN OTHER GENERIC

MANUFACTURERS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCTS, THE TRIAL CONCLUDED IN

JUNE 2006 AND A DECISION IS PENDING.

THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT

RANBAXY LABORATORIES LIMITED (RANBAXY) HAS FILED AN

ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS

PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. ON

NOVEMBER 21, 2005, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA SUED RANBAXY

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDINGLY,

FDA APPROVAL OF RANBAXYS ANDA IS STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS

UNTIL APRIL 2008 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY,

WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA

RECEIVED NOTICE IN JANUARY 2006 THAT IVAX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,

SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED BY TEVA, HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV

CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM

. ON MARCH 8, 2006.

THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA SUED TEVA IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDINGLY, FDA APPROVAL OF

TEVAS ANDA IS STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS UNTIL SEPTEMBER

2008 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY, WHICHEVER MAY

OCCUR EARLIER.

33

IN THE CASE OF FINASTERIDE, AN ANDA HAS BEEN FILED SEEKING

APPROVAL OF A GENERIC VERSION OF

PROPECIA

AND ALLEGING

INVALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS PATENTS. THE COMPANY FILED A

PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF DELAWARE IN

SEPTEMBER 2004. IN 2006, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH

THE GENERIC COMPANY, DR. REDDYS LABORATORIES

(DRL), UNDER WHICH DRL MAY SELL A GENERIC 1 MG

FINASTERIDE PRODUCT BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2013.

IN EUROPE, THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPANIES SEEKING

REGISTRATION FOR GENERIC LOSARTAN (THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOR

COZAAR

). THE COMPANY HAS PATENT RIGHTS TO LOSARTAN VIA

LICENSE FROM E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY (DU

PONT). THE COMPANY AND DU PONT HAVE FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS COMPANIES IN PORTUGAL,

SPAIN AND NORWAY.

OTHER

LITIGATION

ON JULY 27, 2005, MERCK WAS SERVED WITH A FURTHER

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT FILED IN THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR

COURT FOR HUNTERDON COUNTY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THIS LAWSUIT SEEKS TO

RECOVER OR CANCEL COMPENSATION AWARDED TO THE COMPANYS

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN 2004, AND ASSERTS CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF

FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT. ON JULY 21,

2006, THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS BASED

ON PLAINTIFFS FAILURE TO MAKE PRE-SUIT DEMAND ON

MERCKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DENIED PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND. THUS, THIS CASE HAS BEEN TERMINATED.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE BOARD ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY HAD SUSTAINED DAMAGES

THROUGH THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF ITS CHANGE IN CONTROL

SEPARATION BENEFITS PLAN (THE CIC PLAN) IN NOVEMBER

2004. THE SHAREHOLDER MADE A DEMAND ON THE BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL

ACTION AGAINST THE BOARDS CURRENT OR FORMER MEMBERS FOR

ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE

ADOPTION OF THE CIC PLAN. IN RESPONSE TO THAT DEMAND LETTER, THE

INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD DETERMINED AT THE

NOVEMBER 22, 2005 BOARD MEETING THAT THE BOARD WOULD TAKE

THE SHAREHOLDERS REQUEST UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT

REMAINS UNDER CONSIDERATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 20, 2004, THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY GRANTED A

MOTION BY THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO

HEALTH) AND CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO DISMISS A

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION INVOLVING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS REVENUE RECOGNITION PRACTICE FOR RETAIL

CO-PAYMENTS PAID BY INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM MEDCO HEALTH PROVIDES

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER ALLEGATIONS. THE

COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE

DECISION. ON DECEMBER 15, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT UPHELD MOST OF THE DISTRICT

COURTS DECISION DISMISSING THE SUIT, AND SENT THE ISSUE OF

WHETHER THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROPERLY REFUSED

THE SHAREHOLDER DEMAND RELATING TO THE COMPANYS TREATMENT

OF RETAIL CO-PAYMENTS BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR

RECONSIDERATION UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL STANDARD. PLAINTIFFS

MOVED TO REMAND THEIR ACTION TO STATE COURT ON AUGUST 18,

2006, AND THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THAT MOTION ON

FEBRUARY 1, 2007. THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT IS

CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY,

CHANCERY DIVISION, HUNTERDON COUNTY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH,

THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION

BASIS, A SERIES OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA (THE

GRUER CASES). THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A

NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS,

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY AGREED TO

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT COST

AND DISTRACTION OF PROLONGED LITIGATION. THE PROPOSED CLASS

SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES

FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A

TOTAL OF $42.5 MILLION, AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO

MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TO CONTINUE CERTAIN

SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE

FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE

SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO

HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME SINCE

DECEMBER 17, 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD HEARINGS TO HEAR

OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND

APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE

NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL ONLY

IF AND WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. CERTAIN CLASS MEMBER

PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH PLANS AND TWO

INDIVIDUALS REMAIN PENDING IN THE

34

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES HAVE

ASSERTED CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND

STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO THE CLAIMS THAT

HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES.

THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE

CASES.

THREE NOTICES OF APPEAL WERE FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT HEARD

ORAL ARGUMENT IN MAY 2005. ON DECEMBER 8, 2005, THE

APPELLATE COURT ISSUED A DECISION VACATING THE DISTRICT

COURTS JUDGMENT AND REMANDING THE CASES TO THE DISTRICT

COURT TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT COURT TO RESOLVE CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. A HEARING WAS HELD TO ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006. THE DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A RULING ON

AUGUST 10, 2006 RESOLVING SUCH JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES IN

FAVOR OF THE SETTLING PLAINTIFFS. THE CLASS MEMBERS AND OTHER

PARTY THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURTS

JUDGMENT HAVE RENEWED THEIR APPEALS. THE RENEWED APPEALS ARE

PRESENTLY BEING BRIEFED.

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS

DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING TWO PARAGRAPHS. THESE CASES ARE BEING

DEFENDED BY MEDCO HEALTH.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY,

WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS

ITEM, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE

EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR

WHICH A SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED IN THIS ITEM.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE

OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS

OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE

GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY

TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP

COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF

CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE

RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE

COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO

SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN

DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES

OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, SUCH

PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH

WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND

PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY

REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM

INSURERS, FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT

DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THE COMPANYS

PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS,

SAFETY AND VALUE OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE PRODUCTS TO

HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES

AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

OVERVIEW

DURING 2006, MERCK CONTINUED TO EXECUTE ITS STRATEGY TO RECLAIM

ITS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. THIS WAS

MADE EVIDENT THROUGH THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES OF FIVE NOVEL

MEDICINES AND VACCINES IN AREAS SUCH AS CANCER PREVENTION AND

DIABETES, THE ADVANCEMENT OF DRUG CANDIDATES THROUGH EVERY PHASE

OF THE COMPANYS PIPELINE AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF ITS

NEWER AND IN-LINE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS

DEVELOPING A NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL WHICH IS DESIGNED TO BROADEN

ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH CUSTOMERS AND SCIENTIFIC LEADERS, LEVERAGE

ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS TO COMPLEMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS

SALES FORCE, AND DRIVE GROWTH IN KEY MARKETS.

DURING 2006, FIVE PRODUCTS RECEIVED U.S. FOOD AND DRUG

ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVAL.

GARDASIL

, THE

FIRST VACCINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF CERVICAL CANCER AND GENITAL

WARTS CAUSED BY CERTAIN TYPES OF HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS

(HPV);

JANUVIA

, THE FIRST MEDICINE OF ITS

CLASS THAT ENHANCES A NATURAL BODY SYSTEM TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR

CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES;

ZOSTAVAX

, THE

FIRST VACCINE FOR ADULTS 60 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER TO

REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF SHINGLES, A DISEASE WHICH EVERY YEAR

AFFLICTS AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES

ALONE;

ROTATEQ

, A PEDIATRIC VACCINE TO HELP PREVENT

ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN, THE EFFECTS

OF WHICH TAKE THE LIVES OF NEARLY 600,000 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE

OF FIVE WORLDWIDE EVERY YEAR; AND

ZOLINZA

, A NOVEL

MEDICINE TO TREAT PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ADVANCED CUTANEOUS

T-CELL LYMPHOMA (CTCL).

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS THREE DRUG CANDIDATES CURRENTLY

UNDER FDA REVIEW.

JANUMET

(PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS

MK-0431A), AN INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL MEDICINE COMBINING

SITAGLIPTIN PHOSPHATE WITH METFORMIN FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES THAT IS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR PATIENTS

WHO NEED MORE THAN ONE ORAL AGENT TO HELP CONTROL THEIR BLOOD

SUGAR;

EMEND

FOR INJECTION (MK-0517), AN INTRAVENOUS

THERAPY FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING

(CINV); AND

ARCOXIA

, MERCKS SELECTIVE

COX-2 INHIBITOR FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES FILING THREE NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS (NDA)

WITH THE FDA IN 2007: MK-0518, A

FIRST-IN-CLASS HIV

INTEGRASE INHIBITOR; GABOXADOL, A NOVEL COMPOUND FROM

MERCKS ALLIANCE WITH H. LUNDBECK A/S FOR THE TREATMENT OF

INSOMNIA; AND MK-0524A, AN EXTENDED-RELEASE (ER)

NIACIN COMBINED WITH LAROPIPRANT (A NOVEL FLUSHING PATHWAY

INHIBITOR) FOR CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, BY MID-YEAR

2007, MERCK EXPECTS TO HAVE FOUR PRODUCTS IN PHASE III

DEVELOPMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, TARGETED ACQUISITIONS MADE DURING THE YEAR OF

SIRNA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (SIRNA), GLYCOFI, INC.

(GLYCOFI) AND ABMAXIS, INC. (ABMAXIS),

AS WELL AS OTHER ALLIANCES AND COLLABORATIONS, WILL COMPLEMENT

MERCKS STRONG INTERNAL RESEARCH CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD

CONTINUE TO HELP THE COMPANY BUILD A PIPELINE THAT WILL SUPPORT

ITS LONG-TERM GROWTH.

MERCK IS WORKING TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED

PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. THE COMPANY

HAS SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED LATE DEVELOPMENT PRODUCT CYCLE TIMES

AND ANTICIPATES FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN THE COMING YEAR.

ADDITIONALLY, MERCKS NEW COMMERCIAL MODEL IS EXPECTED TO

LOWER SPENDING PER

45

PRIMARY CARE BRAND BY 15% TO 20% IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 2005

THROUGH 2010 (AN INTERIM TARGETED 9% REDUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE

ACHIEVED THROUGH THE END OF 2007) WHILE STILL APPROPRIATELY

SUPPORTING PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE SUCCESSFUL

LAUNCH OF FIVE NEW PRODUCTS IN 2006. THROUGH REDEPLOYMENT, THE

LAUNCHES WERE ACHIEVED WITH NO INCREASE IN SALES FORCE.

THE INITIAL PHASE OF A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO

REDUCE THE COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY

AND ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS IS UNDERWAY. THE INITIAL STEPS

INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK

MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER,

MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, IN 2005,

MERCK ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SELL OR CLOSE FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES

AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES BY THE END OF 2008 (THREE OF THE

MANUFACTURING SITES WERE CLOSED, SOLD OR HAD CEASED OPERATIONS

AND THE TWO PRECLINICAL SITES WERE CLOSED BY THE END OF 2006),

AND ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,000 POSITIONS COMPANY-WIDE (OF

WHICH APPROXIMATELY 4,800 POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED BY THE END

OF 2006 COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AND THE

ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS). HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES AS THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS REQUIRES IT. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO SOLD CERTAIN OTHER

FACILITIES AND RELATED ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THE PRE-TAX COSTS OF THIS RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM WERE $935.5 MILLION IN 2006 (COMPRISED OF

$793.2 MILLION PRIMARILY REPRESENTING ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT COSTS AND $142.3 MILLION

OF SEPARATION AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS) AND ARE

EXPECTED TO BE $300 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN 2007.

THROUGH THE END OF 2008, WHEN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURING STRATEGY IS

EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, THE CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX

COSTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM

$1.9 BILLION TO $2.2 BILLION. MERCK CONTINUES TO

EXPECT THE INITIAL PHASE OF ITS COST REDUCTION PROGRAM TO YIELD

CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX SAVINGS OF $4.5 TO $5.0 BILLION FROM

2006 THROUGH 2010.

WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION, TO DATE IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, OF THE 29 PLAINTIFFS

WHOSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN

WERE DISMISSED, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE WITHDRAWN FROM THE

TRIAL CALENDAR BY PLAINTIFFS, AND JURIES HAVE DECIDED IN

MERCKS FAVOR NINE TIMES AND IN PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FOUR

TIMES. IN ADDITION, IN THE RECENT CALIFORNIA TRIAL INVOLVING TWO

PLAINTIFFS, THE JURY COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT FOR EITHER

PLAINTIFF AND A MISTRIAL WAS DECLARED. A NEW JERSEY STATE JUDGE

SET ASIDE ONE OF THE NINE MERCK VERDICTS. WITH RESPECT TO THE

FOUR PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK ALREADY HAS FILED AN

APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE CASES, AND IN

ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD

SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. IN ADDITION, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL WITH TWO

PLAINTIFFS IS CURRENTLY ONGOING IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN

NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE CAROL E. HIGBEE AND

ANOTHER TRIAL HAS COMMENCED IN STATE COURT IN ILLINOIS. DURING

2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE,

INCLUDING $175 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

RECORDED CHARGES OF $673 MILLION TO INCREASE THE RESERVE

SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 THE BALANCE OF THE

RESERVE WAS $858 MILLION. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY

BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2008. THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION IS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION FOR 2006 WERE $2.03,

INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM OF

$0.28 PER SHARE, THE ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO

THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA OF $0.21 PER SHARE AND THE

ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF GLYCOFI

OF $0.14 PER SHARE (AS DISCUSSED IN

ACQUISITIONS BELOW), ADDITIONAL RESERVES ESTABLISHED

SOLELY FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR

VIOXX

LITIGATION (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE) AND THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING A

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS

(AS DISCUSSED IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION BELOW).

COMPETITION

AND THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT

THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS ARE

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED. GLOBAL EFFORTS

TOWARD HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE

ON PRODUCT PRICING AND ACCESS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE ACCESS

BY ENACTING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER

2003. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS GOAL OF IMPROVING

ACCESS TO

46

MEDICINES BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHILE PRESERVING

MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION. AT THE

SAME TIME, THE LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG

COSTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND BY

ENCOURAGING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF MEDICINES.

IN ADDRESSING COST-CONTAINMENT PRESSURE, THE COMPANY HAS MADE A

CONTINUING EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEDICINES CAN HELP

SAVE COSTS IN OVERALL PATIENT HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION, PRICING

FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE COMPANYS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO HAS

ENCOURAGED GROWING USE OF ITS MEDICINES AND MITIGATED THE

EFFECTS OF INCREASING COST PRESSURES.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IN DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS ENCUMBERED

BY GOVERNMENT COST-CONTAINMENT ACTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS WORKED

IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PAYERS ON ALLOCATING SCARCE RESOURCES TO

OPTIMIZE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES, LIMITING THE POTENTIALLY

DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON SALES GROWTH AND

ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE MEDICINES AND VACCINES, AND TO SUPPORT THE

DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO BENEFIT

PATIENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO IS WORKING WITH GOVERNMENTS IN MANY

EMERGING MARKETS IN EASTERN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA AND ASIA TO

ENCOURAGE THEM TO INCREASE THEIR INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH AND

THEREBY IMPROVE THEIR CITIZENS ACCESS TO MEDICINES. WITHIN

EUROPE, EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

(EC) HAVE RECOGNIZED THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE

RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE VALUE OF

INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT, THEY ARE WORKING

WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO COMPLETE THE SINGLE

MARKET IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE

CLIMATE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS INCLUDING MARKET

DEREGULATION. IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE RELATED POLICY DEBATE, THE

EC LAUNCHED THE HIGH LEVEL PHARMACEUTICAL FORUM

(HLPF) AT THE END OF 2005. THIS INITIATIVE AIMS AT

IMPROVING THE PROSPECTS OF THE RESEARCH-BASED PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRY IN EUROPE AND THUS THE HEALTH PROSPECTS OF ALL PATIENTS

WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM INNOVATIVE THERAPIES. THROUGH AN ACTIVE

DIALOGUE AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (FROM

PAYERS TO PATIENTS), THIS INITIATIVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO TACKLE KEY

POLICY ISSUES IN EUROPE: (I) PROMOTING GREATER PRICING

FLEXIBILITY FOR MEDICINES; (II) ENSURING THAT HEALTH

AUTHORITIES APPLY BEST PRACTICES FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE

RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICINES; AND (III) IMPROVING

GREATER ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS IN

EUROPE. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE EC AND

OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME FOR

THE HLPF THAT WOULD HELP EUROPEAN PATIENTS GAIN GREATER AND

QUICKER ACCESS TO ITS MEDICINES.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND

ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. THE

AFRICAN COMPREHENSIVE HIV/AIDS PARTNERSHIPS (ACHAP)

IN BOTSWANA, A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF BOTSWANA,

THE BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION AND THE MERCK

COMPANY FOUNDATION/MERCK & CO., INC., IS SUPPORTING

BOTSWANAS RESPONSE TO HIV/AIDS THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE AND

SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO HIV PREVENTION, CARE, TREATMENT AND

SUPPORT. IN MAY 2005, THE COMPANY INITIATED A SIMILAR

PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA (FOCUSED

INITIALLY IN SICHUAN PROVINCE) TO HELP STRENGTHEN CHINAS

RESPONSE TO THE HIV EPIDEMIC.

TO FURTHER CATALYZE ACCESS TO HIV MEDICINES IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES, UNDER PRICE REDUCTION GUIDELINES THAT THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED IN 2001, MERCK MAKES NO PROFIT ON THE SALE OF ITS

CURRENT HIV/AIDS MEDICINES IN THE WORLDS POOREST COUNTRIES

AND THOSE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC, AND OFFERS ITS HIV/AIDS

MEDICINES AT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PRICES TO MEDIUM-INCOME

COUNTRIES. IN FEBRUARY 2007, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGAIN

REDUCED THE PRICE OF

STOCRIN

IN THE LEAST DEVELOPED

COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD AND THOSE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. BY

THE END OF 2006, MORE THAN 475,000 PATIENTS IN MORE THAN 75

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WERE BEING TREATED WITH ANTIRETROVIRAL

REGIMENS CONTAINING EITHER

CRIXIVAN

OR

STOCRIN.

THROUGH THESE AND OTHER ACTIONS, MERCK IS WORKING INDEPENDENTLY

AND WITH PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS ALIKE TO

FOCUS ON THE MOST CRITICAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO MEDICINES IN

THE DEVELOPING WORLD: THE NEED FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCING,

INCREASED INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN

EDUCATION, TRAINING AND HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY IN

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS GLOBALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

ALTHOUGH NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE AND OTHER

LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND ADVOCACY INITIATIVES, THE COMPANY IS

WELL POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING HEALTH CARE

ENVIRONMENT AND MARKET FORCES.

47

AS PATENTS ON CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS EXPIRE,

MERCK HAS ENTERED INTO, AND MAY CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO,

AUTHORIZED GENERIC AGREEMENTS WHICH ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BENEFIT

WHEN THESE MEDICINES BECOME AVAILABLE IN GENERIC FORM.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLDWIDE TREND TOWARD

COST-CONTAINMENT WILL CONTINUE, RESULTING IN ONGOING PRESSURES

ON HEALTH CARE BUDGETS. AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SUCCESSFULLY

LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS, CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH CARE DEBATES AND

MONITOR REFORMS, ITS NEW PRODUCTS, POLICIES AND STRATEGIES

SHOULD ENABLE IT TO MAINTAIN A STRONG POSITION IN THE CHANGING

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

ACQUISITIONS

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA FOR

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION. SIRNA IS A BIOTECHNOLOGY

COMPANY THAT IS A LEADER IN DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES

BASED ON RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH

COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE. THE

TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION IN WHICH

THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

ACQUIRED NET ASSETS HAS BEEN RECORDED AS GOODWILL OF

$345.9 MILLION. THE GOODWILL WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX

PURPOSES. THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $466.2 MILLION

FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH SIRNAS COMPOUNDS

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT,  WHICH RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT

OF TREATMENTS FOR BOTH THE HEPATITIS B AND HEPATITIS C

VIRUSES, WHICH ARE IN PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS

LICENSING AGREEMENTS HELD BY SIRNA. THE CHARGE WAS NOT

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT

TO EACH OF THESE COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO

BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES. THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALSO RESULTED IN

THE RECOGNITION OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET OF $357.8 MILLION,

AND A RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $146.3 MILLION,

RELATED TO SIRNAS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY. THE ACQUISITION OF

SIRNA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE MERCKS ABILITY TO USE RNAI

TECHNOLOGY TO TURN OFF A TARGETED GENE IN A HUMAN CELL,

POTENTIALLY RENDERING INOPERATIVE A GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR

TRIGGERING A SPECIFIC DISEASE. (SEE NOTE 5 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

IN JUNE 2006, MERCK ACQUIRED GLYCOFI, A PRIVATELY-HELD

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS A LEADER IN THE FIELD OF YEAST

GLYCOENGINEERING, WHICH IS THE ADDITION OF SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE

MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROTEINS IN YEAST, AND OPTIMIZATION OF

BIOLOGIC DRUG MOLECULES, FOR $373 MILLION IN CASH

($400 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE NET OF $25 MILLION OF

SHARES ALREADY OWNED AND NET TRANSACTION COSTS). THE COMPANY

RECORDED A $296.3 MILLION CHARGE FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX

PURPOSES. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A $99.4 MILLION

INTANGIBLE ASSET ($57.6 MILLION NET OF DEFERRED TAXES)

RELATED TO GLYCOFIS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY. IN MAY 2006,

MERCK ACQUIRED ABMAXIS, A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL

COMPANY DEDICATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND OPTIMIZATION OF

MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN THERAPEUTICS AND

DIAGNOSTICS, FOR $80 MILLION IN CASH. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO AN INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATING

TO ABMAXIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. WHILE EACH OF THE

ACQUISITIONS HAS INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC MERITS, THE COMBINATION

OF THE GLYCOFI AND ABMAXIS PLATFORMS IS POTENTIALLY SYNERGISTIC,

GIVING MERCK THE ABILITY TO OPERATE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM

OF THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODY DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND

COMMERCIALIZATION. (SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

2006, A DECREASE OF 2% OVER 2005. SALES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES WERE AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER GENERIC

ALENDRONATE SODIUM PRODUCTS IN SOME KEY MARKETS, INCLUDING THE

UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND GERMANY. THE COMPANY HAS ONGOING

LITIGATION IN CERTAIN OF THOSE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BASED ON THE

COMPANYS ALENDRONATE PATENTS.

FOSAMAX

WORLDWIDE SALES OF

ZOCOR

, MERCKS STATIN FOR

MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL, WERE $2.8 BILLION IN 2006, A

DECREASE OF 36% FROM 2005. SALES OF

ZOCOR

WERE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF U.S. MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY IN JUNE

2006. GLOBAL SALES OF

ZOCOR

ARE EXPECTED TO BE

$0.6 BILLION TO $0.9 BILLION IN 2007.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH DRL

THAT AUTHORIZED THE SALE OF GENERIC SIMVASTATIN. UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY IS REIMBURSED ON A COST-PLUS BASIS

BY DRL FOR SUPPLYING FINISHED GOODS AND RECEIVES A SHARE OF THE

NET PROFITS RECORDED BY DRL. MERCK CONTINUES TO OFFER BRANDED

ZOCOR

AND TO MANUFACTURE SIMVASTATIN FOR BRANDED

ZOCOR

,

VYTORIN

AND THE COMPANYS

INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND MK-0524B. IN 2006, MERCK RECORDED

$208.9 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRL ARRANGEMENT FOR

SIMVASTATIN. THIS REVENUE IS NOT EXPECTED TO CONTINUE BEYOND

2006.

IN OCTOBER 2006,

JANUVIA

WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA, AND IS

NOW THE FIRST AND ONLY DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-4

(DPP-4) INHIBITOR AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES. DPP-4 INHIBITORS REPRESENT A

NEW CLASS OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS THAT IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR

CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES BY ENHANCING A NATURAL

BODY SYSTEM CALLED THE INCRETIN SYSTEM.

JANUVIA

HAS BEEN

APPROVED AS MONOTHERAPY AND AS ADD-ON THERAPY TO EITHER OF TWO

OTHER ORAL DIABETES MEDICATIONS, METFORMIN OR THIAZOLIDINEDIONES

(TZDS), TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR (GLUCOSE) CONTROL IN

PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES WHEN DIET AND EXERCISE ARE NOT

ENOUGH.

ON JANUARY 25, 2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A POSITIVE

OPINION ABOUT

JANUVIA

FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL

PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (CHMP) OF THE EUROPEAN

MEDICINES AGENCY (EMEA) IN EUROPE. THE CHMP OPINION

RECOMMENDED THAT

JANUVIA

BE APPROVED IN THE EU FOR THE

TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THE

CHMP REVIEW, THE OPINION FOR

JANUVIA

WILL BE TRANSMITTED

TO THE EC. IF THE EC ADOPTS THE OPINION,

JANUVIA

WILL BE

THE FIRST AND ONLY PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION IN A NEW CLASS OF

DRUGS KNOWN AS DPP-4 INHIBITORS, WHICH ENHANCE THE BODYS

OWN ABILITY TO LOWER BLOOD SUGAR (GLUCOSE) WHEN IT IS ELEVATED.

THE DECISION WILL BE APPLICABLE TO THE 27 COUNTRIES THAT ARE

MEMBERS OF THE EU. MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FROM THE EC IS

EXPECTED IN EARLY APRIL 2007 AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE OPINION.

INCLUDING THE EU, MERCK ANTICIPATES APPROVAL FOR

JANUVIA

IN AT LEAST ANOTHER 55 COUNTRIES IN 2007.

CLINICAL STUDIES SHOW THAT

JANUVIA

PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT

A1C (A MEASURE OF AVERAGE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL OVER A TWO- TO

THREE-MONTH PERIOD) REDUCTIONS IN BOTH MONOTHERAPY AND WHEN

ADDED TO TWO COMMONLY USED TYPES OF DIABETES DRUGS, METFORMIN

AND TZDS. TREATMENT WITH

JANUVIA

WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

WEIGHT GAIN OR AN INCREASED RISK OF HYPOGLYCEMIA.

JANUVIA

IS NOW AVAILABLE IN 11 COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED

STATES, MEXICO, AND BRAZIL, AND OTHER REGULATORY FILINGS AROUND

THE WORLD ARE MOVING FORWARD. GLOBAL SALES OF

JANUVIA

WERE $42.9 MILLION IN 2006.

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE FDA APPROVED

ZOLINZA

FOR THE

TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH CTCL WHO

HAVE PROGRESSIVE, PERSISTENT OR RECURRENT DISEASE ON OR

FOLLOWING TWO SYSTEMIC THERAPIES. THE APPROVAL OF

ZOLINZA

REPRESENTS THE FIRST ANTICANCER TREATMENT APPROVED FOR CTCL

SINCE 1999.

OTHER PRODUCTS EXPERIENCING GROWTH IN 2006 INCLUDE

COSOPT

TO TREAT GLAUCOMA,

PROPECIA

FOR MALE PATTERN HAIR

LOSS,

MAXALT

NAUSEA AND VOMITING. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO MERCKS TOTAL

SALES IN 2006 WAS REVENUE RESULTING FROM THE COMPANYS

RELATIONSHIP WITH AZLP, PRIMARILY RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM.

PROSCAR

, MERCKS UROLOGY PRODUCT FOR THE TREATMENT

OF SYMPTOMATIC BENIGN PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT, LOST MARKETING

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN JUNE 2006. MERCKS

U.S. SALES OF

PROSCAR

FOR 2006 WERE

$243.7 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 34% COMPARED WITH 2005. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THE DECLINE IN U.S.

PROSCAR

SALES TO

CONTINUE. THE BASIC PATENT FOR

PROSCAR

ALSO COVERS

PROPECIA

, HOWEVER,

PROPECIA

IS PROTECTED BY

ADDITIONAL PATENTS WHICH EXPIRE IN OCTOBER 2013.

VACCINES

SEGMENT REVENUES

SALES OF THE VACCINES SEGMENT INCREASED 73% IN 2006 AS A RESULT

OF NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF IN-LINE

VACCINES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF VACCINES INCLUDES TOTAL

VACCINES SALES, THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE

VACCINES SEGMENT AND THE REMAINDER, REPRESENTING CERTAIN SALES

OF VACCINES BY

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES,

ARE MANAGED BY AND INCLUDED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT. THESE

AMOUNTS DO NOT REFLECT

51

SALES OF VACCINES SOLD IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS THROUGH

SANOFI PASTEUR MSD (SPMSD) THE COMPANYS JOINT

VENTURE WITH SANOFI PASTEUR, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE REFLECTED

IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED FDA APPROVAL OF THREE NEW

BREAKTHROUGH VACCINES.

GARDASIL

,

ROTATEQ

AND

ZOSTAVAX.

ON JUNE 8, 2006, THE FDA APPROVED

GARDASIL

, THE ONLY

VACCINE AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES TO PREVENT CERVICAL

CANCER AND VULVAR AND VAGINAL PRE-CANCERS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 16

AND 18 AND TO PREVENT LOW-GRADE AND PRE-CANCEROUS LESIONS AND

GENITAL WARTS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND 18.

GARDASIL

IS APPROVED FOR 9- TO

26-YEAR-OLD

GIRLS AND WOMEN.

GARDASIL

IS A THREE DOSE, INTRA MUSCULAR

VACCINE GIVEN OVER SIX MONTHS. IN THE UNITED STATES, IT IS

ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 9,700 WOMEN WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH

CERVICAL CANCER THIS YEAR, AND APPROXIMATELY 3,700 WOMEN WILL

DIE.

IN JUNE 2006, THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROLS

(CDC) ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES

(ACIP) VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO RECOMMEND THAT GIRLS AND

WOMEN 11 TO 26 YEARS OLD BE VACCINATED WITH

GARDASIL.

THE ACIP RECOMMENDED THAT

GARDASIL

BE ADMINISTERED TO 11- AND

12-YEAR-OLD

FEMALES AND TO FEMALES AGED 13 TO 26 WHO HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY

BEEN VACCINATED, AND THAT 9- AND

10-YEAR-OLD

FEMALES BE VACCINATED WITH

GARDASIL

AT THE DISCRETION OF

THEIR PHYSICIANS.

ON NOVEMBER 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE CDC

ADDED

GARDASIL

TO THE CDCS VACCINES FOR CHILDREN

PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE GIRLS AND WOMEN AGED 9 TO 18. AS OF

FEBRUARY 2, 2007, MANAGED CARE PLANS REPRESENTING AT LEAST

96% OF PRIVATELY-INSURED LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES (CURRENTLY

MORE THAN 120 INSURANCE PLANS) HAD DECIDED TO REIMBURSE FOR

GARDASIL

WHEN COVERED UNDER THE MEMBERS BENEFIT

DESIGN. THESE INSURERS ARE REIMBURSING THE VACCINE AT OR ABOVE

THE LOWEST PRICE PAID TO MERCK BY PRIVATE NON-HMO CUSTOMERS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

GARDASIL

WAS APPROVED AS THE FIRST AND

ONLY VACCINE IN THE EU FOR USE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AGED

9 TO 15 YEARS AND IN ADULT FEMALES AGED 16 TO 26 YEARS

FOR THE PREVENTION OF CERVICAL CANCER, HIGH-GRADE CERVICAL

DYSPLASIAS/PRECANCERS [CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (CIN

2/3)], HIGH-GRADE/PRECANCEROUS VULVAR DYSPLASTIC LESIONS (VIN

2/3) AND GENITAL WARTS CAUSED BY HPV TYPES 6, 11, 16 AND

18.

GARDASIL

IS MARKETED BY SPMSD IN 19 EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES, INCLUDING 15 IN THE EU. IN THE REMAINING CENTRAL AND

EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,

GARDASIL

IS MARKETED BY MERCK

SHARP & DOHME AS EITHER

GARDASIL

OR

SILGARD.

IN 2006, TOTAL SALES OF

GARDASIL

RECORDED BY MERCK WERE

$234.8 MILLION.

GARDASIL

HAS BEEN APPROVED IN

54 COUNTRIES, ALL UNDER ACCELERATED REVIEWS, WITH

REGULATORY APPLICATIONS PENDING IN APPROXIMATELY 50 COUNTRIES.

IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT AND

GLAXOSMITHKLINE (GSK) ENTERED INTO A CROSS-LICENSE

AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR CERTAIN PATENT RIGHTS RELATED TO

HPV VACCINES. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, GSK RECEIVED AN UPFRONT

PAYMENT AND IS RECEIVING ROYALTIES FROM THE COMPANY BASED UPON

SALES OF

GARDASIL

, UPON DEVELOPMENT AND LAUNCH. THE

AGREEMENT RESOLVES COMPETING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AND GSKS VACCINE CANDIDATES.

IN ADDITION, IN 1995, MERCK ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT AND

COLLABORATION WITH CSL LIMITED RELATING TO TECHNOLOGY USED IN

GARDASIL.

GARDASIL

IS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF OTHER

THIRD-PARTY LICENSING AGREEMENTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE

AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY WILL PAY ROYALTIES ON THE WORLDWIDE

SALES OF

GARDASIL

OF APPROXIMATELY 24% TO 26% IN THE

AGGREGATE.

CLINICAL STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF

GARDASIL

IN

FEMALES 27 TO 45 YEARS OF AGE AND MALES 16 TO 26 YEARS

OF AGE CONTINUE IN MORE THAN 30 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO SUBMIT TO THE FDA AN INDICATION FOR FEMALES

27 TO 45 YEARS OF AGE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, AND AN

INDICATION FOR MALES 16 TO 26 YEARS OF AGE IN 2008. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO CONDUCTING ONGOING CLINICAL STUDIES TO ASSESS

THE POTENTIAL FOR CROSS-PROTECTION AGAINST HPV TYPES RELATED TO

HPV 16 AND 18, INCLUDING HPV 31 AND 45. CROSS-PROTECTION,

IF PROVEN, COULD POTENTIALLY EXPAND THE VACCINES

PREVENTION COVERAGE AGAINST CERVICAL CANCER.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE FDA APPROVED

ROTATEQ

, THE

COMPANYS VACCINE TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST ROTAVIRUS

GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN. THE FDA APPROVAL OF

ROTATEQ

WAS BASED ON DATA FROM THE COMPANYS

PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS OF NEARLY 70,000 INFANTS,

INCLUDING DATA FROM THE ROTAVIRUS EFFICACY AND SAFETY TRIAL

(REST), ONE OF THE LARGEST PRE-LICENSURE VACCINE

CLINICAL TRIALS EVER CONDUCTED. IN THESE CLINICAL TRIALS,

ROTATEQ

PREVENTED 98% OF SEVERE CASES OF ROTAVIRUS

GASTROENTERITIS AND PREVENTED 74% OF ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS

CASES OF ANY SEVERITY CAUSED BY SEROTYPES TARGETED BY THE

VACCINE (G1, G2, G3, G4) COMPARED TO PLACEBO THROUGH THE FIRST

FULL

52

ROTAVIRUS SEASON AFTER VACCINATION.

ROTATEQ

ALSO REDUCED

HOSPITALIZATIONS BY 96% AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS BY 94% FOR

ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS CAUSED BY SEROTYPES TARGETED BY THE

VACCINE THROUGH THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER THE THIRD DOSE.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE CDCS ACIP UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO

RECOMMEND THAT ALL INFANTS, STARTING AT 6 TO 12 WEEKS OF

AGE BE VACCINATED WITH

ROTATEQ

, NOW THE ONLY ROTAVIRUS

VACCINE AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ACIP RECOMMENDED

THAT THE ORAL, READY-TO USE VACCINE BE GIVEN DURING THE CURRENT

ROUTINE WELL-BABY VISITS AT 2, 4, AND 6 MONTHS OF AGE.

IN APRIL,

ROTATEQ

WAS MADE AVAILABLE IN THE CDC VACCINES

FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM.

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, AS OF FEBRUARY 6, 2007, HEALTH

INSURANCE PLANS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 90% OF COVERED LIVES

IN THE ELIGIBLE AGE GROUP OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN BETWEEN

SIX AND 32 WEEKS OF AGE HAVE ADDED

ROTATEQ

TO THEIR

FORMULARIES.

ROTATEQ

HAS BEEN APPROVED IN 34 COUNTRIES

AND APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE HAVE BEEN FILED IN MORE THAN 100

COUNTRIES. IN NICARAGUA, WHERE

ROTATEQ

WAS APPROVED IN

2006, THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE THE VACCINE FREE OF CHARGE FOR

ALL INFANTS BORN IN THE COUNTRY OVER A

THREE-YEAR

PERIOD COMMENCING IN OCTOBER 2006, THROUGH A JOINT DEMONSTRATION

PROJECT WITH THE NICARAGUAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH. IN 2006,

ROTATEQ

SALES RECORDED BY MERCK WERE $163.4 MILLION.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, MERCK UPDATED THE LABELING INFORMATION FOR

ROTATEQ

TO INCLUDE POST-MARKETING REPORTS OF

INTUSSUSCEPTION AND HEMATOCHEZIA TO THE VACCINE ADVERSE EVENTS

REPORTING SYSTEM (VAERS), A NATIONAL VACCINE SAFETY

SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FDA REPORTED THAT

SINCE THE LICENSURE OF

ROTATEQ

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2006

UNTIL JANUARY 31, 2007, 28 CASES OF INTUSSUSCEPTION IN

INFANTS WHO RECEIVED

ROTATEQ

HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE

UNITED STATES TO VAERS AND THAT THIS NUMBER DOES NOT EXCEED THE

NUMBER OF CASES EXPECTED BASED ON THE BACKGROUND RATE. REST WAS

SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO EVALUATE VACCINE SAFETY WITH RESPECT TO

INTUSSUSCEPTION. IN REST, THERE WAS NO INCREASED RISK OF

INTUSSUCEPTION WITH

ROTATEQ

, COMPARED TO PLACEBO.

IN MAY 2006, THE FDA APPROVED

ZOSTAVAX

, THE

COMPANYS VACCINE FOR PREVENTION OF HERPES ZOSTER

(SHINGLES) IN INDIVIDUALS 60 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. IT WAS

ALSO APPROVED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA

IN MAY.

ZOSTAVAX

IS THE FIRST AND ONLY MEDICAL OPTION

APPROVED FOR THE PREVENTION OF SHINGLES.

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE CDC ACIP VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO RECOMMEND

THAT ADULTS 60 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER BE VACCINATED WITH

ZOSTAVAX

TO HELP PREVENT SHINGLES. FOLLOWING THE ACIP

RECOMMENDATION, IN THE UNITED STATES, AS OF FEBRUARY 6,

2007, MANAGED CARE PLANS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 85% OF

COVERED LIVES ARE REIMBURSING FOR

ZOSTAVAX.

SALES OF

ZOSTAVAX

RECORDED BY MERCK IN 2006 WERE

$38.6 MILLION.

IN JUNE 2006, THE ACIP UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO RECOMMEND THAT

CHILDREN 4 TO 6 YEARS OF AGE ROUTINELY RECEIVE A SECOND

DOSE OF VARICELLA (CHICKENPOX)-CONTAINING VACCINE. MERCKS

VARIVAX

AND ITS COMBINATION VACCINE

PROQUAD

ARE

THE ONLY VACCINES TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST CHICKENPOX AVAILABLE

IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ACIP ALSO VOTED TO RECOMMEND THAT

CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS WHO PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED ONE

DOSE OF VARICELLA-CONTAINING VACCINE SHOULD RECEIVE A

CATCH-UP

SECOND DOSE. THE ACIP VOTED TO INCLUDE THE SECOND DOSE OF

CHICKENPOX VACCINE IN THE VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM.

MERCK HAS RECENTLY DETERMINED THAT THE BULK MANUFACTURING

PROCESS FOR THE COMPANYS VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS

(VZV)-CONTAINING

VACCINES WAS PRODUCING LOWER AMOUNTS OF BULK VZV INTERMEDIATE

THAN EXPECTED. THE VZV BULK IN QUESTION WAS DESIGNATED FOR USE

IN FULFILLING FUTURE QUANTITIES OF THE THREE VZV-CONTAINING

VACCINES 

VARIVAX, PROQUAD

AND

ZOSTAVAX

. AS A RESULT, PRODUCTION OF THE VZV BULK HAS

BEEN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED WHILE THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES THE

CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.

THIS SITUATION DOES NOT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF ANY OF

MERCKS

VZV-CONTAINING

VACCINES CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET, ANY LOTS OF VACCINE IN

INVENTORY THAT ARE READY FOR RELEASE TO THE MARKET OR ANY

VACCINES WHICH WILL BE  FILLED AND FINISHED FROM EXISTING VZV

BULK.

AS THE COMPANY WORKS TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, IT IS DECREASING THE

AVAILABILITY OF

PROQUAD

, WHILE INCREASING THE

AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPONENT VACCINES

VARIVAX

AND

M-M-R

II.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY WILL POSTPONE THE INTRODUCTIONS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF

PROQUAD

AND

ZOSTAVAX

UNTIL THE VZV BULK ISSUE IS RESOLVED.

BASED ON THIS APPROACH AND IN VIEW OF CURRENT PROJECTIONS, THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS TO MEET ANTICIPATED MARKET DEMAND FOR

VZV-CONTAINING

VACCINES.

53

COSTS,

EXPENSES AND OTHER

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

ON JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT

NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R) (SEE NOTE 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FAS 123R REQUIRES ALL

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES BE EXPENSED OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS.

PRIOR TO ADOPTING FAS 123R, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD WHICH

MEASURES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT EXCEEDS THE

EXERCISE PRICE. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE

TRANSITION METHOD FOR ADOPTING FAS 123R, AND THEREFORE,

PRIOR PERIODS WERE NOT RESTATED. UNDER THIS METHOD, THE

PROVISIONS OF FAS 123R APPLY TO ALL AWARDS GRANTED OR

MODIFIED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006. TOTAL PRE-TAX SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS $312.5 MILLION IN 2006,

$48.0 MILLION IN 2005 AND $25.7 MILLION IN 2004.

INCREMENTAL PRE-TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF

FAS 123R WAS $227.8 MILLION IN 2006. IN ADDITION, THE

UNRECOGNIZED EXPENSE OF AWARDS THAT HAVE NOT YET VESTED AT THE

DATE OF ADOPTION SHALL BE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME IN THE

PERIODS AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THERE WAS $273.8 MILLION OF TOTAL PRE-TAX UNRECOGNIZED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO NONVESTED STOCK OPTION,

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AND PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARDS WHICH

WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF

2.0 YEARS. FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSE.

MATERIALS

AND PRODUCTION

IN 2006, MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS INCREASED 17%, COMPARED

TO A 3% INCREASE IN SALES. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO $736.4 MILLION RECORDED IN 2006 RELATED TO

THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM COMPARED WITH

$177.1 MILLION RECORDED IN 2005. OF THE AMOUNT RECORDED IN

2006, $707.3 MILLION REPRESENTS ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLANNED SALE OR CLOSURE OF FIVE OF THE

COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE REMAINING

$29.1 MILLION REPRESENTS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH

THE ABANDONMENT OF CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS THAT WILL NO LONGER BE

USED IN THE BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS.

MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS IN 2006 ALSO INCLUDE STOCK OPTION

EXPENSE OF $23.8 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, MATERIALS AND

PRODUCTION COSTS INCLUDED A 1% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM INFLATION

IN 2006.

IN 2005, MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS INCREASED 4%, COMPARED

TO A 4% DECLINE IN SALES. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE

TO $177.1 MILLION RECORDED IN 2005 RELATED TO THE GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. OF THIS, $111.2 MILLION REPRESENTS

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABANDONMENT OF CERTAIN

FIXED ASSETS THAT WILL NO LONGER BE USED IN THE BUSINESS AS A

RESULT OF THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. THE REMAINING

$65.9 MILLION REPRESENTS ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION

ASSOCIATED WITH MERCKS PLAN TO SELL OR CLOSE FIVE OF ITS

OWNED MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, 1% OF THE INCREASE

IN MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS IN 2005 IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

UNFAVORABLE EFFECT FROM INFLATION. THE VARIANCE IN THESE COSTS

RELATIVE TO THE SALES DECLINE REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE ITEMS

NOTED ABOVE, AS WELL AS THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON SALES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUNTARY WORLDWIDE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

IN 2004.

GROSS MARGIN WAS 73.5% IN 2006 COMPARED TO 76.6% IN 2005 AND

78.4% IN 2004. THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES NOTED ABOVE HAD AN

UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF 3.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2006 AND

0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2005. IN ADDITION, IN 2006,

ZOCOR

LOST U.S. MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY WHICH

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE GROSS MARGIN. THE IMPACT OF THE

VOLUNTARY WORLDWIDE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

HAD AN

UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON THE GROSS MARGIN IN 2004.

54

MARKETING

AND ADMINISTRATIVE

IN 2006, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 14%,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING $673 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL RESERVES

SOLELY FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR

VIOXX

LITIGATION (SEE

NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) AS WELL

AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAUNCHES OF THREE NEW VACCINES AND

OTHER NEW PRODUCTS, MAINLY

IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2006, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDED A

$48 MILLION CHARGE TO ESTABLISH A LEGAL DEFENSE RESERVE FOR

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION (SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), AS WELL AS STOCK OPTION EXPENSE OF

$143.7 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES INCLUDED A 3% UNFAVORABLE EFFECT FROM INFLATION IN 2006.

IN 2005, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED 1%

PRIMARILY DUE TO COSTS RECORDED IN 2004 OF $141.4 MILLION

FOR THE VOLUNTARY WORLDWIDE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

AND

$604 MILLION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RESERVE SOLELY FOR

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS FOR

VIOXX

LITIGATION. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THE DECREASE WAS AN ADDITIONAL RESERVE OF

$295 MILLION FOR

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RECORDED

IN 2005, AS WELL AS COSTS REQUIRED TO PREPARE FOR THE LAUNCH OF

THREE NEW VACCINES. ADDITIONALLY, A 4% UNFAVORABLE EFFECT FROM

INFLATION AND A 1% UNFAVORABLE EFFECT FROM EXCHANGE ALSO

PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECLINES.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED 24% IN 2006.

INCLUDED IN THE INCREASE IS A $466.2 MILLION ACQUIRED

RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO ACQUISITION OF SIRNA, AS WELL AS A

$296.3 MILLION ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RESULTING FROM THE

GLYCOFI ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE REFLECTS

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS OF $56.5 MILLION IN 2006

RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF RESEARCH FACILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH

THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, AS WELL AS STOCK OPTION

EXPENSE OF $55.5 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, A 2% UNFAVORABLE

EFFECT FROM INFLATION ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN 2006.

THE COMPANY HAS THREE DRUG CANDIDATES CURRENTLY UNDER FDA REVIEW.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW AN NDA FOR

MK-0517, THE INTRAVENOUS PRODRUG OF

EMEND,

FOR THE

TREATMENT OF CINV. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES A DECISION ON THE NDA

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007.

IN JULY 2006, THE FDA ACCEPTED FOR STANDARD REVIEW THE NDA FOR

JANUMET

, THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATIONAL ORAL MEDICINE

COMBINING

JANUVIA

WITH METFORMIN, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS NEEDING MORE THAN

ONE ORAL AGENT TO HELP CONTROL BLOOD SUGAR FOR TREATMENT OF TYPE

2 DIABETES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS FDA ACTION ON THE NDA BY THE END

OF MARCH 2007. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MOVING FORWARD AS PLANNED

WITH REGULATORY FILINGS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

ARCOXIA

, THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATIONAL SELECTIVE

COX-2 INHIBITOR, REMAINS UNDER STANDARD REVIEW BY THE FDA IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN RESPONSE TO THE FDAS APPROVABLE LETTER,

MERCK INCLUDED RESULTS OF THE MEDAL (MULTINATIONAL ETORICOXIB

AND DICLOFENAC ARTHRITIS LONG-TERM) PROGRAM THAT SHOWED THE RATE

OF CONFIRMED THROMBOTIC CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS WAS SIMILAR

BETWEEN

ARCOXIA

AND DICLOFENAC, THE MOST WIDELY USED

NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG IN THE WORLD. THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES FDA ACTION IN APRIL 2007. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT

AN FDA ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING WILL BE HELD PRIOR TO FDA

ACTION.

ARCOXIA

IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN MORE THAN 60

COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND

MIDDLE EAST/NORTHERN AFRICA.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FILING THREE NDAS WITH THE FDA IN 2007.

THE COMPANY PLANS TO FILE AN NDA FOR MK-0518 WITH THE FDA IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 AND HAS RECEIVED FAST TRACK DESIGNATION

FOR AN INDICATION IN TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS.

INTERIM 16-WEEK DATA FROM THE DOSE-RANGING PHASE II TRIAL

OF MK-0518, THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATIONAL HIV INTEGRASE

INHIBITOR, IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HIV INFECTION WERE

PRESENTED AT THE

13

TH

ANNUAL

CONFERENCE ON RETROVIRUSES AND OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN

FEBRUARY 2006. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ORAL INVESTIGATIONAL

MEDICATION AT ALL THREE DOSES STUDIED IN COMBINATION WITH

OPTIMIZED BACKGROUND THERAPY (OBT) HAD GREATER

ANTIRETROVIRAL ACTIVITY THAN OBT ALONE. STUDY RESULTS ALSO

SHOWED THAT MK-0518 IN COMBINATION WITH OBT WAS GENERALLY WELL

TOLERATED IN THESE PATIENTS WHO WERE FAILING ANTIRETROVIRAL

THERAPY (ART), WHO WERE RESISTANT TO AT LEAST ONE

DRUG OF EACH OF THE THREE AVAILABLE CLASSES OF ORAL ARTS, AND

WHO HAD LIMITED ACTIVE ARTS AS OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT. AT THE

AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGYS

46

TH

ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ANTIMICROBIAL

55

AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY PRESENTED

INTERIM 24-WEEK DATA FROM THIS ONGOING STUDY IN

TREATMENT-EXPERIENCED PATIENTS, WHICH DEMONSTRATED MK-0518

MAINTAINING VIRAL LOAD REGRESSION.

IN AUGUST 2006 AT THE

16

TH

INTERNATIONAL

AIDS CONFERENCE, THE COMPANY PRESENTED INTERIM

24-WEEK

DATA

FROM THE PHASE II DOSE-RANGING TRIAL OF MK-0518 CONDUCTED

IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE, HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS. THE DATA SHOWED

THAT MK-0518 TWICE DAILY, WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH

TENOFOVIR AND LAMIVUDINE, ACHIEVED A COMPARABLE VIRAL LOAD

REDUCTION TO EFAVIRENZ COMBINED WITH THE SAME AGENTS IN

PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED PATIENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2006 AT THE AMERICAN

SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGYS 46TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL

CONFERENCE ON ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY, THE COMPANY

PRESENTED ADDITIONAL INTERIM

24-WEEK

DATA

FROM THIS PHASE II DOSE-RANGING STUDY IN

TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS THAT DEMONSTRATED NO INCREASE IN

LIPID LEVELS IN PATIENTS TAKING MK-0518 WITH TENOFOVIR AND

LAMIVUDINE.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS WITH

MK-0524A AND TO SUPPORT MK-0524B, INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPIES FOR

LIPID MANAGEMENT. MK-0524A REPRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH TO

LOWERING LDL-C, RAISING HDL-C AND LOWERING TRIGLYCERIDES.

MK-0524B COMBINES MK-0524A WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF

SIMVASTATIN TO POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE RISK OF CORONARY HEART

DISEASE BEYOND WHAT STATINS PROVIDE ALONE. THE COMPANY PLANS TO

FILE MK-0524A WITH THE FDA IN 2007 AND TO FILE MK-0524B IN 2008.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY PRESENTED DATA FROM A

PHASE II STUDY AT THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATIONS

SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS 2006 IN CHICAGO THAT SHOWED

CO-ADMINISTRATION OF MK-0524 WITH ER NIACIN SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCED FLUSHING IN PATIENTS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIA COMPARED TO THOSE

PATIENTS WHO TOOK ER NIACIN ALONE. FLUSHING, CHARACTERIZED BY

REDNESS OF THE SKIN WITH WARMING OR BURNING ON THE FACE AND NECK

CAUSED BY THE DILATION OF BLOOD VESSELS NEAR THE SKIN, IS A

COMMON NIACIN-INDUCED SIDE EFFECT THAT CAN CAUSE DISCOMFORT TO

PATIENTS AND IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION

OF NIACIN THERAPY.

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE COMPANY AND H. LUNDBECK A/S OF DENMARK

ANNOUNCED THAT THE SUBMISSION OF AN NDA FOR GABOXADOL, A NOVEL

INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG IN PHASE III DEVELOPMENT FOR THE

TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA, WILL OCCUR IN MID-2007. PHASE II

CLINICAL STUDIES OF GABOXADOL SHOWED IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY AS

WELL AS INCREASED SLOW-WAVE SLEEP WITHOUT SUPPRESSING REM SLEEP.

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK ANNOUNCED THAT GABOXADOL WILL LIKELY BE

A SCHEDULED COMPOUND.

ALSO, BY MID-YEAR 2007, MERCK EXPECTS TO HAVE FOUR PRODUCTS IN

PHASE III DEVELOPMENT (INCLUDING

MK-0524B

DISCUSSED ABOVE).

THE COMPANY HAS INITIATED A TARGETED PHASE III PROGRAM WITH

ITS INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY,

MK-0364, WHICH IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR

INVERSE AGONIST. RESULTS OF EARLY CLINICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT

MK-0364 DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT-LOSS EFFICACY VERSUS

PLACEBO AND WAS GENERALLY SAFE AND WELL-TOLERATED, HOWEVER, AS

REPORTED WITH ANOTHER CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR INVERSE AGONIST,

SOME PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED.

AS ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY PLANS TO START

PHASE III TESTING OF MK-0974, THE CALCITONIN GENE RELATED

PEPTIDE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST FOR THE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE

HEADACHES. THE PHASE III PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN

FIRST QUARTER 2007.

ALSO ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

MK-0822, A CATHEPSIN K INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF

OSTEOPOROSIS, WILL ENTER PHASE III TESTING IN MID-2007.

IN AUGUST 2006, MERCK AND GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.

(GILEAD) ESTABLISHED AN AGREEMENT FOR THE

DISTRIBUTION OF ATRIPLA, A ONCE-DAILY, SINGLE TABLET REGIMEN FOR

THE TREATMENT OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN ADULTS, IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. ATRIPLA CONTAINS 600 MG OF

EFAVIRENZ, A NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITOR,

200 MG OF EMTRICITABINE AND 300 MG OF TENOFOVIR

DISOPROXIL FUMARATE, BOTH NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE

INHIBITORS. EFAVIRENZ IS MARKETED BY MERCK UNDER THE TRADENAME

STOCRIN

IN ALL TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES,

CANADA AND CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (WHERE IT IS

COMMERCIALIZED BY BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB (BMS) UNDER

THE TRADENAME

SUSTIVA

). EMTRICITABINE AND TENOFOVIR

DISOPROXIL FUMARATE ARE COMMERCIALIZED BY GILEAD UNDER THE

TRADENAMES EMTRIVA AND VIREAD, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPOUNDS ARE

COMMONLY PRESCRIBED TOGETHER AS A ONCE-DAILY, FIXED-DOSE TABLET,

MARKETED UNDER THE TRADENAME TRUVADA FOR USE AS PART OF

COMBINATION THERAPY.

56

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE COMPANY ALONG WITH BMS AND GILEAD ANNOUNCED

THE SUBMISSION OF A MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATION

(MAA) FOR ATRIPLA IN THE EU TO THE EMEA. THE MAA

WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE CHMP, SUBJECT TO VALIDATION BY THE EMEA.

THE MAA FOR ATRIPLA IN THE EU WAS FILED JOINTLY BY THE THREE

COMPANIES THROUGH A NEWLY ESTABLISHED THREE-WAY COLLABORATION

BASED IN IRELAND. REVIEW OF THE MAA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE

EMEA UNDER THE CENTRALIZED LICENSING PROCEDURE, WHICH, WHEN

FINALIZED, PROVIDES ONE MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN ALL MEMBER

STATES OF THE EU. DISCUSSIONS AMONG THE THREE COMPANIES

REGARDING AGREEMENTS FOR MANUFACTURING, COMMERCIALIZATION AND

DISTRIBUTION OF ATRIPLA IN THE EU ARE ONGOING.

MERCK CONTINUES TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON AUGMENTING ITS INTERNAL

EFFORTS BY CAPITALIZING ON GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, RANGING FROM

TARGETED ACQUISITIONS TO RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, PRECLINICAL

AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS THAT WILL

DRIVE BOTH NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. THE COMPANY COMPLETED 53

TRANSACTIONS IN 2006 ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC

CATEGORIES, AS WELL AS EARLYSTAGE TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTIONS.

MERCK IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES, AND IS

ACTIVELY MONITORING THE LANDSCAPE FOR A RANGE OF TARGETED

POTENTIALLY RECEIVE MILESTONE PAYMENTS OF $74.5 MILLION FOR

EACH TARGET INCLUDED IN THE COLLABORATION. THE COLLABORATION

WILL BEGIN WITH TWO TARGET PROGRAMS, AND COULD EXPAND TO INCLUDE

OTHERS OVER TIME.

IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA, A

PUBLICLY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS A LEADER IN

DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES BASED ON RNAI TECHNOLOGY,

WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE

OF $466.2 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH

SIRNAS COMPOUNDS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, FOR WHICH,

AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN

ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED (SEE

ACQUISITIONS ABOVE).

ADDITIONALLY IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK AND IDERA PHARMACEUTICALS

(IDERA) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD FORMED A BROAD

COLLABORATION TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

IDERAS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR) AGONISTS.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL RECEIVE WORLDWIDE

EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO A NUMBER OF IDERAS AGONIST COMPOUNDS

COLLABORATION. IDERA IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE MILESTONE PAYMENTS

OF UP TO $165 MILLION IF VACCINES ARE SUCCESSFULLY

DEVELOPED IN EACH OF THE THREE FIELDS. ADDITIONAL MILESTONES OF

UP TO $260 MILLION WOULD BE PAYABLE FOR FOLLOW-ON

INDICATIONS IN THE ONCOLOGY FIELD AND THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT

OF ADDITIONAL VACCINES CONTAINING IDERAS TLR AGONISTS.

THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF VACCINES TO WHICH MERCK CAN

APPLY IDERAS AGONISTS WITHIN THE LICENSED FIELDS. IN

ADDITION, IDERA WILL RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON PRODUCTS

COMMERCIALIZED UNDER THE COLLABORATION.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM EXPLORATORY AND

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY AS WELL

AS RESEARCH PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY

DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL MEDICINES TO

ADDRESS LARGE, UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. MERCKS NEW EFFORTS TO

IMPROVE DRUG DISCOVERY INVOLVE FOCUSING ON NINE PRIORITY DISEASE

AREAS, AS WELL AS UTILIZING NEW RESEARCH TECHNOLOGIES, BUILDING

ALLIANCES WITH EXTERNAL PARTNERS AND MAKING TARGETED

ACQUISITIONS WHICH WILL COMPLEMENT THE COMPANYS STRONG

INTERNAL RESEARCH CAPABILITIES. THE PREVIOUS ANNOUNCED NINE

PRIORITY DISEASE AREAS ARE: ALZHEIMERS DISEASE;

ATHEROSCLEROSIS; CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE; DIABETES; NOVEL

VACCINES; OBESITY; ONCOLOGY (TARGETED THERAPIES); PAIN; AND

SLEEP DISORDERS. THESE THERAPEUTIC AREAS WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN

BASED ON A SET OF CRITERIA INCLUDING UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS,

SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. A CHART

REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CURRENT RESEARCH PIPELINE AS OF

FEBRUARY 15, 2007 IS SET FORTH IN ITEM 1.

BUSINESS ABOVE.

58

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED 4% IN 2005. INCLUDED

IN 2005 ARE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS OF

$121.8 MILLION RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF RESEARCH

FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE REFLECTS THE 2004 IMPACT

OF $225.0 MILLION OF LICENSING EXPENSE FOR THE INITIAL

PAYMENTS FOR CERTAIN DISCLOSED RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AND

$125.5 MILLION OF ACQUIRED RESEARCH EXPENSE FROM THE

ACQUISITION OF ATON PHARMA, INC. IN 2004. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THE DECREASE IS AN 8% INCREASE IN OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES SUPPORTING MERCKS PIPELINE, AS WELL AS A 2%

UNFAVORABLE EFFECT FROM INFLATION.

RESTRUCTURING

COSTS

RESTRUCTURING COSTS WERE $142.3 MILLION AND

$322.2 MILLION FOR 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN

RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE SEPARATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

MERCKS PLAN TO ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,000 POSITIONS BY

THE END OF 2008. IN 2006 AND 2005, MERCK INCURRED

$113.7 MILLION AND $182.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN

SEPARATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AS

WELL AS HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS THAT WERE PROBABLE AND COULD BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED RELATED TO THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM. THE COMPANY ELIMINATED 3,700 POSITIONS IN 2006 AND

1,100 POSITIONS IN 2005 (WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT

POSITIONS). ALSO, IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED

$116.8 MILLION FOR SEPARATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN

UNALLOCATED EXPENSE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

EQUITY

INCOME FROM AFFILIATES

EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES REFLECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANYS JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS. IN 2006 AND

2005, THE INCREASE IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES REFLECTS THE

SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

THROUGH THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP. THE GROWTH IN

2005 IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER PARTNERSHIP RETURNS FROM

AZLP. SEE SELECTED JOINT VENTURE AND AFFILIATE

INFORMATION BELOW.

OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

THE INCREASE IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, IN 2006 REFLECTS AN

INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME GENERATED FROM THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DERIVED FROM HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND

HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BALANCES. THE DECREASE IN

OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, IN 2005 PRIMARILY REFLECTS A

$176.8 MILLION GAIN IN 2004 FROM THE SALE OF THE

COMPANYS 50% EQUITY STAKE IN ITS EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE

WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON, AS WELL AS REALIZED GAINS ON

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RECORDED IN 2004.

SEGMENT PROFITS ARE COMPRISED OF SEGMENT REVENUES LESS CERTAIN

ELEMENTS OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS AND OPERATING

EXPENSES, INCLUDING COMPONENTS OF EQUITY INCOME (LOSS) FROM

AFFILIATES AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES. FOR

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING PRESENTED TO THE CHIEF OPERATING

DECISION MAKER, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOCATE THE VAST MAJORITY

OF INDIRECT PRODUCTION COSTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS WELL AS THE COST OF

FINANCING THESE ACTIVITIES. SEPARATE DIVISIONS MAINTAIN

RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING AND MANAGING THESE COSTS,

INCLUDING DEPRECIATION RELATED TO FIXED ASSETS UTILIZED BY THESE

DIVISIONS AND, THEREFORE, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN SEGMENT

PROFITS. ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE DETERMINATION OF SEGMENT PROFITS

ARE TAXES PAID AT THE JOINT VENTURE LEVEL AND A PORTION OF

EQUITY INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, SEGMENT PROFITS DO NOT REFLECT

OTHER EXPENSES FROM CORPORATE AND MANUFACTURING COST CENTERS AND

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME (EXPENSE). THESE UNALLOCATED ITEMS

ARE REFLECTED IN OTHER IN THE ABOVE TABLE. ALSO

INCLUDED IN OTHER ARE MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE PROFITS, OPERATING

PROFITS RELATED TO DIVESTED PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES, OTHER SUPPLY

SALES AND ADJUSTMENTS TO ELIMINATE THE EFFECT OF DOUBLE COUNTING

CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE.

59

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT PROFITS INCREASED 4% IN 2006 COMPARED

WITH 2005 REFLECTING HIGHER EQUITY INCOME, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH PARTNERSHIP,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSS OF U.S. MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY

FOR

ZOCOR

AND

PROSCAR.

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT

PROFITS DECLINED 3% IN 2005 PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE VOLUNTARY

WORLDWIDE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX.

VACCINES SEGMENT PROFITS INCREASED 16% IN 2006 DRIVEN BY THE

LAUNCH OF THREE NEW VACCINES AND THE SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF

IN-LINE VACCINES. VACCINES SEGMENT PROFITS DECLINED 13% IN 2005

PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS REQUIRED TO PREPARE FOR THE LAUNCHES OF THREE NEW

VACCINES. VACCINES SEGMENT PROFITS ALSO REFLECT EQUITY INCOME

FROM SPMSD.

TAXES ON

INCOME

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 28.7% IN 2006,

37.1% IN 2005 AND 27.1% IN 2004. THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

IN 2005 REFLECTS AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF 9.1 PERCENTAGE

POINTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DECISION TO

REPATRIATE $15.9 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (AJCA).

THE 2006 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF

3.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS RELATED TO THE NON-DEDUCTIBLE

ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ACQUISITIONS OF SIRNA AND GLYCOFI. THE TAX RATE IN ALL THREE

YEARS WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

COMPARED TO A DECLINE OF 20% IN 2005. THESE DECLINES PRIMARILY

REFLECT THE IMPACT OF ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGES, HIGHER

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, INCREASED RESERVES FOR LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS AND THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS.

THESE INCREASED COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN EQUITY

INCOME FROM AFFILIATES IN 2006 AND THE 2005 NET TAX CHARGE

ASSOCIATED WITH REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE AJCA. NET INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 19.6% IN

2006, 21.0% IN 2005 AND 25.4% IN 2004. THE DECREASE IN THE

PERCENTAGE OF SALES RATIO IN 2006 AS COMPARED TO 2005 REFLECTS

THE SAME FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE. NET INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF

AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS WAS 9.9% IN 2006, 10.6% IN 2005 AND 14.0%

IN 2004.

CAPABILITIES, OPPORTUNITIES AND ASSETS, IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE

COMPANY FORMED A NUMBER OF JOINT VENTURES. (SEE NOTE 9 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PARTNERSHIP

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) (COLLECTIVELY, THE

PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE

EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED

STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT

AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY

PROVIDE FOR EQUAL SHARING OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND FOR

CO-PROMOTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS BY EACH COMPANY. IN 2001, THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO

INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN

2002, EZETIMIBE, THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES

AS

ZETIA

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES). IN JULY 2004, A COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

WAS

APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES AS

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES).

60

THE CHOLESTEROL AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE SHARING OF OPERATING

INCOME GENERATED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL

PARTNERSHIP (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP) BASED UPON

PERCENTAGES THAT VARY BY PRODUCT, SALES LEVEL AND COUNTRY. IN

THE U.S. MARKET, THE PARTNERS SHARE PROFITS ON

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

SALES EQUALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

FIRST $300 MILLION OF ANNUAL

ZETIA

SALES, ON WHICH

SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVES A GREATER SHARE OF PROFITS. OPERATING

INCOME INCLUDES EXPENSES THAT THE PARTNERS HAVE CONTRACTUALLY

AGREED TO SHARE, SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANUFACTURING COSTS,

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED PROMOTION COSTS (INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

ADVERTISING AND DIRECT AND IDENTIFIABLE

OUT-OF-POCKET

PROMOTION) AND OTHER AGREED UPON COSTS FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES

SUCH AS ON-GOING CLINICAL RESEARCH, MARKET SUPPORT, MARKET

RESEARCH, MARKET EXPANSION, AS WELL AS A SPECIALTY SALES FORCE

AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUPPORT

OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP BUT NOT SHARED BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, SUCH

AS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (INCLUDING CERTAIN

SALES FORCE COSTS), AS WELL AS CERTAIN MANUFACTURING COSTS, ARE

NOT INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES. HOWEVER, THESE

COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY SHARED

EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR EARNED MILESTONES.

IN JUNE 2006, THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED NEW DATA FROM TWO

CLINICAL TRIALS. DATA PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM

ON ATHEROSCLEROSIS MEETING SHOWED THAT

VYTORIN

WAS

SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CRESTOR IN REDUCING LDL

CHOLESTEROL ACROSS ALL STUDY DOSE COMPARISONS AND AN ANALYSIS OF

THE DATA SHOWED THAT, WHEN AVERAGED ACROSS ALL STUDY DOSES,

VYTORIN

THAT AT THE RECOMMENDED USUAL STARTING DOSES,

VYTORIN

WAS

SUPERIOR TO LIPITOR IN THE LOWERING OF LDL CHOLESTEROL IN

PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL. THESE DATA

WERE ALSO PUBLISHED IN THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUE OF

MAYO CLINIC

PROCEEDINGS.

THE RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE MSP

PARTNERSHIP ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES. MERCK

RECOGNIZED EQUITY INCOME OF $1,218.6 MILLION IN 2006,

$570.4 MILLION IN 2005 AND $132.0 MILLION IN 2004.

ASTRAZENECA

LP

IN 1982, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRA PRODUCTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN 1994, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA FORMED AN

EQUALLY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE THAT DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF

ASTRAS NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDING

PRILOSEC

, THE FIRST IN A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS

KNOWN AS PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF

ACID FROM THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY AND ASTRA RESTRUCTURED THE JOINT VENTURE

WHEREBY THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN THE JOINT

VENTURE, RENAMED KBI INC. (KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED

KBIS OPERATING ASSETS TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP NAMED ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS, L.P. (THE

PARTNERSHIP), IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A

LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP, RENAMED ASTRAZENECA

LP (AZLP), BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE

PRODUCTS FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS.

MERCK EARNS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE

KBI PRODUCTS AND SUCH REVENUE WAS $1.8 BILLION,

$1.7 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

IN ADDITION, MERCK EARNS CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP

RETURNS, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES.

SUCH RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, VARIABLE RETURNS BASED, IN

61

PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS, AND

A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING MERCKS SHARE OF

UNDISTRIBUTED AZLP GAAP EARNINGS. THESE RETURNS AGGREGATED

$783.7 MILLION, $833.5 MILLION AND $646.5 MILLION

IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

MERIAL

LIMITED

IN 1997, MERCK AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW SANOFI-AVENTIS

S.A.) COMBINED THEIR ANIMAL HEALTH AND POULTRY GENETICS

BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A

FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE

JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A

COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE

THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL

SPECIES.

SANOFI

PASTEUR MSD

IN 1994, MERCK AND PASTEUR MERIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW SANOFI PASTEUR

S.A.) ESTABLISHED A 50% OWNED JOINT VENTURE TO MARKET VACCINES

IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMBINATION

VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN EUROPE.

IN 2006, MERCK LAUNCHED THREE NEW VACCINES THAT HAVE BEEN

APPROVED FOR USE IN THE EU AND WILL BE MARKETED BY SPMSD IN

CERTAIN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

GARDASIL

FOR THE

PREVENTION OF CERVICAL CANCER AND GENITAL WARTS CAUSED BY

CERTAIN TYPES OF HPV;

ROTATEQ

TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST

ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN; AND

ZOSTAVAX

TO HELP PREVENT SHINGLES (HERPES ZOSTER) IN

INDIVIDUALS 60 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, SPMSD ENTERED INTO A LETTER OF UNDERTAKING

(LOU), WITH THE EMEA DUE TO AGENCY CONCERNS

REGARDING THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE HEPATITIS B COMPONENT OF

HEXAVAC.

THE HEPATITIS B COMPONENT OF

HEXAVAC

IS

MANUFACTURED BY MERCK. THE LOU REQUIRES, IN RELEVANT PART

(1) SUSPENSION OF THE EU

HEXAVAC

LICENSE;

(2) SUSPENSION OF

HEXAVAC

DISTRIBUTION; (3) A

RECALL OF

HEXAVAC

PRODUCT IN THE EU; (4) A RECALL OF

HEXAVAC

IN A NUMBER OF NON-EU COUNTRIES; AND (5) A

SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM AND POSSIBLE FUTURE REVACCINATION. SPMSD,

WHICH MARKETS AND SELLS

HEXAVAC

IN PART OF THE EU, HAS

NOTIFIED MERCK THAT IT IS RESERVING ANY RIGHTS THAT IT MAY HAVE

TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM MERCK AND TO BE DEFENDED, INDEMNIFIED AND

HELD HARMLESS BY MERCK IN THE EVENT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE EMEA INITIATED A FORMAL REVIEW OF THE

LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE HEPATITIS B VACCINE,

HBVAXPRO

,

AND OF THE HEPATITIS B COMPONENT OF THE HEPATITIS B/HIB

COMBINATION VACCINE,

PROCOMVAX.

BOTH PRODUCTS ARE

MARKETED AND SOLD BY SPMSD IN ITS EUROPEAN TERRITORY, AND ARE

SOLD ELSEWHERE, UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES, BY MERCK. AFTER EXTENSIVE

REVIEW, THE EMEA DETERMINED IN MAY 2006 THAT EACH VACCINE

CONTINUES TO OFFER EFFECTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST HEPATITIS B AND

ALLOWED SPMSD TO CONTINUE MARKETING EACH PRODUCT WITH MINOR

LABEL CHANGES.

WERE $714.7 MILLION IN 2006 AND $938.7 MILLION IN

2005. EXPENDITURES DURING 2006 INCLUDED $334.8 MILLION FOR

PRODUCTION FACILITIES, $314.6 MILLION FOR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES, $7.9 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

PROJECTS, AND $322.9 MILLION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, SAFETY AND

GENERAL SITE PROJECTS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2007 ARE

ESTIMATED TO BE $1.2 BILLION.

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE WAS $2.1 BILLION IN 2006 AND

$1.5 BILLION IN 2005, OF WHICH $1.5 BILLION AND

$1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, APPLIED TO LOCATIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES. TOTAL DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IN 2006 AND 2005

INCLUDES ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF $763.8 MILLION AND

$84.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PLAN. ADDITIONALLY, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR 2005

REFLECTS $103.1 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE

TERLINGS PARK BASIC RESEARCH CENTER (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

ANALYSIS

OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

MERCKS STRONG FINANCIAL PROFILE ENABLES THE COMPANY TO

FULLY FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, FOCUS ON EXTERNAL

ALLIANCES, SUPPORT IN-LINE PRODUCTS AND MAXIMIZE UPCOMING

LAUNCHES WHILE PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT CASH RETURNS TO

SHAREHOLDERS. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WAS

$6.8 BILLION IN 2006, CONTINUES TO BE THE COMPANYS

PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS TO FINANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

TREASURY STOCK PURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE TOTAL OF WORLDWIDE CASH AND

INVESTMENTS WAS $16.5 BILLION, INCLUDING $8.7 BILLION

OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND

$7.8 BILLION OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIFTING ITS MIX OF INVESTMENTS

FROM SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF

WORKING CAPITAL IN LINE WITH HISTORICAL LEVELS RELATIVE TO THE

LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN 2005, TO ENABLE EXECUTION OF

THE AJCA REPATRIATION, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS MIX OF

INVESTMENTS FROM LONG-TERM TO SHORT-TERM, RESULTING IN A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005. THE AJCA CREATED TEMPORARY INCENTIVES THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2005 FOR U.S. MULTINATIONALS TO

REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

AJCA, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED $15.9 BILLION DURING 2005. AS

A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCOME TAX CHARGE OF

$766.5 MILLION IN TAXES ON INCOME IN 2005 RELATED TO THIS

REPATRIATION, $185 MILLION OF WHICH WAS PAID IN 2005 AND

THE REMAINDER OF WHICH WAS PAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION OF

THE AJCA REPATRIATION WAS INVESTED IN FULLY COLLATERALIZED

OVERNIGHT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND WAS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. IN EARLY 2006,

THE COMPANY BEGAN REINVESTING ITS REPURCHASE AGREEMENT BALANCES

INTO OTHER SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. WORKING CAPITAL

LEVELS ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET THE OPERATING REQUIREMENTS

OF THE COMPANY. THE RATIOS OF TOTAL DEBT TO TOTAL LIABILITIES

AND EQUITY AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS TO TOTAL DEBT REFLECT

THE STRENGTH OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND THE

ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO COVER ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

(IRS) HAS BEEN EXAMINING THE COMPANYS TAX

RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1993 TO 2001 AND HAD ISSUED NOTICES OF

DEFICIENCY WITH RESPECT TO A PARTNERSHIP TRANSACTION ENTERED

INTO IN 1993, AND TWO MINORITY INTEREST EQUITY FINANCINGS

ENTERED INTO IN 1995 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE IRS HAS

RECENTLY CONCLUDED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE YEARS

1993-2001

AND WILL ISSUE A FINAL REVENUE AGENTS REPORT IN THE FIRST

QUARTER. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2007, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

CLOSING AGREEMENTS WITH THE IRS COVERING SEVERAL SPECIFIC ITEMS,

INCLUDING THE 1993 PARTNERSHIP TRANSACTION AND THE 1995 AND 2000

MINORITY INTEREST EQUITY FINANCINGS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

CLOSING AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF

APPROXIMATELY $2.85 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

THIS PAYMENT WILL BE OFFSET DURING 2007 BY (I) A TAX REFUND

OF $150 MILLION FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID RELATED TO

THESE MATTERS AND (II) A $400 MILLION FEDERAL TAX

BENEFIT RELATED TO INTEREST INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT, RESULTING

IN A NET CASH COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION. THE COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED

RESERVES FOR THESE MATTERS AND WHILE THE CONCLUSION OF THE IRS

EXAMINATION, INCLUDING THE CLOSING AGREEMENTS, DOES NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CASH FLOW FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2007 WHEN THE PAYMENT IS MADE. THE IMPACT FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT

TO 2001 OF THE PARTNERSHIP TRANSACTION AND THE MINORITY INTEREST

EQUITY FINANCINGS IS INCLUDED IN THE CLOSING AGREEMENTS ALTHOUGH

THOSE YEARS REMAIN OPEN IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, DURING OCTOBER 2006 THE COMPANY

RECEIVED A NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT FROM THE CANADA REVENUE AGENCY

(CRA) CONTAINING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS WHICH RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TAXES

DUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS

INTEREST OF $360 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) (SEE

NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE

COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE CRA AND

BELIEVES THEY ARE WITHOUT MERIT. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTEST

THE REASSESSMENT THROUGH THE CRA APPEALS PROCESS AND THE COURTS

IF NECESSARY. IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS, IN THE

NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO POST A

DEPOSIT OF UP TO ONE HALF OF THE TAX AND INTEREST ASSESSED.

DURING JANUARY 2007, THE COMPANY PLEDGED COLLATERAL CONSISTING

OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $802 MILLION TO A FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION WHICH PROVIDED A LETTER OF GUARANTEE TO THE CRA.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH AN ADJUSTMENT

IS RECORDED OR THE TAX IS DUE.

PAYMENTS CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE EVENTS. LOANS PAYABLE AND

CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDES $500.0 MILLION

OF NOTES WHICH WERE REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY IN FEBRUARY 2007,

UPON NOTIFICATION FROM THE REMARKETING AGENT THAT, DUE TO AN

OVERALL RISE IN INTEREST RATES, IT WOULD NOT EXERCISE ITS ANNUAL

OPTION TO REMARKET THE NOTES. LOANS PAYABLE AND CURRENT PORTION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT ALSO REFLECTS $336.2 MILLION OF

LONG-DATED NOTES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REPAYMENT AT THE OPTION OF

THE HOLDERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. REQUIRED FUNDING OBLIGATIONS FOR

2007 RELATING TO THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE CAPACITY OF ITS

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) TO ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES

BY AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE

COMPANY ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF 4.75% TEN-YEAR NOTES UNDER

THE SHELF. IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ISSUED

$500 MILLION OF 5.75% TWENTY-YEAR NOTES AND

$250 MILLION OF 5.125% FIVE-YEAR NOTES UNDER THE SHELF. THE

REMAINING CAPACITY UNDER THE COMPANYS SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT IS APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION.

IN APRIL 2006, THE COMPANY EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF ITS

$1.5 BILLION, FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FROM

FEBRUARY 2010 TO APRIL 2011. THE FACILITY PROVIDES BACKUP

LIQUIDITY FOR THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING

FACILITY AND IS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANY HAS

NOT DRAWN FUNDING FROM THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY

MOODYS AND STANDARD & POORS ARE AA3 AND

AA-, RESPECTIVELY, EACH WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK. THESE RATINGS

CONTINUE TO ALLOW ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND FLEXIBILITY

IN OBTAINING FUNDS ON COMPETITIVE TERMS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE FINANCIAL PROFILE. TOTAL CASH AND

INVESTMENTS OF $16.5 BILLION EXCEEDS THE SUM OF LOANS

PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT OF $6.8 BILLION. THE COMPANY

ALSO HAS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS THAT REMAIN AMONG THE TOP 4%

OF RATED NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS. DESPITE THIS STRONG

FINANCIAL PROFILE, CERTAIN CONTINGENT EVENTS, IF REALIZED, WHICH

ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING

UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT PROVIDE FINANCING OR

POTENTIALLY EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO UNRECORDED FINANCIAL

OBLIGATIONS.

IN JULY 2002, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED PURCHASES OVER

TIME OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF MERCK SHARES. TOTAL TREASURY

STOCK PURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN 2006 WAS

$1.0 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

$6.5 BILLION REMAINS UNDER THE 2002 STOCK REPURCHASE

AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY THE MERCK BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

WHILE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. MERCK RELIES ON SUSTAINED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM

FOREIGN SOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THE EXTENT

THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CASH FLOWS IS DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF A

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR, THE COMPANYS

65

ABILITY TO FUND RESEARCH AND OTHER DOLLAR-BASED STRATEGIC

INITIATIVES AT A CONSISTENT LEVEL MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY

HAS ESTABLISHED REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST VOLATILITY OF FUTURE

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR LONGER-TERM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TO DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, PRIMARILY

THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE

COMPANY WILL PARTIALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED THIRD-PARTY SALES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER ITS PLANNING CYCLE, TYPICALLY NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL LAYER IN

HEDGES OVER TIME, INCREASING THE PORTION OF SALES HEDGED AS IT

GETS CLOSER TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUCH THAT

IT IS PROBABLE THE HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. THE PORTION OF

SALES HEDGED IS BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF COST-BENEFIT PROFILES

THAT CONSIDER NATURAL OFFSETTING EXPOSURES, REVENUE AND EXCHANGE

RATE VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, AND THE COST OF HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS. THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES ARE A SPECIFIED

COMPONENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF SIMILARLY DENOMINATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY-BASED SALES TRANSACTIONS, EACH OF WHICH RESPONDS TO THE

HEDGED RISK IN THE SAME MANNER. MERCK MANAGES ITS ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY

PUT OPTIONS, WHICH PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A RIGHT, BUT NOT AN

OBLIGATION, TO SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT A

PREDETERMINED PRICE. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS

RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, TOTAL

CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS FULLY OFFSET THE DECLINE

IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED

FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENS, THE OPTIONS VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO, BUT THE

COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE

ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. WHILE A WEAKER

U.S. DOLLAR WOULD RESULT IN A NET BENEFIT, THE MARKET VALUE

OF THE COMPANYS HEDGES WOULD HAVE DECLINED BY

$38.7 MILLION AND $113.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FROM A

UNIFORM 10% WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. THE MARKET VALUE WAS DETERMINED

USING A FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION PRICING MODEL AND HOLDING ALL

FACTORS EXCEPT EXCHANGE RATES CONSTANT. BECAUSE MERCK

PRINCIPALLY USES PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS, A UNIFORM

WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL YIELD THE LARGEST OVERALL

POTENTIAL LOSS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS. THE

SENSITIVITY MEASUREMENT ASSUMES THAT A CHANGE IN ONE FOREIGN

CURRENCY RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WOULD NOT AFFECT OTHER

FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH

NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A 10%

THRESHOLD REFLECTS REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN

MERCKS MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF CASH FLOWS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS FROM THE EFFECTS OF

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEIR

CONVERSION TO U.S. DOLLARS. MERCK PRINCIPALLY UTILIZES

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO BUY AND

SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

AND ECONOMICALLY OFFSET THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS DERIVED

FROM THE NET ASSETS. MERCK ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS TO

FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES DENOMINATED IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRY CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE

YEN. FOR EXPOSURES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CURRENCIES, THE COMPANY

WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ON A MORE LIMITED BASIS AND

ONLY WHEN IT IS DEEMED ECONOMICAL TO DO SO BASED ON A

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

EXPOSURE, THE VOLATILITY OF THE EXCHANGE RATE AND THE COST OF

THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MINIMIZE THE

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE ON MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY

MANAGING OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND NET ASSET POSITIONS AT THE

LOCAL LEVEL. THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO CHANGES IN THE VALUE

OF THE U.S. DOLLAR ON FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

DERIVATIVES, INVESTMENTS AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

INDICATED THAT IF THE U.S. DOLLAR UNIFORMLY WEAKENED BY 10%

AGAINST ALL CURRENCY EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, INCOME BEFORE TAXES WOULD HAVE

DECLINED BY $32.7 MILLION AND $3.5 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE MERCK IS IN A NET SHORT POSITION RELATIVE

TO ITS MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES AFTER CONSIDERATION OF FORWARD

CONTRACTS, A UNIFORM WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL

YIELD THE LARGEST OVERALL POTENTIAL NET LOSS IN EARNINGS DUE TO

EXCHANGE. THIS MEASUREMENT ASSUMES THAT A CHANGE IN ONE FOREIGN

CURRENCY RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WOULD NOT AFFECT OTHER

FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH

NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A 10%

THRESHOLD REFLECTS REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN

MERCKS MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

IN ADDITION TO THE REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY MAY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONTRACTS ON CERTAIN INVESTING AND BORROWING TRANSACTIONS TO

MANAGE ITS NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND TO REDUCE

ITS OVERALL COST OF BORROWING. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE

LEVERAGED SWAPS AND, IN GENERAL, DOES NOT LEVERAGE ANY OF ITS

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD PUT PRINCIPAL CAPITAL AT RISK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY TO SEVEN

PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED RATE

NOTES. THERE IS ONE SWAP MATURING IN 2007 WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT

OF $350 MILLION; TWO SWAPS MATURING IN 2011 WITH NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF $125 MILLION EACH; ONE SWAP MATURING IN 2013

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION AND THREE SWAPS

MATURING IN 2015 WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $250 MILLION

EACH. THE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS

TO FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE

CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 INCLUDED REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, THE

MARKET VALUES OF WHICH ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES

IN INTEREST RATES. THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

MEDIUM- TO LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS IS MODESTLY IMPACTED

BY CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES. CHANGES IN MEDIUM- TO

LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE

BORROWINGS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE LONGER MATURITIES. A

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS, DEBT AND RELATED SWAP

CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE

PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005 WOULD HAVE POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE NET AGGREGATE

MARKET VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS BY $111.0 MILLION AND

$236.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 WOULD HAVE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE NET AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE BY

$171.0 MILLION AND $283.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE

DECREASED SENSITIVITY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF

INVESTMENTS FROM SHORT-TERM VARIABLE RATE AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 TO LONG-TERM FIXED RATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT WAS DETERMINED USING

PRICING MODELS REFLECTING ONE PERCENTAGE POINT SHIFTS IN THE

APPROPRIATE YIELD CURVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENTS WAS DETERMINED USING A COMBINATION OF PRICING AND

DURATION MODELS.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER MATTERS

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS

THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING SUCH ITEMS AS

PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, DEPRECIABLE AND

AMORTIZABLE LIVES, RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN

PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR

CONTINGENCIES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER RESERVES,

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS,

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ASSUMPTIONS, ACQUISITIONS AND TAXES ON

INCOME. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES,

ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. APPLICATION OF

THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES RESULT IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

REVENUES FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND

RISK OF LOSS PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. REVENUES FOR DOMESTIC

PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT,

WHILE FOR MANY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS FOR VACCINE

SALES, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ALSO REQUIRES REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF

COLLECTION OF SALES PROCEEDS AND COMPLETION OF ALL PERFORMANCE

OBLIGATIONS. DOMESTICALLY, SALES DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED TO

CUSTOMERS AS DIRECT DISCOUNTS AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE

OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALE PURCHASER, KNOWN

AS CHARGEBACKS, OR INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF REBATES.

ADDITIONALLY, SALES ARE GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF

RETURN UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF

PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, WHICH ARE

ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

THE PROVISION FOR AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS COVERS

CHARGEBACKS AND REBATES. CHARGEBACKS ARE DISCOUNTS THAT OCCUR

WHEN A CONTRACTED CUSTOMER PURCHASES DIRECTLY THROUGH AN

INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALE PURCHASER. THE CONTRACTED CUSTOMER

GENERALLY PURCHASES PRODUCT AT ITS CONTRACTED PRICE PLUS A

MARK-UP

FROM

THE WHOLESALER. THE WHOLESALER, IN TURN, CHARGES THE COMPANY

BACK FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE INITIALLY PAID BY THE

67

WHOLESALER AND THE CONTRACT PRICE PAID TO THE WHOLESALER BY THE

CUSTOMER. THE PROVISION FOR CHARGEBACKS IS BASED ON EXPECTED

SELL-THROUGH LEVELS BY THE COMPANYS WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS TO

CONTRACTED CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS ESTIMATED WHOLESALER INVENTORY

LEVELS. REBATES ARE AMOUNTS OWED BASED UPON DEFINITIVE

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH PRIVATE SECTOR

AND PUBLIC SECTOR (MEDICAID) BENEFIT PROVIDERS, AFTER THE FINAL

DISPENSING OF THE PRODUCT BY A PHARMACY TO A BENEFIT PLAN

PARTICIPANT. THE PROVISION IS BASED ON EXPECTED PAYMENTS, WHICH

ARE DRIVEN BY PATIENT USAGE AND CONTRACT PERFORMANCE BY THE

BENEFIT PROVIDER CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY ASSUMES A

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT MOVEMENT OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR

PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING ITS AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNT

ACCRUAL. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL CUSTOMER

SEGMENT MIX, ADJUSTED FOR OTHER KNOWN EVENTS, IN ORDER TO

ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PROVISION. AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR AGGREGATE

INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS ARE EVALUATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS

THROUGH COMPARISON OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE WHOLESALERS

AND OTHER CUSTOMERS TO THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED. ADJUSTMENTS ARE

RECORDED WHEN TRENDS OR SIGNIFICANT EVENTS INDICATE THAT A

CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED PROVISION IS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS PROVISION FOR AGGREGATE

INDIRECT CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS

TO ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AGGREGATE INDIRECT CUSTOMER

DISCOUNT PROVISION IN 2006, 2005 OR 2004.

SUMMARIZED INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN THE AGGREGATE INDIRECT

CUSTOMER DISCOUNT ACCRUAL IS AS FOLLOWS.

INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT

LIABILITIES WERE $60.4 MILLION AND $696.7 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND $164.3 MILLION

AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RETURNS POLICY THAT ALLOWS ITS CUSTOMERS

TO RETURN PRODUCT WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD PRIOR TO AND

SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXPIRATION DATE (GENERALLY, SIX MONTHS BEFORE

AND TWELVE MONTHS AFTER PRODUCT EXPIRATION). THE ESTIMATE OF THE

PROVISION FOR RETURNS IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH

ACTUAL RETURNS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS FACTORS SUCH

AS LEVELS OF INVENTORY IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, PRODUCT

DATING AND EXPIRATION PERIOD, WHETHER PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

DISCONTINUED, ENTRANCE IN THE MARKET OF ADDITIONAL GENERIC

COMPETITION, CHANGES IN FORMULARIES OR LAUNCH OF

OVER-THE-COUNTER

PRODUCTS, TO NAME A FEW. THE PRODUCT RETURNS PROVISION, AS WELL

AS ACTUAL RETURNS, WERE LESS THAN 1.0% OF NET SALES IN 2006,

2005 AND 2004.

THROUGH ITS DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH U.S. WHOLESALERS, THE

COMPANY ENCOURAGES WHOLESALERS TO ALIGN PURCHASES WITH

UNDERLYING DEMAND AND MAINTAIN INVENTORIES WITHIN SPECIFIED

LEVELS. THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM ALLOW THE WHOLESALERS TO EARN

FEES UPON PROVIDING VISIBILITY INTO THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS AS

WELL AS BY ACHIEVING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS, SUCH AS,

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, REDUCING SHORTAGE

CLAIMS AND REDUCING PRODUCT RETURNS. INFORMATION PROVIDED

THROUGH THE WHOLESALER DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM INCLUDES ITEMS SUCH

AS SALES TRENDS, INVENTORY ON-HAND, ON-ORDER QUANTITY AND

PRODUCT RETURNS.

WHOLESALERS GENERALLY PROVIDE ONLY THE ABOVE MENTIONED DATA TO

THE COMPANY, AS THERE IS NO REGULATORY REQUIREMENT TO REPORT LOT

LEVEL INFORMATION TO MANUFACTURERS, WHICH IS THE LEVEL OF

INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE REMAINING SHELF LIFE AND

ORIGINAL SALE DATE OF INVENTORY. GIVEN CURRENT WHOLESALER

INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN A MONTH, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT COLLECTION OF ORDER LOT INFORMATION ACROSS

ALL WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE LIMITED USE IN ESTIMATING

SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS.

68

INVENTORIES

PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR

PRODUCT LAUNCHES SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT INITIAL MARKET DEMAND.

TYPICALLY, CAPITALIZATION OF SUCH INVENTORY DOES NOT BEGIN UNTIL

THE RELATED PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE IN PHASE III CLINICAL

TRIALS AND ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF

REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE STATUS OF EACH

RESPECTIVE PRODUCT WITHIN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT DISCLOSE SPECIFIC TIMING

FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC

RISKS OR CONTINGENCIES OTHER THAN THE NORMAL REGULATORY APPROVAL

PROCESS OR IF THERE ARE ANY SPECIFIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING

THE RESEARCH PROCESS RELATING TO SAFETY, EFFICACY,

MANUFACTURING, MARKETING OR LABELING, THE RELATED INVENTORY

WOULD GENERALLY NOT BE CAPITALIZED. EXPIRY DATES OF THE

INVENTORY ARE IMPACTED BY THE STAGE OF COMPLETION. THE COMPANY

MANAGES THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY AT EACH STAGE TO OPTIMIZE THE

SHELF LIFE OF THE INVENTORY IN RELATION TO ANTICIPATED MARKET

DEMAND IN ORDER TO AVOID PRODUCT EXPIRY ISSUES. FOR INVENTORIES

THAT ARE CAPITALIZED, ANTICIPATED FUTURE SALES AND SHELF LIVES

SUPPORT THE REALIZATION OF THE INVENTORY VALUE AS THE INVENTORY

SHELF LIFE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET INITIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH

REQUIREMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN

PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES CONSISTED OF THREE VACCINE

PRODUCTS, A NEW FORMULATION FOR AN EXISTING VACCINE PRODUCT, AND

A NEW COMPOUND FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES, ALL OF WHICH THE COMPANY

LAUNCHED IN 2006. ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT

INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES

CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE

BUILD-UP

OF

INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY.

CONTINGENCIES

AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS

WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS. (SEE

NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.) THE

COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY

AS ASSESSMENTS CHANGE OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, A PORTION OF THE

OVERALL ACCRUAL IS ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED AND CONSIDERS SUCH

FACTORS AS PAST EXPERIENCE, NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND

ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. INDIVIDUALLY

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LOSSES ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD A

RESERVE OF $685 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION

IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING $175 MILLION IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER, IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO

(I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006,

THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF $598 MILLION AND

$75 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY

FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO

VIOXX

TO

$858 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THIS RESERVE IS

BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE

AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, IT CAN

REASONABLY ESTIMATE WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2008. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND ONGOING

REVIEW OF THE RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY UP TO

THAT TIME; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE

COMPANY; THE COSTS AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE MOST

CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION,

AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EVENTS SUCH AS

SCHEDULED TRIALS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT 2007 AND

INTO 2008, AND THE INHERENT INABILITY TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOMES OF SUCH TRIALS, LIMIT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

REASONABLY ESTIMATE ITS LEGAL COSTS BEYOND THE END OF 2008.

WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL NEED TO

INCREASE THE RESERVE EVERY QUARTER, IT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES AND MAY DETERMINE TO INCREASE ITS RESERVES

FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE IF, BASED UPON

THE FACTORS SET FORTH, IT BELIEVES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO

SO.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2007. A TRIAL IN

THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2007, BUT THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE

69

CLAIMANTS SEEK INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO

PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT

REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH

RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN

THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR

ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A RESERVE

OF APPROXIMATELY $48 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION; THE NUMBER OF CASES

BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING,

PROGRESSION, AND RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE

ASSOCIATED RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION,

THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE END OF

2008. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE

COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL

LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. WHEN A LEGITIMATE CLAIM FOR CONTRIBUTION

IS ASSERTED, A LIABILITY IS INITIALLY ACCRUED BASED UPON THE

ESTIMATED TRANSACTION COSTS TO MANAGE THE SITE. ACCRUALS ARE

ADJUSTED AS FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND RELATED COST ASSESSMENTS OF

REMEDIAL TECHNIQUES ARE COMPLETED, AND AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) WHO MAY

BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE IS

DETERMINED.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO REMEDIATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN OF ITS SITES

AND TAKES AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING FOR THESE

COSTS. A WORLDWIDE SURVEY WAS INITIALLY PERFORMED TO ASSESS ALL

SITES FOR POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION RESULTING FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL

ACTIVITIES. WHERE ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT PHYSICAL

INVESTIGATION WAS WARRANTED, SUCH INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED,

PROVIDING A BETTER EVALUATION OF THE NEED FOR REMEDIAL ACTION.

WHERE SUCH NEED WAS IDENTIFIED, REMEDIAL ACTION WAS THEN

INITIATED. ESTIMATES OF THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION AT EACH SITE

WERE INITIALLY MADE AT THE PRE-INVESTIGATION STAGE AND

LIABILITIES FOR THE POTENTIAL COST OF REMEDIATION WERE ACCRUED

AT THAT TIME. AS MORE DEFINITIVE INFORMATION BECAME AVAILABLE

DURING THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATIONS

AND/OR

REMEDIAL EFFORTS AT EACH SITE, ESTIMATES WERE REFINED AND

ACCRUALS WERE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. THESE ESTIMATES AND RELATED

ACCRUALS CONTINUE TO BE REFINED ANNUALLY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE

$12.6 MILLION IN 2006, AND ARE ESTIMATED AT

$94.2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2007 THROUGH 2011. IN

MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE HAVE BEEN

ACCRUED AND TOTALED $129.0 MILLION AND $100.4 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT

CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER PARTIES AND

WILL BE PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE

APPLICABLE SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE

NEXT 15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY

POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE

LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $62.0 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE. MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION COST RELATING TO SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN NET INCOME USING A FAIR-VALUE

MEASUREMENT METHOD, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 123R, WHICH IT

ADOPTED ON JANUARY 1, 2006. FAS 123R REQUIRES ALL

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME AS COMPENSATION

EXPENSE BASED ON FAIR VALUE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF

THE AWARDS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

SHARE-BASED AWARDS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL

WHICH USES BOTH HISTORICAL AND CURRENT MARKET DATA TO ESTIMATE

THE FAIR VALUE. THIS METHOD

70

INCORPORATES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE RISK-FREE INTEREST

RATE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD AND EXPECTED

LIFE OF THE OPTIONS.

PENSIONS

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST TOTALED

$563.7 MILLION IN 2006 AND $561.8 MILLION IN 2005.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN INFORMATION FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS CALCULATED USING ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING A DISCOUNT RATE FOR PLAN BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND AN EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS.

THE COMPANY REASSESSES ITS BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS ON A REGULAR

BASIS. FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS EVALUATED ANNUALLY AND MODIFIED TO

REFLECT THE PREVAILING MARKET RATE AT DECEMBER 31 OF A

PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT

WOULD PROVIDE THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS NEEDED TO PAY THE BENEFITS

INCLUDED IN THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS THEY COME DUE. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS DISCOUNT RATE TO

6.00% FROM 5.75% FOR ITS U.S. PENSION PLANS AND ITS

U.S. OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN FOR BOTH THE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE RATE OF

RETURN TO BE EARNED ON PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PERIOD THE BENEFITS

INCLUDED IN THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION ARE TO BE PAID. IN DEVELOPING

THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM

COMPOUND ANNUALIZED RETURNS OF HISTORICAL MARKET DATA AS WELL AS

ACTUAL RETURNS ON THE COMPANYS PLAN ASSETS AND APPLIES

ADJUSTMENTS THAT REFLECT MORE RECENT CAPITAL MARKET EXPERIENCE.

USING THIS REFERENCE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DEVELOPS

FORWARD-LOOKING RETURN EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH ASSET CATEGORY AND

A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR A

TARGETED PORTFOLIO ALLOCATED ACROSS THESE INVESTMENT CATEGORIES.

THE EXPECTED PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE REFLECTS THE CONTRIBUTION OF

ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE. AS A RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS,

FOR 2007, THE COMPANYS EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN OF 8.75%

REMAINED UNCHANGED FROM 2006 FOR ITS U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

THE TARGET INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF THE COMPANYS

U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IS

ALLOCATED 45% TO 60% IN U.S. EQUITIES, 20% TO 30% IN

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, 15% TO 25% IN FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS,

AND UP TO 8% IN CASH AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE PORTFOLIOS

EQUITY WEIGHTING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE

PLANS BENEFIT OBLIGATION. THE EXPECTED ANNUAL STANDARD

DEVIATION OF RETURNS OF THE TARGET PORTFOLIO, WHICH APPROXIMATES

13%, REFLECTS BOTH THE EQUITY ALLOCATION AND THE DIVERSIFICATION

BENEFITS AMONG THE ASSET CLASSES IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO INVESTS.

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT. A REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE OF PLUS

(MINUS) 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION,

WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE AN ESTIMATED

$39.8 MILLION FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE) IMPACT ON NET PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. A REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE OF

PLUS (MINUS) 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN

ASSUMPTION, WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE AN

ESTIMATED $13.1 MILLION FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE) IMPACT ON

NET PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT EXPECT TO HAVE A MINIMUM PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENT UNDER

THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE DURING 2007. THE PRECEDING

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RATE OF

RETURN ASSUMPTIONS WOULD NOT IMPACT THE COMPANYS FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB

STATEMENT NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 106 AND 132R

(FAS 158), EXCEPT FOR THE REQUIREMENT TO

MEASURE PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE

COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR END BALANCE SHEET, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF

FAS 158, NET LOSS AMOUNTS, WHICH REFLECT EXPERIENCE

DIFFERENTIALS PRIMARILY RELATING TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPECTED

AND ACTUAL RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF

CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. EXPECTED RETURNS ARE

BASED ON A CALCULATED MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. UNDER THIS

METHODOLOGY, ASSET GAINS/LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTUAL RETURNS

THAT DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTED RETURNS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS RATABLY OVER A

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. ALSO, NET LOSS AMOUNTS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN THRESHOLDS ARE

AMORTIZED INTO NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST

OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

AMORTIZATION OF NET LOSSES FOR THE COMPANYS

U.S. PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE NET PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST BY

APPROXIMATELY $96.4 MILLION ANNUALLY FROM 2007 THROUGH 2011.

71

ACQUISITIONS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE PURCHASE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. ANY EXCESS OF THE

PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ACQUIRED COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WHICH HAS NOT

COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE ACQUISITION WILL

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WOULD NOT BE

RECORDED. THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING

ACQUIRED RESEARCH, IS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND ACCORDINGLY, FOR SIGNIFICANT ITEMS, THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY OBTAINS ASSISTANCE FROM THIRD PARTY VALUATION

SPECIALISTS. AMOUNTS ARE ALLOCATED TO ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND

EXPENSED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION IF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY

HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED.

FOR PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH

PROCESS THAT HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES, THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND AMORTIZES THEM OVER AN

APPROPRIATE USEFUL LIFE. THE VALUATIONS AND USEFUL LIFE

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE NEAR THE

ACQUISITION DATE AND ARE BASED ON EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT ARE DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT. THE JUDGMENTS MADE IN

DETERMINING ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED

AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AS WELL AS ASSET LIVES, CAN MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING ACQUIRED RESEARCH, THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY USES THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE

BASED ON EACH PROJECTS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS. FUTURE CASH

FLOWS ARE PREDOMINATELY BASED ON A NET INCOME FORECAST OF EACH

PROJECT, CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL PRICING, MARGINS AND EXPENSE

LEVELS OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS. REVENUES ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON

RELEVANT MARKET SIZE AND GROWTH FACTORS, EXPECTED INDUSTRY

TRENDS, INDIVIDUAL PROJECT LIFE CYCLES, AND THE LIFE OF EACH

RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERLING PATENT, IF ANY. EXPECTED

REVENUES ARE THEN ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF TECHNICAL AND

MARKETING SUCCESS AND THE RESULTING CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED AT

A RISK -ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE.

TAXES ON

INCOME

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON PRE-TAX

INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES

AVAILABLE IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

OPERATES. AN ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR A YEAR IS APPLIED

TO THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS. IN THE EVENT

THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNUSUAL OR ONE-TIME ITEM RECOGNIZED,

OR EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED, IN THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY

OPERATING RESULTS, THE TAX ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT ITEM WOULD BE

SEPARATELY CALCULATED AND RECORDED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE

UNUSUAL OR ONE-TIME ITEM. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RESOLUTION

OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS TO BE SUCH ITEMS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT

IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

AND IN EVALUATING ITS TAX POSITIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES

RESERVES WHEN, DESPITE ITS BELIEF THAT THE TAX RETURN POSITIONS

ARE FULLY SUPPORTABLE, CERTAIN POSITIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE

CHALLENGED AND THAT IT MAY NOT SUCCEED. (SEE NOTE 17 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.) THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THESE

RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS

THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT.

TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE TAX RETURN

AT DIFFERENT TIMES THAN THE ITEMS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AS A RESULT, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS DIFFERENT THAN THAT REPORTED IN THE TAX

RETURN. SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES ARE PERMANENT, SUCH AS

EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTIBLE ON THE TAX RETURN, AND SOME ARE

TIMING DIFFERENCES, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. TIMING

DIFFERENCES CREATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS GENERALLY REPRESENT ITEMS THAT CAN BE USED AS A TAX

DEDUCTION OR CREDIT IN THE TAX RETURN IN FUTURE YEARS FOR WHICH

THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY RECORDED THE TAX BENEFIT IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES VALUATION

ALLOWANCES FOR ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN THE AMOUNT OF

EXPECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IS NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE USE

OF THE DEDUCTION OR CREDIT. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES GENERALLY

REPRESENT TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

WHICH PAYMENT HAS BEEN DEFERRED OR EXPENSE FOR WHICH THE COMPANY

HAS ALREADY TAKEN A DEDUCTION ON THE TAX RETURN, BUT HAS NOT YET

RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN OCTOBER 2004, THE AJCA WAS SIGNED

INTO LAW. THE AJCA CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR

U.S. MULTINATIONALS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE AJCA, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED

$15.9 BILLION DURING 2005 (SEE NOTE 17 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AS A RESULT OF THIS

REPATRIATION, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCOME TAX CHARGE OF

$766.5 MILLION IN TAXES ON INCOME IN 2005 RELATED TO THIS

REPATRIATION. THIS CHARGE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

72

$100 MILLION BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH A DECISION TO

IMPLEMENT CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

CHANGED ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ACCUMULATED

EARNINGS EARNED SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2002. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, FOREIGN EARNINGS OF $12.5 BILLION

HAVE BEEN RETAINED INDEFINITELY BY SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES FOR

REINVESTMENT. NO PROVISION WILL BE MADE FOR INCOME TAXES THAT

WOULD BE PAYABLE UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH EARNINGS AND IT

IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE RELATED

UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITY.

RECENTLY

ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

(FIN 48), WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2007. FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE UNCERTAINTY

IN TAX POSITIONS BY REQUIRING COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE IN THEIR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE IMPACT OF A TAX POSITION, IF THAT

POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED ON AUDIT

BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. AMONG OTHER

PROVISIONS, FIN 48 ALSO REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES AT

THE END OF EACH ANNUAL PERIOD PRESENTED. THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF FIN 48 ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AT THIS TIME, THE EFFECTS OF ADOPTION

HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157), WHICH

WILL BE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008. THIS STATEMENT CLARIFIES

THE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR

MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 157 ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS

NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN

IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS

SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS,

WILL, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS,

PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN

ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY

TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO

ADDRESS THE COMPANYS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT POTENTIAL AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH

STATEMENT AND SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF OTHER RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE

NOT. NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL

FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ASSUME THE OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. ONE SHOULD CAREFULLY EVALUATE SUCH

STATEMENTS IN LIGHT OF FACTORS, INCLUDING RISK FACTORS,

DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANYS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ESPECIALLY ON

FORMS 10-K,

10-Q

AND

8-K.

IN

ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

THE COMPANY DISCUSSES IN MORE DETAIL VARIOUS IMPORTANT FACTORS

THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM EXPECTED OR

HISTORIC RESULTS. THE COMPANY NOTES THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS

AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF

1995. ONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE READER SHOULD

NOT CONSIDER ANY SUCH LIST TO BE A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF ALL

POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

MERCK & CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

($ IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

1.

NATURE OF

OPERATIONS

MERCK IS A GLOBAL RESEARCH-DRIVEN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT

DISCOVERS, DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY MANAGED ON A PRODUCTS

BASIS AND ARE COMPRISED OF TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND THE VACCINES SEGMENT. THE

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT INCLUDES HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.

THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF THERAPEUTIC AND PREVENTIVE AGENTS,

SOLD BY PRESCRIPTION, FOR THE TREATMENT OF HUMAN DISORDERS.

MERCK SELLS THESE HUMAN HEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIMARILY

TO DRUG WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND MANAGED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTH

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THE VACCINES

SEGMENT INCLUDES HUMAN HEALTH VACCINE PRODUCTS MARKETED EITHER

DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE. THESE PRODUCTS CONSIST OF

PREVENTATIVE PEDIATRIC, ADOLESCENT AND ADULT VACCINES, PRIMARILY

ADMINISTERED AT PHYSICIAN OFFICES. MERCK SELLS THESE HUMAN

HEALTH VACCINES PRIMARILY TO PHYSICIANS, WHOLESALERS, PHYSICIAN

DISTRIBUTORS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THE COMPANYS

PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES COMMUNICATE THE EFFECTIVENESS,

SAFETY AND VALUE OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL AND VACCINE PRODUCTS TO

HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, GROUP PRACTICES

AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

2.

SUMMARY

OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 

THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ALL

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS

MAINTAINED. CONTROLLING INTEREST IS DETERMINED BY MAJORITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST AND THE ABSENCE OF SUBSTANTIVE THIRD-PARTY

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS OR, IN THE CASE OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES, BY MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO EXPECTED LOSSES, RESIDUAL

RETURNS OR BOTH. FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE MERCK

OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100%, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS

INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN

AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT

NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST, SUCH AS INTERESTS IN ENTITIES OWNED

EQUALLY BY THE COMPANY AND A THIRD PARTY THAT ARE UNDER SHARED

CONTROL, ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 

THE

U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

CASH EQUIVALENTS

ARE COMPRISED OF CERTAIN HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

INVENTORIES 

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DOMESTIC

INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF

LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) COST OR MARKET FOR BOTH BOOK AND

TAX PURPOSES. FOREIGN INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES CONSIST

OF CURRENTLY MARKETED PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN PRODUCTS AWAITING

REGULATORY APPROVAL. IN EVALUATING THE RECOVERABILITY OF

INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABILITY THAT REVENUE WILL BE OBTAINED

FROM THE FUTURE SALE OF THE RELATED INVENTORY TOGETHER WITH THE

STATUS OF THE PRODUCT WITHIN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS.

INVESTMENTS 

INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, TO

THE EXTENT NOT HEDGED, REPORTED NET OF TAX IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED

AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY,

CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS INTENT, ARE REPORTED AT COST.

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE CHARGED TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET,

FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE

IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF ITS INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING

THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST

AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

REVENUES FROM SALES OF

PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS PASSES TO

THE CUSTOMER. REVENUES FOR DOMESTIC PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ARE

RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, WHILE FOR MANY FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS FOR VACCINE SALES, REVENUES ARE

RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY. RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ALSO

REQUIRES REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COLLECTION OF SALES PROCEEDS

AND COMPLETION OF ALL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. DOMESTICALLY,

SALES DISCOUNTS ARE ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS AS DIRECT DISCOUNTS AT

THE

POINT-OF-SALE

OR

77

INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY WHOLESALE PURCHASER, KNOWN AS

CHARGEBACKS, OR INDIRECTLY IN THE FORM OF REBATES. ADDITIONALLY,

SALES ARE GENERALLY MADE WITH A LIMITED RIGHT OF RETURN UNDER

CERTAIN CONDITIONS. REVENUES ARE RECORDED NET OF PROVISIONS FOR

SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS, WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME

OF SALE. ACCRUALS FOR CHARGEBACKS ARE REFLECTED AS A DIRECT

REDUCTION TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUALS FOR REBATES ARE

RECORDED AS ACCRUED EXPENSES. THE ACCRUED BALANCES RELATIVE TO

THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCRUED AND

OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES WERE $60.4 MILLION AND

$696.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

$164.3 MILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN RECOGNIZING

REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF VACCINES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR

PLACEMENT INTO STOCKPILES RELATED TO THE PEDIATRIC VACCINE

STOCKPILE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC) INTERPRETATION,

COMMISSION GUIDANCE

REGARDING ACCOUNTING FOR SALES OF VACCINES AND BIOTERROR

COUNTERMEASURES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR PLACEMENT INTO THE

PEDIATRIC VACCINE STOCKPILE OR THE STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE.

THE COMPANY RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED THE IMPACTS OF ADOPTING

THE INTERPRETATION BY REDUCING ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT

LIABILITIES BY $103.4 MILLION AND INCREASING INCOME TAXES

PAYABLE BY $42.3 MILLION AND RETAINED EARNINGS BY

$61.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR 2006 OR 2005. THE IMPACTS OF ADOPTION ON 2004 RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS WERE INCREASES TO THE FOLLOWING: SALES OF

$34.2 MILLION, MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS OF

$5.9 MILLION, TAXES ON INCOME OF $11.6 MILLION, NET

INCOME OF $16.7 MILLION AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

ASSUMING DILUTION OF $0.01.

DEPRECIATION 

DEPRECIATION IS PROVIDED OVER

THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. FOR TAX PURPOSES, ACCELERATED METHODS ARE

USED. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO

50 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, AND FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS FOR

MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND OFFICE FURNISHINGS.

ACQUISITIONS 

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) STATEMENT NO. 141,

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

LIABILITIES ASSUMED BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AT

THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE

OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS

RECORDED AS GOODWILL. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ACQUIRED

COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WHICH HAS NOT COMMENCED

ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE ACQUISITION WILL BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WOULD NOT BE RECORDED. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 4,

APPLICABILITY

OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 2 TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ACCOUNTED

FOR BY THE PURCHASE METHOD

, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES AMOUNTS TO

ACQUIRED RESEARCH WHICH ARE EXPENSED AT THE AT THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION IF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS NOT BEEN

ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. FOR PROJECTS

WHICH CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS THAT HAVE

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES THESE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND AMORTIZES THEM OVER AN APPROPRIATE USEFUL

LIFE. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS ARE

REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS OF THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES 

GOODWILL

REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF ACQUISITION COSTS OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED. GOODWILL IS ASSIGNED TO

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE COMPANYS SEGMENTS AND EVALUATED

FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, USING A FAIR VALUE

BASED TEST. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES ARE RECORDED AT COST AND

ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS (SEE NOTE 8).

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVIEW, THE COMPANY WILL

ASSESS RECOVERABILITY FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS OF OTHER

INTANGIBLES USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM THE

LOWEST APPROPRIATE ASSET GROUPINGS, GENERALLY THE SUBSIDIARY

LEVEL. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING RESULTS TO THE

EXTENT THAT CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS

DETERMINED BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT IS EXPENSED AS INCURRED. UPFRONT AND MILESTONE

PAYMENTS MADE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS PRIOR TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PAYMENTS MADE TO THIRD PARTIES SUBSEQUENT

TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE

SHORTER OF THE REMAINING LICENSE OR PRODUCT PATENT LIFE.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STATEMENT

NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R) (SEE NOTE 14). FAS 123R

REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES TO BE EXPENSED

OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR

VALUE OF THE AWARDS AND

78

REQUIRES THAT THE UNVESTED PORTION OF ALL OUTSTANDING AWARDS

UPON ADOPTION BE RECOGNIZED USING THE SAME FAIR VALUE AND

ATTRIBUTION METHODOLOGIES PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED UNDER FASB

STATEMENT NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES

VALUATION METHOD AND APPLIED THE REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 123R

USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF

FAS 123R, EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION WAS RECOGNIZED

USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD, WHICH MEASURES SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE MARKET PRICE OF

THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT EXCEEDS THE EXERCISE PRICE.

ACCORDINGLY, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE

COMPANYS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OTHER THAN FOR ITS

PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND OPTIONS

GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS 

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY

ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

USE OF ESTIMATES 

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (GAAP) AND,

ACCORDINGLY, INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ESTIMATES ARE

USED IN DETERMINING SUCH ITEMS AS PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS

AND RETURNS, DEPRECIABLE AND AMORTIZABLE LIVES, RECOVERABILITY

OF INVENTORIES PRODUCED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCT LAUNCHES,

VOLUNTARY

PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY

WORLDWIDE WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE

PAIN MEDICATION. THE COMPANYS DECISION, WHICH WAS

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, WAS BASED ON NEW THREE-YEAR DATA FROM A

PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL,

APPROVE (ADENOMATOUS POLYP PREVENTION ON

VIOXX

).

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WITHDRAWAL, IN 2004 THE COMPANY RECORDED

AN UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME OF $552.6 MILLION,

OR $0.25 PER SHARE. THE ADJUSTMENT TO PRE-TAX INCOME WAS

$726.2 MILLION. OF THIS AMOUNT, $491.6 MILLION RELATED

TO ESTIMATED CUSTOMER RETURNS OF PRODUCT PREVIOUSLY SOLD AND WAS

RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF SALES, $93.2 MILLION RELATED TO

WRITE-OFFS OF INVENTORY HELD BY THE COMPANY AND WAS RECORDED IN

MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION EXPENSE, AND $141.4 MILLION

RELATED TO ESTIMATED COSTS TO UNDERTAKE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE

PRODUCT AND WAS RECORDED IN MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE. THE TAX BENEFIT OF THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS

$173.6 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS THE GEOGRAPHICAL MIX OF

VIOXX

RETURNS AND THE COST OF THE WITHDRAWAL. THE

ADJUSTMENT DID NOT INCLUDE CHARGES FOR FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS (SEE NOTE 11). THE

VIOXX

WITHDRAWAL PROCESS

WAS COMPLETED DURING 2005 AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

WITHDRAWAL WERE IN LINE WITH THE ORIGINAL AMOUNTS RECORDED BY

THE COMPANY IN 2004.

RESTRUCTURING

GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE INITIAL PHASE OF A

GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

COMPANYS COST STRUCTURE, INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCE

COMPETITIVENESS. THE INITIAL STEPS INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

A NEW SUPPLY STRATEGY BY THE MERCK MANUFACTURING DIVISION, WHICH

IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LEANER, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND

CUSTOMER-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING MODEL OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, MERCK ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SELL OR CLOSE

FIVE MANUFACTURING SITES AND TWO PRECLINICAL SITES BY THE END OF

2008, AND ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY 7,000 POSITIONS COMPANY-WIDE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO SOLD OR CLOSED CERTAIN OTHER FACILITIES AND

SOLD RELATED ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM. THE PRE-TAX COSTS OF THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WERE

$935.5 MILLION IN 2006, $401.2 MILLION IN 2005 AND ARE

EXPECTED TO BE $300 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN 2007.

THROUGH THE END OF 2008, WHEN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE,

THE CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX COSTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO

RANGE FROM $1.9 BILLION TO $2.2 BILLION. APPROXIMATELY

70% OF THE CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX COSTS ARE NON-CASH, RELATING

PRIMARILY TO ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION FOR THOSE FACILITIES

SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE GLOBAL

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE

COMPANY HAS RECORDED TOTAL PRE-TAX ACCUMULATED COSTS OF

$1.3 BILLION AND ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 4,800 POSITIONS,

COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS AND THE ELIMINATION OF

CONTRACTORS AND VACANT POSITIONS.

SEPARATION COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS, AS WELL AS THOSE HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS WHICH WERE

PROBABLE AND COULD BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. APPROXIMATELY 3,700

POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED IN 2006 AND APPROXIMATELY 1,100 WERE

ELIMINATED IN 2005 (WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF ACTUAL HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTORS AND VACANT

POSITIONS).

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE FIVE

MERCK-OWNED MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (PONDERS END, UNITED

KINGDOM; OKAZAKI, JAPAN; KIRKLAND, CANADA; ALBANY, GEORGIA, AND

DANVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA) AND THE TWO PRECLINICAL SITES (IN

OKAZAKI AND MENUMA, JAPAN) TO BE SOLD OR CLOSED BY THE END OF

2008. THESE ACTIONS ARE IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE COSTS AND

CONSOLIDATE THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH

FACILITIES. THROUGH THE END OF 2006, THREE OF THE MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES HAD BEEN CLOSED, SOLD OR HAD CEASED OPERATIONS AND

THE TWO PRECLINICAL SITES WERE CLOSED. ALL OF THE SITES HAVE AND

WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE UP THROUGH THE RESPECTIVE CLOSURE

DATES, AND SINCE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE

RESPECTIVE BOOK VALUES, MERCK WAS REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE

DEPRECIATION OF THE SITE ASSETS RATHER THAN WRITING THEM OFF

IMMEDIATELY. THE SITE ASSETS INCLUDE MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.

OTHER ACTIVITY IN 2006 AND 2005 INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY

$25.0 MILLION AND $111.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS THAT WILL

NO LONGER BE USED IN THE BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF THESE

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND MUST THEREFORE, BE WRITTEN OFF.

ADDITIONALLY, OTHER ACTIVITY IN 2006 AND 2005 INCLUDES

$34.2 MILLION AND $23.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED

TO CURTAILMENT, SETTLEMENT AND TERMINATION CHARGES ON THE

80

COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

(SEE NOTE 15). IN 2006, OTHER ACTIVITY ALSO INCLUDES

PRE-TAX GAINS OF $40.7 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SALES OF

FACILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

OTHER

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS

AS PART OF A COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER 2003

AND COMPLETED AT THE END OF 2004, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED 5,100

POSITIONS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN 2005 WITH

900 POSITIONS BEING ELIMINATED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2005.

AS A RESULT OF THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED

RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $116.8 MILLION FOR 2005 AND

$107.6 MILLION FOR 2004. OF THESE AMOUNTS, IN 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY, $91.5 MILLION AND $84.4 MILLION

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE BENEFITS, $25.3 MILLION AND

$21.5 MILLION RELATED TO CURTAILMENT, SETTLEMENT AND

TERMINATION CHARGES ON THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (SEE NOTE 15) AND

$1.7 MILLION RELATED TO A MODIFICATION IN THE TERMS OF

CERTAIN EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTION GRANTS IN 2004 ONLY.

THE COMPANY INCURRED ADDITIONAL ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION COSTS

OF $103.1 MILLION RECORDED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE DURING 2005 NOT REFLECTED IN THE ABOVE TABLE, WHICH

REDUCED THE ASSETS OF THIS RESEARCH CENTER DOWN TO THEIR NET

RESEARCH

COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS

MERCK CONTINUES ITS STRATEGY OF ESTABLISHING STRONG EXTERNAL

ALLIANCES TO COMPLEMENT ITS SUBSTANTIAL INTERNAL RESEARCH

CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS,

LICENSING PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS AND TECHNOLOGY

TRANSFERS TO DRIVE BOTH NEAR- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. DURING 2006,

MERCK SIGNED 53 SUCH AGREEMENTS.

ON DECEMBER 29, 2006, MERCK COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

SIRNA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (SIRNA) FOR $13 PER

SHARE IN CASH, FOR A TOTAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF ALL

OUTSTANDING SIRNA SHARES, WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS. THE

AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $1.1 BILLION WAS PAID ON

JANUARY 3, 2007, AND

81

ACCORDINGLY, IS REFLECTED AS A LIABILITY WITHIN ACCRUED AND

OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. SIRNA WAS A

PUBLICLY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS A LEADER IN

DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES BASED ON RNA INTERFERENCE

(RNAI) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER

THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE. RNAI-BASED THERAPEUTICS SELECTIVELY

CATALYZE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RNA TRANSCRIBED FROM AN

INDIVIDUAL GENE. THE ACQUISITION OF SIRNA IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE MERCKS ABILITY TO USE RNAI TECHNOLOGY TO TURN OFF

A TARGETED GENE IN A HUMAN CELL, POTENTIALLY RENDERING

INOPERATIVE A GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIGGERING A SPECIFIC

DISEASE. THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

,

IN WHICH THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM SIRNA AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION

WERE RECORDED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES AS OF THE

ACQUISITION DATE IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE EXCESS OF THE

PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED NET ASSETS

HAS BEEN RECORDED AS GOODWILL OF $345.9 MILLION. THE

GOODWILL WAS FULLY ALLOCATED TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND

IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. ALSO, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

CHARGE OF $466.2 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED

WITH SIRNAS COMPOUNDS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, FOR

WHICH, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD

NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THE

ACQUIRED RESEARCH CHARGE RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

TREATMENTS FOR BOTH THE HEPATITIS B AND HEPATITIS C

VIRUSES, WHICH ARE IN PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS

LICENSING AGREEMENTS HELD BY SIRNA. THE CHARGE, WHICH IS NOT

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, WAS RECORDED IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE PRESENT

VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES

RESULTING FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED FOR THE PROBABILITY OF

ITS TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS UTILIZING AN INCOME APPROACH

REFLECTING APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES OF 27.0% TO

30.0%. THE ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE

COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THE

ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALSO RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET OF $357.8 MILLION AND A

RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $146.3 MILLION, AS WELL

AS OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  NET OF

$112.6 MILLION. THE INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATES TO

SIRNAS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY

IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND HAS ALTERNATIVE

FUTURE USES. THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER A SEVEN

YEAR USEFUL LIFE. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS NOT

REQUIRED BECAUSE SIRNAS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE

NOT SIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS. THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON DECEMBER 29, 2006, AND

ACCORDINGLY, SIRNAS OPERATING RESULTS WERE NOT REFLECTED

IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2006.

ALSO, IN DECEMBER 2006, MERCK AND IDERA PHARMACEUTICALS

(IDERA) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD FORMED A BROAD

COLLABORATION TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

IDERAS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR) AGONISTS.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL RECEIVE WORLDWIDE

EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO A NUMBER OF IDERAS AGONIST COMPOUNDS

TARGETING TLR 7, 8 AND 9 FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH

MERCKS THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC VACCINES UNDER

DEVELOPMENT FOR ONCOLOGY, INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND

ALZHEIMERS DISEASE. MERCK AND IDERA WILL ENGAGE IN A

TWO-YEAR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION TO GENERATE

NOVEL AGONISTS TARGETING TLR 7 AND TLR 8 AND INCORPORATING BOTH

MERCK AND IDERA CHEMISTRY FOR USE IN THE LICENSED FIELDS. MERCK

PAID AN UPFRONT LICENSE FEE OF $20 MILLION TO IDERA, WHICH

WAS RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND PURCHASED

$10 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT $5.50 PER SHARE. IN

ADDITION, MERCK WILL FUND THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

COLLABORATION. IDERA IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE MILESTONE PAYMENTS

OF UP TO $165 MILLION IF VACCINES ARE SUCCESSFULLY

DEVELOPED IN EACH OF THE THREE FIELDS. ADDITIONAL MILESTONES OF

UP TO $260 MILLION WOULD BE PAYABLE FOR FOLLOW-ON

INDICATIONS IN THE ONCOLOGY FIELD AND THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT

OF ADDITIONAL VACCINES CONTAINING IDERAS TLR AGONISTS.

THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF VACCINES TO WHICH MERCK CAN

APPLY IDERAS AGONISTS WITHIN THE LICENSED FIELDS. IN

ADDITION, IDERA WILL RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON PRODUCTS

COMMERCIALIZED UNDER THE COLLABORATION.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF ITS EXISTING

STRATEGIC COLLABORATION WITH FOXHOLLOW TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

(FOXHOLLOW) FOR ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE ANALYSIS.

ADDITIONALLY, MERCK ACQUIRED A STAKE IN FOXHOLLOW WITH THE

PURCHASE OF $95 MILLION OF NEWLY-ISSUED SHARES OF FOXHOLLOW

COMMON STOCK FOR $29.629 PER SHARE, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY AN 11% STAKE. THESE SHARES ARE RECORDED AS AN

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE EXISTING STRATEGIC COLLABORATION,

ENTERED INTO IN 2005, PROVIDED FOR FOXHOLLOW TO RECEIVE AN

UPFRONT PAYMENT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS IF

THE COLLABORATION CONTINUED. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EXPANDED

COLLABORATION AGREEMENT, MERCK WILL PAY $40 MILLION TO

FOXHOLLOW OVER FOUR YEARS IN EXCHANGE FOR FOXHOLLOWS

AGREEMENT TO COLLABORATE EXCLUSIVELY WITH MERCK IN SPECIFIED

DISEASE AREAS. MERCK WILL ALSO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF

$60 MILLION IN FUNDING TO FOXHOLLOW OVER THE FIRST

82

THREE YEARS OF THE FOUR YEAR COLLABORATION PROGRAM TERM, FOR

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TO BE CONDUCTED BY FOXHOLLOW UNDER

MERCKS DIRECTION. FOXHOLLOW WILL RECEIVE MILESTONE

PAYMENTS ON SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG PRODUCTS OR

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS UTILIZING RESULTS FROM THE COLLABORATION, AS

WELL AS ROYALTIES.

IN OCTOBER 2006, MERCK AND AMBRILIA BIOPHARMA INC.

(AMBRILIA), A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY DEVELOPING

INNOVATIVE THERAPEUTICS IN THE FIELDS OF CANCER AND INFECTIOUS

DISEASES, ANNOUNCED THEY ENTERED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSING

AGREEMENT GRANTING MERCK THE WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO AMBRILIAS

HIV/AIDS PROTEASE INHIBITOR PROGRAM. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

AGREEMENT, AMBRILIA GRANTED MERCK THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE RIGHTS

TO ITS LEAD COMPOUND, PPL-100, WHICH HAS COMPLETED A

PHASE I SINGLE-DOSE PHARMACOKINETIC STUDY AND IS CURRENTLY

IN A PHASE I REPEAT DOSE PHARMACOKINETIC STUDY. IN RETURN,

AMBRILIA RECEIVED AN UPFRONT LICENSING FEE OF $17 MILLION

ON SIGNING, WHICH THE COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2006, AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CASH PAYMENTS

TOTALING UP TO $215 MILLION UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF

DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL, REGULATORY AND SALES MILESTONES. AMBRILIA

WILL RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON ALL FUTURE PRODUCT SALES.

IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY

OF GLYCOFI, INC. (GLYCOFI) FOR APPROXIMATELY

$373 MILLION IN CASH ($400 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE NET

OF $25 MILLION IN SHARES ALREADY OWNED AND NET TRANSACTION

COSTS). GLYCOFI WAS A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT

IS A LEADER IN THE FIELD OF YEAST GLYCOENGINEERING, WHICH IS THE

ADDITION OF SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROTEINS

IN YEAST, AND OPTIMIZATION OF BIOLOGIC DRUG MOLECULES.

GLYCOFIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

GLYCOPROTEIN, AS WELL AS THE OPTIMIZATION OF A GLYCOPROTEIN

TARGET. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED

A CHARGE OF $296.3 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED

WITH GLYCOFIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO BE USED IN THE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, FOR WHICH, AT THE ACQUISITION

DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE EXISTED. THIS CHARGE IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE

FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THIS TECHNOLOGY TO BE

FULLY DEVELOPED OVER THE NEXT ONE TO TWO YEARS. THE CHARGE WAS

RECORDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND WAS DETERMINED

BASED UPON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF

NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES RESULTING FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTED

FOR THE PROBABILITY OF ITS TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SUCCESS

UTILIZING AN INCOME APPROACH REFLECTING THE APPROPRIATE

RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A

$99.4 MILLION INTANGIBLE ASSET ($57.6 MILLION NET OF

DEFERRED TAXES) RELATED TO GLYCOFIS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY

THAT CAN BE USED IMMEDIATELY IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PROCESS AND HAS ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES. THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET

WILL BE AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A FIVE YEAR USEFUL LIFE. THE REMAINING

NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THIS TRANSACTION WERE NOT MATERIAL.

BECAUSE GLYCOFI WAS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT

COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A

BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE, GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED.

GLYCOFIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE EQUITY OF ABMAXIS,

INC. (ABMAXIS) FOR APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION IN

CASH. ABMAXIS WAS A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

DEDICATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND OPTIMIZATION OF MONOCLONAL

ANTIBODY (MAB) PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN THERAPEUTICS AND

DIAGNOSTICS. ABMAXIS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A BREAKTHROUGH

ANTIBODY ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, ABMAXIS

IN-SILICO

IMMUNIZATION, WHICH HAS ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES TO THE

COMPANY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL OR ENGINEERING RISKS

AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION,

THE COMPANY ALLOCATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO

ABMAXIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND RECORDED AN INTANGIBLE

ASSET OF $135.3 MILLION ($78.5 MILLION NET OF DEFERRED

TAXES). THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE AMORTIZED TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A FIVE YEAR

USEFUL LIFE. THE REMAINING NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THIS

TRANSACTION WERE NOT MATERIAL. BECAUSE ABMAXIS WAS A DEVELOPMENT

STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL

OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION

OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE,

GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED. ABMAXIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL RESULTS SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE.

IN MARCH 2006, NEUROMED PHARMACEUTICALS LTD.

(NEUROMED) AND MERCK SIGNED A RESEARCH COLLABORATION

AND LICENSE AGREEMENT TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE

NOVEL COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PAIN AND OTHER NEUROLOGICAL

DISORDERS, INCLUDING NEUROMEDS LEAD COMPOUND, NMED-160

(MK-6721), WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE II DEVELOPMENT FOR

THE TREATMENT OF PAIN. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT,

NEUROMED RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $25 MILLION WHICH

THE COMPANY RECORDED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN

2006. THE

83

SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND LAUNCH OF NMED-160 FOR AN INITIAL

SINGLE INDICATION ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS WOULD TRIGGER MILESTONE

PAYMENTS TOTALING $202 MILLION. MILESTONES COULD INCREASE

TO APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION IF A FURTHER INDICATION FOR

NMED-160 IS DEVELOPED AND APPROVED AND AN ADDITIONAL COMPOUND IS

DEVELOPED AND APPROVED FOR TWO INDICATIONS. NEUROMED WOULD ALSO

RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON WORLDWIDE SALES OF NMED-160 AND ANY

ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS DEVELOPED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

IN 2005, AGENSYS, INC. (AGENSYS), A CANCER

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY, AND MERCK ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A

GLOBAL ALLIANCE TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE AGS-PSCA,

AGENSYS FULLY HUMAN MAB TO PROSTATE STEM CELL ANTIGEN.

ALSO IN 2005, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH GERON

CORPORATION TO DEVELOP A CANCER VACCINE AGAINST TELOMERASE, AN

ENZYME, ACTIVE IN MOST CANCER CELLS THAT MAINTAINS TELOMERE

LENGTH AT THE ENDS OF CHROMOSOMES, WHICH ALLOWS THE CANCER TO

GROW AND METASTASIZE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ATON PHARMA, INC.

(ATON), A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY

FOCUSING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR CANCER AND

OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES. ATONS CLINICAL PIPELINE OF HISTONE

DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS REPRESENTS A CLASS OF ANTI-TUMOR AGENTS

WITH POTENTIAL FOR EFFICACY BASED ON A NOVEL MECHANISM OF

ACTION. ATONS LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE AT THE TIME OF

ACQUISITION, SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC ACID, KNOWN AS

VORINOSTAT, FOR THE TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA WAS

APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION IN OCTOBER 2006 AND

IS MARKETED AS

ZOLINZA

IN THE UNITED STATES.

CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITION CONSISTED OF AN UPFRONT

PAYMENT, AS WELL AS CONTINGENT PAYMENTS BASED UPON THE

REGULATORY FILING, APPROVAL AND SALE OF PRODUCTS. IN CONNECTION

WITH THE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$125.5 MILLION, INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE, FOR ACQUIRED RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTS IN

DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE

USE EXISTED. THE REMAINING NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THIS

TRANSACTION WERE NOT MATERIAL. BECAUSE ATON WAS A DEVELOPMENT

STAGE COMPANY THAT HAD NOT COMMENCED ITS PLANNED PRINCIPAL

OPERATIONS, THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ACQUISITION

OF ASSETS RATHER THAN AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND, THEREFORE,

GOODWILL WAS NOT RECORDED. ATONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE COMPANYS SINCE THE ACQUISITION

DATE.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

WHILE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. MERCK RELIES ON SUSTAINED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM

FOREIGN SOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THE EXTENT

THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CASH FLOWS IS DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF A

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND

RESEARCH AND OTHER DOLLAR-BASED STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AT A

CONSISTENT LEVEL MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO

PROTECT AGAINST VOLATILITY OF FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS

AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR LONGER-TERM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TO DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES, PRIMARILY

THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE

COMPANY WILL PARTIALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED THIRD-PARTY SALES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER ITS PLANNING CYCLE, TYPICALLY NO MORE

THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL LAYER IN

HEDGES OVER TIME, INCREASING THE PORTION OF SALES HEDGED AS IT

GETS CLOSER TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUCH THAT

IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. THE

PORTION OF SALES HEDGED IS BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF COST-BENEFIT

PROFILES THAT CONSIDER NATURAL OFFSETTING EXPOSURES, REVENUE AND

EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, AND THE COST OF

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES ARE A

SPECIFIED COMPONENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF SIMILARLY DENOMINATED

FOREIGN CURRENCY-BASED SALES TRANSACTIONS, EACH OF WHICH

RESPONDS TO THE HEDGED RISK IN THE SAME MANNER. MERCK MANAGES

ITS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH PURCHASED

LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS, WHICH PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A

RIGHT, BUT NOT AN OBLIGATION, TO SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE

FUTURE AT A PREDETERMINED PRICE. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED

SALES, TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS FULLY

OFFSET THE DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH

FLOWS OF THE HEDGED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. CONVERSELY, IF THE

U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS, THE OPTIONS VALUE REDUCES TO

ZERO, BUT THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF

THE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.

84

THE DESIGNATED HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON TOTAL CHANGES IN

THE OPTIONS CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ENTIRE FAIR VALUE

CHANGE IN THE OPTIONS IS DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) AND RECLASSIFIED INTO

SALES WHEN THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE

HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS PERFECTLY EFFECTIVE AND THEREFORE NO HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECORDED. THE FAIR VALUES OF CURRENCY OPTIONS

ARE REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OR OTHER ASSETS. THE CASH

FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS FROM THE EFFECTS OF

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEIR

CONVERSION TO U.S. DOLLARS. MERCK PRINCIPALLY UTILIZES

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO BUY AND

SELL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FUTURE AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES

AND ECONOMICALLY OFFSET THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE ON THE AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS DERIVED

FROM THE NET ASSETS. MERCK ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTS TO

FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE ON EXPOSURES DENOMINATED IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRY CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE

YEN. FOR EXPOSURES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CURRENCIES, THE COMPANY

WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ON A MORE LIMITED BASIS, AND

ONLY WHEN IT IS DEEMED ECONOMICAL TO DO SO BASED ON A

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

EXPOSURE, THE VOLATILITY OF THE EXCHANGE RATE AND THE COST OF

THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MINIMIZE THE

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE ON MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY

MANAGING OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND NET ASSET POSITIONS AT THE

LOCAL LEVEL.

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

REMEASURED AT SPOT RATES IN EFFECT ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

WITH THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SPOT RATES REPORTED IN OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. THE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED

AS HEDGES AND ARE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH OTHER (INCOME)

EXPENSE, NET. ACCORDINGLY, FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

CONTRACTS HELP MITIGATE THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE

REMEASURED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE

SPOT-FORWARD DIFFERENCES. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT

DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS, WHICH TYPICALLY

HAVE AVERAGE MATURITIES AT INCEPTION OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR.

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

SECURITIES DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN SPOT RATES ARE OFFSET IN OTHER

(INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, BY THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

CONTRACTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPOT RATE FLUCTUATIONS. HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL DURING 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTS FAIR VALUE DUE TO SPOT-FORWARD

DIFFERENCES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DESIGNATED HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

AND RECOGNIZED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. THESE AMOUNTS

WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006,

2005 AND 2004.

THE FAIR VALUES OF FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED IN

THE FOLLOWING FOUR BALANCE SHEET LINE ITEMS: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

(CURRENT PORTION OF GAIN POSITION), OTHER ASSETS (NON-CURRENT

PORTION OF GAIN POSITION), ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

(CURRENT PORTION OF LOSS POSITION), OR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND

NONCURRENT LIABILITIES (NON-CURRENT PORTION OF LOSS POSITION).

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ON CERTAIN

INVESTING AND BORROWING TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE ITS NET EXPOSURE

TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND TO REDUCE ITS OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE LEVERAGED SWAPS AND, IN

GENERAL, DOES NOT LEVERAGE ANY OF ITS INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES THAT

WOULD PUT PRINCIPAL CAPITAL AT RISK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY TO SEVEN

PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE

NOTES. THERE IS ONE SWAP MATURING IN 2007 WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT

OF $350 MILLION; TWO SWAPS MATURING IN 2011 WITH NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF $125 MILLION EACH; ONE SWAP MATURING IN 2013

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION AND THREE SWAPS

MATURING IN 2015 WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $250 MILLION

EACH. THE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS

TO FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE

NOTES ARE FULLY OFFSET IN INTEREST EXPENSE BY THE FAIR VALUE

CHANGES IN THE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE

CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OTHER ASSETS,

ACCRUED AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, OR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

AND NONCURRENT

85

LIABILITIES. THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS

OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

(AJCA) THE COMPANY REPATRIATED $15.9 BILLION

DURING 2005 (SEE NOTE 17). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

$5.2 BILLION OF THE AJCA REPATRIATION WAS INVESTED IN FULLY

COLLATERALIZED OVERNIGHT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND WAS INCLUDED

IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. IN

MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

IN 2000, THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION

(SCHERING-PLOUGH) (COLLECTIVELY THE

PARTNERS) ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO CREATE SEPARATE

EQUALLY-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET IN THE UNITED

STATES NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT

AND RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AREAS. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY

PROVIDE FOR EQUAL SHARING OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND FOR

CO-PROMOTION OF APPROVED PRODUCTS BY EACH COMPANY. IN 2001, THE

CHOLESTEROL-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO

INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, EXCLUDING JAPAN. IN

2002, EZETIMIBE, THE FIRST IN A NEW CLASS OF

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENTS, WAS LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES

AS

ZETIA

(MARKETED AS

EZETROL

OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES). AS REPORTED BY THE MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH CHOLESTEROL

PARTNERSHIP (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP), GLOBAL SALES OF

ZETIA

TOTALED $1.93 BILLION IN 2006,

$1.4 BILLION IN 2005 AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2004. IN JULY

2004, A COMBINATION PRODUCT CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF

BOTH

ZETIA

AND

ZOCOR

, WAS APPROVED IN THE UNITED

STATES AS

VYTORIN

(MARKETED AS

INEGY

OUTSIDE OF

THE UNITED STATES). GLOBAL SALES OF

VYTORIN

WERE

$1.96 BILLION IN 2006, $1.0 BILLION IN 2005 AND

$132.4 MILLION IN 2004.

THE CHOLESTEROL AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE SHARING OF OPERATING

INCOME GENERATED BY THE MSP PARTNERSHIP BASED UPON PERCENTAGES

THAT VARY BY PRODUCT, SALES LEVEL AND COUNTRY. IN THE

U.S. MARKET, THE PARTNERS SHARE PROFITS ON

ZETIA

AND

VYTORIN

EQUALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST

$300 MILLION OF ANNUAL

ZETIA

SALES, ON WHICH

SCHERING-PLOUGH RECEIVES A GREATER SHARE OF PROFITS. OPERATING

INCOME INCLUDES EXPENSES THAT THE PARTNERS HAVE CONTRACTUALLY

AGREED TO SHARE, SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANUFACTURING COSTS,

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED PROMOTION COSTS (INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

ADVERTISING AND DIRECT AND IDENTIFIABLE

OUT-OF-POCKET

PROMOTION) AND OTHER AGREED UPON COSTS FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES

SUCH AS ON-GOING CLINICAL RESEARCH, MARKET SUPPORT, MARKET

RESEARCH, MARKET EXPANSION, AS WELL AS A SPECIALTY SALES FORCE

AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUPPORT

OF THE MSP PARTNERSHIP BUT NOT SHARED BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, SUCH

AS MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (INCLUDING CERTAIN

SALES FORCE COSTS), AS WELL AS CERTAIN MANUFACTURING COSTS, ARE

NOT INCLUDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES.

88

HOWEVER, THESE COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THE

COMPANY. CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY

SHARED EQUALLY BY THE PARTNERS, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR EARNED

MILESTONES.

THE RESPIRATORY THERAPEUTIC AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE JOINT

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING BY THE PARTNERS OF A ONCE-DAILY,

FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND LORATADINE. MONTELUKAST SODIUM IS SOLD BY

MERCK AS

SINGULAIR

AND LORATADINE IS SOLD BY

SCHERING-PLOUGH AS CLARITIN. IN JANUARY 2002, THE RESPIRATORY

PARTNERSHIP REPORTED ON RESULTS OF PHASE III CLINICAL

TRIALS OF A FIXED-COMBINATION TABLET CONTAINING MONTELUKAST

SODIUM AND LORATADINE. THIS PHASE III STUDY DID NOT

DEMONSTRATE SUFFICIENT ADDED BENEFITS IN THE TREATMENT OF

SEASONAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS. ALTHOUGH THE MONTELUKAST SODIUM AND

LORATADINE COMBINATION TABLET DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL IN ANY

COUNTRY, PHASE III CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT IS ONGOING.

ASTRAZENECA

LP

IN 1982, MERCK ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ASTRA AB

(ASTRA) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET ASTRAS PRODUCTS

UNDER A ROYALTY-BEARING LICENSE. IN 1993, THE COMPANYS

TOTAL SALES OF ASTRA PRODUCTS REACHED A LEVEL THAT TRIGGERED THE

FIRST STEP IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT VENTURE BUSINESS

CARRIED ON BY ASTRA MERCK INC. (AMI), IN WHICH MERCK

AND ASTRA EACH OWNED A 50% SHARE. THIS JOINT VENTURE, FORMED IN

1994, DEVELOPED AND MARKETED MOST OF ASTRAS NEW

PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING

PRILOSEC,

THE FIRST OF A CLASS OF MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS, WHICH SLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ACID FROM

THE CELLS OF THE STOMACH LINING.

IN 1998, MERCK AND ASTRA COMPLETED THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE

OWNERSHIP AND OPERATIONS OF THE JOINT VENTURE WHEREBY THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED ASTRAS INTEREST IN AMI, RENAMED KBI INC.

(KBI), AND CONTRIBUTED KBIS OPERATING ASSETS

TO A NEW U.S. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, ASTRA PHARMACEUTICALS

L.P. (THE PARTNERSHIP), IN EXCHANGE FOR A 1% LIMITED

PARTNER INTEREST. ASTRA CONTRIBUTED THE NET ASSETS OF ITS WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ASTRA USA, INC., TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN

EXCHANGE FOR A 99% GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST. THE PARTNERSHIP,

RENAMED ASTRAZENECA LP (AZLP) UPON ASTRAS 1999

MERGER WITH ZENECA GROUP PLC (THE ASTRAZENECA

MERGER), BECAME THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF THE PRODUCTS

FOR WHICH KBI RETAINED RIGHTS.

WHILE MAINTAINING A 1% LIMITED PARTNER INTEREST IN AZLP, MERCK

HAS CONSENT AND PROTECTIVE RIGHTS INTENDED TO PRESERVE ITS

BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

POWER OF THE GENERAL PARTNER TO MAKE CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS OR

DISPOSITIONS. FURTHERMORE, IN LIMITED EVENTS OF DEFAULT,

ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WILL BE GRANTED TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING

POWERS TO DIRECT THE ACTIONS OF, OR REMOVE AND REPLACE, THE

PARTNERSHIPS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER. MERCK EARNS ONGOING REVENUE BASED ON SALES OF CURRENT

AND FUTURE KBI PRODUCTS AND SUCH REVENUE WAS $1.8 BILLION,

$1.7 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RELATING TO SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

IN ADDITION, MERCK EARNS CERTAIN PARTNERSHIP

RETURNS WHICH ARE RECORDED IN EQUITY INCOME FROM AFFILIATES AS

REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. SUCH RETURNS INCLUDE A PRIORITY

RETURN PROVIDED FOR IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, VARIABLE

RETURNS BASED, IN PART, UPON SALES OF CERTAIN FORMER ASTRA USA,

INC. PRODUCTS, AND A PREFERENTIAL RETURN REPRESENTING

MERCKS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED AZLP GAAP EARNINGS. THE

ASTRAZENECA MERGER TRIGGERS A PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF MERCKS

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN 2008. UPON THIS REDEMPTION, AZLP

WILL DISTRIBUTE TO KBI AN AMOUNT BASED PRIMARILY ON A MULTIPLE

OF MERCKS AVERAGE ANNUAL VARIABLE RETURNS DERIVED FROM

SALES OF THE FORMER ASTRA USA, INC. PRODUCTS FOR THE THREE YEARS

PRIOR TO THE REDEMPTION (THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF

AGREED VALUE).

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING, FOR A PAYMENT OF

$443.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS DEFERRED, ASTRA PURCHASED AN

OPTION (THE ASSET OPTION) TO BUY MERCKS

INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING THE GASTROINTESTINAL

MEDICINES

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC.

THE ASSET OPTION IS

EXERCISABLE IN 2010 AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE NET

PRESENT VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 OF PROJECTED FUTURE

PRETAX REVENUE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FROM THE KBI

PRODUCTS (THE APPRAISED VALUE). MERCK ALSO HAS THE

RIGHT TO REQUIRE ASTRA TO PURCHASE SUCH INTEREST IN 2008 AT THE

APPRAISED VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY GRANTED ASTRA AN

OPTION TO BUY MERCKS COMMON STOCK INTEREST IN KBI,

EXERCISABLE TWO YEARS AFTER ASTRAS PURCHASE OF

MERCKS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS. THE EXERCISE OF THIS

OPTION BY ASTRA IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR IN THE YEAR 2017 OR IF

COMBINED ANNUAL SALES OF THE TWO PRODUCTS FALL BELOW A MINIMUM

AMOUNT PROVIDED, IN EACH CASE, ONLY SO LONG AS EITHER THE MERCK

OPTION IN 2008 OR ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 HAS BEEN

EXERCISED. THE EXERCISE PRICE IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE

OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SALES OF

NEXIUM

AND

PRILOSEC

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE.

89

THE 1999 ASTRAZENECA MERGER CONSTITUTED A TRIGGER EVENT UNDER

THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, IN

EXCHANGE FOR MERCKS RELINQUISHMENT OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE

ASTRA PRODUCTS WITH NO EXISTING OR PENDING U.S. PATENTS AT

THE TIME OF THE MERGER, ASTRA PAID $967.4 MILLION (THE

ADVANCE PAYMENT), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A

TRUE-UP

CALCULATION IN 2008 THAT MAY REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ALL OR A

PORTION OF THIS AMOUNT. THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IN 2008 OF

THE ASTRA PRODUCT RIGHTS RETAINED BY THE COMPANY. ACCORDINGLY,

RECOGNITION OF THIS CONTINGENT INCOME HAS BEEN DEFERRED UNTIL

THE REALIZABLE AMOUNT, IF ANY, IS DETERMINABLE, WHICH IS NOT

ANTICIPATED PRIOR TO 2008.

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE KBI RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENTS,

BECAUSE A TRIGGER EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE SUM OF THE LIMITED

PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE, THE APPRAISED VALUE AND THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT IS GUARANTEED TO BE A MINIMUM OF $4.7 BILLION.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIMITED PARTNER SHARE OF AGREED VALUE AND

PAYMENT OF THE

TRUE-UP

AMOUNT WILL OCCUR IN 2008. ASTRAZENECAS PURCHASE OF

MERCKS INTEREST IN THE KBI PRODUCTS IS CONTINGENT UPON THE

EXERCISE OF EITHER MERCKS OPTION IN 2008 OR

ASTRAZENECAS OPTION IN 2010 AND, THEREFORE, PAYMENT OF THE

APPRAISED VALUE MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.

SANOFI

PASTEUR MSD

IN 1994, MERCK AND PASTEUR MÉRIEUX CONNAUGHT (NOW SANOFI

PASTEUR S.A.) ESTABLISHED AN EQUALLY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE TO

MARKET VACCINES IN EUROPE AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT

OF COMBINATION VACCINES FOR DISTRIBUTION IN EUROPE. JOINT

VENTURE VACCINE SALES WERE $913.9 MILLION FOR 2006,

$865.1 MILLION FOR 2005 AND $807.0 MILLION FOR 2004.

MERIAL

LIMITED

IN 1997, MERCK AND RHÔNE-POULENC S.A. (NOW SANOFI-AVENTIS

S.A.) COMBINED THEIR ANIMAL HEALTH AND POULTRY GENETICS

BUSINESSES TO FORM MERIAL LIMITED (MERIAL), A

FULLY INTEGRATED ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY, WHICH IS A STAND-ALONE

JOINT VENTURE, EQUALLY OWNED BY EACH PARTY. MERIAL PROVIDES A

COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES TO ENHANCE

THE HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL

SPECIES. MERIAL SALES WERE $2.2 BILLION FOR 2006,

$2.0 BILLION FOR 2005 AND $1.8 BILLION FOR 2004.

JOHNSON &

JOHNSON

O

MERCK

CONSUMER PHARMACEUTICALS COMPANY

IN 1989, MERCK FORMED A JOINT VENTURE WITH JOHNSON &

JOHNSON TO DEVELOP AND MARKET A BROAD RANGE OF NONPRESCRIPTION

MEDICINES FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS 50% OWNED VENTURE WAS

EXPANDED INTO EUROPE IN 1993, AND INTO CANADA IN 1996. IN MARCH

2004, MERCK SOLD ITS 50% EQUITY STAKE IN ITS EUROPEAN JOINT

VENTURE TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON FOR $244.0 MILLION

AND RECORDED A $176.8 MILLION GAIN AS OTHER (INCOME)

EXPENSE, NET (SEE NOTE 16). MERCK WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT

THROUGH ROYALTIES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND ALSO REGAINED THE

RIGHTS TO POTENTIAL FUTURE PRODUCTS THAT SWITCH FROM

PRESCRIPTION TO

OVER-THE-COUNTER

STATUS IN EUROPE. SALES OF PRODUCT MARKETED BY THE JOINT

VENTURE, INCLUDING SALES OF THE EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE UP

THROUGH MARCH 2004, WERE $252.6 MILLION FOR 2006,

$253.3 MILLION FOR 2005 AND $315.3 MILLION FOR 2004.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD,

INCLUDING THE ABOVE JOINT VENTURES, TOTALED $3.5 BILLION AT

CONTINGENCIES

AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

OF A NATURE CONSIDERED NORMAL TO ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AS

WELL AS ADDITIONAL MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST ACTIONS. THE

COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY

AS ASSESSMENTS CHANGE OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, A PORTION OF THE

OVERALL ACCRUAL IS ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED AND CONSIDERS SUCH

FACTORS AS PAST EXPERIENCE, NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND

ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. INDIVIDUALLY

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LOSSES ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE

INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

THE COMPANYS DECISION TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE IS

DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING COST AND AVAILABILITY,

EXISTING AT THE TIME SUCH DECISIONS ARE MADE. AS A RESULT OF A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE HAS BECOME LESS

AVAILABLE WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE

COMPANY HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST

OF OBTAINING PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY

BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS AVAILABLE AND AS SUCH, HAS NO

INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE

AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD

AFTER THAT DATE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS

INSURANCE NEEDS AND THE COSTS, AVAILABILITY AND BENEFITS OF

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE.

VIOXX

LITIGATION

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, INDIVIDUAL AND PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS

ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY

AND/OR

ECONOMIC LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASE OR USE OF

VIOXX.

ALL SUCH ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT ARE

COORDINATED IN A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA

(THE MDL) BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE ELDON E. FALLON. A

NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS FILED IN STATE COURT ARE COORDINATED IN

SEPARATE COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS IN STATE COURTS IN NEW JERSEY,

CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, AND THE COUNTIES OF PHILADELPHIA,

PENNSYLVANIA AND CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN SERVED OR WAS AWARE THAT IT HAD BEEN

NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 27,400 LAWSUITS, WHICH

INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 46,100 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL

INJURIES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

, AND IN

APPROXIMATELY 264 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGING PERSONAL

INJURIES

AND/OR

ECONOMIC LOSS. (ALL OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH

ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS.) OF THESE LAWSUITS, APPROXIMATELY

8,300 LAWSUITS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 23,700 PLAINTIFF

GROUPS ARE OR ARE SLATED TO BE IN THE FEDERAL MDL AND

APPROXIMATELY 16,800 LAWSUITS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 16,800

PLAINTIFF GROUPS ARE INCLUDED IN A COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE CAROL E. HIGBEE.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CLAIMS OF OVER 4,025 PLAINTIFFS HAD BEEN

DISMISSED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. OF THESE, THERE HAVE

BEEN OVER 1,225 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED WITH

PREJUDICE (I.E., THEY CANNOT BE BROUGHT AGAIN) EITHER BY

PLAINTIFFS THEMSELVES OR BY THE COURTS. OVER 2,800 ADDITIONAL

PLAINTIFFS HAVE HAD THEIR CLAIMS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE

(I.E., THEY CAN BE BROUGHT AGAIN).

IN THE MDL, JUDGE FALLON IN JULY 2005 INDICATED THAT HE WOULD

SCHEDULE FOR TRIAL A SERIES OF CASES DURING THE PERIOD NOVEMBER

2005 THROUGH 2006, IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: (I) HEART

ATTACK WITH SHORT TERM USE; (II) HEART ATTACK WITH LONG

TERM USE; (III) STROKE; AND (IV) CARDIOVASCULAR INJURY

INVOLVING A PRESCRIPTION WRITTEN AFTER APRIL 2002 WHEN THE

LABELING FOR

VIOXX

WAS REVISED TO INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF

THE VIGOR TRIAL. THESE TRIALS BEGAN IN NOVEMBER 2005 AND

CONCLUDED IN DECEMBER 2006. THE NEXT SCHEDULED TRIAL IN THE MDL

IS A RE-TRIAL IN BARNETT V. MERCK ON THE ISSUE OF DAMAGES

AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

MERCK HAS ENTERED INTO A TOLLING AGREEMENT (THE TOLLING

AGREEMENT) WITH THE MDL PLAINTIFFS STEERING

COMMITTEE THAT ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE TO HALT THE RUNNING OF

THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS (TOLLING) AS TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF

CLAIMS ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX

BY NON-NEW

JERSEY CITIZENS. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT APPLIES TO INDIVIDUALS

WHO HAVE NOT FILED LAWSUITS AND MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY FILE

LAWSUITS AND ONLY TO THOSE

92

CLAIMANTS WHO SEEK TO TOLL CLAIMS ALLEGING INJURIES RESULTING

FROM A THROMBOTIC CARDIOVASCULAR EVENT THAT RESULTS IN A

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION OR ISCHEMIC STROKE. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT

PROVIDES COUNSEL ADDITIONAL TIME TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL CLAIMS.

THE TOLLING AGREEMENT REQUIRES ANY TOLLED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN

FEDERAL COURT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY

14,180 CLAIMANTS HAD ENTERED INTO TOLLING AGREEMENTS.

MERCK VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

FROM THE MARKET ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. MANY STATES HAVE A TWO-YEAR STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, REQUIRING THAT CLAIMS

MUST BE FILED WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS LEARNED OR

COULD HAVE LEARNED OF THEIR POTENTIAL CAUSE OF ACTION. AS A

RESULT, SOME MAY VIEW SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AS A DEADLINE FOR

FILING

VIOXX

CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, HOWEVER,

THAT THE LAW REGARDING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS CAN BE COMPLEX,

VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE, CAN BE FACT-SPECIFIC, AND IN SOME

CASES, MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE EXISTENCE OF PENDING CLASS

ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME STATES HAVE THREE YEAR STATUTES OF

LIMITATIONS AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

IS EVEN LONGER. MERCK EXPECTS THAT THERE WILL BE LEGAL ARGUMENTS

CONCERNING THE PROPER APPLICATION OF THESE STATUTES, AND THE

DECISIONS WILL BE UP TO THE JUDGES PRESIDING IN INDIVIDUAL CASES

IN STATE AND FEDERAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THE OUTCOMES OF SEVERAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT WERE TRIED PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 (SEE CHART BELOW).

IN AUGUST 2006, IN BARNETT V. MERCK, A CASE BEFORE JUDGE FALLON

IN THE MDL, A JURY IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA RETURNED A

PLAINTIFF VERDICT IN THE SECOND FEDERAL

VIOXX

CASE TO GO

TO TRIAL. THE JURY AWARDED $50 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES AND $1 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON

AUGUST 30, 2006, JUDGE FALLON OVERTURNED AS EXCESSIVE THE

DAMAGES PORTION OF THE VERDICT AND ORDERED A NEW TRIAL ON

DAMAGES. JUDGE FALLON HAS SET RE-TRIAL FOR OCTOBER 29, 2007

ON THE ISSUE OF DAMAGES. MERCK HAS FILED MOTIONS FOR A NEW TRIAL

ON ALL ISSUES AND FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, BOTH OF WHICH

ARE CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE COURT. PLAINTIFF HAS OPPOSED

MERCKS MOTION AND HAS ASKED THE JUDGE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT

OF THE AWARD RATHER THAN RE-TRY THE CASE.

JURIES FOUND IN FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS IN THE FOURTH AND

FIFTH CASES TO GO TO TRIAL IN THE MDL. THE JURY RETURNED ITS

VERDICT FOR MERCK IN MASON V. MERCK ON NOVEMBER 8,

2006 AND IN DEDRICK V. MERCK ON DECEMBER 13, 2006.

ON NOVEMBER 22, 2006, JUDGE FALLON DENIED A MOTION FILED IN

THE MDL TO CERTIFY A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF ALL PERSONS WHO

ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF TAKING

VIOXX.

ON DECEMBER 15, 2006, THE JURY IN ALBRIGHT V. MERCK, A CASE

TRIED IN STATE COURT IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT

FOR MERCK ON ALL COUNTS.

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THAT IN APRIL 2006, IN

GARZA V. MERCK, A JURY IN RIO GRANDE CITY, TEXAS RETURNED A

VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE TEXAS

STATE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS REQUEST TO INVESTIGATE

POSSIBLE JURY BIAS BECAUSE A JUROR ADMITTED THAT HE HAD, PRIOR

TO THE TRIAL, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BORROWED MONEY FROM THE

PLAINTIFF. ON DECEMBER 21, 2006, THE COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT

FOR PLAINTIFF IN THE AMOUNT OF $7.75 MILLION, PLUS

INTEREST, REDUCED FROM THE ORIGINAL AWARD OF $32 MILLION

BECAUSE OF THE TEXAS STATE CAP ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE COMPANY

IS SEEKING A NEW TRIAL AND WILL APPEAL THE VERDICT IF THE COURT

DOES NOT GRANT A NEW TRIAL.

ON OCTOBER 31, 2006, IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT IN LOS

ANGELES, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL BEGAN IN THE CASES APPELL V.

MERCK AND ARRIGALE V. MERCK. ON JANUARY 18, 2007,

JUDGE VICTORIA CHANEY DECLARED A MISTRIAL AS TO BOTH PLAINTIFFS

AFTER THE JURY REPORTED THAT IT WAS DEADLOCKED.

ON OCTOBER 5, 2006, IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN NEW

JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT, JUDGE HIGBEE DISMISSED CLAIMS OF THE

UNITED KINGDOM PLAINTIFFS. THESE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED.

THE FIRST CASE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN THE TEXAS COORDINATED

PROCEEDING, RIGBY V. MERCK, WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN TRIAL ON

NOVEMBER 7, 2006. THE RIGBY CASE WAS VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED

ON OCTOBER 23, 2006 WHEN THE PLAINTIFF FILED A NOTICE OF

NON-SUIT WITH THE COURT.

A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL, HERMANS V. MERCK AND HUMESTON V.

MERCK, BEGAN ON JANUARY 17, 2007, IN THE COORDINATED

PROCEEDING IN NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE.

HUMESTON V. MERCK WAS FIRST TRIED IN 2005, BUT JUDGE HIGBEE

SET ASIDE THE NOVEMBER 2005 JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF MERCK AND

ORDERED A NEW TRIAL ON THE

93

GROUNDS OF NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE. THE HERMANS/HUMESTON TRIAL

IS SEPARATED INTO TWO PHASES: A GENERAL PHASE REGARDING

MERCKS CONDUCT AND A PLAINTIFF-SPECIFIC PHASE. THERE WILL

BE JURY QUESTIONS AND A DELIBERATION AFTER PHASE I

REGARDING MERCKS CONDUCT. IF THE JURY ANSWERS ANY OF THE

QUESTIONS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THE CASE WILL MOVE TO

PHASE II. IN PHASE II EACH PLAINTIFF WILL PRESENT HIS

OR HER SPECIFIC CASE. AT THE END OF PHASE II, THE JURY WILL

DELIBERATE AND WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE

TWO PLAINTIFFS. THE JURY WILL ANSWER SEPARATE VERDICT SHEETS BUT

IN THE COURSE OF ONLY ONE DELIBERATION. IF THE CASE MOVES TO A

PUNITIVE PHASE, THERE WILL BE A SINGLE PRESENTATION FOR EACH

SIDE AND ONE JURY DELIBERATION FOR BOTH PLAINTIFFS.

THE FIRST CASE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN THE PHILADELPHIA

COORDINATED PROCEEDING, MCCOOL V. MERCK, WAS SCHEDULED TO

BEGIN TRIAL ON FEBRUARY 26, 2007. THE PLAINTIFF VOLUNTARILY

DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE HER CASE ON JANUARY 16, 2007.

ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2006, THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT,

APPELLATE DIVISION, HEARD ARGUMENT ON PLAINTIFFS APPEAL OF

JUDGE HIGBEES DISMISSAL OF THE SINCLAIR V. MERCK

CASE. THIS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION WAS ORIGINALLY FILED IN

DECEMBER 2004 AND SOUGHT THE CREATION OF A MEDICAL MONITORING

FUND. JUDGE HIGBEE HAD GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO

DISMISS IN MAY 2005. ON JANUARY 16, 2007, THE APPELLATE

DIVISION REVERSED THE DECISION AND REMANDED THE CASE BACK TO

JUDGE HIGBEE FOR FURTHER FACTUAL INQUIRY. THE COMPANY HAS

PETITIONED THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT FOR REVIEW OF THE

APPELLATE DIVISIONS DECISION.

TO DATE IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, OF THE

29 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL, THE

CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE DISMISSED, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE

WITHDRAWN FROM THE TRIAL CALENDAR BY PLAINTIFFS, AND JURIES HAVE

DECIDED IN MERCKS FAVOR NINE TIMES AND IN PLAINTIFFS

FAVOR FOUR TIMES. IN ADDITION, IN THE RECENT CALIFORNIA TRIAL

INVOLVING TWO PLAINTIFFS, THE JURY COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT FOR

EITHER PLAINTIFF AND A MISTRIAL WAS DECLARED. A NEW JERSEY STATE

JUDGE SET ASIDE ONE OF THE NINE MERCK VERDICTS. WITH RESPECT TO

THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK ALREADY HAS FILED AN

APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE CASES, AND IN

ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD

SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. IN ADDITION, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL WITH TWO

PLAINTIFFS IS CURRENTLY ONGOING IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN

NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE AND ANOTHER TRIAL,

SCHWALLER V. MERCK, HAS COMMENCED IN STATE COURT IN MADISON

COUNTY, ILLINOIS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JULY 29, 2005, A NEW JERSEY

STATE TRIAL COURT CERTIFIED A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF THIRD-PARTY

PAYORS (SUCH AS UNIONS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS) THAT PAID IN

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR THE

VIOXX

USED BY THEIR PLAN MEMBERS

OR INSUREDS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE SEEKS RECOVERY OF

CERTAIN

VIOXX

PURCHASE COSTS (PLUS PENALTIES) BASED ON

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE PURPORTED CLASS MEMBERS PAID MORE FOR

VIOXX

THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY KNOWN OF THE

PRODUCTS ALLEGED RISKS. MERCK BELIEVES THAT THE CLASS WAS

IMPROPERLY CERTIFIED. THE TRIAL COURTS RULING IS

PROCEDURAL ONLY; IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGATIONS, WHICH THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

DEFEND VIGOROUSLY. ON MARCH 31, 2006, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPERIOR COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, AFFIRMED THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON JULY 19, 2006, THE NEW JERSEY

SUPREME COURT DECIDED TO EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION TO HEAR THE

COMPANYS APPEAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISIONS DECISION.

ON AUGUST 24, 2006, THE APPELLATE DIVISION ORDERED A STAY

OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN SUPERIOR COURT PENDING A RULING BY THE

SUPREME COURT. ORAL ARGUMENT BEFORE THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT

IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN MARCH 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN SEPARATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

OF ALASKA, LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, MONTANA, TEXAS AND UTAH.

THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPANY MISREPRESENTED THE SAFETY

OF

VIOXX

AND SEEK (I) RECOVERY OF THE COST OF

VIOXX

PURCHASED OR REIMBURSED BY THE STATE AND ITS

AGENCIES; (II) REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL SUMS PAID BY THE STATE

AND ITS AGENCIES FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE TREATMENT OF

PERSONS INJURED BY

VIOXX

; (III) DAMAGES UNDER

VARIOUS COMMON LAW THEORIES;

AND/OR

(IV) REMEDIES

UNDER VARIOUS STATE STATUTORY THEORIES, INCLUDING STATE CONSUMER

AND/OR

FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR MEDICAID FRAUD STATUTES, INCLUDING

CIVIL PENALTIES.

SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, THE COMPANY AND VARIOUS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ALL OF THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED BY THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION

(THE JPML) TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BEFORE DISTRICT JUDGE STANLEY R.

CHESLER FOR INCLUSION IN A NATIONWIDE MDL (THE SHAREHOLDER

MDL). JUDGE CHESLER HAS CONSOLIDATED THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS FOR ALL PURPOSES. PLAINTIFFS REQUEST

CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF PURCHASERS OF COMPANY STOCK BETWEEN

MAY 21, 1999 AND OCTOBER 29, 2004. THE COMPLAINT

ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND

20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE COSTS OF SUIT,

INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ASSERTS A

CLAIM UNDER SECTION 20A OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT

AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS RELATING TO THEIR SALES OF MERCK

STOCK. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS UNDER

SECTIONS 11, 12 AND 15 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 THAT

CERTAIN DEFENDANTS MADE INCOMPLETE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN

A REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND CERTAIN PROSPECTUSES FILED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE MERCK STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN, A DIVIDEND

REINVESTMENT PLAN. DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE

COMPLAINT. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE MOTION TO DISMISS IS SCHEDULED

TO TAKE PLACE IN MARCH 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 15, 2005, A COMPLAINT

WAS FILED IN OREGON STATE COURT BY THE STATE OF OREGON THROUGH

THE OREGON STATE TREASURER ON BEHALF OF THE OREGON PUBLIC

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUND AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT

AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS

BROUGHT UNDER OREGON SECURITIES LAW, ALLEGES THAT PLAINTIFF HAS

SUFFERED DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PURCHASES OF MERCK

COMMON STOCK AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES DUE TO THE

COMPANYS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF LAW RELATED TO DISCLOSURES

ABOUT

VIOXX.

THE CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS

AND DIRECTORS HAVE ENTERED INTO A TOLLING AGREEMENT AND, ON

JUNE 30, 2006, WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE FROM THE

CASE. ON JULY 19, 2006, THE COURT DENIED THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT, BUT REQUIRED PLAINTIFF TO AMEND

THE COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ON

SEPTEMBER 21, 2006. MERCK FILED A MOTION TO REQUIRE

PLAINTIFFS TO MAKE THE COMPLAINT MORE DEFINITE AND CERTAIN,

WHICH WAS DENIED BY THE COURT. MERCK FILED AN ANSWER TO THE

COMPLAINT IN JANUARY 2007.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

FILED IN FEDERAL COURT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL

AND CONSOLIDATED FOR ALL PURPOSES BY JUDGE CHESLER (THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS). THE CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT AROSE OUT OF SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME FACTUAL

ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE MADE IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS. THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS, WHICH WERE

PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT TO ASSERT RIGHTS OF THE COMPANY, ASSERT

CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD PAST AND PRESENT AND

CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE

OF CORPORATE ASSETS, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, ABUSE OF CONTROL AND

GROSS MISMANAGEMENT. ON MAY 5, 2006, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENIED PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS

APPEAL OF THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION REFUSING THEM LEAVE

TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT IS CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, TWO

INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS MADE A DEMAND ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST MR. RAYMOND

GILMARTIN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO

THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

IN JULY 2006, THE BOARD RECEIVED ANOTHER

SHAREHOLDER LETTER DEMANDING THAT THE BOARD TAKE LEGAL ACTION

AGAINST THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT OF MERCK FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING

DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY RELATING TO THE COMPANYS ALLEGEDLY

IMPROPER MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

IN DECEMBER 2006, EACH OF

THESE DEMANDS WAS REJECTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPOINTED A

SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE COMPANYS ACTIONS PRIOR TO

ITS VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, TO ACT FOR THE BOARD

IN RESPONDING TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION MATTERS RELATED TO THE

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

, AND TO ADVISE THE BOARD WITH RESPECT

TO ANY ACTION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW. IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE RETAINED THE HONORABLE JOHN

S. MARTIN, JR. OF DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP TO

CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENTS

CONDUCT

96

WITH RESPECT TO THE CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY PROFILE OF

VIOXX

DURING THE PERIOD

VIOXX

WAS DEVELOPED AND MARKETED.

THE REVIEW WAS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 AND THE

FULL REPORT (INCLUDING APPENDICES) WAS MADE PUBLIC IN SEPTEMBER

2006.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (THE



VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS)

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHAREHOLDER MDL AND CONSOLIDATED

FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

RETIREMENT PLANS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE LAWSUITS MAKE

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS. ON OCTOBER 7, 2005, DEFENDANTS

MOVED TO DISMISS THE ERISA COMPLAINT. ON JULY 11, 2006,

JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS.

INTERNATIONAL

LAWSUITS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LITIGATION

RELATING TO

VIOXX

IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS) IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS

CANADA, BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, TURKEY, AND ISRAEL.

ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS

BASED ON MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER SOURCES, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

INSURANCE

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$630 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTIBLES AND CO-INSURANCE. THIS

INSURANCE PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND

POTENTIAL DAMAGE AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE INCURRED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE EXTENDS TO

ADDITIONAL

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS THAT MAY BE

FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

INSURANCE COVERAGE APPLICABLE TO THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER

LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS

FIDUCIARY AND OTHER INSURANCE FOR THE

VIOXX

ERISA

LAWSUITS WITH STATED UPPER LIMITS OF APPROXIMATELY

$275 MILLION. ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THESE

CLAIMS MAY ALSO BE AVAILABLE UNDER UPPER-LEVEL EXCESS POLICIES

THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THERE ARE DISPUTES

WITH CERTAIN INSURERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF

THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL

DISPUTES. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO

THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS

DEFENSE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANYS UPPER LEVEL EXCESS

INSURERS (WHICH PROVIDE EXCESS INSURANCE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE

TO ALL OF THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) HAVE COMMENCED AN

ARBITRATION SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO CANCEL THOSE

POLICIES, TO VOID ALL OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THOSE POLICIES

AND TO RAISE OTHER COVERAGE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. MERCK INTENDS TO CONTEST VIGOROUSLY THE

INSURERS CLAIMS AND WILL ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS

UNDER APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES. THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY

RECOVERED UNDER THE POLICIES DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION MAY BE

LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY WAS

ADVISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT IT WAS COMMENCING AN

INFORMAL INQUIRY CONCERNING

VIOXX.

ON JANUARY 28,

2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE SEC

ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF INVESTIGATION. ALSO, THE COMPANY HAS

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE

DOJ) REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

CERTAIN CITIES IN EUROPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY

CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT CONCERNING

VIOXX.

THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH

97

THESE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS

(THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY

CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INQUIRIES; HOWEVER, THEY

COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL DISPOSITIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF

CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS (CID) FROM A GROUP OF

ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM 31 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA WHO ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANY VIOLATED

STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN MARKETING

VIOXX.

THE

COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN RESPONDING

TO THE CIDS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN SEPTEMBER 2006

FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS

AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF

VIOXX

ON

CALIFORNIAS MEDI-CAL FORMULARY. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

RESERVES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED THROUGHOUT 2007. A

TRIAL IN THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2007, BUT

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT

DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY

RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING FOR

THOSE CASES IN WHICH VERDICTS OR JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN ENTERED

AGAINST THE COMPANY, AND ARE NOW IN POST-VERDICT PROCEEDINGS OR

ON APPEAL. IN EACH OF THOSE CASES THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS

STRONG POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL AND THEREFORE THAT UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOMES IN SUCH CASES ARE NOT PROBABLE. UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN

THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION (AS DEFINED BELOW) COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A

LOSS CONTINGENCY ARE ACCRUED WHEN PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD A

RESERVE OF $685 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE, INCLUDING $175 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS

(COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE

THIRD QUARTER AND FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED

CHARGES OF $598 MILLION AND $75 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE

COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION TO

$858 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN INCREASING THE

RESERVE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THE SAME FACTORS THAT IT

CONSIDERED WHEN IT PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT NOW BELIEVES IT HAS A BETTER

ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPENSES AND CAN REASONABLY

ESTIMATE SUCH COSTS THROUGH 2008. SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND ONGOING REVIEW OF

THE RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WERE AS

FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY; THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE STRATEGY AND

STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE SCOPE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION;

THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY; THE COSTS

AND OUTCOMES OF COMPLETED TRIALS AND THE MOST CURRENT

INFORMATION REGARDING ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES AND TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EVENTS SUCH AS SCHEDULED TRIALS,

THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT 2007 AND INTO 2008, AND

THE INHERENT INABILITY TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOMES OF SUCH

TRIALS, LIMIT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE

ITS LEGAL COSTS BEYOND THE END OF 2008. THE COMPANY WILL

CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE

ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED RESERVES.

OTHER

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING

FOSAMAX

(THE 

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 104 CASES HAD BEEN FILED AGAINST MERCK

IN EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE COURT, INCLUDING 4 CASES WHICH SEEK

CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION, AS WELL AS DAMAGES AND MEDICAL

MONITORING. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW,

98

GENERALLY SUBSEQUENT TO INVASIVE DENTAL PROCEDURES SUCH AS TOOTH

EXTRACTION OR DENTAL IMPLANTS,

AND/OR

DELAYED HEALING, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF

FOSAMAX.

ON AUGUST 16, 2006, THE JPML ORDERED THAT THE

FOSAMAX

PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS NATIONWIDE

SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION (THE 

FOSAMAX

MDL) FOR COORDINATED

PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE

FOSAMAX

MDL HAS BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE JOHN KEENAN IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AS A RESULT OF THE

JPML ORDER, OVER 80 CASES ARE BEFORE JUDGE KEENAN. JUDGE KEENAN

HAS ISSUED A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER SETTING FORTH A SCHEDULE

GOVERNING THE PROCEEDINGS WHICH FOCUSES PRIMARILY UPON RESOLVING

THE CLASS ACTION CERTIFICATION MOTIONS IN 2007. THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A RESERVE

OF APPROXIMATELY $48 MILLION SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. SOME OF THE

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

RESERVE FOR THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY THUS

FAR; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEGAL DEFENSE

STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE CREATION OF THE

FOSAMAX

MDL; THE NUMBER OF CASES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST

THE COMPANY; AND THE ANTICIPATED TIMING, PROGRESSION, AND

RELATED COSTS OF PRE-TRIAL ACTIVITIES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS LEGAL

DEFENSE COSTS AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ASSOCIATED

RESERVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF LITIGATION, THE COMPANY

IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS COSTS BEYOND THE END OF 2008.

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

FOSAMAX

LITIGATION COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMMERCIAL

LITIGATION

BEGINNING IN 1993, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A NUMBER OF

ANTITRUST SUITS, CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE CERTIFIED AS CLASS

ACTIONS, INSTITUTED BY MOST OF THE NATIONS RETAIL

PHARMACIES AND CONSUMERS IN SEVERAL STATES. THE COMPANY SETTLED

THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTION, WHICH REPRESENTED THE SINGLE LARGEST

GROUP OF CLAIMS AND HAS SETTLED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

REMAINING CASES ON SATISFACTORY TERMS. THE FEW REMAINING CASES

HAVE BEEN INACTIVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ENGAGED IN ANY CONSPIRACY AND NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING WAS

MADE OR INCLUDED IN ANY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY WAS JOINED IN ONGOING

LITIGATION ALLEGING MANIPULATION BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

OF AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES (AWP), WHICH ARE

SOMETIMES USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT DETERMINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

SECTOR REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. IN 2002, THE JPML ORDERED THE

TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATION OF ALL PENDING FEDERAL AWP CASES TO

FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED ONE

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH AGGREGATED THE CLAIMS

PREVIOUSLY FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ACTIONS AND

ALSO EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE SOME WHICH,

LIKE THE COMPANY, HAD NOT BEEN DEFENDANTS IN ANY PRIOR PENDING

CASE. IN MAY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION AND DISMISSED THE

COMPANY FROM THE CLASS ACTION CASE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE

COMPANYS DISMISSAL, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, WHICH DID NOT NAME THE

COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT. THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN SIMILAR

COMPLAINTS PENDING IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURT BROUGHT

INDIVIDUALLY BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS ARE AWAITING THE FINAL

RULING ON THEIR MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE SUFFOLK COUNTY CASE,

WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE NEW YORK COUNTY CASES TO BE FILED. IN

ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY WAS A

DEFENDANT IN STATE CASES BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF

KENTUCKY, ILLINOIS, ALABAMA, WISCONSIN, MISSISSIPPI, ARIZONA,

HAWAII AND ALASKA, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN ANTITRUST CASES IN FEDERAL COURT IN MINNESOTA AND

IN STATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA, EACH ALLEGING AN UNLAWFUL

CONSPIRACY AMONG DIFFERENT SETS OF PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

TO PROTECT HIGH PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES BY IMPEDING

IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF LOWER-PRICED

PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CANADA. THE COURT DISMISSED THE FEDERAL

CLAIMS IN THE MINNESOTA CASE WITH PREJUDICE AND THE PLAINTIFFS

FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

EIGHTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF THE FEDERAL CLAIMS. THE

STATE CLAIMS IN THAT ACTION WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE,

BUT HAVE NOT BEEN REFILED IN ANY JURISDICTION.

99

IN THE CALIFORNIA ANTITRUST ACTION, THE PARTIES ENGAGED IN

DISCOVERY AND THE DEFENDANT MANUFACTURERS FILED FOR SUMMARY

JUDGMENT. IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT

IN FAVOR OF MERCK AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS AND DISMISSED THE

CASE. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL IN THE

CALIFORNIA STATE APPEALS COURT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, A SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN ALABAMA BY

TWO PROVIDERS OF HEALTH SERVICES TO NEEDY PATIENTS ALLEGES THAT

15 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OVERCHARGED THE PLAINTIFFS AND A

CLASS OF THOSE SIMILARLY SITUATED, FOR PHARMACEUTICALS PURCHASED

BY THE PLAINTIFFS UNDER THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY

SECTION 340B OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. THE COMPANY

AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

ON NUMEROUS GROUNDS WHICH WAS RECENTLY DENIED BY THE COURT.

AFTER DENIAL OF THE MOTION TO DISMISS, THE CASE WAS DISMISSED

VOLUNTARILY BY THE PARTIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2003, THE DOJ NOTIFIED THE

FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO

INTERVENE AT THAT TIME IN A PENDING FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT

CASE THAT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL IN DECEMBER 1999 AGAINST THE

COMPANY. THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER UNSEALING THE COMPLAINT,

WHICH WAS FILED BY A PHYSICIAN IN LOUISIANA, AND ORDERED THAT

THE COMPLAINT BE SERVED. THE COMPLAINT, WHICH ALLEGED THAT THE

COMPANYS DISCOUNTING OF

PEPCID

IN CERTAIN LOUISIANA

HOSPITALS LED TO INCREASES IN COSTS TO MEDICAID, WAS DISMISSED.

AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED UNDER SEAL AND THE CASE HAS BEEN

ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED BY THE COURT UNTIL THE SEAL IS LIFTED.

THE STATE OF LOUISIANA HAS FILED ITS OWN AMENDED COMPLAINT,

INCORPORATING THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED AMENDED

COMPLAINT. THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SEALED AMENDED

COMPLAINT ARE UNKNOWN.

IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY WAS NAMED IN A QUI TAM LAWSUIT UNDER

THE NEVADA FALSE CLAIMS ACT. THE SUIT, IN WHICH THE NEVADA

ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS INTERVENED, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY

INAPPROPRIATELY OFFERED NOMINAL PRICING AND OTHER MARKETING AND

PRICING INDUCEMENTS TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND ALSO FAILED TO

COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MEDICAID BEST PRICE SCHEME

RELATED TO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION WAS DENIED BY THE DISTRICT COURT.

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING AGAINST THIS LAWSUIT.

GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A SUBPOENA

FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND SAMPLES. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

REPORTED THAT IT HAS RECEIVED A CID FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

TEXAS REGARDING THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND SELLING

ACTIVITIES RELATING TO TEXAS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED ANOTHER CID FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS

ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS

MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO TEXAS, INCLUDING

WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF ITS NOMINAL PRICING PROGRAMS AND

SAMPLES. IN APRIL 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE

OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN

CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS

INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,

MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA. IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

LETTER REQUEST FROM THE DOJ IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION

OF THE COMPANYS PRICING OF

PEPCID.

IN SEPTEMBER

2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE ILLINOIS ATTORNEY

GENERAL. THE SUBPOENA SEEKS INFORMATION RELATED TO REPACKAGING

OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY RELATING TO MERCK

IN THE ILLINOIS MATTER IN 2006.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE DOJ ADVISING IT OF THE EXISTENCE OF A QUI TAM COMPLAINT

ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY VIOLATED CERTAIN RULES RELATED TO ITS

CALCULATIONS OF BEST PRICE AND OTHER FEDERAL PRICING BENCHMARK

CALCULATIONS, CERTAIN OF WHICH MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

MEDICAID REBATE OBLIGATION. THE DOJ HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY

THAT IT DOES NOT INTEND TO INTERVENE IN THIS ACTION AND HAS

CLOSED ITS INVESTIGATION. THE LAWSUIT CONTINUES, HOWEVER.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS;

HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FROM

TIME TO TIME, OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN REGULATORS OR

AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK INFORMATION ABOUT PRACTICES IN THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY OR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES

IN INQUIRIES OTHER THAN THE INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS

SECTION. IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH

INQUIRIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON FEBRUARY 23, 2004, THE ITALIAN

ANTITRUST AUTHORITY (ICA) ADOPTED A MEASURE

COMMENCING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF MERCK SHARP &

DOHME (ITALIA) S.P.A. (MSD ITALY) AND THE COMPANY

UNDER

100

ARTICLE 14 OF THE ITALIAN COMPETITION LAW AND

ARTICLE 82 EC TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE COMPANY AND MSD

ITALY COMMITTED AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION BY REFUSING TO

GRANT TO ACS DOBFAR S.P.A. (DOBFAR), AN ITALIAN

COMPANY, A VOLUNTARY LICENSE UNDER THE COMPANYS ITALIAN

SUPPLEMENTARY PROTECTION CERTIFICATE (SPC), PURSUANT

TO DOMESTIC LEGISLATION PASSED IN 2002, TO PERMIT DOBFAR TO

MANUFACTURE IMIPENEM AND CILASTATIN (I&C), THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN

TIENAM

, IN ITALY FOR SALE OUTSIDE

ITALY IN COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION HAD EXPIRED OR NEVER

EXISTED. A HEARING BEFORE THE ICA WAS HELD ON MAY 2, 2005

AND ON JUNE 17, 2005, THE ICA FOUND, ON A PRELIMINARY

BASIS, THAT THE COMPANYS REFUSAL TO GRANT THE LICENSE WAS

AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION, AND IMPOSED INTERIM MEASURES

REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO GRANT A LICENSE TO MANUFACTURE I&C

IN ITALY FOR STOCKPILING PURPOSES ONLY, UNTIL EXPIRATION OF THE

SPC. ON NOVEMBER 16, 2005, THE ITALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

DENIED THE COMPANYS APPEAL OF THE ICAS ORDER. THE

COMPANYS SPC EXPIRED IN JANUARY 2006. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE

THE ICA CONTINUED ON THE MERITS OF THE ARTICLE 82

INVESTIGATION AND, IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE MATTER, THE

COMPANY OFFERED A COMMITMENT TO THE ICA PURSUANT TO WHICH THE

COMPANY WOULD GRANT NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSES UNDER ITS ITALIAN SPC

FOR FINASTERIDE WITH RESPECT TO FINASTERIDE 5 MG FOR THE

TREATMENT OF BENIGN PROSTATE HYPERPLASIA. THE DEADLINE FOR THE

ICA TO ADOPT ITS FINAL DECISION AS TO WHETHER THE COMPANYS

COMMITMENT WARRANTS THE CLOSURE OF THE CASE IS MARCH 16,

2007.

VACCINE

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS A PARTY IN CLAIMS

BROUGHT UNDER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1987 IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, WHICH ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A

VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING VACCINATED WITH

VARIOUS BIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES AND RUBELLA

AND/OR

TRIVALENT VACCINES FOR MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS

M-M-R

II. THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE AUTISM,

WITH OR WITHOUT INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, EPILEPSY,

ENCEPHALITIS, ENCEPHALOPATHY, GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME AND

TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. THERE ARE NOW 6 CLAIMANTS PROCEEDING OR, TO

THE COMPANYS KNOWLEDGE, INTENDING TO PROCEED AGAINST THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY WILL DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS ALSO A PARTY TO

INDIVIDUAL AND CLASS ACTION PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PEDIATRIC VACCINES (E.G.,

HEPATITIS B VACCINE) THAT CONTAINED THIMEROSAL, A PRESERVATIVE

USED IN VACCINES. MERCK HAS NOT DISTRIBUTED

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING PEDIATRIC VACCINES IN THE

UNITED STATES SINCE THE FALL OF 2001. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 250 ACTIVE

THIMEROSAL RELATED LAWSUITS WITH APPROXIMATELY 670 PLAINTIFFS.

OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE OTHER VACCINE MANUFACTURERS WHO

PRODUCED PEDIATRIC VACCINES CONTAINING THIMEROSAL AS WELL AS

MANUFACTURERS OF THIMEROSAL. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL

INJURIES AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO THIMEROSAL FROM PEDIATRIC

VACCINES. TWO CASES SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2006 WERE

DISMISSED  ONE, A STATE COURT CASE IN OHIO

VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED BY THE PLAINTIFFS, AND THE SECOND, A

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT CASE IN TEXAS IN WHICH THE COURT ENTERED

SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANTS IN 2005 AND PLAINTIFFS

ULTIMATELY VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR APPEAL. THE COMPANY WILL

DEFEND AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING CASES OF THIS TYPE

EITHER DISMISSED OR STAYED ON THE GROUND THAT THE ACTION IS

PROHIBITED UNDER THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT (THE

VACCINE ACT). THE VACCINE ACT PROHIBITS ANY PERSON

FROM FILING OR MAINTAINING A CIVIL ACTION (IN STATE OR FEDERAL

COURT) SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER FOR

VACCINE-RELATED INJURIES UNLESS A PETITION IS FIRST FILED IN THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS (HEREINAFTER THE

VACCINE COURT). UNDER THE VACCINE ACT, BEFORE FILING

A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A VACCINE MANUFACTURER, THE PETITIONER

MUST EITHER (A) PURSUE HIS OR HER PETITION TO CONCLUSION IN

VACCINE COURT AND THEN TIMELY FILE AN ELECTION TO PROCEED WITH A

CIVIL ACTION IN LIEU OF ACCEPTING THE VACCINE COURTS

ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION OR (B) TIMELY EXERCISE A RIGHT

TO WITHDRAW THE PETITION PRIOR TO VACCINE COURT ADJUDICATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS. THE

COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE

PETITIONS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THE CASES WITH TRIAL DATES REFERRED

TO IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH AS HAVING BEEN DISMISSED WERE

BROUGHT BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE MADE A TIMELY

WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR VACCINE COURT PETITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 4,700 CASES

PENDING IN THE VACCINE COURT INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT

THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES

AND/OR

THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE CAUSE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. NOT ALL

OF THE THIMEROSAL-CONTAINING VACCINES INVOLVED IN THE VACCINE

COURT PROCEEDING ARE COMPANY VACCINES. THE COMPANY IS THE SOLE

SOURCE OF THE

M-M-R

II VACCINE DOMESTICALLY. IN JUNE

2007, THE SPECIAL MASTERS PRESIDING OVER

101

THE VACCINE COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN A HEARING

IN WHICH BOTH PETITIONERS AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL PRESENT

EVIDENCE ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THESE VACCINES CAN CAUSE AUTISM

SPECTRUM DISORDERS. THAT HEARING IS EXPECTED TO LAST A NUMBER OF

WEEKS. SINCE IT IS NOT A PARTY, THE COMPANY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE

IN THE PROCEEDINGS.

PATENT

LITIGATION

FROM TIME TO TIME, GENERIC MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS

(ANDAS) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC

FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBMITTED ANDAS TO THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES A GENERIC FORM OF

FOSAMAX

,

PRILOSEC, NEXIUM

,

PROPECIA, TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE COMPANYS (AND

ASTRAZENECAS IN THE CASE OF

PRILOSEC

AND

NEXIUM

) PATENTS CONCERNING THESE PRODUCTS. THE GENERIC

COMPANIES ANDAS GENERALLY INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF

NON-INFRINGEMENT, INVALIDITY AND UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE

PATENTS. GENERIC MANUFACTURERS HAVE RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL TO

MARKET A GENERIC FORM OF

PRILOSEC.

THE COMPANY HAS FILED

PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST COMPANIES

FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC ALENDRONATE (

FOSAMAX

),

FINASTERIDE (

PROPECIA

), DORZOLAMIDE (

TRUSOPT

) AND

DORZOLAMIDE/TIMOLOL (

COSOPT

), AND ASTRAZENECA AND THE

COMPANY HAVE FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUITS IN FEDERAL COURT

AGAINST COMPANIES FILING ANDAS FOR GENERIC OMEPRAZOLE

(

PRILOSEC

) AND ESOMEPRAZOLE (

NEXIUM

). SIMILAR

PATENT CHALLENGES EXIST IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE

COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITS PATENTS, WHICH IT

BELIEVES ARE VALID, AGAINST INFRINGEMENT BY GENERIC COMPANIES

ATTEMPTING TO MARKET PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATES OF

SUCH PATENTS. AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

OF THE OUTCOMES, WHICH, IF ADVERSE, COULD RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED PERIODS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THESE

PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, SCHERING PLOUGH CORPORATION (SCHERING

PLOUGH) RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A GENERIC COMPANY

INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ZETIA

AND THAT

IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENTS THAT ARE LISTED FOR

ZETIA.

MERCK AND SCHERING PLOUGH MARKET

ZETIA

THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE AND THEY ARE CONSIDERING THE

APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM A

GENERIC COMPANY INDICATING THAT IT HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

MONTELUKAST AND THAT IT IS CHALLENGING THE U.S. PATENT THAT IS

LISTED FOR

SINGULAIR

. THE COMPANY IS CONSIDERING THE

APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN

WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE

COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005.

BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION,

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE

UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND APRIL 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND

THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

U.S.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES

AFTER EACH PRODUCTS RESPECTIVE LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

IN MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA TRIAL DIVISION ISSUED A

DECISION REFUSING TO BAR THE APPROVAL OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE ON

THE GROUND THAT MERCKS PATENT FOR WEEKLY ALENDRONATE WAS

LIKELY INVALID. THIS DECISION CANNOT BE APPEALED AND GENERIC

ALENDRONATE WAS LAUNCHED IN CANADA IN JUNE 2005. IN JULY 2005,

MERCK WAS SUED IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA BY APOTEX SEEKING

DAMAGES FOR LOST SALES OF GENERIC WEEKLY ALENDRONATE DUE TO THE

PATENT PROCEEDING.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY APPEALED

A DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION (THE OPPOSITION

DIVISION) OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (THE

EPO) THAT REVOKED THE COMPANYS PATENT IN

EUROPE THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

ALENDRONATE. ON MARCH 14, 2006, THE BOARD OF APPEAL OF THE

EPO UPHELD THE DECISION OF THE OPPOSITION DIVISION. THUS,

PRESENTLY THE COMPANY IS NOT ENTITLED TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

FOSAMAX

IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS AFTER 2007. IN

ADDITION, MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE USE OF

ALENDRONATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ADVERSE DECISIONS IN GERMANY, HOLLAND

AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE DECISION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS

UPHELD ON APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THE DECISIONS IN

GERMANY AND HOLLAND.

IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY FILED LAWSUITS IN FEDERAL COURT

AGAINST BARR LABORATORIES, INC. AND TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL

INDUSTRIES LTD. (TEVA) ASSERTING THAT THEIR

RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES FOR MAKING THEIR ALENDRONATE

PRODUCTS WOULD INFRINGE ONE OR MORE PROCESS PATENTS OF THE

COMPANY.

102

ON OCTOBER 5, 2004, IN AN ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CHALLENGING

THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS AUSTRALIAN PATENT FOR THE

ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE, THE PATENT WAS FOUND

TO BE INVALID. THAT DECISION WAS UPHELD ON APPEAL.

IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JAPAN A PROCEEDING HAS

BEEN FILED CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS

JAPANESE PATENT FOR THE ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

ALENDRONATE.

ON JANUARY 18, 2006, THE COMPANY SUED HI-TECH PHARMACAL

CO., INC. (HI-TECH) OF AMITYVILLE, NEW YORK FOR

PATENT INFRINGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO HI-TECHS APPLICATION TO

THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF A GENERIC VERSION OF MERCKS

OPHTHALMIC DRUGS

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

, WHICH ARE

USED FOR TREATING ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN PEOPLE WITH

OCULAR HYPERTENSION OR GLAUCOMA. IN THE LAWSUIT, MERCK SUED TO

ENFORCE A PATENT COVERING AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT DORZOLAMIDE,

WHICH IS PRESENT IN BOTH

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT.

IN

THAT CASE, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT IN MERCKS

FAVOR AND HI-TECH APPEALED. A HEARING OF THE APPEAL WAS

CONDUCTED IN DECEMBER 2006 AND A DECISION IS PENDING. MERCK HAS

ELECTED NOT TO ENFORCE TWO U.S. PATENTS LISTED WITH THE FDA

WHICH COVER THE COMBINATION OF DORZOLAMIDE AND TIMOLOL, THE TWO

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN

COSOPT.

THIS LAWSUIT AUTOMATICALLY

STAYS FDA APPROVAL OF HI-TECHS ANDAS FOR

30 MONTHS FROM JANUARY 2006 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT

DECISION, WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE PATENT COVERING

DORZOLAMIDE PROVIDES EXCLUSIVITY FOR

TRUSOPT

AND

COSOPT

UNTIL OCTOBER 2008 (INCLUDING SIX MONTHS OF

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY). AFTER SUCH TIME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS TO DECLINE.

IN THE CASE OF OMEPRAZOLE, THE TRIAL COURT IN THE UNITED STATES

RENDERED AN OPINION IN OCTOBER 2002 UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF

THE COMPANYS AND ASTRAZENECAS PATENTS COVERING THE

STABILIZED FORMULATION OF OMEPRAZOLE AND RULING THAT ONE

DEFENDANTS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCT DID NOT INFRINGE THOSE

PATENTS. THE OTHER THREE DEFENDANTS PRODUCTS WERE FOUND TO

INFRINGE THE FORMULATION PATENTS. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE

DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS

PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN OTHER GENERIC

MANUFACTURERS OMEPRAZOLE PRODUCTS, THE TRIAL CONCLUDED IN

JUNE 2006 AND A DECISION IS PENDING.

THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA RECEIVED NOTICE IN OCTOBER 2005 THAT

RANBAXY LABORATORIES LIMITED (RANBAXY) HAS FILED AN

ANDA FOR ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS

PARAGRAPH IV CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM.

ON

NOVEMBER 21, 2005, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA SUED RANBAXY

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDINGLY,

FDA APPROVAL OF RANBAXYS ANDA IS STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS

UNTIL APRIL 2008 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY,

WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER. THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA

RECEIVED NOTICE IN JANUARY 2006 THAT IVAX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,

SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED BY TEVA, HAD FILED AN ANDA FOR

ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM. THE ANDA CONTAINS PARAGRAPH IV

CHALLENGES TO PATENTS ON

NEXIUM.

ON

MARCH 8, 2006, THE COMPANY AND ASTRAZENECA SUED TEVA IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDINGLY, FDA

APPROVAL OF TEVAS ANDA IS STAYED FOR 30 MONTHS UNTIL

SEPTEMBER 2008 OR UNTIL AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION, IF ANY,

WHICHEVER MAY OCCUR EARLIER.

IN THE CASE OF FINASTERIDE, AN ANDA HAS BEEN FILED SEEKING

APPROVAL OF A GENERIC VERSION OF

PROPECIA

AND ALLEGING

INVALIDITY OF THE COMPANYS PATENTS. THE COMPANY FILED A

PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF DELAWARE IN

SEPTEMBER 2004. IN 2006, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH

THE GENERIC COMPANY, DR. REDDYS LABORATORIES

(DRL), UNDER WHICH DRL MAY SELL A GENERIC 1 MG

FINASTERIDE PRODUCT BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2013.

IN EUROPE, THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPANIES SEEKING

REGISTRATION FOR GENERIC LOSARTAN (THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOR

COZAAR

). THE COMPANY HAS PATENT RIGHTS TO LOSARTAN VIA

LICENSE FROM E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY (DU

PONT). THE COMPANY AND DU PONT HAVE FILED PATENT

INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS COMPANIES IN PORTUGAL,

SPAIN AND NORWAY.

OTHER

LITIGATION

ON JULY 27, 2005, MERCK WAS SERVED WITH A FURTHER

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT FILED IN THE NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR

COURT FOR HUNTERDON COUNTY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THIS LAWSUIT SEEKS TO

RECOVER OR CANCEL COMPENSATION AWARDED TO THE COMPANYS

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN 2004, AND ASSERTS CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF

FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT. ON JULY 21,

2006, THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS BASED

ON PLAINTIFFS FAILURE TO MAKE PRE-SUIT DEMAND ON

MERCKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DENIED PLAINTIFFS

REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO AMEND. THUS, THIS CASE HAS BEEN TERMINATED.

103

IN NOVEMBER 2005, AN INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER DELIVERED A LETTER

TO THE BOARD ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY HAD SUSTAINED DAMAGES

THROUGH THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF ITS CHANGE IN CONTROL

SEPARATION BENEFITS PLAN (THE CIC PLAN) IN NOVEMBER

2004. THE SHAREHOLDER MADE A DEMAND ON THE BOARD TO TAKE LEGAL

ACTION AGAINST THE BOARDS CURRENT OR FORMER MEMBERS FOR

ALLEGEDLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE

ADOPTION OF THE CIC PLAN. IN RESPONSE TO THAT DEMAND LETTER, THE

INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD DETERMINED AT THE

NOVEMBER 22, 2005 BOARD MEETING THAT THE BOARD WOULD TAKE

THE SHAREHOLDERS REQUEST UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT

REMAINS UNDER CONSIDERATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 20, 2004, THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY GRANTED A

MOTION BY THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC. (MEDCO

HEALTH) AND CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO DISMISS A

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION INVOLVING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS REVENUE RECOGNITION PRACTICE FOR RETAIL

CO-PAYMENTS PAID BY INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM MEDCO HEALTH PROVIDES

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER ALLEGATIONS. THE

COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE

DECISION. ON DECEMBER 15, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT UPHELD MOST OF THE DISTRICT

COURTS DECISION DISMISSING THE SUIT, AND SENT THE ISSUE OF

WHETHER THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROPERLY REFUSED

THE SHAREHOLDER DEMAND RELATING TO THE COMPANYS TREATMENT

OF RETAIL CO-PAYMENTS BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR

RECONSIDERATION UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL STANDARD. PLAINTIFFS

MOVED TO REMAND THEIR ACTION TO STATE COURT ON AUGUST 18,

2006, AND THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THAT MOTION ON

FEBRUARY 1, 2007. THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT IS

CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY,

CHANCERY DIVISION, HUNTERDON COUNTY.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH,

THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH AGREED TO SETTLE, ON A CLASS ACTION

BASIS, A SERIES OF LAWSUITS ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA (THE

GRUER CASES). THE COMPANY, MEDCO HEALTH AND CERTAIN

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, WHERE CASES COMMENCED BY A

NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS IN A NUMBER OF

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO HEALTH IS THE

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, AS WELL AS TRUSTEES OF SUCH PLANS,

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY AGREED TO

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SIGNIFICANT COST

AND DISTRACTION OF PROLONGED LITIGATION. THE PROPOSED CLASS

SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE OF THE CASES

FILED AGAINST MEDCO HEALTH AND THE COMPANY. UNDER THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH HAVE AGREED TO PAY A

TOTAL OF $42.5 MILLION, AND MEDCO HEALTH HAS AGREED TO

MODIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TO CONTINUE CERTAIN

SPECIFIED BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE

FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT MEMBERS OF THE

SETTLEMENT CLASS, WHICH INCLUDES ERISA PLANS FOR WHICH MEDCO

HEALTH ADMINISTERED A PHARMACY BENEFIT AT ANY TIME SINCE

DECEMBER 17, 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD HEARINGS TO HEAR

OBJECTIONS TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND

APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT IN 2004, BUT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE

NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBER PLANS THAT HAVE PROPERLY ELECTED NOT TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT BECOMES FINAL ONLY

IF AND WHEN ALL APPEALS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. CERTAIN CLASS MEMBER

PLANS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

SETTLEMENT. CASES INITIATED BY THREE SUCH PLANS AND TWO

INDIVIDUALS REMAIN PENDING IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES HAVE ASSERTED CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA AS

WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR

SIMILAR TO THE CLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN ASSERTED BY SETTLING CLASS

MEMBERS IN THE GRUER CASES. THE COMPANY AND MEDCO HEALTH ARE

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES.

THREE NOTICES OF APPEAL WERE FILED AND THE APPELLATE COURT HEARD

ORAL ARGUMENT IN MAY 2005. ON DECEMBER 8, 2005, THE

APPELLATE COURT ISSUED A DECISION VACATING THE DISTRICT

COURTS JUDGMENT AND REMANDING THE CASES TO THE DISTRICT

COURT TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT COURT TO RESOLVE CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. A HEARING WAS HELD TO ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006. THE DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A RULING ON

AUGUST 10, 2006 RESOLVING SUCH JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES IN

FAVOR OF THE SETTLING PLAINTIFFS. THE CLASS MEMBERS AND OTHER

PARTY THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURTS

JUDGMENT HAVE RENEWED THEIR APPEALS. THE RENEWED APPEALS ARE

PRESENTLY BEING BRIEFED.

AFTER THE SPIN-OFF OF MEDCO HEALTH, MEDCO HEALTH ASSUMED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE MATTERS

DISCUSSED IN THE FOREGOING TWO PARAGRAPHS. THESE CASES ARE BEING

DEFENDED BY MEDCO HEALTH.

THERE ARE VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PRINCIPALLY PRODUCT

LIABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUITS INVOLVING THE COMPANY,

WHICH ARE PENDING. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS OR THE PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS

NOTE, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, ALL SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE

EITHER ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE OR, IF NOT SO COVERED,

SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL

104

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS FOR WHICH A

SEPARATE ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED IN THIS NOTE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT, COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUPERFUND, AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE EQUIVALENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS SEEK TO REQUIRE THE

OPERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES, TRANSPORTERS

OF WASTE TO THE SITES AND GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OR TO REIMBURSE THE

GOVERNMENT FOR CLEANUP COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN MADE A PARTY

TO THESE PROCEEDINGS AS AN ALLEGED GENERATOR OF WASTE DISPOSED

OF AT THE SITES. IN EACH CASE, THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE CLEANUP

COSTS. ALTHOUGH JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS ALLEGED, THESE

PROCEEDINGS ARE FREQUENTLY RESOLVED SO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF

CLEANUP COSTS AMONG THE PARTIES MORE NEARLY REFLECTS THE

RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SITE SITUATION. THE

COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY VARIES GREATLY FROM SITE TO

SITE. FOR SOME SITES THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS

DE MINIMIS

AND FOR OTHERS THE COSTS OF CLEANUP HAVE NOT YET BEEN

DETERMINED. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES

OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY, SUCH

PROCEEDINGS SHOULD NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY LIABILITY WHICH

WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN IDENTIFYING AND

PROVIDING FOR THESE COSTS AND SUCH AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY

REDUCTION FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERIES OF CLEANUP COSTS FROM

INSURERS, FORMER SITE OWNERS OR OPERATORS OR OTHER RECALCITRANT

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

ON JUNE 13, 2006, POTASSIUM THIOCYANATE WAS ACCIDENTALLY

DISCHARGED FROM THE COMPANYS PLANT IN WEST POINT,

PENNSYLVANIA THROUGH THE UPPER GWYNEDD TOWNSHIP AUTHORITYS

WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT INTO THE WISSAHICKON CREEK, CAUSING A

FISHKILL. FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE

DISCHARGE AND THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY COOPERATING WITH THE

INVESTIGATIONS.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE LIABILITIES FOR ALL

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE

HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND TOTALED $129.0 MILLION AND

$100.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIABILITIES ARE UNDISCOUNTED, DO NOT

CONSIDER POTENTIAL RECOVERIES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER PARTIES AND

WILL BE PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE

APPLICABLE SITES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY OVER THE

NEXT 15 YEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, OR THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF

REMEDIATION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY REASONABLY

POSSIBLE EXPENDITURES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE

LIABILITIES ACCRUED SHOULD EXCEED $62.0 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE. MANAGEMENT ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE

EXPENDITURES SHOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR ANY YEAR.

12.

PREFERRED

STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY REDEEMED VARIABLE-RATE PREFERRED

UNITS OF A SUBSIDIARY AT $1.5 BILLION OF PAR VALUE PLUS

ACCRUED DIVIDENDS. BECAUSE THESE PREFERRED SECURITIES WERE HELD

AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL, THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN

MINORITY INTERESTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1998 RESTRUCTURING OF AMI (SEE

NOTE 9), THE COMPANY ASSUMED A $2.4 BILLION PAR VALUE

PREFERRED STOCK OBLIGATION WITH A DIVIDEND RATE OF 5% PER

ANNUM, WHICH IS CARRIED BY KBI AND INCLUDED IN MINORITY

INTERESTS. WHILE A SMALL PORTION OF THE PREFERRED STOCK CARRIED

BY KBI IS CONVERTIBLE INTO KBI COMMON SHARES, NONE OF THE

PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO THE COMPANYS

COMMON SHARES AND, THEREFORE, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED AS COMMON

SHARES ISSUABLE FOR PURPOSES OF COMPUTING EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION (SEE NOTE 18).

13.

STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY

OTHER PAID-IN CAPITAL INCREASED BY $266.5 MILLION IN 2006

AND $30.2 MILLION IN 2005, AND DECREASED BY

$86.8 MILLION IN 2004. THE CHANGES PRIMARILY REFLECT THE

IMPACT OF SHARES ISSUED UPON EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND

RELATED INCOME TAX BENEFITS, AS WELL AS THE ISSUANCE OF

RESTRICTED SHARES. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE IN 2006 REFLECTS

THE IMPACT OF RECOGNIZING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS A

RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R (SEE NOTE 14).

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER WHICH

EMPLOYEES, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANYS EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES MAY BE GRANTED

OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK AT THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT. IN ADDITION TO STOCK OPTIONS,

THE COMPANY GRANTS PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (PSUS)

AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) TO CERTAIN

MANAGEMENT LEVEL EMPLOYEES. THESE PLANS WERE APPROVED BY THE

COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

187.7 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS

UNDER THE COMPANYS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE

COMPANY SETTLES EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

PRIMARILY WITH TREASURY SHARES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMPANY

STOCK AT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF GRANT. THESE

AWARDS GENERALLY VEST ONE-THIRD EACH YEAR OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERIOD, WITH A CONTRACTUAL TERM OF 10 YEARS. RSUS ARE STOCK

AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AND ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARDS VEST, AS WELL AS

NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

AWARDS IS DETERMINED AND FIXED ON THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE

COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. PSUS ARE STOCK AWARDS WHERE THE

ULTIMATE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED WILL BE CONTINGENT ON THE

COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AGAINST A PRE-SET OBJECTIVE OR SET OF

OBJECTIVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH PSU IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE

OF GRANT BASED ON THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. OVER THE

PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED WILL BE ADJUSTED BASED ON THE PROBABILITY

OF ACHIEVEMENT OF A PERFORMANCE TARGET AND FINAL COMPENSATION

EXPENSE WILL BE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ULTIMATE NUMBER OF

SHARES ISSUED. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH PSUS IN 2006, 2005 OR 2004.

BOTH PSU AND RSU PAYOUTS WILL BE IN SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK

AFTER THE END OF A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS

APPLICABLE TO SUCH AWARDS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

FAS 123R. EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS

PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD WHICH

MEASURES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT EXCEEDS THE

EXERCISE PRICE. FAS 123R REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN NET INCOME, WHICH THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE MODIFIED

PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD FOR ADOPTING FAS 123R, AND

THEREFORE, PRIOR PERIODS WERE NOT RETROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTED.

UNDER THIS METHOD, THE PROVISIONS FOR FAS 123R APPLY TO ALL

AWARDS GRANTED OR MODIFIED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006. IN

ADDITION, THE UNRECOGNIZED EXPENSE OF AWARDS THAT HAVE NOT YET

VESTED AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME IN

THE RELEVANT PERIOD AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. ALSO EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STAFF POSITION

123R-3,

TRANSITION ELECTION RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX

EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

, WHICH PROVIDES THE

COMPANY AN OPTIONAL SHORT CUT METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE

HISTORICAL POOL OF WINDFALL TAX BENEFITS UPON ADOPTING

FAS 123R.

FAS 123R REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PRESENT PRO FORMA

DISCLOSURE, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS AT THE DATE OF

GRANT, INCLUDING THOSE GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES,

IS AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND

THE PRO FORMA AMOUNTS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION GRANT

WERE ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES

OPTION PRICING MODEL. UPON THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R,

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY FOR AWARDS

GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR OVER THE PERIOD FROM

THE GRANT DATE TO THE DATE RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY IS ACHIEVED.

THIS APPROACH IS KNOWN AS THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD

APPROACH. IF THE COMPANY HAD BEEN APPLYING THIS APPROACH FOR

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, THE

EFFECT ON PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, AS PROVIDED IN THE

ABOVE TABLE, WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

IN 2005 AND 2004, PRO FORMA COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS CALCULATED

USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL UTILIZING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON

HISTORICAL DATA, SUCH THAT EXPENSE WAS DETERMINED USING SEPARATE

EXPECTED TERM ASSUMPTIONS FOR EACH VESTING TRANCHE. AS A RESULT,

PRO FORMA COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ANY STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED

AFTER JANUARY 1, 2004 BUT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006 WAS

CALCULATED USING THE ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION METHOD PRESCRIBED

IN FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 28,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER VARIABLE STOCK OPTION OR AWARD

PLANS.

UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION

EXPENSE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

107

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING

MODEL FOR OPTION GRANTS AFTER ADOPTION OF FAS 123R. IN

APPLYING THIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES BOTH HISTORICAL DATA AND

CURRENT MARKET DATA TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS OPTIONS.

THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL REQUIRES SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTIONS, RISK-FREE RATE, VOLATILITY, AND

DIVIDEND YIELD. THE EXPECTED TERM REPRESENTS THE EXPECTED AMOUNT

OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING,

BASED ON HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED EXERCISE BEHAVIOR. THE

RISK-FREE RATE IS BASED ON THE RATE AT GRANT DATE OF ZERO-COUPON

U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH A TERM EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED TERM

OF THE OPTION. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED USING A BLEND OF

HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE HISTORICAL COMPONENT IS

BASED ON HISTORICAL MONTHLY PRICE CHANGES. THE IMPLIED

VOLATILITY IS OBTAINED FROM MARKET DATA ON THE COMPANYS

TRADED OPTIONS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2006, 2005

AND 2004 WAS $7.25, $6.66 AND $10.50 PER OPTION,

RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE DETERMINED USING THE FOLLOWING

STATES ARE BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERS FINAL AVERAGE PAY

AND YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PROVIDES

MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS, PRINCIPALLY TO ITS

ELIGIBLE U.S. RETIREES AND SIMILAR BENEFITS TO THEIR

DEPENDENTS, THROUGH ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE

PLANS ARE DETERMINED BY COUNTRY BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE

LIABILITIES AND CONSIDERING THE DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF THE

PLAN PARTICIPANTS (AVERAGE AGE, YEARS OF SERVICE AND ACTIVE

VERSUS RETIREE STATUS) AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL REGULATIONS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE TARGET ALLOCATION WAS 38% IN

U.S. EQUITIES, 34% IN INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, 23% IN

FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS, 4% IN REAL ESTATE AND OTHER

INVESTMENTS, AND 1% IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. OTHER

AND IS WELL DIVERSIFIED AMONG THE ASSET CLASSES IN WHICH THE

PORTFOLIO INVESTS.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION WAS $5.4 BILLION AND $5.0 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PENSION PLANS AND $3.2 BILLION AND

$3.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, REPRESENTING

THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION EXCEEDED

PLAN ASSETS FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS, OF

$29.9 MILLION PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF FAS 158 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND HAD A MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY OF

$34.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

FOR PENSION PLANS WITH BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN

ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE FAIR VALUE OF

PLAN ASSETS WAS $785.3 MILLION AND $695.3 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AND THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $1.6 BILLION

AND $1.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THOSE PLANS WITH

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS AT

112

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS

WAS $187.1 MILLION AND $144.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AND THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $535.2 MILLION

AND $456.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EFFECTIVE WITH THE ADOPTION OF FAS 158, NET LOSS AMOUNTS,

WHICH REFLECT EXPERIENCE DIFFERENTIALS PRIMARILY RELATING TO

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPECTED AND ACTUAL RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS

AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE

RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF AOCI. NET LOSS AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF

CERTAIN THRESHOLDS ARE AMORTIZED INTO NET PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE

LIFE OF EMPLOYEES. THE ESTIMATED NET LOSS AND PRIOR SERVICE COST

(CREDIT) AMOUNTS THAT WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM AOCI INTO NET

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST DURING 2007 ARE

$123.1 MILLION AND $11.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR

INCOME TAXES PAID IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WERE $2.4 BILLION,

IN 2006 OR 2005. STOCK OPTION EXERCISES REDUCED INCOME TAXES

PAID IN 2004 BY $121.7 MILLION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

(IRS) HAS BEEN EXAMINING THE COMPANYS TAX

RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1993 TO 2001 AND HAD ISSUED NOTICES OF

DEFICIENCY WITH RESPECT TO A PARTNERSHIP TRANSACTION ENTERED

INTO IN 1993, AND TWO MINORITY INTEREST EQUITY FINANCINGS

ENTERED INTO IN 1995 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE IRS HAS

RECENTLY CONCLUDED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE YEARS

1993-2001

AND WILL ISSUE A FINAL REVENUE AGENTS REPORT IN THE FIRST

QUARTER. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2007, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

CLOSING AGREEMENTS WITH THE IRS COVERING SEVERAL SPECIFIC ITEMS,

INCLUDING THE 1993 PARTNERSHIP TRANSACTION AND THE 1995 AND 2000

MINORITY INTEREST EQUITY FINANCINGS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

CLOSING AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF

APPROXIMATELY $2.85 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

THIS PAYMENT WILL BE OFFSET DURING 2007 BY (I) A TAX REFUND

OF $150 MILLION FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID RELATED TO

THESE MATTERS AND (II) A $400 MILLION FEDERAL TAX

BENEFIT RELATED TO INTEREST INCLUDED IN THE PAYMENT, RESULTING

IN A NET CASH COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION. THE COMPANY HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED

RESERVES FOR THESE MATTERS AND WHILE THE CONCLUSION OF THE IRS

EXAMINATION, INCLUDING THE CLOSING AGREEMENTS, DOES NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CASH FLOW FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2007 WHEN THE PAYMENT IS MADE. THE IMPACT FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT

TO 2001 OF THE PARTNERSHIP TRANSACTION AND THE MINORITY INTEREST

EQUITY FINANCINGS IS INCLUDED IN THE CLOSING AGREEMENTS ALTHOUGH

THOSE YEARS REMAIN OPEN IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MERCKS CANADIAN TAX RETURNS FOR

THE YEARS 1998 THROUGH 2004 ARE BEING EXAMINED BY THE CANADA

REVENUE AGENCY (CRA). ON OCTOBER 10, 2006, CRA

ISSUED THE COMPANY A NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT CONTAINING

ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY PRICING MATTERS

WHICH RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TAX DUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.4 BILLION (U.S. DOLLARS) PLUS INTEREST OF

$360 MILLION (U.S. DOLLARS). THE COMPANY DISAGREES

WITH THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY CRA AND BELIEVES THEY ARE WITHOUT

MERIT. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTEST THE ASSESSMENT THROUGH THE

CRA APPEALS PROCESS AND THE COURTS IF NECESSARY. IN CONNECTION

WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS, IN THE NOTICE OF REASSESSMENT, THE

COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO POST A DEPOSIT OF UP TO ONE HALF OF THE

TAX AND INTEREST ASSESSED. DURING JANUARY 2007, THE COMPANY

PLEDGED COLLATERAL CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF

$802 MILLION TO A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHICH PROVIDED A

LETTER OF GUARANTEE TO THE CRA. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

HOWEVER, AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS

IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH AN ADJUSTMENT IS RECORDED OR THE TAX IS

DUE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN OCTOBER 2004, THE AJCA WAS SIGNED

INTO LAW. THE AJCA CREATED TEMPORARY INCENTIVES FOR

U.S. MULTINATIONALS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE AJCA, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED

$15.9 BILLION DURING 2005. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCOME

TAX CHARGE OF $766.5 MILLION IN TAXES ON INCOME IN 2005

RELATED TO THIS REPATRIATION, $185 MILLION OF WHICH WAS

PAID IN 2005 AND THE REMAINDER WAS PAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2006. THIS CHARGE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $100 MILLION

BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH A DECISION TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN TAX

PLANNING STRATEGIES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT CHANGED ITS INTENTION

TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ACCUMULATED EARNINGS EARNED SUBSEQUENT

TO DECEMBER 31, 2002. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, FOREIGN

EARNINGS OF $12.5 BILLION HAVE BEEN RETAINED INDEFINITELY

BY SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES FOR REINVESTMENT. NO PROVISION WILL BE

MADE FOR INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE UPON THE

DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUCH EARNINGS AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO

DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE RELATED UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME

TAX LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSIDIARIES

OPERATING IN PUERTO RICO AND SINGAPORE UNDER TAX INCENTIVE

GRANTS THAT EXPIRE IN 2015 AND 2026, RESPECTIVELY.

REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERCK & CO., INC..

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF MERCK & CO.,

INC.S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR

OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND

THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, OF RETAINED

EARNINGS, OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF

MERCK & CO., INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND THE

RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE

THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 IN

CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING

THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN 2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN

AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT

PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

122

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS

AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF

THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.
