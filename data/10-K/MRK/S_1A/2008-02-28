RISK

FACTORS.

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF THE INFORMATION SET FORTH

IN THIS

FORM 10-K,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST

IN ANY OF THE COMPANYS SECURITIES. THE RISKS BELOW ARE NOT

THE ONLY ONES THE COMPANY FACES. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT CURRENTLY

KNOWN TO THE COMPANY OR THAT THE COMPANY PRESENTLY DEEMS

IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. THIS

FORM 10-K

ALSO CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANYS RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY

DIFFER FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISKS

IT FACES AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE. SEE CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS BELOW.

THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION, FROM THE

MARKET WORLDWIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY

26,500 PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY

47,275 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING

FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX,

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 262 PURPORTED CLASS

ACTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF

VIOXX.

(ALL OF THESE SUITS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS.) AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ON NOVEMBER 9, 2007,

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT) WITH THE LAW FIRMS THAT

COMPRISE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PLAINTIFFS

STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT

VIOXX

LITIGATION AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF PLAINTIFFS

COUNSEL IN THE TEXAS, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA STATE

COORDINATED PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE STATE AND FEDERAL MYOCARDIAL

INFARCTION (MI) AND ISCHEMIC STROKE (IS)

CLAIMS FILED AS OF THAT DATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO TOLLED CLAIMS, WAS

SIGNED BY THE PARTIES AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THREE OF THE

FOUR JUDGES OVERSEEING THE COORDINATION OF MORE THAN

95 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

APPLIES ONLY TO U.S. LEGAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO ALLEGE

THAT THEIR MI OR IS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, IF, BY MARCH 1, 2008

(SUBJECT TO EXTENSION), PLAINTIFFS ENROLL IN THE RESOLUTION

PROCESS (THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM) AT LEAST

85 PERCENT OF EACH OF ALL CURRENTLY PENDING AND TOLLED

(I) MI CLAIMS, (II) IS CLAIMS, (III) ELIGIBLE MI

AND IS CLAIMS TOGETHER WHICH INVOLVE DEATH, AND

(IV) ELIGIBLE MI AND IS CLAIMS WHICH TOGETHER ALLEGE MORE

THAN 12 MONTHS OF USE, MERCK WILL PAY AN AGGREGATE OF

$4.85 BILLION INTO TWO FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING CLAIMS

CONSISTING OF $4.0 BILLION FOR QUALIFYING MI CLAIMS AND

$850 MILLION FOR QUALIFYING IS CLAIMS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS

THAT THE PARTICIPATION CONDITIONS WILL BE MET; HOWEVER, IF THEY

ARE NOT, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO WAIVE THE CONDITIONS

OR TERMINATE THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

CLAIMS OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL THIRD-PARTY PAYORS REMAIN PENDING

IN THE NEW JERSEY COURT, AND COUNSEL PURPORTING TO REPRESENT A

LARGE NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS HAS THREATENED TO FILE

NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL SUCH ACTIONS. ACTIVITY IN THE PENDING CASES

IS CURRENTLY STAYED.

THERE ARE ALSO PENDING IN VARIOUS U.S. COURTS PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL

PURCHASERS OR USERS OF

VIOXX

AND CLAIMING EITHER

REIMBURSEMENT OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC LOSS OR AN ENTITLEMENT TO

MEDICAL MONITORING. ALL OF THESE CASES ARE AT EARLY PROCEDURAL

STAGES, AND NO CLASS HAS BEEN CERTIFIED. IN NEW JERSEY, THE

TRIAL COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT IN THE CASE OF SINCLAIR, A

PURPORTED STATEWIDE MEDICAL MONITORING CLASS. THE APPELLATE

DIVISION REVERSED THE DISMISSAL, AND THE ISSUE IS NOW ON APPEAL

TO THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT. THAT COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON

OCTOBER 22, 2007.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS HAVE

BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY

MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN

VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND

FORMER EMPLOYEES,

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).

(ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS.) IN ADDITION, SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE

SUITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FILED AND DISMISSED ARE NOW ON APPEAL

AND SEVERAL SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED DEMANDS WITH THE COMPANY

ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD MEMBERS AND COMPANY OFFICERS.

(ALL OF THESE SUITS AND DEMANDS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH

THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

ERISA

LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS.)

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN

VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE SUITS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN SUED BY SEVEN STATES

AND TWO COUNTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS RELATING TO

VIOXX

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANY

CONCERNING

VIOXX.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS

ISSUED A SUBPOENA REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS

BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL

FROM THIRTY-ONE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE

CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS SALES AND

MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH

AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. (ALL OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.) THE COMPANY CAN NOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER, THEY COULD

RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

TO DATE, IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION,

JURIES HAVE DECIDED IN MERCKS FAVOR 12 TIMES AND IN

PLAINTIFFS FAVOR FIVE TIMES. ONE MERCK VERDICT WAS SET

ASIDE BY THE COURT AND HAS NOT BEEN RETRIED. ANOTHER MERCK

VERDICT WAS SET ASIDE AND RETRIED, LEADING TO ONE OF THE FIVE

PLAINTIFF VERDICTS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO UNRESOLVED MISTRIALS.

WITH RESPECT TO THE FIVE PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK

ALREADY HAS FILED AN APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF

THOSE CASES, AND IN ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE

OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION IS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

THE OUTCOMES OF THESE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS

SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED TO INDICATE ANY TREND OR WHAT OUTCOME

MAY BE LIKELY IN FUTURE

VIOXX

TRIALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2008. A TRIAL IN

THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2008, BUT THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE

COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY SPENT $616 MILLION, INCLUDING

$200 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN THE AGGREGATE IN

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS

(COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$210 MILLION AND IN THE THIRD QUARTER IT RECORDED ANOTHER

CHARGE OF $70 MILLION, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR

ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION FROM $858 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

TO $522 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN ADDITION, AS

NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF

$4.85 BILLION EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO

THE QUALIFYING CLAIMANTS IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THUS, THE

COMPANYS TOTAL RESERVE FOR THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $5.372 BILLION (THE



VIOXX

RESERVE). THE

VIOXX

RESERVE IS

BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2009.

THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY ADDITIONAL

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN CONNECTION

WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS AND

THE COMPANY HAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO THE COURSE THE

PROCEEDINGS WILL TAKE. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF

PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE

ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES,

THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS,

AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR

RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT

INCLUDED IN THE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES

FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING IN THE PAYMENT OF

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

IN EXCESS OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND, WHEN THAT OCCURS,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE

MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS

PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAVE

RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION

FROM LOWER PRICE GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR

ONE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO A RAPID

LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED GENERIC VERSIONS

OF THAT DRUG BECOME AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT

CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPANYS SALES, THE LOSS

OF PATENT PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOSAMAX

LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN

FEBRUARY 2008.

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE MARKETING

EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2008. AS A RESULT OF

THESE EVENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

U.S.

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES.

U.S. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WERE

$2.0 BILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN 2007. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE SODIUM

PRODUCTS IN SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA

AND GERMANY.

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT

SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND THE

COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS; IN CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST

PATENT PROTECTION.

LIKE OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS

EACH YEAR. DECLINES IN SALES OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

MEAN THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE

SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

NEW PRODUCTS WHICH IT DEVELOPS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND

PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH LICENSE OR

ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMPANY COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL

EFFORT, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES, AND THROUGH VARIOUS

COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THE COMPANY MUST MAKE ONGOING, SUBSTANTIAL

EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFORTS IT IS

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN A COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT. THE

COMPANY MUST ALSO COMMIT SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS, FUNDS AND OTHER

RESOURCES TO RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGH QUALITY SCIENTISTS

AND OTHER PERSONNEL WITH PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPERTISE.

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, SEE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ABOVE. EACH PHASE OF

TESTING IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A

SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER SERIOUS

OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE

COMPANY MAY ABANDON A PRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY. SOME OF THE RISKS

ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND MAY YIELD

DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL

SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ITS

INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A

NEW DRUG; OR SALES OF A NEW PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

THE COMPANY CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF

ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL BE LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT

WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE COMPOUNDS,

PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE

LAUNCHED, WILL BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND

SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING

PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER ITS SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS

PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

,

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING PRODUCTS

OR

19

THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

ISSUES CONCERNING

VYTORIN

AND THE ENHANCE CLINICAL

TRIAL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

THE COMPANY AND SCHERING-PLOUGH SELL

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

THROUGH THEIR JOINT VENTURE COMPANY, MERCK/SCHERING-PLOUGH

PHARMACEUTICALS (THE MSP PARTNERSHIP). ON

JANUARY 14, 2008, THE MSP PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCED THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE ENHANCE (EFFECT OF COMBINATION

EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE

ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA) TRIAL. ENHANCE WAS A SURROGATE ENDPOINT

TRIAL CONDUCTED IN 720 PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL

HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE CONDITION THAT AFFECTS

APPROXIMATELY 0.2% OF THE POPULATION. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS

THE MEAN CHANGE IN THE INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS MEASURED AT THREE

SITES IN THE CAROTID ARTERIES (THE RIGHT AND LEFT COMMON

CAROTID, INTERNAL CAROTID AND CAROTID BULB) BETWEEN PATIENTS

TREATED WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN

10/80 MG

VERSUS PATIENTS TREATED WITH SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE OVER A

TWO YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT.

THERE WAS ALSO NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE TREATMENT GROUPS FOR EACH OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRIMARY

ENDPOINT, INCLUDING THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY.

DURING DECEMBER 2007 AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2008, THE

COMPANY AND ITS JOINT-VENTURE PARTNER, SCHERING-PLOUGH, RECEIVED

SEVERAL JOINT LETTERS FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND

COMMERCE AND THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND

INVESTIGATIONS, AND ONE LETTER FROM THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS

INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES

RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE COMPANIES AND THE MSP PARTNERSHIP

EACH RECEIVED TWO SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS.

MERCK AND SCHERING-PLOUGH HAVE ALSO EACH RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

THE OFFICE OF THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL DATED

FEBRUARY 1, 2008, REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE

MARKETING AND SALE OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND THE

TIMING OF DISCLOSURES OF THE RESULTS OF ENHANCE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND WORKING WITH

SCHERING-PLOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE INQUIRIES. IN ADDITION, SINCE

MID-JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF OR BEEN SERVED

WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 CIVIL CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGING

COMMON LAW AND STATE CONSUMER FRAUD CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE ENHANCE CLINICAL

TRIAL RESULTS IN A PRESS RELEASE ON JANUARY 14, 2008. TO

DATE, SALES OF BOTH PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN BELOW THE

COMPANYS PRIOR EXPECTATIONS. IN ADDITION, WHOLESALERS IN

THE U.S. HAVE MODERATED THEIR PURCHASES OF BOTH PRODUCTS TO

REDUCE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS.

THESE ISSUES CONCERNING THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MSP PARTNERSHIPS SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

IF SALES OF SUCH PRODUCTS ARE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH

FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS

COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION,

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS OR THE CONSUMER FRAUD LITIGATION CONCERNING THE

SALE AND PROMOTION OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS THE COMPANY OBTAINS AND

MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL

TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING ITS

PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE FDA IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY, AS

IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL,

SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO IS

PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY

CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL

DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, TO DELAY OR WITHHOLD

REGISTRATION AND MARKETING APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE PRODUCT

WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT

WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND

UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE

OBTAINED, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS

TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE APPROVAL

IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL,

SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, OR ITS FAILURE TO

MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM

SELLING THE NEW PRODUCTS IN THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS

OBTAINED, IF EVER. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE

REVENUES FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT

DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS

PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS

WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN

HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN

MARKETS. PATENTS COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED

NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SEEKS

PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS

WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND WHERE MEANINGFUL

PATENT PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS

PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES OR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE

OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT

APPLICATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TO

DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN

PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO ITS PATENTS OR

INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS ITS IMPORTANT PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION BELOW. IN

PARTICULAR, MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS

FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS

(ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF

RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY NORMALLY

RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS PATENT, INCLUDING BY FILING

LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT LITIGATION AND

OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS ARE COSTLY AND

UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE THE COMPANY OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES, THIRD PARTY PATENTS

MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING AND SELLING A PRODUCT IN

A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN

PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO

DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE

PRODUCTS BECOMING AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST SALES UNLESS

AND UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY

SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC

PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM

LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS

PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN

SOME COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN

IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICAL

PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO

LEGISLATION WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS

PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE

EMERGENCE OF GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED

PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES, REDUCING THE COMPANYS

SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR

THE COMPANYS DRUGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION, PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR

LEGISLATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND RAPID APPROVAL OF

GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED INTO LAW COULD

WORSEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION MAY INCREASE AS NEW

PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE SAFER OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR

MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION,

THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE SOLD

AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

AS A RESULT, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE

POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY FACES PRICING PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO ITS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICE

PRESSURES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN THE

UNITED STATES. THESE INCLUDE (I) PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE

GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASERS AND

(II) U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, INCLUDING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003

ACT).

THE 2003 ACT INCLUDED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR

INDIVIDUALS WHICH FIRST WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1,

2006. THE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE

ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD RESULT IN FURTHER

PRICING PRESSURES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PRICING PRESSURES TO

INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS IN THE

MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS INHERENT IN

MANUFACTURING ITS PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY ITS VACCINES, SUCH AS

(I) FAILURE OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS VENDORS OR

SUPPLIERS TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES

AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

GUIDELINES THAT COULD LEAD TO MANUFACTURING SHUTDOWNS, PRODUCT

SHORTAGES AND DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING;

(II) CONSTRUCTION DELAYS RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW

FACILITIES OR THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING FACILITIES, INCLUDING

THOSE INTENDED TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS; AND (III) OTHER MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION

PROBLEMS INCLUDING CHANGES IN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION SITES AND

LIMITS TO MANUFACTURING CAPACITY DUE TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

CHANGES IN TYPES OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED, OR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS

THAT COULD IMPACT CONTINUOUS SUPPLY. MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES

CAN RESULT IN PRODUCT SHORTAGES, LEADING TO LOST SALES.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CAN DEVELOP UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR

EFFICACY CONCERNS.

UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR EFFICACY CONCERNS CAN ARISE WITH RESPECT TO

MARKETED PRODUCTS, WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED,

LEADING TO PRODUCT RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS, OR DECLINING SALES, AS

WELL AS PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER FRAUD

AND/OR

OTHER

CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY HAS NO PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR PRODUCTS

FIRST SOLD AFTER AUGUST 1, 2004.

AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE

HAS BECOME LESS AVAILABLE WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS

DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF OBTAINING PRODUCT LIABILITY

INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS

AVAILABLE AND AS SUCH, HAS NO INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT

LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY

FOR PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD AFTER THAT DATE.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS.

ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, PRICING, SALES,

LITIGATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND AGENCY REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION

REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN

IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS

SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS,
