YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY

CONSIDER ALL OF THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS FORM 10-K, INCLUDING

THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN ANY OF THE COMPANYS SECURITIES. THE

RISKS BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES THE COMPANY FACES. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT CURRENTLY KNOWN TO THE

COMPANY OR THAT THE COMPANY PRESENTLY DEEMS IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. THIS FORM 10-K ALSO CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANYS RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THOSE

ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISKS

IT FACES AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE. SEE CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

ON PAGE 22.

THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004,

THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN

MEDICATION, FROM THE MARKET WORLDWIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

APPROXIMATELY 9,650 PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 19,100 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING

FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX,

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF

VIOXX.

(ALL

OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE

COMPANY MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS) AND THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

ERISA

LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED DERIVATIVE SUITS AND ONE SHAREHOLDER

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HAS FILED A DEMAND ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD MEMBERS

AND COMPANY OFFICERS. (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS). THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN

LAWSUITS). THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN SUED BY FOUR STATES WITH

RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS RELATING TO

VIOXX

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE FUTURE.

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANY CONCERNING

VIOXX

. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ISSUED A SUBPOENA REQUESTING

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING

INVESTIGATIONS BY CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. A GROUP OF

ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM THIRTY-ONE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE CONDUCTING AN

INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS SALES AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX

. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH

AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. (ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS). THE COMPANY CAN NOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS;

HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

THREE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS IN THE U.S. HAVE GONE TO TRIAL AND RESULTED IN

JURY VERDICTS.

ON AUGUST 19, 2005, IN A TRIAL IN STATE COURT IN TEXAS, THE JURY IN ERNST VS. MERCK REACHED A

VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF AND PURPORTED TO AWARD HER A TOTAL OF $253 MILLION IN

COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. UNDER TEXAS LAW, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT COULD BE AWARDED TO

THE PLAINTIFF IS CAPPED AT APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO APPEAL THIS VERDICT

AFTER THE COMPLETION OF POST-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS STRONG

POINTS TO RAISE ON APPEAL. SINCE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR AN UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOME IS NOT PROBABLE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A RESERVE WITH RESPECT TO THE VERDICT.

ON NOVEMBER 3, 2005, IN THE SECOND

VIOXX

PERSONAL INJURY CASE TO GO TO TRIAL, FREDERICK AND

MARY JACKSON HUMESTON VS. MERCK & CO., INC., IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY, LAW DIVISION,

ATLANTIC COUNTY, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY ON ALL COUNTS. THE JURY FOUND,

BY AN 8 TO 1 VOTE, THAT THE COMPANY DID NOT FAIL TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE WARNING TO PRESCRIBING

PHYSICIANS OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN

VIOXX

AND AN INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

PRIOR TO MR. HUMESTONS HEART ATTACK. THE JURY ALSO UNANIMOUSLY FOUND THAT THE COMPANY DID NOT

VIOLATE THE NEW JERSEY CONSUMER FRAUD ACT IN MARKETING THE DRUG TO PRESCRIBING PHYSICIANS.

ON FEBRUARY 17, 2006, IN A RE-TRIAL OF A CASE IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW ORLEANS BROUGHT BY

EVELYN IRVIN PLUNKETT, ON BEHALF OF HER LATE HUSBAND, RICHARD IRVIN, JR., WHO DIED FROM AN APPARENT

HEART ATTACK, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF MERCK ON ALL COUNTS.

THE

OUTCOMES OF THESE FIRST

THREE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED TO INDICATE ANY TREND

OR WHAT OUTCOME MAY BE LIKELY IN FUTURE

VIOXX

TRIALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE

TRIED IN 2006. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY TRIALS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS INSURANCE

COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSIVE COSTS AND

ANY LOSSES.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY SPENT $285 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE

RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

(II) THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND (IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LITIGATION).

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $295 MILLION TO INCREASE THE

RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION FROM $675 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 TO $685 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT

THE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2007.

THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO

PAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. THESE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS, ARE CURRENTLY AT A VERY EARLY STAGE AND THE COMPANY HAS VERY LITTLE

INFORMATION AS TO THE COURSE THEY WILL TAKE. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE

OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS

TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING

IN THE PAYMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES, COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE

AND, WHEN THAT OCCURS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS

PRODUCTS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAVE

RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY

FACES STRONG COMPETITION FROM LOWER PRICE GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO A RAPID LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED

GENERIC VERSIONS OF THAT DRUG BECOME AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE

SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPANYS SALES, THE LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN 2003,

ZOCOR,

THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL AND CURRENTLY ITS LARGEST

REVENUE-PRODUCING PRODUCT, LOST ITS BASIC PATENT PROTECTION IN CANADA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN

EUROPE, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY, AND THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AS THE RESULT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF A GENERIC VERSION. WORLDWIDE SALES

OF

ZOCOR

WERE $4.4 BILLION IN 2005, COMPARED TO $5.2 BILLION IN 2004. IN JUNE 2006,

ZOCOR

WILL

LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES AFTER THAT TIME.

IN AUGUST 2004, THE OPPOSITION DIVISION OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE RENDERED A DECISION TO

REVOKE THE COMPANYS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. THAT

DECISION HAS BEEN APPEALED AND A HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 14 AND 15. DECISIONS IN SUCH

PROCEEDINGS ARE TYPICALLY RENDERED AT THE END OF THE HEARING. IF THE DECISION IS UPHELD, THE

COMPANY WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

FOSAMAX

IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS AFTER

2007. MOREOVER, MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE USE OF ALENDRONATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN

SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IF THE COMPANY IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN THOSE COUNTRIES THE COMPANY COULD

LOSE EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS TO FOSAMAX BEFORE 2007 IN SUCH COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY WOULD EXPECT A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EUROPEAN SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AFTER LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN 2005 HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF

GENERIC PRODUCTS IN SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND GERMANY. NONETHELESS,

GLOBAL SALES OF

FOSAMAX

GREW 1% IN 2005 TO $3.2 BILLION, AS A RESULT OF STRONG SALES IN THE UNITED

STATES.

ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

FOUND THE COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE

COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS

DECISION,

FOSAMAX

WILL LOSE ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008, AND THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

FOSAMAX

SALES AFTER THAT TIME.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY

SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS IN

OTHER WAYS; IN CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS

THAT HAVE LOST PATENT PROTECTION.

LIKE OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST

CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS EACH YEAR. DECLINES IN SALES OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

MEAN THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NEW

PRODUCTS WHICH IT DEVELOPS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH

LICENSE OR ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMPANY COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT, FUNDS AND

OTHER RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES, AND THROUGH

VARIOUS COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THE

COMPANY MUST MAKE ONGOING, SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFORTS IT IS

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN A COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO COMMIT SUBSTANTIAL

EFFORTS, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGH QUALITY SCIENTISTS AND OTHER

PERSONNEL WITH PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE.

BASED ON FDA STATISTICS, DRUG DEVELOPMENT TIME FROM INITIATION OF PRECLINICAL TESTING TO NDA

APPROVAL CAN RANGE FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 8.5 YEARS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, SEE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. EACH PHASE OF TESTING IS HIGHLY

REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER

SERIOUS OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANY MAY ABANDON A PRODUCT

IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY. SOME OF THE RISKS ENCOUNTERED IN

THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND

MAY YIELD DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG

MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE APPROVED BY THE FDA

FOR ITS INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A NEW DRUG; OR SALES OF A NEW

PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

THE COMPANY CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER

DEVELOPMENT WILL BE LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE

COMPOUNDS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE LAUNCHED, WILL BE

COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS

AND SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER

ITS SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS PROFITABLE

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

, LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING PRODUCTS

OR THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS THE

COMPANY OBTAINS AND MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING ITS PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA IS OF

PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY, AS IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING,

APPROVAL, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION

PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY

CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION TO

REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, TO DELAY OR WITHHOLD REGISTRATION AND MARKETING APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE

PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET

ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE OBTAINED, THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE

APPROVAL IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL, SIGNIFICANT

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL

PROCESS, OR ITS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM SELLING THE

NEW PRODUCTS IN THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS OBTAINED, IF EVER. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE

ABLE TO REALIZE REVENUES FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT DOES NOT HAVE

APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR

CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE

COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN

MARKETS. PATENTS COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY,

WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SEEKS

PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS

AND WHERE MEANINGFUL PATENT PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES MAY

CHALLENGE OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT

FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TO DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO ITS

PATENTS OR INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS

ITS IMPORTANT PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION. IN PARTICULAR,

MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG

APPLICATIONS (ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY NORMALLY RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY

DEFENDING ITS PATENT, INCLUDING BY FILING LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT LITIGATION

AND OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS ARE COSTLY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE THE

COMPANY OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES, THIRD PARTY PATENTS MAY

PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING AND SELLING A PRODUCT IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

BECOMING AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST

SALES UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE

PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN

SOME COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN IN THE

UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICAL PRESSURES TO REDUCE SPENDING ON

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO LEGISLATION WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF

GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES,

REDUCING THE COMPANYS SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR THE

COMPANYS DRUGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION,

PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR LEGISLATION TO

FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND RAPID APPROVAL OF GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED

INTO LAW COULD WORSEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION

MAY INCREASE AS NEW PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE

SAFER OR MORE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFECTIVE OR MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION, THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS

WHICH ARE SOLD AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, IF THE

COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

ITS BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE

COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS, WILL, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS,

PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO

NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO ADDRESS THE

COMPANYS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT

POTENTIAL, AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH STATEMENT AND SHOULD

UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF

OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE NOT. NO

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY. THE

COMPANY CAUTIONS YOU NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.



COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AS THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION.



INCREASED BRAND COMPETITION IN THERAPEUTIC AREAS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.



THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS

OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A CANDIDATE CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE

LATE-STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING

IN DEVELOPMENT BUT FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS, THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN NECESSARY

REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE AND/OR THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL

TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.



PRICING PRESSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, INCLUDING RULES AND PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS, JUDICIAL

DECISIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM, PHARMACEUTICAL

REIMBURSEMENT AND PRICING IN GENERAL.



CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT THEREOF AFFECTING THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS



EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO MARKETED PRODUCTS, WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED, LEADING TO

PRODUCT RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS OR DECLINING SALES.



LEGAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING TAX

DISPUTES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND PATENT DISPUTES WITH BRANDED AND GENERIC COMPETITORS, ANY OF WHICH COULD PRECLUDE

COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING PRODUCTS.



LOST MARKET OPPORTUNITY RESULTING FROM DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS OF THE FDA AND FOREIGN

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.



INCREASED FOCUS ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. IN THE UNITED

STATES, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PURSUED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES REGARDING PATIENT PRIVACY,

INCLUDING FEDERAL AND RECENTLY ISSUED STATE PRIVACY REGULATIONS CONCERNING HEALTH INFORMATION, WHICH HAVE AFFECTED THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS.



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS PROMULGATED BY STANDARD-SETTING OR REGULATORY BODIES, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD AND THE SEC, THAT ARE ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY.



ECONOMIC FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING CHANGES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THIS LIST SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN EXHAUSTIVE STATEMENT OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. SEE RISK FACTORS ON PAGE 17.
