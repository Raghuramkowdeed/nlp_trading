ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

INVESTORS IN MSDS DEBT SECURITIES SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF THE INFORMATION SET FORTH

IN THIS FORM 10-K, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN ANY OF MSDS

DEBT SECURITIES. THE RISKS BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES MSD FACES. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT CURRENTLY

KNOWN TO MSD OR THAT MSD PRESENTLY DEEMS IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. MSDS

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. THIS FORM 10-K ALSO CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT

INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MSDS RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISKS IT FACES AS

DESCRIBED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE. SEE CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS BELOW.

CERTAIN OF MSDS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND,

WHEN THAT OCCURS, MSD EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

MSD DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FOR

SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF MSDS PRODUCTS HAVE RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE

ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, MSD FACES STRONG COMPETITION FROM

LOWER PRICED GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF MSDS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO

A RAPID LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED GENERIC VERSIONS OF THAT DRUG BECOME

AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO MSDS SALES, THE LOSS OF PATENT

PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS. THE PATENTS THAT PROVIDE U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

EXPIRE IN APRIL 2010. IN ADDITION, THE PATENT FOR

COZAAR

EXPIRED IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR

EUROPEAN MARKETS IN MARCH 2010.

HYZAAR

LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

FEBRUARY 2010. MSD EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS AFTER SUCH TIMES. IN

ADDITION, THE PATENT THAT PROVIDES U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

SINGULAIR

EXPIRES IN AUGUST 2012.

MSD EXPECTS THAT WITHIN THE TWO YEARS FOLLOWING PATENT EXPIRATION, IT WILL LOSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

U.S. SALES OF

SINGULAIR

, WITH MOST OF THOSE DECLINES COMING IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR FOLLOWING PATENT

EXPIRATION. ALSO, THE PATENT FOR

SINGULAIR

WILL EXPIRE IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

AUGUST 2012 AND MSD EXPECTS SALES OF

SINGULAIR

IN THOSE MARKETS WILL DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY

THEREAFTER.

A CHART LISTING THE U.S. PATENT PROTECTION FOR MSDS MAJOR MARKETED PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH

ABOVE IN ITEM 1. BUSINESS  PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES.

KEY MSD PRODUCTS GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MSDS PROFITS AND CASH FLOWS, AND ANY EVENTS

THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKETS FOR ITS LEADING PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

MSDS ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS AND OPERATING CASH FLOW DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE CONTINUED

PROFITABILITY OF MSDS KEY PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

SINGULAIR

,

VYTORIN, ZETIA, JANUVIA,

AND

GARDASIL

. AS A

RESULT OF MSDS DEPENDENCE ON KEY PRODUCTS, ANY EVENT THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS

OR THE MARKETS FOR ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND CASH FLOWS. THESE EVENTS COULD INCLUDE LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH MANUFACTURING, GENERIC OR OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) AVAILABILITY OF MSDS PRODUCT OR A

COMPETITIVE PRODUCT, THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS, INCREASED COMPETITION FROM

THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND DISCONTINUATION OR REMOVAL FROM THE MARKET

OF THE PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON.

MSDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCTS AND MSD MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS; IN

CONSEQUENCE, MSD MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST PATENT

PROTECTION.

IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, MSD MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS EACH YEAR. DECLINES

IN SALES OF PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

FOSAMAX, COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR,

AFTER THE LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY MEAN

THAT MSDS FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NEW PRODUCTS

WHICH IT MAY DEVELOP THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH LICENSE

OR ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, MSD COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES AND THROUGH VARIOUS

COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. THERE IS A HIGH RATE OF FAILURE INHERENT IN THE RESEARCH TO

DEVELOP NEW DRUGS TO TREAT DISEASES. AS A RESULT, THERE IS A HIGH RISK THAT FUNDS INVESTED BY MSD

IN RESEARCH PROGRAMS WILL NOT GENERATE FINANCIAL RETURNS. THIS RISK PROFILE IS COMPOUNDED BY THE

FACT THAT THIS RESEARCH HAS A LONG INVESTMENT CYCLE. TO BRING A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUND FROM THE

DISCOVERY PHASE TO MARKET MAY TAKE A DECADE OR MORE AND FAILURE CAN OCCUR AT ANY POINT IN THE

PROCESS, INCLUDING LATER IN THE PROCESS AFTER SIGNIFICANT FUNDS HAVE BEEN INVESTED.

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EACH PHASE OF TESTING IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK

THAT MSD WILL ENCOUNTER SERIOUS OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY MSD MAY

ABANDON A PRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND RESOURCES. SOME OF THE

RISKS ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL

TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND MAY YIELD DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ITS INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A NEW DRUG;

OR SALES OF A NEW PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

MSD CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL

BE APPROVED OR LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE

COMPOUNDS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE LAUNCHED, WILL BE

COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. MSD MUST MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND

SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER ITS

SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS PROFITABLE

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

FOSAMAX, COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR,

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING

PRODUCTS OR THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

MSDS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF NEW PRODUCTS, WHICH

ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS.

PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR PROMISING IN DEVELOPMENT MAY FAIL TO REACH MARKET FOR NUMEROUS REASONS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



FINDINGS OF INEFFECTIVENESS, SUPERIOR SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF COMPETING PRODUCTS, OR

HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS IN CLINICAL OR PRE-CLINICAL TESTING;



FAILURE TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, INCLUDING DELAYS IN THE

APPROVAL OF NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW INDICATIONS, AND INCREASING UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE TIME

REQUIRED TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS AND THE BENEFIT/RISK STANDARDS APPLIED BY

REGULATORY AGENCIES IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO GRANT APPROVALS;



LACK OF ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY DUE TO MANUFACTURING COSTS OR OTHER FACTORS; AND



PRECLUSION FROM COMMERCIALIZATION BY THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MSDS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS MSD OBTAINS AND

MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

MSDS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING

AND MARKETING ITS PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA IS OF PARTICULAR

IMPORTANCE TO MSD, AS IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL, SAFETY,

EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY

CASES, THE FDA REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW

PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO

IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE FDA

AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, TO

DELAY OR WITHHOLD REGISTRATION AND MARKETING APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF MSD IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY OF

THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE OBTAINED, MSD MUST MAINTAIN

APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE APPROVAL IS

REQUIRED. MSDS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL, SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, OR ITS

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM SELLING THE NEW PRODUCTS IN

THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS OBTAINED, IF EVER. MSD WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE REVENUES

FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR

CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN MSDS

MARKETING OF HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS. PATENTS

COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT

FOR THE SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. MSD SEEKS PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS

PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND WHERE MEANINGFUL PATENT

PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF MSD SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES OR GOVERNMENT

AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS.

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR MSDS BUSINESS TO DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS. MSD IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO

ITS PATENTS OR INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST MSD. MSD AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS ITS IMPORTANT

PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT

AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  PATENT LITIGATION BELOW. IN PARTICULAR,

MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG

APPLICATIONS (ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF MSDS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY MSD. MSD NORMALLY RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS

PATENT, INCLUDING BY FILING LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT LITIGATION AND OTHER

CHALLENGES TO MSDS PATENTS ARE COSTLY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE MSD OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES, THIRD PARTY PATENTS MAY PREVENT MSD FROM MARKETING AND

SELLING A PRODUCT IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS HAVE INDICATED THAT COMPULSORY LICENSES TO PATENTS

MAY BE GRANTED IN THE CASE OF NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, WHICH COULD DIMINISH OR ELIMINATE SALES AND

PROFITS FROM THOSE REGIONS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT MSDS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FURTHER, RECENT COURT

DECISIONS RELATING TO OTHER COMPANIES U.S. PATENTS, POTENTIAL U.S. LEGISLATION RELATING TO PATENT

REFORM, AS WELL AS REGULATORY INITIATIVES MAY RESULT IN FURTHER EROSION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

BECOMING AVAILABLE AND, IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SUCH A LOSS COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE. MSDS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST SALES UNLESS AND UNTIL

MSD HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

MSDS HYPERTENSION PRODUCTS

COZAAR

AND

HYZAAR

WILL EACH LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE

UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2010. IN ADDITION, THE PATENT FOR

COZAAR

EXPIRED IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR

EUROPEAN MARKETS IN MARCH 2010.

HYZAAR

LOST PATENT PROTECTION IN MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

FEBRUARY 2010. MSD EXPECTS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS AFTER SUCH TIMES. IN

ADDITION, THE PATENT THAT PROVIDES U.S. MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR

SINGULAIR

EXPIRES IN AUGUST 2012.

MSD EXPECTS THAT WITHIN THE TWO YEARS FOLLOWING PATENT EXPIRATION, IT WILL LOSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

U.S. SALES OF

SINGULAIR

, WITH MOST OF THOSE DECLINES COMING IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR FOLLOWING PATENT

EXPIRATION. ALSO, THE PATENT FOR

SINGULAIR

WILL EXPIRE IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN

AUGUST 2012 AND MSD EXPECTS SALES OF

SINGULAIR

IN THOSE MARKETS WILL DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY

THEREAFTER.

MSD FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, MSD FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE PATENT

RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN SOME

COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE

UNITED STATES, POLITICAL PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO LEGISLATION

WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS MSDS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS

PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO MSDS PRODUCTS CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE

TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES,

REDUCING MSDS SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR MSDS DRUGS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION, PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM TIME

TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR LEGISLATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND

RAPID APPROVAL OF GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED INTO LAW COULD WORSEN THIS

SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MSDS SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MSD FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

MSDS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION MAY

INCREASE AS NEW PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE SAFER

OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN MSDS PRODUCTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE

CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION, THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD AT A

SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN MSDS PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, IF MSD FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS

COMPETITIVE POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

MSD FACES PRICING PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS.

MSD FACES INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE GLOBALLY FROM MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS, INSTITUTIONS

AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT MSDS SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THESE INCLUDE (I) PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND

GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASERS AND (II) U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MEDICARE AND

MEDICAID, INCLUDING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE

2003 ACT). THE 2003 ACT INCLUDED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT FIRST WENT INTO

EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD RESULT IN FURTHER PRICING PRESSURES.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, NUMEROUS MAJOR MARKETS HAVE PERVASIVE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN

FUNDING HEALTHCARE AND, IN THAT REGARD, FIX THE PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND

VACCINE PRODUCTS. CONSEQUENTLY, IN THOSE MARKETS, MSD IS SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING AND

BUDGETARY ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS.

MSD EXPECTS PRICING PRESSURES TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATION AND POLITICAL

ACTION.

MSD BELIEVES THAT THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATION

AS WELL AS POLITICAL AND LEGAL ACTION, AS HEALTH CARE REFORM

IS IMPLEMENTED AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS.

SOME OF THE

PROVISIONS THAT WERE PASSED IN FEDERAL

HEALTH CARE REFORM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT MSDS SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

THE PROVISIONS WILL CREATE GREATER COST CONTROL PRESSURE ON THE U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WHICH COULD LEAD TO GREATER PRESSURE

ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT. THE NEW LAW WILL ALSO INCREASE REBATES AND DISCOUNTS ON

SALES RELATED TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL MEDICAID PROGRAM AND THE MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM, AS WELL AS REQUIRE PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS TO PAY A HEALTH CARE REFORM FEE.

IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL STATES HAVE ENACTED OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT RESTRICT CERTAIN SALES AND MARKETING

ACTIVITIES AND/OR REQUIRE TRACKING AND DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO

HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. SUCH REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT MSDS SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH CARE REFORM OR OTHER RELATED LEGISLATIVE

INITIATIVES MAY FURTHER INCREASE GOVERNMENT

REGULATION OR OTHER GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN HEALTH CARE, LOWER REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND

OTHERWISE CHANGE THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR HEALTH CARE COMPANIES. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

APPLICABLE TO MSDS CURRENT OR FUTURE PRODUCTS, OR THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING REGULATIONS,

MIGHT CHANGE AND THEREBY PREVENT MSD FROM MARKETING SOME OR ALL OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME OR INDEFINITELY.

MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ALL FUTURE CHANGES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL,

OR THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR, OR WHAT IMPACT THEY MAY HAVE ON MSDS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR BUSINESS.

MSD IS EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS IN THE MANUFACTURING OF CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD HAS, IN THE PAST, EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN MANUFACTURING

CERTAIN OF ITS VACCINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS. THESE ISSUES ARE CONTINUING, IN PARTICULAR, WITH

RESPECT TO THE MANUFACTURE OF BULK VARICELLA WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PRODUCTION OF MSDS VARICELLA

ZOSTER VIRUS-CONTAINING VACCINES, SUCH AS

VARIVAX, PROQUAD

AND

ZOSTAVAX

. MSD IS WORKING ON THESE

ISSUES, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF WHEN OR IF THESE ISSUES WILL BE FINALLY RESOLVED.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MSD IS EXPERIENCING CURRENTLY, MSD MAY EXPERIENCE

DIFFICULTIES AND DELAYS INHERENT IN MANUFACTURING ITS PRODUCTS, SUCH AS (I) FAILURE OF MSD OR ANY

OF ITS VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS TO COMPLY WITH CURRENT GOOD

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANUFACTURING PRACTICES AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE GUIDELINES THAT

COULD LEAD TO MANUFACTURING SHUTDOWNS, PRODUCT SHORTAGES AND DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING;

(II) CONSTRUCTION DELAYS RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES OR THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING

FACILITIES, INCLUDING THOSE INTENDED TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND FOR MSDS PRODUCTS; AND (III) OTHER

MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS INCLUDING CHANGES IN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION SITES AND

LIMITS TO MANUFACTURING CAPACITY DUE TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN TYPES OF PRODUCTS

PRODUCED, OR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS THAT COULD IMPACT CONTINUOUS SUPPLY. MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES

CAN RESULT IN PRODUCT SHORTAGES, LEADING TO LOST SALES.

MSD FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, MSD VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN

MEDICATION, FROM THE MARKET WORLDWIDE. ALTHOUGH MSD HAS SETTLED THE MAJOR PORTION OF THE

U.S. PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, MSD STILL FACES MATERIAL LITIGATION ARISING FROM THE VOLUNTARY

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX.

IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND

INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST MSD AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND

DIRECTORS OF MSD ALLEGING THAT MSD MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING

VIOXX

IN

VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). ON APRIL 12, 2007, JUDGE CHESLER GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED JUDGE CHESLERS DECISION TO THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION REVERSING JUDGE CHESLERS ORDER AND REMANDING THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT. MSD FILED A

PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS GRANTED. ORAL

ARGUMENT WAS HELD IN THE SUPREME COURT ON NOVEMBER 30, 2009 AND A DECISION IS EXPECTED IN THE FIRST

HALF OF 2010. WHILE MSDS PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WAS PENDING, PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR CONSOLIDATED

AND FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT IN THE DISTRICT COURT. ON MAY 1, 2009, DEFENDANTS MOVED TO

DISMISS THE FIFTH AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; THAT MOTION HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN WITHOUT PREJUDICE

TO REFILE IT PENDING THE OUTCOME IN THE SUPREME COURT. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST MSD AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS OF

MSD ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF ERISA. (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS

AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS. THE

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.) MSD HAS ALSO

BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE

SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS.) MSD HAS ALSO BEEN SUED BY TEN STATES, FIVE

COUNTIES AND NEW YORK CITY WITH RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) HAS ISSUED SUBPOENAS REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATING TO

MSDS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE

INVESTIGATION UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES SUBPOENAS FOR WITNESSES TO

APPEAR BEFORE A GRAND JURY. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE.

MSD IS COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. (ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.) MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER, THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL REMEDIES.

THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION IS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BELOW. A TRIAL IN A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN AUSTRALIA CONCLUDED ON JUNE 25, 2009, IN THE FEDERAL

COURT OF AUSTRALIA. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO ALLEGED HE SUFFERED AN MI, SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHERS

IN AUSTRALIA WHO INGESTED

VIOXX

AND SUFFERED AN MI, THROMBOTIC STROKE, UNSTABLE ANGINA, TRANSIENT

ISCHEMIC ATTACK OR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. ON MARCH 5, 2010, THE TRIAL JUDGE DELIVERED HIS

JUDGMENT. THE COURT DECIDED TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS AGAINST MSD, SPECIFICALLY FINDING THAT MSD HAD

DONE EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED OF IT IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS DUTY OF CARE. WITH

REGARD TO MSDS AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARY, MERCK SHARP & DOHME (AUSTRALIA) PTY. LTD., THE COURT DECIDED

TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS BUT TO AWARD THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, WHO THE COURT FOUND SUFFERED A

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AFTER INGESTING

VIOXX

FOR APPROXIMATELY 33 MONTHS, COMPENSATION BASED

ON STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT

VIOXX

WAS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, EVEN THOUGH THE

COURT REJECTED THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT MSD KNEW OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN PRIOR TO THE VOLUNTARY

WITHDRAWAL OF

VIOXX

IN SEPTEMBER 2004 THAT

VIOXX

MATERIALLY INCREASED THE RISK OF MI. ON MAY 7,

2010, THE COURT WILL CONDUCT A HEARING TO DETERMINE THE ORDERS TO BE ENTERED GIVING EFFECT TO THE

JUDGMENT, IN WHICH THE COURT WILL DETERMINE WHICH OF ITS FINDINGS OF FACT AND LAW ARE COMMON TO THE

CLAIMS OF OTHER GROUP MEMBERS AND WILL CONSIDER ANY OTHER MOTIONS THAT MIGHT BE BROUGHT. MSDS

SUBSIDIARY INTENDS TO APPEAL THE ADVERSE FINDINGS AFTER THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN ENTERED.

MSD CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT TWO U.S.

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN

2010. MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER TRIALS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION. MSD

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. MSDS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS

WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND ANY LOSSES.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2009, MSD SPENT APPROXIMATELY $244 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE IN LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS

WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS, AND (II) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN 2009, $75 MILLION OF CHARGES WERE RECORDED, INCLUDING $35 MILLION IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER, TO ADD TO THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION WHICH WAS $279 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND $110 MILLION (THE 

VIOXX

RESERVE)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE AMOUNT OF THE

VIOXX

RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED

BELOW UNDER ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT MSD

BELIEVES WILL BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION,

HOWEVER, EVENTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRIALS IN THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION AND OTHER EVENTS THAT COULD ARISE

IN THE COURSE OF THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF DEFENSE COSTS TO BE

INCURRED BY MSD.

MSD IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN

CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE FOR YEARS AND MSD CANNOT PREDICT THE COURSE THE PROCEEDINGS WILL TAKE. IN VIEW OF THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY

CLAIMANTS AND THE CLAIMANTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, MSD IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE

MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH

RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. OTHER THAN A RESERVE

ESTABLISHED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS DISCUSSED BELOW

UNDER ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, MSD HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY

RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING

IN THE PAYMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES, COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2008, MSD AND

MSDS PARENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF COMBINATION EZETIMIBE AND HIGH-DOSE

SIMVASTATIN VS. SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PROCESS IN PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS

FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (ENHANCE) CLINICAL TRIAL, AN IMAGING TRIAL IN 720 PATIENTS WITH

HETEROZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, A RARE GENETIC CONDITION THAT CAUSES VERY HIGH LEVELS

OF LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL AND GREATLY INCREASES THE RISK FOR PREMATURE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN 10/80 MG (

VYTORIN

) SIGNIFICANTLY

LOWERED LDL BAD CHOLESTEROL MORE THAN SIMVASTATIN 80 MG ALONE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT WITH EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN AND SIMVASTATIN ALONE ON THE PRE-SPECIFIED

PRIMARY ENDPOINT, A CHANGE IN THE THICKNESS OF CAROTID ARTERY WALLS OVER TWO YEARS AS MEASURED BY

ULTRASOUND. THE IMPROVED REDUCTION IN HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS PRESENTING WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME

(IMPROVE-IT) TRIAL IS UNDERWAY AND IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES DATA FOR

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME. NO INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF

EZETIMIBE/SIMVASTATIN ON CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT DEMONSTRATED

FOR SIMVASTATIN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN JANUARY 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS

REVIEW OF THE FINAL CLINICAL STUDY REPORT OF ENHANCE. THE FDA STATED THAT THE RESULTS FROM ENHANCE

DID NOT CHANGE ITS POSITION THAT ELEVATED LDL CHOLESTEROL IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR

DISEASE AND THAT LOWERING LDL CHOLESTEROL REDUCES THE RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. FOR A

DISCUSSION CONCERNING LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF THE ENHANCE STUDY, SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BELOW.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD (AS WELL AS MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS

FROM THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, ITS SUBCOMMITTEE ON

OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS (O&I), AND THE RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE SENATE FINANCE

COMMITTEE, COLLECTIVELY SEEKING A COMBINATION OF WITNESS INTERVIEWS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON A

VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENHANCE CLINICAL TRIAL, THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

, AS WELL

AS SALES OF STOCK BY CORPORATE OFFICERS. IN ADDITION, MSD (AS WELL AS  MSDS PARENT COMPANY) HAS RECEIVED THREE

ADDITIONAL LETTERS EACH  FROM O&I, SEEKING CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SIMVASTATIN

AND EZETIMIBE IN AORTIC STENOSIS (SEAS) CLINICAL TRIAL, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, MSD  RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY

GENERALS  OFFICE AND A LETTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION AND

DOCUMENTS. FINALLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE  COMPANIES RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CIVIL

DIVISION OF THE DOJ INFORMING IT THAT THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE COMPANIES CONDUCT

RELATING TO THE PROMOTION OF

VYTORIN

CAUSED FALSE CLAIMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS. MSD IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS. AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, A NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS ARISING OUT OF THE ENHANCE STUDY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

AGAINST MSD AND SCHERING-PLOUGH.

IN JULY 2008, EFFICACY AND SAFETY RESULTS FROM THE SEAS STUDY WERE ANNOUNCED. SEAS WAS

DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INTENSIVE LIPID LOWERING WITH

VYTORIN

10/40 MG WOULD REDUCE THE NEED

FOR AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT AND THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY VERSUS PLACEBO

IN PATIENTS WITH ASYMPTOMATIC MILD TO MODERATE AORTIC STENOSIS WHO HAD NO INDICATION FOR STATIN

THERAPY.

VYTORIN

FAILED TO MEET ITS PRIMARY ENDPOINT FOR THE REDUCTION OF MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR

EVENTS. IN THE STUDY, PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

10/40 MG HAD A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF

CANCER THAN THE GROUP WHO TOOK PLACEBO. THERE WAS ALSO A NONSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM

CANCER IN PATIENTS IN THE GROUP WHO TOOK

VYTORIN

VERSUS THOSE WHO TOOK PLACEBO. CANCER AND CANCER

DEATHS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL MAJOR ORGAN SYSTEMS. MSD BELIEVES THE CANCER FINDING IN SEAS IS

LIKELY TO BE AN ANOMALY THAT, TAKEN IN LIGHT OF ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, DOES NOT SUPPORT AN

ASSOCIATION WITH

VYTORIN

. IN AUGUST 2008, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING THE RESULTS

FROM THE SEAS TRIAL. IN DECEMBER 2009, THE FDA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE

DATA FROM THE SEAS TRIAL AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF INTERIM DATA FROM THE STUDY OF HEART AND RENAL

PROTECTION (SHARP) AND IMPROVE-IT TRIALS. BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE FDA

INDICATED IT BELIEVED IT IS UNLIKELY THAT

VYTORIN

OR

ZETIA

INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER-RELATED

DEATH. THE SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010. THE IMPROVE-IT TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR

COMPLETION IN 2013. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE SHARP TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010. NEGATIVE

RESULTS FROM THE SHARP TRIAL COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA.

FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE ENHANCE AND SEAS CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS, SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

DECLINED IN 2008 AND 2009 IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE ISSUES CONCERNING THE ENHANCE AND

SEAS CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SALES OF

VYTORIN

AND

ZETIA

AND COULD CONTINUE TO

HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SUCH SALES. IF SALES OF SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED,

MSDS BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS COULD ALSO BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THE LITIGATION

CONCERNING THE SALE AND PROMOTION OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS

BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND PROSPECTS.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CAN DEVELOP UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR EFFICACY CONCERNS.

UNEXPECTED SAFETY OR EFFICACY CONCERNS CAN ARISE WITH RESPECT TO MARKETED PRODUCTS, WHETHER OR

NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED, LEADING TO PRODUCT RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS, OR DECLINING SALES, AS WELL

AS PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER FRAUD AND/OR OTHER CLAIMS.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT MSDS BUSINESS.

ALL ASPECTS OF MSDS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING,

PRICING, SALES, LITIGATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION

AND REGULATION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND AGENCY REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS.

RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS AND OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

MSDS BUSINESS.

MSD DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SUPPLIERS, ALLIANCES WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, AND THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, FOR KEY ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS

INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT FOR ITS

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. FAILURE OF THESE THIRD PARTIES TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL,

REGULATORY AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO MSD OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY DISRUPT THE

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MSD AND THESE THIRD PARTIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS

BUSINESS.

MSD IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

MSD IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. ANY

SIGNIFICANT BREAKDOWN, INTRUSION, INTERRUPTION OR CORRUPTION OF THESE SYSTEMS OR DATA BREACHES

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, MSD CURRENTLY IS PROCEEDING WITH

A MULTI-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE WIDE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM, WHICH INCLUDES

MODIFICATION TO THE DESIGN, OPERATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, AND INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT THE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2010. ANY

MATERIAL PROBLEMS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MSDS BUSINESS.

DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF MSDS PRODUCTS.

EVEN AFTER A PRODUCT REACHES MARKET, CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL,

INCLUDING RESULTS IN POST-MARKETING PHASE IV TRIALS, MAY DECREASE DEMAND FOR MSDS PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



THE RE-REVIEW OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALREADY MARKETED;



NEW SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF SCIENTIFIC THEORIES;



THE RECALL OR LOSS OF MARKETING APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALREADY MARKETED;



CHANGING GOVERNMENT STANDARDS OR PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS REGARDING SAFETY, EFFICACY OR

LABELING CHANGES; AND



GREATER SCRUTINY IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, CLINICAL TRIALS AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF CERTAIN MARKETED

DRUGS OF MSD AND OF COMPETITORS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY HAVE RAISED SAFETY CONCERNS THAT HAVE LED TO

RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS OR ADVERSE LABELING OF MARKETED PRODUCTS. CLINICAL TRIALS AND

POST-MARKETING

SURVEILLANCE OF CERTAIN MARKETED DRUGS ALSO HAVE RAISED CONCERNS AMONG SOME PRESCRIBERS AND

PATIENTS RELATING TO THE SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN GENERAL THAT HAVE

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE SALES OF SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, INCREASED SCRUTINY OF THE OUTCOMES OF

CLINICAL TRIALS HAS LED TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN MARKET REACTION. FURTHER, THESE MATTERS OFTEN

ATTRACT LITIGATION AND, EVEN WHERE THE BASIS FOR THE LITIGATION IS GROUNDLESS, CONSIDERABLE

RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED TO RESPOND.

IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING THE WAKE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES,

HEALTH AUTHORITIES SUCH AS THE FDA, THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND

MEDICAL DEVICE AGENCY HAVE INCREASED THEIR FOCUS ON SAFETY WHEN ASSESSING THE BENEFIT/RISK BALANCE

OF DRUGS. SOME HEALTH AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO HAVE BECOME MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT

APPROVABILITY OF NEW PRODUCTS OR INDICATIONS AND ARE RE-REVIEWING SELECT PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALREADY

MARKETED, ADDING FURTHER TO THE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE REGULATORY PROCESSES. THERE IS ALSO GREATER

REGULATORY SCRUTINY, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION AND, IN

PARTICULAR, DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING.

IF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS ARE DISCOVERED OR IF THERE IS AN INCREASE IN NEGATIVE

PUBLICITY REGARDING KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS OF ANY OF MSDS PRODUCTS, IT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE

DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT OR REQUIRE MSD TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT SALES, INCLUDING

REMOVING THE PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET, RESTRICTING ITS DISTRIBUTION OR APPLYING FOR LABELING

CHANGES. FURTHER, IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ALL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OPERATE, MSD IS

AT RISK FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

MSD IS SUBJECT TO EVOLVING AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES

THAT MAY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MSD IS SUBJECT TO EVOLVING AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED FOR DETERMINING MSDS TAX LIABILITIES, AND MSDS TAX RETURNS ARE

PERIODICALLY EXAMINED BY VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES. MSD BELIEVES THAT ITS ACCRUAL FOR TAX

CONTINGENCIES IS ADEQUATE FOR ALL OPEN YEARS BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE, INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAW,

AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY TAX AUTHORITIES; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF TAX

CONTINGENCIES, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF ANY TAX MATTERS MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS GREATER OR LESS

THAN AMOUNTS ACCRUED.

IN FEBRUARY 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMAS ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE

U.S. INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT WOULD LIMIT U.S. TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR EXPENSES

RELATED TO UN-REPATRIATED FOREIGN-SOURCE INCOME AND MODIFY THE U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RULES. WE

CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER THESE PROPOSALS WILL BE ENACTED INTO LAW OR WHAT, IF ANY, CHANGES MAY BE

MADE TO SUCH PROPOSALS PRIOR TO THEIR BEING ENACTED INTO LAW. IF THESE OR OTHER CHANGES TO THE

U.S. INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS ARE ENACTED, THEY COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL

RESULTS OF MSD.

IN ADDITION, MSD MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING TAX RATE CHANGES, CHANGES

TO THE LAWS RELATED TO THE REMITTANCE OF FOREIGN EARNINGS (DEFERRAL), OR OTHER LIMITATIONS

IMPACTING THE U.S. TAX TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, NEW TAX LAWS, AND REVISED TAX LAW

INTERPRETATIONS IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.

MSDS DEBT OBLIGATIONS INCURRED TO FINANCE THE MERGER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS.

WHILE MSDS FINANCING STRATEGY FOR THE MERGER WAS FOCUSED ON PRESERVING FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND

FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MSDS BUSINESS AND KEY GROWTH DRIVERS POST-MERGER, DEBT

OBLIGATIONS INCURRED TO FINANCE THE MERGER COULD AFFECT MSDS FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR

REACTING TO, CHANGES IN ITS BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES, THEREBY PLACING IT AT A

COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO COMPETITORS THAT HAVE LESS INDEBTEDNESS. FURTHER, IF MSD

DECIDES TO RETIRE OR PAY DOWN INDEBTEDNESS EARLY IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO DO SO, THEREBY REDUCING THE AVAILABILITY OF ITS CASH

FLOW FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR PRODUCTS MAY BE LIMITED, COST PROHIBITIVE OR UNAVAILABLE.

AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE HAS BECOME LESS AVAILABLE

WHILE THE COST HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY, MSD SELF-INSURES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RISK, AS THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HAS BECOME MORE

RESTRICTIVE. MSD HAS EVALUATED ITS RISKS AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF OBTAINING PRODUCT

LIABILITY INSURANCE OUTWEIGHS THE LIKELY BENEFITS OF THE COVERAGE THAT IS AVAILABLE AND, AS SUCH,

HAS NO INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITIES EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2004, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR

MSD PRODUCTS FIRST SOLD AFTER THAT DATE. MSD WILL CONTINUALLY ASSESS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS TO

ADDRESS ITS RISK; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL BE OBTAINED OR,

IF OBTAINED, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY COVER PRODUCT LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THE ANNUAL REPORT, AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY MSD MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN IDENTIFY THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS, WILL, ESTIMATES,

FORECASTS, PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT

THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO

ADDRESS MSDS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT

POTENTIAL, AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH STATEMENT AND SHOULD

UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM MSDS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF

OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE NOT. NO

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY. MSD DOES

NOT ASSUME THE OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. MSD CAUTIONS YOU NOT TO PLACE

UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR

IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AS MSDS PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION.



INCREASED BRAND COMPETITION IN THERAPEUTIC AREAS IMPORTANT TO MSDS LONG-TERM BUSINESS

PERFORMANCE.



THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE

LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A DRUG

CANDIDATE CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE LATE-STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES

COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING IN

DEVELOPMENT BUT FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS, THE INABILITY

TO OBTAIN NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE

AND/OR THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE

SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.



PRICING PRESSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, INCLUDING RULES AND PRACTICES OF

MANAGED CARE GROUPS, JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM, PHARMACEUTICAL REIMBURSEMENT AND PRICING IN

GENERAL.



CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT THEREOF AFFECTING MSDS

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT DIRECTLY MSDS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RECENTLY ENACTED LAWS

IN A MAJORITY OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION.



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS PROMULGATED BY STANDARD-SETTING OR REGULATORY BODIES,

INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD AND THE SEC, THAT ARE ADVERSE TO MSD.
