RISK

FACTORS.

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF THE INFORMATION SET FORTH

IN THIS

FORM 10-K,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST

IN ANY OF THE COMPANYS SECURITIES. THE RISKS BELOW ARE NOT

THE ONLY ONES THE COMPANY FACES. ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT CURRENTLY

KNOWN TO THE COMPANY OR THAT THE COMPANY PRESENTLY DEEMS

IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. THIS

FORM 10-K

ALSO CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANYS RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY

DIFFER FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISKS

IT FACES AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE. SEE CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS ON PAGE 21.

THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW

VIOXX

, ITS ARTHRITIS AND ACUTE PAIN MEDICATION, FROM THE

MARKET WORLDWIDE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY

27,400 PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY

46,100 PLAINTIFF GROUPS, ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURIES RESULTING

FROM THE USE OF

VIOXX,

HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN APPROXIMATELY 264 PURPORTED CLASS

ACTIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF

VIOXX.

(ALL OF THESE SUITS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS.) IN ADDITION TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT

LIABILITY LAWSUITS, VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND

INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND

SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY

ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

REGARDING

VIOXX

IN VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE

SECURITIES LAWS (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

SECURITIES LAWSUITS). IN ADDITION,

VARIOUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND SEVERAL CURRENT AND FORMER

16

EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT

(ERISA). (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS.) IN ADDITION,

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FILED AND

DISMISSED ARE NOW ON APPEAL AND SEVERAL SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED

DEMANDS WITH THE COMPANY ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST THE BOARD

MEMBERS AND COMPANY OFFICERS. (ALL OF THESE SUITS AND DEMANDS

ARE REFERRED TO AS THE 

VIOXX

DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE

VIOXX

SECURITIES

LAWSUITS AND THE

VIOXX

ERISA LAWSUITS, THE 

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN NAMED

AS A DEFENDANT IN ACTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. (ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS.) THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

BEEN SUED BY FOUR STATES WITH RESPECT TO THE MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

RELATING TO

VIOXX

WILL BE FILED AGAINST IT

AND/OR

CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANY

CONCERNING

VIOXX.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS

ISSUED A SUBPOENA REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH, MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES WITH

RESPECT TO

VIOXX

IN A FEDERAL HEALTH CARE INVESTIGATION

UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS

BY CERTAIN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

EUROPE. A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM THIRTY-ONE STATES AND

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS SALES AND MARKETING OF

VIOXX.

THE COMPANY

IS COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES IN ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

(ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE



VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.) THE COMPANY CAN NOT

PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS; HOWEVER,

THEY COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL CIVIL

AND/OR

CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

TO DATE, IN THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, OF

THE 29 PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL,

THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE DISMISSED, THE CLAIMS OF SEVEN WERE

WITHDRAWN FROM THE TRIAL CALENDAR BY PLAINTIFFS, AND JURIES HAVE

DECIDED IN MERCKS FAVOR NINE TIMES AND IN PLAINTIFFS

FAVOR FOUR TIMES. IN ADDITION, IN THE RECENT CALIFORNIA TRIAL

INVOLVING TWO PLAINTIFFS, THE JURY COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT FOR

EITHER PLAINTIFF AND A MISTRIAL WAS DECLARED. A NEW JERSEY STATE

JUDGE SET ASIDE ONE OF THE NINE MERCK VERDICTS. WITH RESPECT TO

THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS VERDICTS, MERCK ALREADY HAS FILED AN

APPEAL OR SOUGHT JUDICIAL REVIEW IN EACH OF THOSE CASES, AND IN

ONE OF THOSE FOUR, A FEDERAL JUDGE OVERTURNED THE DAMAGE AWARD

SHORTLY AFTER TRIAL. IN ADDITION, A CONSOLIDATED TRIAL WITH TWO

PLAINTIFFS IS CURRENTLY ONGOING IN THE COORDINATED PROCEEDING IN

NEW JERSEY SUPERIOR COURT BEFORE JUDGE HIGBEE AND ANOTHER TRIAL

HAS COMMENCED IN STATE COURT IN ILLINOIS. THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION IS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW

IN ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

THE OUTCOMES OF THESE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY TRIALS

SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED TO INDICATE ANY TREND OR WHAT OUTCOME

MAY BE LIKELY IN FUTURE

VIOXX

TRIALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT A NUMBER OF

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS WILL BE TRIED IN 2007. A TRIAL IN

THE OREGON SECURITIES CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR 2007, BUT THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL PROCEED ON

SCHEDULE OR THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE OTHER

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT TRIALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY

LAWSUITS,

VIOXX

SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS AND

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS (COLLECTIVELY, THE 

VIOXX

LAWSUITS) AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS DEFENSE COSTS AND

ANY LOSSES.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY SPENT $500 MILLION, INCLUDING

$175 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN THE AGGREGATE IN

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS WORLDWIDE RELATED TO (I) THE

VIOXX

PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS, (II) THE VIOXX SHAREHOLDER

LAWSUITS, (III) THE

VIOXX

FOREIGN LAWSUITS, AND

(IV) THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE



VIOXX

LITIGATION). IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $598 MILLION AND IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER IT RECORDED ANOTHER CHARGE OF

$75 MILLION, TO INCREASE THE RESERVE SOLELY FOR ITS FUTURE

LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO THE

VIOXX

LITIGATION FROM

$685 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 TO $858 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THIS RESERVE IS BASED ON CERTAIN

ASSUMPTIONS, DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT THAT

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, AT THIS TIME, WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2008.

THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ANY AMOUNT OF

DAMAGES THAT IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS. THESE

PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS, ARE

CURRENTLY AT AN EARLY STAGE AND THE COMPANY HAS VERY LITTLE

INFORMATION AS TO THE COURSE THE PROCEEDINGS WILL TAKE. IN VIEW

OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE ARE MANY CLAIMANTS AND THE

CLAIMANTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO

PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND AT THIS TIME CANNOT

REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS WITH

RESPECT TO THE

VIOXX

17

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY RESERVES FOR ANY

POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS.

A SERIES OF UNFAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN THE

VIOXX

LAWSUITS OR

THE

VIOXX

INVESTIGATIONS, RESULTING IN THE PAYMENT OF

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR FINES OR RESULTING IN CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS, CASH FLOW, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION

AND PROSPECTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND, WHEN THAT OCCURS,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON PATENTS TO PROVIDE IT WITH EXCLUSIVE

MARKETING RIGHTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. AS

PRODUCT PATENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAVE

RECENTLY EXPIRED, OR ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE, IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION

FROM LOWER PRICE GENERIC DRUGS. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR

ONE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TYPICALLY LEADS TO A RAPID

LOSS OF SALES FOR THAT PRODUCT, AS LOWER PRICED GENERIC VERSIONS

OF THAT DRUG BECOME AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS THAT

CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMPANYS SALES, THE LOSS

OF PATENT PROTECTION CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2006,

ZOCOR,

THE COMPANYS STATIN FOR

MODIFYING CHOLESTEROL, LOST ITS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE

UNITED STATES.

ZOCOR

HAD ALREADY LOST ITS BASIC

PATENT PROTECTION IN MANY MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE

COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

ZOCOR

SALES. WORLDWIDE SALES OF

ZOCOR

WERE

$2.8 BILLION IN 2006, COMPARED TO $4.4 BILLION IN

2005. WORLDWIDE SALES OF

ZOCOR

ARE EXPECTED TO BE

$0.6 BILLION TO $0.9 BILLION IN 2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY APPEALED A DECISION OF THE

OPPOSITION DIVISION (THE OPPOSITION DIVISION) OF THE

EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE (THE EPO) THAT REVOKED THE

COMPANYS PATENT IN EUROPE THAT COVERS THE ONCE-WEEKLY

ADMINISTRATION OF ALENDRONATE. THAT DECISION WAS UPHELD AND,

THEREFORE, PRESENTLY THE COMPANY IS NOT ENTITLED TO MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR

FOSAMAX

IN MOST MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS

AFTER 2007. IN ADDITION, MERCKS BASIC PATENT COVERING THE

USE OF ALENDRONATE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ADVERSE DECISIONS IN

GERMANY, HOLLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE DECISION IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM WAS UPHELD ON APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED

THE DECISIONS IN GERMANY AND HOLLAND. THE COMPANY EXPECTS A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EUROPEAN SALES OF

FOSAMAX

AFTER

LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY. SALES OF

FOSAMAX

OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES IN 2006 HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC ALENDRONATE SODIUM PRODUCTS IN

SOME MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND GERMANY.

ON JANUARY 28, 2005, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FEDERAL CIRCUIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THE

COMPANYS PATENT CLAIMS FOR ONCE-WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION OF

FOSAMAX

TO BE INVALID. THE COMPANY EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS

TO APPEAL THIS DECISION IN 2005. BASED ON THE COURT OF APPEALS

DECISION,

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

WILL LOSE

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND

APRIL 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

FOSAMAX

AND

FOSAMAX PLUS D

SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER EACH PRODUCTS RESPECTIVE

LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT

SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND THE

COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS; IN CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO REPLACE SALES OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST

PATENT PROTECTION.

LIKE OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS

EACH YEAR. DECLINES IN SALES OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

MEAN THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE

SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

NEW PRODUCTS WHICH IT DEVELOPS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND

PRODUCTS WHICH IT IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH LICENSE OR

ACQUISITION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMPANY COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL

EFFORT, FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

BOTH THROUGH ITS OWN DEDICATED RESOURCES, AND THROUGH VARIOUS

COLLABORATIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THE COMPANY MUST MAKE ONGOING, SUBSTANTIAL

EXPENDITURES, WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFORTS IT IS

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN A COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT. THE

COMPANY MUST ALSO COMMIT SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS, FUNDS AND OTHER

RESOURCES TO RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGH QUALITY SCIENTISTS

AND OTHER PERSONNEL WITH PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPERTISE.

18

BASED ON FDA STATISTICS, DRUG DEVELOPMENT TIME FROM INITIATION

OF PRECLINICAL TESTING TO NDA APPROVAL CAN RANGE FROM 5 TO

20 YEARS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 8.5 YEARS. FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, SEE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ABOVE. EACH PHASE OF

TESTING IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND DURING EACH PHASE THERE IS A

SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER SERIOUS

OBSTACLES OR WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE

COMPANY MAY ABANDON A PRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY. SOME OF THE RISKS

ENCOUNTERED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING: PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF A NEW COMPOUND MAY YIELD

DISAPPOINTING RESULTS; CLINICAL TRIALS OF A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE OR MAY HAVE HARMFUL

SIDE EFFECTS; A NEW DRUG MAY NOT BE APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ITS

INTENDED USE; IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A PATENT FOR A

NEW DRUG; OR SALES OF A NEW PRODUCT MAY BE DISAPPOINTING.

THE COMPANY CANNOT STATE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN OR WHETHER ANY OF

ITS PRODUCTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL BE LAUNCHED; WHETHER IT

WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE COMPOUNDS,

PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS; OR WHETHER ANY PRODUCTS, ONCE

LAUNCHED, WILL BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCTS AND

SUCCESSFUL NEW INDICATIONS OR BRAND EXTENSIONS FOR EXISTING

PRODUCTS SUFFICIENT BOTH TO COVER ITS SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TO REPLACE SALES THAT ARE LOST AS

PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

ZOCOR

AND

FOSAMAX

,

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION OR ARE DISPLACED BY COMPETING PRODUCTS OR

THERAPIES. FAILURE TO DO SO IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL POSITION AND

PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, CAN NOT BE MARKETED UNLESS THE COMPANY OBTAINS AND

MAINTAINS REGULATORY APPROVAL.

THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PRECLINICAL

TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING ITS

PRODUCTS, ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THE FDA, AND BY FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE FDA IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY, AS

IT ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, APPROVAL,

SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING AND MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS. IN MANY CASES, THE FDA

REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY

NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IN

THE UNITED STATES. REGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO IS

PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND, IN MANY

CASES, COST REDUCTION. THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

TESTING, TO DELAY OR WITHHOLD REGISTRATION AND MARKETING

APPROVAL AND TO MANDATE PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IT

WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS UNLESS AND

UNTIL IT HAS OBTAINED ALL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN EACH

JURISDICTION WHERE IT PROPOSES TO MARKET THE NEW PRODUCTS. ONCE

OBTAINED, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN APPROVAL AS LONG AS IT PLANS

TO MARKET ITS NEW PRODUCTS IN EACH JURISDICTION WHERE APPROVAL

IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL,

SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, OR ITS FAILURE TO

MAINTAIN APPROVAL IN ANY JURISDICTION WILL PREVENT IT FROM

SELLING THE NEW PRODUCTS IN THAT JURISDICTION UNTIL APPROVAL IS

OBTAINED, IF EVER. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE

REVENUES FOR THOSE NEW PRODUCTS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT

DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS PATENT RIGHTS, AND IF ITS

PATENT RIGHTS ARE INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, ITS BUSINESS

WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PATENT PROTECTION IS CONSIDERED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO BE OF

MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE COMPANYS MARKETING OF HUMAN

HEALTH PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN MOST MAJOR FOREIGN

MARKETS. PATENTS COVERING PRODUCTS THAT IT HAS INTRODUCED

NORMALLY PROVIDE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

SUCCESSFUL MARKETING AND SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SEEKS

PATENTS COVERING EACH OF ITS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THE MARKETS

WHERE IT INTENDS TO SELL THE PRODUCTS AND WHERE MEANINGFUL

PATENT PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE.

EVEN IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS IN OBTAINING PATENTS COVERING ITS

PRODUCTS, THIRD PARTIES OR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE

OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE OR CIRCUMVENT ITS PATENTS AND PATENT

APPLICATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TO

DEFEND SUCCESSFULLY THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROVIDE MARKET

EXCLUSIVITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS OFTEN INVOLVED IN

PATENT DISPUTES RELATING TO CHALLENGES TO ITS PATENTS OR

INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDS ITS IMPORTANT PATENTS BOTH WITHIN AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING BY FILING CLAIMS OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST OTHER PARTIES. SEE ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS  PATENT

19

LITIGATION BELOW. IN PARTICULAR, MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME FILE ABBREVIATED NEW

DRUG APPLICATIONS (ANDA) WITH THE FDA SEEKING TO

MARKET GENERIC FORMS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION OF RELEVANT PATENTS OWNED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

NORMALLY RESPONDS BY VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS PATENT, INCLUDING

BY FILING LAWSUITS ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. PATENT

LITIGATION AND OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PATENTS

ARE COSTLY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY DEPRIVE THE COMPANY OF

MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR A PATENTED PRODUCT OR, IN SOME CASES,

THIRD PARTY PATENTS MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING AND

SELLING A PRODUCT IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

IF ONE OR MORE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS LOSE PATENT PROTECTION IN

PROFITABLE MARKETS, SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO

DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF THOSE

PRODUCTS BECOMING AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LOST SALES UNLESS

AND UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED COMMERCIALLY

SUCCESSFUL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LOWER-COST GENERIC

PRODUCTS.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM

LOWER-COST GENERIC PRODUCTS. THE PATENT RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ITS

PRODUCTS ARE OF VARYING STRENGTHS AND DURATIONS. IN ADDITION, IN

SOME COUNTRIES, PATENT PROTECTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER THAN

IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE EU. IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICAL

PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS LED TO

LEGISLATION WHICH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF GENERIC PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ACTIVELY PROTECT ITS

PATENT RIGHTS, GENERIC CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

CAN ARISE AT ANY TIME, AND IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE

EMERGENCE OF GENERIC COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT TYPICALLY IS FOLLOWED

PROMPTLY BY GENERIC SUBSTITUTES, REDUCING THE COMPANYS

SALES OF THAT PRODUCT. AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTES FOR

THE COMPANYS DRUGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN ADDITION, PROPOSALS EMERGE FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR

LEGISLATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE EARLY AND RAPID APPROVAL OF

GENERIC DRUGS. ANY SUCH PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED INTO LAW COULD

WORSEN THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

SALES AND, POTENTIALLY, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.

THE COMPANY FACES INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. THIS COMPETITION MAY INCREASE AS NEW

PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THE

COMPETITORS PRODUCTS MAY BE SAFER OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR

MORE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AND SOLD THAN THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN THE CASE OF GENERIC COMPETITION,

THEY MAY BE EQUALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE SOLD

AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

AS A RESULT, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE

POSITION, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY FACES PRICING PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO ITS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICE

PRESSURES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN THE

UNITED STATES. THESE INCLUDE (I) PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE

GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL PURCHASERS AND

(II) U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, INCLUDING THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003

ACT).

THE 2003 ACT INCLUDED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR

INDIVIDUALS WHICH FIRST WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1,

2006. THE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE

ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES COULD RESULT IN FURTHER

PRICING PRESSURES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PRICING PRESSURES TO

INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS.

ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, PRICING, SALES,

LITIGATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND AGENCY REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

CAUTIONARY

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

THIS REPORT AND OTHER WRITTEN REPORTS AND ORAL STATEMENTS MADE

FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE COMPANY MAY CONTAIN SO-CALLED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENTS. ONE CAN

IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY THEIR USE OF WORDS

SUCH AS EXPECTS, PLANS,

WILL, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS,

PROJECTS AND OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ONE CAN

ALSO IDENTIFY THEM BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY

TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO

ADDRESS THE COMPANYS GROWTH STRATEGY, FINANCIAL RESULTS,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT APPROVALS, PRODUCT POTENTIAL, AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. ONE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ANY SUCH

STATEMENT AND SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS AND A BROAD VARIETY OF OTHER RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE KNOWN AND SOME THAT ARE

NOT. NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED AND ACTUAL

FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ASSUME

THE OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. THE

COMPANY CAUTIONS YOU NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, THEY MAY INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.



SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RELATED TO

VIOXX.



COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AS THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

LOSE PATENT PROTECTION.



INCREASED BRAND COMPETITION IN THERAPEUTIC AREAS

IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.



THE DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A CANDIDATE CAN

FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND ONE OR MORE LATE-STAGE

PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD FAIL TO RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL.

NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY APPEAR PROMISING IN DEVELOPMENT BUT

FAIL TO REACH THE MARKET BECAUSE OF EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS,

THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE

DIFFICULTY OR EXCESSIVE COST TO MANUFACTURE

AND/OR

THE

INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF

OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, THE SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY PROVE TO BE

DISAPPOINTING AND FAIL TO REACH ANTICIPATED LEVELS.



PRICING PRESSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD,

INCLUDING RULES AND PRACTICES OF MANAGED CARE GROUPS, JUDICIAL

DECISIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM, PHARMACEUTICAL

REIMBURSEMENT AND PRICING IN GENERAL.



CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT

THEREOF AFFECTING THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.



EFFICACY OR SAFETY CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO MARKETED PRODUCTS,

WHETHER OR NOT SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED, LEADING TO PRODUCT

RECALLS, WITHDRAWALS OR DECLINING SALES.



LEGAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, ANTITRUST

LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING TAX

DISPUTES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND PATENT DISPUTES WITH

BRANDED AND GENERIC COMPETITORS, ANY OF WHICH COULD PRECLUDE

COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING PRODUCTS.



LOST MARKET OPPORTUNITY RESULTING FROM DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTIES

IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS OF THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.



INCREASED FOCUS ON PRIVACY ISSUES IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. THE LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ISSUES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

DIRECTLY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO THE TAXATION OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS.



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS PROMULGATED BY

STANDARD-SETTING OR REGULATORY BODIES, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD AND THE SEC, THAT ARE ADVERSE TO THE

COMPANY.

21



ECONOMIC FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL,

INCLUDING CHANGES IN INFLATION, INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THIS LIST SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN EXHAUSTIVE STATEMENT OF

ALL POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. SEE RISK
