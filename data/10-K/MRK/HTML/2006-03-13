<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merck &#038; Co., Inc. (&#147;Merck&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a global research-driven pharmaceutical
company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of innovative products to
improve human and animal health, directly and through its joint ventures. The Company sells its
products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and
managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations and other institutions. The
Company&#146;s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of its
products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices and managed care
organizations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview &#151; </I>In December&nbsp;2005, Merck unveiled a plan to reclaim its leadership position in the
pharmaceutical industry. As part of the strategy, Merck is focusing on improving its research and
development (&#147;R&#038;D&#148;) productivity by focusing on select therapeutic areas, implementing a new
commercial model that will deliver greater value to customers, and reducing its overall cost
structure companywide.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merck&#146;s new R&#038;D model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of
success by prioritizing the Company&#146;s R&#038;D resources on nine priority disease areas &#150; Alzheimer&#146;s
disease, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, novel vaccines, obesity, oncology,
pain and sleep disorders. These therapeutic areas were carefully chosen based on a set of
criteria including unmet medical needs, scientific opportunity and commercial opportunity. Within
these therapeutic areas, Merck will commit resources to achieve research breadth and depth and to
develop best-in-class targeted and differentiated products that are valued highly by patients,
payers and physicians.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will also make focused investments to pursue specific mechanisms in the following
selected disease areas: antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals (hepatitis C virus, human
immunodeficiency virus), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neurodegeneration,
ophthalmology, osteoporosis, schizophrenia and stroke. In addition, the Company will capitalize
on selected opportunities outside these areas by continuing to commercialize attractive clinical
development candidates in the pipeline and by pursuing appropriate external licensing
opportunities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merck&#146;s late-stage pipeline is showing strong progress with three Biologics License
Application (&#147;BLA&#148;)&nbsp;submissions to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;)&nbsp;in 2005, one New Drug
Application (&#147;NDA&#148;)&nbsp;already filed with the FDA in 2006, two additional FDA filings anticipated in
2006, and an expected five programs in Phase III by the first quarter of 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
three FDA BLA submissions in 2005 include <I>Gardasil</I>, a breakthrough vaccine to help prevent
cervical cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide; <I>Zostavax</I>, a vaccine
to reduce the incidence of shingles; and <I>RotaTeq</I>, a pediatric vaccine to prevent rotavirus
gastroenteritis, a leading cause of diarrhea in infants and young children, which leads to nearly
500,000 deaths worldwide each year. On February&nbsp;3, 2006, Merck announced the approval by the FDA
of <I>RotaTeq</I>. In addition, on February&nbsp;7, 2006, Merck announced that the FDA has accepted the BLA
for <I>Gardasil </I>and granted the vaccine priority review
designation. The FDA's review of <I>Zostavax</I> is expected to be
completed by late May 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;15, 2006, Merck announced that the NDA filed with the FDA for <I>Januvia </I>(the
proposed trademark for the compound known as MK-0431), a novel mechanism for the treatment of type
2 diabetes, was accepted for standard review. Merck also anticipates two additional FDA filings
in 2006: vorinostat (the generic name for the suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid compound), a
histone deacetylase inhibitor for cancer; and MK-0517, an intravenous prodrug of aprepitant to
treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve its commercial selling model, Merck will continue to streamline and restructure
its marketing and sales operations worldwide to improve their effectiveness and generate greater
efficiencies. In the United States, the Company already has reduced the number of sales
representatives promoting the same product by 50
percent versus historical levels. In addition, Merck will place more emphasis on active
engagement with key

information and devote additional resources to utilizing technology and demonstrating product
value to physicians, as well as payers and consumers who have increasing influence on prescription
decisions. In the United States, this approach has already resulted in considerable productivity
improvements in pilot programs and is expected to lower the Company&#146;s spending per brand by 15 to
20&nbsp;percent by 2010, while maximizing sales performance. To provide additional support to its
upcoming vaccine launches, in the United States Merck is redeploying 1,500 sales representatives
who currently promote its major in-line products to support the launch of new vaccines.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Company announced the first phase of a global restructuring program
designed to reduce the Company&#146;s cost structure, increase efficiency, and enhance competitiveness.
The initial steps will include the implementation of a new supply strategy by the Merck
Manufacturing Division, which is intended to create a leaner, more cost-effective and
customer-focused manufacturing model over the next three years. As part of this program, Merck
plans to sell or close five manufacturing sites and two preclinical sites by the end of 2008, and
eliminate approximately 7,000 positions company-wide. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, approximately 1,100
positions throughout the Company had been eliminated. Merck incurred $401.2&nbsp;million in costs
associated with the global restructuring program which were comprised of $205.4&nbsp;million of
separation costs and $195.8&nbsp;million of accelerated depreciation and asset impairment costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing facilities included in this action are: Ponders End, United Kingdom;
Okazaki, Japan; Kirkland, Canada; Albany, Georgia and Danville, Pennsylvania. The two preclinical
sites are in Okazaki and Menuma, Japan. The Company will incur significantly larger accelerated
depreciation charges during 2006 associated with these actions. The asset impairment charge was
associated with the abandonment of certain fixed assets that will no longer be used in the business
as a result of these restructuring actions. The Company also plans to close its basic research
center in Terlings Park, United Kingdom, and incurred additional accelerated depreciation costs of
$103.1&nbsp;million during 2005 with respect to this site.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional charges of approximately $800&nbsp;million to $1&nbsp;billion are expected to be recorded
during 2006, based on estimated time of completion, as the sales/closures of the facilities
previously discussed occur. Merck expects its cost reduction program to yield cumulative pre-tax
savings of $4.5 to $5.0&nbsp;billion from 2006 through 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Jobs Creation Act (&#147;AJCA&#148;), signed into law in October&nbsp;2004, created temporary
incentives through December&nbsp;31, 2005 for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income
earned outside of the United States as of December&nbsp;31, 2002. In connection with the AJCA, the
Company repatriated $15.9&nbsp;billion during 2005, and as a result, recorded an income tax charge of
$766.5&nbsp;million. This charge was partially offset by a $100&nbsp;million benefit associated with the
decision to implement certain tax planning strategies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, on September&nbsp;30, 2004, Merck announced a voluntary worldwide
withdrawal of <I>Vioxx</I>, its arthritis and acute pain medication. As a result, the Company recorded a
charge to pre-tax income of $726.2&nbsp;million, or $552.6&nbsp;million after tax adjustment to net income,
in the third quarter 2004. This did not include charges for future legal defense costs. The <I>Vioxx</I>
withdrawal process was completed during 2005 and the costs associated with the withdrawal were in
line with the original amounts recorded by the Company in 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had established a reserve of $675&nbsp;million solely for its
future <I>Vioxx </I>legal defense costs. During 2005, the Company spent $285&nbsp;million in the aggregate in
<I>Vioxx </I>legal defense costs worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a charge
of $295&nbsp;million to increase the reserve solely for its future legal defense costs related to <I>Vioxx</I>
to $685&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005. This reserve is based on certain assumptions and is the best
estimate of the amount that the Company believes, at this time, it can reasonably estimate will be
spent through 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings per common share assuming dilution for 2005 were $2.10, including the impact of the
global
restructuring program of $0.12 per share, the net tax charge primarily associated with the
AJCA of $0.31 per share and additional reserves established solely for future legal defense costs
for <I>Vioxx </I>litigation (as discussed above).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;3, 2006, Merck announced the approval by the FDA of <I>RotaTeq</I>, a pediatric vaccine
to prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis. <I>RotaTeq </I>is an oral pentavalent three-dose liquid vaccine
that contains five human serotypes: G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1. Merck has also submitted applications
for licensure of <I>RotaTeq </I>in more than 50&nbsp;countries
including Australia, Canada and countries in Asia and Latin America and,
through the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture, in the European Union
(&#147;EU&#148;). <i>RotaTeq</i> also received regulatory approval in
Mexico in November 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Voluntary
Withdrawal of Vioxx &#151; </I>On September&nbsp;30, 2004, Merck announced a voluntary worldwide
withdrawal of <I>Vioxx</I>, its arthritis and acute pain medication. The Company&#146;s decision, which was
effective immediately, was based on new three-year data from a prospective, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial, APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on <I>Vioxx</I>).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial, which was stopped, was designed to evaluate the efficacy of <I>Vioxx </I>25 mg in
preventing the recurrence of colorectal polyps in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas
and to further assess the cardiovascular safety of <I>Vioxx</I>. In this study, there was an increased
relative risk for confirmed cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, beginning after
18&nbsp;months of treatment in the patients taking <I>Vioxx </I>compared to those taking placebo. The results
for the first 18&nbsp;months of the APPROVe study did not show any increased risk of confirmed
cardiovascular events on <I>Vioxx</I>, and in this respect, were similar to the results of two
placebo-controlled studies described in the most recent U.S. labeling for <I>Vioxx</I>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company estimates that there were 105&nbsp;million U.S. prescriptions written for <I>Vioxx </I>from
May&nbsp;1999 through August&nbsp;2004. Based on this estimate, the Company estimates that the number of
patients who have taken <I>Vioxx </I>in the United States since its 1999 launch is approximately 20
million. The number of patients outside the United States who have taken <I>Vioxx </I>is undetermined at
this time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2004, the Company received a letter from Senator Charles Grassley, Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Finance, requesting certain documents and information related to <I>Vioxx</I>. The
Company also received requests for information from other Congressional committees. The Company
intends to cooperate with these inquiries so that the Company can continue to describe the reasons
for the Company&#146;s voluntary withdrawal of <I>Vioxx </I>and to answer any questions related to the
Company&#146;s development and extensive testing of the medicine and its disclosures of the results of
its studies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;16-18, 2005, the FDA held a joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and
the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. The committees discussed the overall
benefit-to-risk considerations (including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety concerns) for
COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and related agents. On February&nbsp;18, 2005, the
members of the committees were asked to vote on whether the overall risk versus benefit profile for
<I>Vioxx </I>supports marketing in the United States. The members of the committees voted 17 to 15 in
support of the marketing of <I>Vioxx </I>in the United States. The Company looks forward to further
discussions with the FDA and other regulatory authorities about <I>Vioxx.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously announced, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed a Special Committee
to review the Company&#146;s actions prior to its voluntary withdrawal of <I>Vioxx, </I>to act for the Board in
responding to shareholder litigation matters related to the withdrawal of <I>Vioxx </I>and to advise the
Board with respect to any action that should be taken as a result of the review. That review is
ongoing.

</I>&#151; <I>Arcoxia </I>has been launched in 56 countries in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa.
In October, 2004, the Company received an &#147;approvable&#148; letter from the FDA for the Company&#146;s NDA for <I>Arcoxia</I>. The FDA informed the Company in the letter that before
approval of the NDA can be issued, additional safety and efficacy data for <I>Arcoxia </I>are required.
On November&nbsp;28, 2005, the European Commission adopted a binding Decision on COX-2 inhibitor
products, including <I>Arcoxia</I>, marketed in the EU. The Decision resulted from a review by the

including thrombotic and cardio-renal events, following the voluntary withdrawal of <I>Vioxx</I>. The
Decision adopted the Opinion of the EMEA issued on June&nbsp;27, 2005, which recommended new
cardiovascular contraindications and warnings for inclusion in the labeling of COX-2 inhibitors,
including <I>Arcoxia</I>, in the EU. The CHMP concluded that the available data show an increased risk of
cardiovascular adverse events for COX-2 inhibitors as a class relative to placebo and some NSAIDS
and that the data suggested an association between duration of use and dose and the probability of
suffering a cardiovascular event. Label modifications included in the EMEA&#146;s Opinion reflected
that use of the lowest effective dose of COX-2 inhibitors for the shortest possible duration of
treatment was recommended. Further, a contra-indication for all COX-2 inhibitors in patients with
ischemic heart disease or stroke and a contra-indication for certain patients having higher classes
of congestive heart failure were included. Specifically with respect to <I>Arcoxia, </I>label changes
included a contra-indication in patients with hypertension whose blood pressure is not under
control and that <I>Arcoxia </I>may be associated with more frequent and severe effects on blood pressure,
particularly at higher doses, than some other COX-2 inhibitors, and recommended monitoring of blood
pressure for all patients taking <I>Arcoxia. </I>Additional warnings regarding hypersensitivity and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, the Company and Astra restructured the joint venture whereby the Company acquired
Astra&#146;s interest in the joint venture, renamed KBI Inc. (&#147;KBI&#148;), and contributed KBI&#146;s operating
assets to a new U.S. limited partnership named Astra Pharmaceuticals, L.P. (the &#147;Partnership&#148;), in
which the Company maintains a limited partner interest. The Partnership, renamed AstraZeneca LP,
became the exclusive distributor of the products for which KBI retained rights. The Company earns
certain Partnership returns as well as ongoing revenue based on sales of current and future KBI
products. The Partnership returns include a priority return provided for in the Partnership
Agreement, variable returns based, in part, upon sales of certain former Astra USA, Inc. products,
and a preferential return representing the Company&#146;s share of undistributed Partnership GAAP
earnings. In conjunction with the 1998 restructuring, for a payment of $443.0&nbsp;million, Astra
purchased an option to buy the Company&#146;s interest in the KBI products, excluding the Company&#146;s
interest in the gastrointestinal medicines <I>Nexium </I>and <I>Prilosec</I>. The Company also granted Astra an
option (the &#147;Shares Option&#148;) to buy the Company&#146;s common stock interest in KBI, at an exercise
price based on the present value of estimated future net sales of <I>Nexium </I>and <I>Prilosec</I>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;1999, Astra merged with Zeneca Group Plc, forming AstraZeneca AB (&#147;AstraZeneca&#148;). As
a result of the merger, in exchange for the Company&#146;s relinquishment of rights to future Astra
products with no existing or pending U.S. patents at the time of the merger, Astra paid $967.4
million, which is subject to a true-up calculation in 2008 that may require repayment of all or a
portion of this amount. The merger also triggers a partial redemption of the Company&#146;s limited
partner interest in 2008. Furthermore, as a result of the merger, AstraZeneca&#146;s option to buy the
Company&#146;s interest in the KBI products is exercisable in 2010 and the Company has the right to
require AstraZeneca to purchase such interest in 2008. In addition, the Shares Option is
exercisable two years after Astra&#146;s purchase of the Company&#146;s interest in the KBI products. The
exercise of this option by Astra is also provided for in the year 2017 or if combined annual sales
of the two products fall below a minimum amount provided, in each case, only so long as either the
Merck option in 2008 or AstraZeneca&#146;s option in 2010 has been exercised. The exercise price is
based on the present value of estimated future net sales of <I>Nexium </I>and <I>Prilosec </I>as determined
at the time of exercise.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, the Company formed a joint venture with Johnson &#038; Johnson to develop and market a
broad range of nonprescription medicines for U.S. consumers. This 50% owned joint venture was
expanded into Europe in 1993, and into Canada in 1996. Significant joint venture products are
<I>Pepcid AC </I>(famotidine), an over-the-counter form of the Company&#146;s ulcer medication <I>Pepcid</I>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective April&nbsp;1992, the Company, through the Merck Vaccine Division, and Connaught
Laboratories, Inc. (now Sanofi Pasteur S.A.), agreed to collaborate on the development and
marketing of combination pediatric vaccines and to promote selected vaccines in the United States.
The research and marketing collaboration enables the companies to pool their resources to expedite
the development of vaccines combining several different antigens to protect children against a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, Sanofi Pasteur MSD (&#147;SPMSD&#148;), Merck&#146;s vaccine joint venture with Sanofi Pasteur,
entered into a Letter of Undertaking (LOU)&nbsp;with the EMEA due to
EMEA&#146;s concerns regarding the long-term efficacy of the hepatitis B component of <I>Hexavac. </I>The
hepatitis B component of <I>Hexavac </I>is manufactured by Merck. The LOU requires, in relevant part (1)
suspension of the EU <I>Hexavac </I>license; (2)&nbsp;suspension of <I>Hexavac </I>distribution; (3)&nbsp;a recall of
<I>Hexavac </I>product in the EU; (4)&nbsp;a recall of <I>Hexavac </I>in a number of non-EU countries; and (5)&nbsp;a
surveillance program and possible future revaccination. SPMSD, which markets and sells <I>Hexavac </I>in
part of the EU, has notified Merck that it is reserving any rights that it may have to seek damages
from Merck and to be defended, indemnified and held harmless by Merck in the event of third party
claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2005, the EMEA also initiated a formal review of the long-term efficacy of the
hepatitis B vaccine, <I>HBvaxPRO</I>, and of the hepatitis B component of the hepatitis B/Hib combination
vaccine, <I>Procomvax</I>. Both products are marketed and sold by SPMSD in its European territory, and
are sold elsewhere, under different names, by Merck. An assessment report prepared for the CHMP&nbsp;and Merck&#146;s response were considered at a
CHMP meeting in February&nbsp;2006. It is expected that the CHMP will conclude its review in April
2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the Company and Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc S.A. (now Sanofi-Aventis S.A.) combined their
respective animal health and poultry genetics businesses to form Merial Limited (&#147;Merial&#148;), a fully
integrated animal health company, which is a stand-alone joint venture, equally owned by each
party. Merial provides a comprehensive range of pharmaceuticals and vaccines to enhance the
health, well-being and performance of a wide range of animal species.
Merial divested its entire poultry
genetics business in three segments. The domestic turkey and layer segments were divested in 2004
and 2003, respectively, and the broiler and foreign turkey segments were sold in 2005.

are highly competitive and often highly regulated. Global efforts toward health care cost
containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and access.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such competition involves an intensive search for technological innovations and the ability to
market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development,
the Company is well prepared to compete in the search for technological innovations. Additional
resources to meet competition include quality control, flexibility to meet customer specifications,
an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. The Company is active
in acquiring and marketing products through joint ventures and licenses and has been refining its
sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions. To enhance its
product portfolio, the Company continues to pursue external alliances, from early-stage to
late-stage product opportunities, including joint ventures and targeted acquisitions. However, the
introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and
product replacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds
available to treat diseases typically increases over time and has resulted in slowing the growth in
sales of certain of the Company&#146;s products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation enacted in all states in the United States, particularly in the area of human
pharmaceutical products, allows, encourages or, in a few instances, in the absence of specific
instructions from the prescribing physician, mandates the use of &#147;generic&#148; products (those
containing the same active chemical as an innovator&#146;s product) rather than &#147;brand-name&#148; products.
Governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products have significantly
reduced the sales of certain of the Company&#146;s products no longer protected by patents, such as
<I>Vasotec </I>and <I>Vaseretic </I>(enalapril maleate in combination with hydrochlorothiazide)<I>, </I>the U.S. rights

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company implemented a new distribution program for U.S.
wholesalers to moderate the fluctuations in sales caused by wholesaler investment buying and
improve efficiencies in the distribution of Company pharmaceutical products. The new program
lowered previous limits on average monthly purchases of Company pharmaceutical products by U.S.

global regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies. Of particular importance is the
FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety,
effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In many
cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new
products and bring them to market in the United States. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration
Modernization Act (the &#147;FDA Modernization Act&#148;) was passed and was the culmination of a
comprehensive legislative reform effort designed to streamline regulatory procedures within the FDA
and to improve the regulation of drugs, medical devices and food. The legislation was principally
designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and effective drugs and biologics by expediting
the premarket review process for new products. A key provision of the legislation is the
re-authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, which permits the continued
collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers to augment FDA resources earmarked for
the review of human drug applications. This helps provide the resources necessary to ensure the
prompt approval of safe and effective new drugs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the government expanded health care access by enacting the Medicare
Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law in December
2003. Prescription drug coverage began on January&nbsp;1, 2006. This new benefit supports the
Company&#146;s goal of improving access to medicines by expanding insurance coverage, while preserving
market-based incentives for pharmaceutical innovation. At the same time, the benefit will ensure
that prescription drug costs will be controlled by competitive pressures and by encouraging the
appropriate use of medicines. In addressing cost-containment pressure, the Company has made a continuing effort to
demonstrate that its medicines can help save costs in overall patient health care.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the pharmaceutical industry has been under federal and state oversight with
the approval process for new drugs, drug safety, advertising and promotion, drug purchasing and
reimbursement programs and formularies variously under review. The Company believes that it will
continue to be able to conduct its operations, including the introduction of new drugs to the
market, in this regulatory environment. One type of federal initiative to contain federal health
care spending is the prospective or &#147;capitated&#148; payment system, first implemented to reduce the
rate of growth in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. Such a system establishes in advance a flat
rate for reimbursement for health care for those patients for whom the payor is fiscally
responsible. This type of payment system and other cost containment systems are now widely used by
public and private payors and have caused hospitals, health maintenance organizations and other
customers of the Company to be more cost-conscious in their treatment decisions, including
decisions regarding the medicines to be made available to their patients. The Company continues to
work with private and federal employers to slow increases in health care costs. Further, the

have helped offset the effects of increasing cost pressures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, federal and state governments have pursued methods to directly reduce the cost of drugs
and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal laws require the Company to pay specified
rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid, to provide discounts for outpatient medicines
purchased by certain Public Health Service entities and &#147;disproportionate share&#148; hospitals
(hospitals meeting certain criteria), and to provide minimum discounts of 24% off of a defined
&#147;non-federal average manufacturer price&#148; for purchases by certain components of the federal
government such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiatives in some states seek rebates beyond the minimum required by Medicaid legislation,
in some cases for patients beyond those who are eligible for Medicaid. Under the Federal Vaccines
for Children entitlement program, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#147;CDC&#148;) funds
and purchases recommended pediatric vaccines at a public sector price for the immunization of
Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, Native American and certain underinsured children. The Company was
awarded a CDC contract in 2005 for the supply of $340&nbsp;million of pediatric vaccines for the
Vaccines for Children program. As of January&nbsp;1, 2006, patients previously eligible for Medicaid
who are also Medicare beneficiaries (65&nbsp;years and older or disabled) will leave the
state-administered Medicaid system to be covered by the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the United States, the Company encounters similar regulatory and legislative issues in
most of the countries where it does business. There, too, the primary thrust of governmental
inquiry and action is toward determining drug safety and effectiveness, often with mechanisms for
controlling the prices of prescription drugs and the profits of prescription drug companies. The
EU has adopted directives concerning the classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale
distribution and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use. The Company&#146;s
policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives;
consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies and is, therefore,
subject to potential administrative actions. Such actions may include seizures of products and
other civil and criminal sanctions. Under certain circumstances, the Company on its own may deem
it advisable to initiate product recalls. The Company believes that it should be able to compete
effectively within this environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, certain countries within the EU, recognizing the economic importance of the
research-based pharmaceutical industry and the value of innovative medicines to society, are
working with industry representatives and the European Commission on proposals to complete the

currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.
These exclusivity provisions were re-authorized until October&nbsp;1, 2007 by the &#147;Best Pharmaceuticals
for Children Act&#148; passed in January&nbsp;2002. In 2005, the FDA granted an additional six months of
market exclusivity in the United States to <I>Invanz </I>until August&nbsp;2013. In 2004, the FDA granted an
additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States to <I>Trusopt </I>until October&nbsp;2008. In
2002, the FDA granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States to
<I>Cozaar/Hyzaar </I>until February&nbsp;2010. In 2005, the FDA granted an additional six months of market
exclusivity in the United States to <I>Singulair </I>until
August&nbsp;2012. For further information with respect to the
Company&#146;s patents, see &#147;Patent Litigation&#148; on
page&nbsp;31.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for
the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from: (i)
later-granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of
manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii)&nbsp;patents relating to the use of such
product; (iii)&nbsp;patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and (iv)&nbsp;in the United
States, market exclusivity that may be available under federal law. The effect of product patent
expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of
the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and
economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the
requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and
regulations in other countries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additions to market exclusivity are sought in the United States and other countries through
all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in
patent life have been partially offset by a general increase in the number of, incentives for and
use of generic products. Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in
the United States and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and
implementation of international treaties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2006, <I>Zocor </I>will lose its market exclusivity in the United States and the Company
expects a significant decline in U.S. <I>Zocor </I>sales after that time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2006, the basic patent in the United States covering <I>Proscar </I>will expire. As a
result, the Company expects a significant decline in U.S. <I>Proscar </I>sales after that time. The basic
patent for <I>Proscar </I>also covers <I>Propecia; </I>however, <I>Propecia </I>is protected by additional patents which
expire in October&nbsp;2013.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the FDA granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States
to <I>Fosamax </I>until February&nbsp;2008, and <I>Fosamax </I>Once Weekly until January&nbsp;2019. However, on January
28, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. found the Company&#146;s
patent claims for once-weekly administration of <I>Fosamax </I>to be invalid. The Company exhausted all
options to appeal this decision in 2005. Based on the Court of Appeals&#146; decision, <I>Fosamax </I>will
lose its market exclusivity in the United States in February&nbsp;2008 and the Company expects a
significant decline in U.S. <I>Fosamax </I>sales after that time.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for
existing products through a strong research and development program. Approximately 12,400 people
are employed in the Company&#146;s research activities. Expenditures for the Company&#146;s research and
development programs were $3.8&nbsp;billion in 2005, $4.0&nbsp;billion in 2004 and $3.2&nbsp;billion in 2003 and
are estimated to continue at the same level as the full-year 2005 expense in 2006. The Company
maintains its ongoing commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and clinical
development in support of new products. Total expenditures for the period 1996 through 2005
exceeded $25.6&nbsp;billion with a compound annual growth rate of 11%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in
biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. Merck&#146;s
new R&#038;D
model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by
prioritizing the Company&#146;s R&#038;D resources on nine priority disease areas &#151; Alzheimer&#146;s disease,
atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, novel vaccines, obesity, oncology, pain and
sleep disorders. These therapeutic areas were carefully chosen based on a set of criteria
including unmet medical needs, scientific opportunity and commercial opportunity. Within these
therapeutic areas, Merck will commit resources to achieve research breadth and depth and to develop
best-in-class targeted and differentiated products that are valued highly by patients, payers and
physicians.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will also make focused investments to pursue specific mechanisms in the following
selected disease areas: antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals (hepatitis C virus, human
immunodeficiency virus), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neurodegeneration,
ophthalmology, osteoporosis, schizophrenia and stroke. In addition, the Company will capitalize on
selected opportunities outside these areas by continuing to commercialize attractive clinical
development candidates in the pipeline and by pursuing appropriate external licensing
opportunities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of human health products, industry practice and government regulations in
the United States and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and

experience are included in the NDA or the BLA to the FDA
for the required approval. The development of certain other products is also subject to government
regulations covering safety and efficacy in the United States and many foreign countries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Company&#146;s scientists discover a new compound that they believe has promise to treat a
medical condition, the Company commences preclinical testing with that compound. Preclinical
testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry,
pharmacology and toxicology. Pending acceptable preclinical data, the Company will initiate
clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements. The clinical testing
begins with Phase I studies, which are designed to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable, additional,
larger Phase II studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected
population, define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects
that could limit the compound&#146;s usefulness. If the results from the Phase II trials are
satisfactory, the Company commences large-scale Phase III trials to confirm the compound&#146;s efficacy
and safety. Upon completion of those trials, if satisfactory, the Company submits regulatory
filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate
approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any
particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the FDA approval process begins once a complete NDA is submitted and
received by the FDA. Pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA review period targets
for NDAs or supplemental NDAs is either six months, for priority review, or ten months, for a
standard review. Within 60&nbsp;days after receipt of an NDA, the FDA determines if the application is
sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether
the application will be granted a priority review or standard review. Once the review timelines
are defined, the FDA will act upon the application within those timelines, unless a major amendment
has been submitted (either at the Company&#146;s own initiative or the FDA&#146;s request) to the pending
application. If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of the new
information, but by no more than 180&nbsp;days. Extensions to the review period are communicated to the
Company. Based on FDA statistics, drug development time from initiation of preclinical testing to
NDA approval can range from 5 to 20&nbsp;years with an average of 8.5&nbsp;years.

June&nbsp;2005, the FDA accepted for standard review the BLA for <I>Zostavax, </I>Merck&#146;s investigational vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster, commonly known
as &#147;shingles&#148; in adults 60&nbsp;years of age or older. Sanofi Pasteur MSD has submitted an application
for licensure of <I>Zostavax </I>in the
EU, and Merck has also submitted applications for licensure of <I>Zostavax </I>in Australia, Canada and in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Employees</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of 2005, the Company had approximately 61,500 employees worldwide, with
approximately 31,900 employed in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Approximately 20% of
worldwide employees of the Company are represented by various collective bargaining groups.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of a cost-reduction initiative announced in October&nbsp;2003 and completed at the end of
2004, the Company had eliminated 5,100 positions. The Company completed a similar program in 2005
with 900 positions being eliminated through December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;28, 2005, the Company announced the first phase of a global restructuring program
designed to reduce the Company&#146;s cost structure, increase efficiency, and enhance competitiveness.
The initial steps will include the implementation of a new supply strategy by the Merck
Manufacturing Division, which is intended to create a leaner, more cost-effective and
customer-focused manufacturing model over the next three years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, Merck will incur certain costs associated with exit or disposal activities. As
part of the global restructuring program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 7,000
positions in manufacturing and other divisions worldwide, representing about 11% of its global work
force, by the end of 2008. About half of the position reductions are expected to occur in the
United States, with the remainder in other countries. Merck intends to sell or close five of its
31 manufacturing facilities worldwide and to reduce operations at a number of other sites. The
Company also expects to close one basic research site and two preclinical development sites. The
sites identified for closure are expected to be closed by the end of 2008, subject to compliance
with legal obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pretax costs of the restructuring were $401.2&nbsp;million in 2005 and are expected to be $800
million to $1&nbsp;billion in 2006. Through the end of 2008, when the initial phase of the
restructuring program is substantially complete, the cumulative pretax costs of the restructuring
activities announced on November&nbsp;28, 2005 are expected to range from $1.8&nbsp;billion to $2.2&nbsp;billion.
Approximately 70% of the cumulative pretax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to accelerated
depreciation for those facilities scheduled for closure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Environmental Matters</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. In 2005, the Company incurred capital expenditures of
approximately $35.5&nbsp;million for environmental protection facilities. The Company is also
remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its
sites. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $31.3&nbsp;million in 2005, and
are estimated at $53.5&nbsp;million for the years 2006 through 2010. These amounts do not consider
potential recoveries from insurers or other parties. The Company has taken an active role in
identifying and providing for these costs, and in management&#146;s opinion, the liabilities for all
environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued. Although it
is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these environmental matters, or the
ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible
expenditures that may be incurred in excess of those provided should result in a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Geographic Area and Segment Information</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operations are principally managed on a products basis with one reportable
segment: The Merck Pharmaceutical segment which includes products marketed either directly or
through joint ventures. Merck Pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive
agents, sold by prescription, for the treatment and prevention of human disorders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operations outside the United States are conducted primarily through
subsidiaries. Sales worldwide by subsidiaries outside the United States were 42% of sales in 2005,
41% of sales in 2004 and 41% of sales in 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s worldwide business is subject to risks of currency fluctuations, governmental
actions and other governmental proceedings abroad. The Company does not regard these risks as a
deterrent to further expansion of its operations abroad. However, the Company closely reviews its
methods of operations and adopts strategies responsive to changing economic and political
conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Company has been expanding its operations in countries located in Latin
America, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific where changes in government
policies and economic conditions are making it possible for the Company to earn fair returns.
Business in these developing areas, while sometimes less stable, offers important opportunities for

 the Company voluntarily withdrew <I>Vioxx</I>, its arthritis and acute pain

approximately 9,650 product
liability lawsuits, involving approximately 19,100 plaintiff groups, alleging personal injuries resulting
from the use of <I>Vioxx, </I>have been filed against the Company in state and federal courts in the
United States. The Company is also a defendant in purported class actions related to the use of
<I>Vioxx.</I> (All
of these suits are referred to as the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Product

<I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits, a number of purported class actions have been brought against the
Company and several current and former officers and directors of the Company alleging that the
Company made false and misleading statements regarding <I>Vioxx </I>in violation of the federal securities

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SEC is conducting a formal investigation of the
Company concerning <I>Vioxx</I>. The U.S. Department of Justice has issued a subpoena requesting
information relating to the Company&#146;s research, marketing and selling activities with respect to
<I>Vioxx </I>in a federal health care investigation under criminal statutes. There are also ongoing
investigations by certain Congressional committees and local authorities in Europe. A group of
Attorneys General from thirty-one states and the District of Columbia are conducting an
investigation of the Company&#146;s sales and marketing of <I>Vioxx</I>. The Company is cooperating with
authorities in all of these investigations. (All of these investigations are referred to as the
&#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Investigations&#148;). The Company can not predict the outcome of any of these investigations;
however, they could result in potential civil and/or criminal liability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three <I>Vioxx </I>Product
 Liability Lawsuits in the U.S. have gone to trial and resulted in
jury verdicts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;19, 2005, in a trial in state court in Texas, the jury in Ernst vs. Merck reached a
verdict in favor of the plaintiff and purported to award her a total of $253&nbsp;million in
compensatory and punitive damages. Under Texas law, the maximum amount that could be awarded to
the plaintiff is capped at approximately $26&nbsp;million. The Company intends to appeal this verdict
after the completion of post-trial proceedings in the trial court and believes that it has strong
points to raise on appeal. Since the Company believes that the potential for an unfavorable
outcome is not probable, the Company has not established a reserve with respect to the verdict.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;3, 2005, in the second <I>Vioxx </I>personal injury case to go to trial, Frederick and
Mary Jackson Humeston vs. Merck &#038; Co., Inc., in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division,
Atlantic County, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company on all counts. The jury found,
by an 8 to 1 vote, that the Company did not fail to provide an adequate warning to prescribing
physicians of an association between <I>Vioxx </I>and an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events
prior to Mr.&nbsp;Humeston&#146;s heart attack. The jury also unanimously found that the Company did not
violate the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act in marketing the drug to prescribing physicians.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;17, 2006, in a re-trial of a case in federal court in New Orleans brought by
Evelyn Irvin Plunkett, on behalf of her late husband, Richard Irvin, Jr., who died from an apparent
heart attack, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Merck on all counts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
outcomes of these first
 three <I>Vioxx </I>product liability trials should not be interpreted to indicate any trend
or what outcome may be likely in future <I>Vioxx </I>trials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently anticipates that a number of <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits will be
tried in 2006. The Company cannot predict the timing of any trials with respect to the <I>Vioxx</I>
Shareholder Lawsuits. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the <I>Vioxx </I>Product
Liability Lawsuits, <I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder Lawsuits and <I>Vioxx </I>Foreign Lawsuits (collectively, the &#147;<I>Vioxx</I>
Lawsuits&#148;) and will vigorously defend against them. The Company believes that its insurance
coverage with respect to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits will not be adequate to cover its defensive costs and
any losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, the Company spent $285&nbsp;million in the aggregate in legal defense costs worldwide
related to (i)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits,
(ii)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx</I> Shareholder Lawsuits, (iii)&nbsp;the

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $295&nbsp;million to increase the
reserve solely for its future legal defense costs related to the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation from $675&nbsp;million
at December&nbsp;31, 2004 to $685&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005. This reserve is based on certain

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is not currently able to estimate any amount of damages that it may be required to
pay in connection with the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits or <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations. These proceedings, which are
expected to continue for years, are currently at a very early stage and the Company has very little
information as to the course they will take. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the
outcome of litigation, particularly where there are many claimants and the claimants seek
indeterminate damages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, and at this
time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to the <I>Vioxx</I>
Lawsuits. The Company has not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to the
<I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits or the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of unfavorable outcomes in the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits or the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations, resulting
in the payment of substantial damages or fines or resulting in criminal penalties, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial
position and prospects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Certain of the Company&#146;s major products are going to lose patent protection in the near future
and, when that occurs, the Company expects a significant decline in sales of those products.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for its
products for some period of time. As product patents for several of the Company&#146;s products have
recently expired, or are about to expire, in the United States and in other countries, the Company
faces strong competition from lower price generic drugs. Loss of patent protection for one of the
Company&#146;s products typically leads to a rapid loss of sales for that product, as lower priced
generic versions of that drug become available. In the case of products that contribute
significantly to the Company&#146;s sales, the loss of patent protection can have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, <I>Zocor, </I>the Company&#146;s statin for modifying cholesterol and currently its largest
revenue-producing product, lost its basic patent protection in Canada and certain countries in
Europe, including the United Kingdom and Germany, and the Company experienced a decline in <I>Zocor</I>
sales in those countries as the result of the availability of a generic version. Worldwide sales
of <I>Zocor </I>were $4.4&nbsp;billion in 2005, compared to $5.2&nbsp;billion in 2004. In June&nbsp;2006, <I>Zocor </I>will
lose its market exclusivity in the United States, and the Company expects a significant decline in
<I>Zocor </I>sales after that time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2004, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office rendered a decision to
revoke the Company&#146;s patent in Europe that covers the weekly administration of alendronate. That
decision has been appealed and a hearing is scheduled for March&nbsp;14 and 15. Decisions in such
proceedings are typically rendered at the end of the hearing. If the decision is upheld, the
Company will not be entitled to market exclusivity for <I>Fosamax </I>in most major European markets after
2007. Moreover, Merck&#146;s basic patent covering the use of alendronate has been challenged in
several European countries and if the Company is unsuccessful in those countries the Company could
lose exclusivity rights to Fosamax before 2007 in such countries. The Company would expect a
significant decline in European sales of <I>Fosamax </I>after loss of exclusivity. Sales of <I>Fosamax</I>
outside the United States in 2005 have already been adversely affected by the availability of
generic products in some markets, including the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. Nonetheless,
global sales of <I>Fosamax </I>grew 1% in 2005 to $3.2&nbsp;billion, as a result of strong sales in the United
States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;28, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C.
found the Company&#146;s patent claims for once-weekly administration of <I>Fosamax </I>to be invalid. The
Company exhausted all options to appeal this decision in 2005. Based on the Court of Appeals
decision, <I>Fosamax </I>will lose its market exclusivity in the United States in February&nbsp;2008, and the
Company expects a significant decline in <I>Fosamax </I>sales after that time.

successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in
other ways; in consequence, the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other major pharmaceutical companies, in order to remain competitive, the Company must
continue to launch new products each year. Declines in sales of products such as <I>Zocor </I>and <I>Fosamax</I>
mean that the Company&#146;s future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new
products which it develops through joint ventures and products which it is able to obtain through
license or acquisition. To accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds and
other resources to research and development, both through its own dedicated resources, and through
various collaborations with third parties. To support its research and development efforts the
Company must make ongoing, substantial expenditures, without any assurance that the efforts it is
funding will result in a commercially successful product. The Company must also commit substantial
efforts, funds and other resources to recruiting and retaining high quality scientists and other
personnel with pharmaceutical research and development expertise.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on FDA statistics, drug development time from initiation of preclinical testing to NDA
approval can range from 5 to 20&nbsp;years with an average of 8.5&nbsp;years. For a description of the
research and development process, see &#147;Research and Development&#148;. Each phase of testing is highly
regulated, and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter
serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals, and accordingly the Company may abandon a product
in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and money. Some of the risks encountered in
the research and development process include the following: pre-clinical testing of a new compound
may yield disappointing results; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug
may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the FDA
for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; or sales of a new
product may be disappointing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under
development will be launched; whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire
compounds, product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be
commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products
and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover
its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable
products, such as <I>Zocor </I>and <I>Fosamax</I>, lose patent protection or are displaced by competing products
or therapies. Failure to do so in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect
on the Company&#146;s business, results of operations, cash flow, financial position and prospects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Company&#146;s products, including products in development, can not be marketed unless the
Company obtains and maintains regulatory approval.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s activities, including research, preclinical testing, clinical trials and
manufacturing and marketing its products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal,
state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign
regulatory authorities, including the European Commission. In the United States, the FDA is of
particular importance to the Company, as it administers requirements covering the testing,
approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription
pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and money
necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. Regulation
outside the United States also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many
cases, cost reduction. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion to
require additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to mandate
product withdrawals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Company is successful in developing new products, it will not be able to market
any of those products unless and until it has obtained all required regulatory approvals in each
jurisdiction where it proposes to market the new products. Once obtained, the Company must
maintain approval as long as it plans to market its new products in each jurisdiction where
approval is required. The Company&#146;s failure to obtain approval, significant

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">delays in the approval
process, or its failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction will prevent it from selling the
new products in that jurisdiction until approval is obtained, if ever. The Company would not be
able to realize revenues for those new products in any jurisdiction where it does not have
approval.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are invalidated or
circumvented, its business would be adversely affected.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance in the
Company&#146;s marketing of human health products in the United States and in most major foreign
markets. Patents covering products that it has introduced normally provide market exclusivity,
which is important for the successful marketing and sale of its products. The Company seeks
patents covering each of its products in each of the markets where it intends to sell the products
and where meaningful patent protection is available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties may
challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent its patents and patent applications. It is important
for the Company&#146;s business to defend successfully the patent rights that provide market exclusivity
for its products. The Company is often involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its
patents or infringement and similar claims against the Company. The Company aggressively defends
its important patents both within and outside the United States, including by filing claims of
infringement against other parties. See &#147;Legal Proceedings &#150; Patent Litigation&#148;. In particular,
manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file Abbreviated New Drug
Applications (&#147;ANDA&#148;) with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of the Company&#146;s products prior to the
expiration of relevant patents owned by the Company. The Company normally responds by vigorously
defending its patent, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Patent litigation
and other challenges to the Company&#146;s patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the
Company of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third party patents may
prevent the Company from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one or more important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those
products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products
becoming available. The Company&#146;s results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost
sales unless and until the Company has successfully launched commercially successful replacement
products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Company faces intense competition from lower-cost generic products.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the Company faces increasing competition from lower-cost generic products. The
patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths and durations. In addition, in
some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the
United States or the EU. In the United States, political pressures to reduce spending on
prescription drugs has led to legislation which encourages the use of generic products.
Although it is the Company&#146;s policy to actively protect its patent rights, generic challenges to
the Company&#146;s products can arise at any time, and it may not be able to prevent the emergence of
generic competition for its products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes,
reducing the Company&#146;s sales of that product. Availability of generic substitutes for the
Company&#146;s drugs may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow. In addition,
proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to
further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposal that is enacted
into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the Company&#146;s sales and, potentially, its
results of operations and cash flow.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s products face intense competition from competitors&#146; products. This competition

to its business, including product liability, intellectual property, and commercial litigation, as

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>Product Liability Lawsuits</I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, federal and state product liability lawsuits involving individual
claims, as well as putative class actions, have been filed against the Company with respect to
<I>Vioxx</I>. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company has been served or is aware that it has been named
as a defendant in approximately 9,650 lawsuits, which include approximately 19,100 plaintiff
groups, alleging personal injuries resulting from the use of <I>Vioxx</I>. Of these lawsuits,
approximately 4,350 lawsuits representing approximately 12,075 plaintiff groups are or are slated
to be in the federal MDL (discussed below) and approximately 4,200 lawsuits representing
approximately 4,200 plaintiff groups are included in a coordinated proceeding in New Jersey
Superior Court before Judge Carol E. Higbee. Certain of these lawsuits include allegations
regarding gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events, thrombotic events or kidney damage.
The Company has also been named as a defendant in approximately 190 putative class actions
alleging personal injuries or seeking (i)&nbsp;medical monitoring as a result of the putative class
members&#146; use of <I>Vioxx</I>, (ii)&nbsp;disgorgement of certain profits under common law unjust enrichment
theories, and/or (iii)&nbsp;various remedies under state consumer fraud and fair business practice
statutes, including recovering the cost of <I>Vioxx </I>purchased by individuals and third-party payors
such as union health plans (all of the actions discussed in this paragraph are collectively
referred to as the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits&#148;). The actions filed in the state courts of
California, Texas, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, respectively, have been
transferred to a single judge in each state for coordinated proceedings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;16, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the &#147;JPML&#148;)
transferred all <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one
Multidistrict Litigation (&#147;MDL&#148;) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. The MDL has been
transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana before
District Judge Eldon E. Fallon.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Fallon has indicated that he intends to try a series of cases during the period
November&nbsp;2005 through 2006, in the following categories: (i)&nbsp;heart attack with short term use;
(ii)&nbsp;heart attack with long term use; (iii)&nbsp;stroke; and (iv)&nbsp;cardiovascular injury involving a
prescription written after April&nbsp;2002 when the labeling for <I>Vioxx </I>was revised to include the
results of the VIGOR trial. In November and December&nbsp;2005, the case brought by Evelyn Irvin
Plunkett, on behalf of her late husband Richard Irvin, Jr., who died from an apparent heart
attack, was tried in Houston, Texas. Plaintiff alleged that Mr.&nbsp;Irvin took <I>Vioxx </I>for
approximately one month and, thus, the action fell within the category of heart attack with short
term use. After deliberating for two and one-half days, the court found that the jury was
deadlocked and declared a mistrial. Federal court rules require a unanimous verdict. The
retrial of the case commenced on February&nbsp;6, 2006 in New Orleans, Louisiana. On February&nbsp;17, the
jury returned a verdict in favor of Merck on all counts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next scheduled MDL trial is Diaz v. Merck, a case in which plaintiffs claim a heart
attack with long term use, which is scheduled for June (it was previously scheduled for May). In
addition to the Diaz case and the Garza case discussed below, other <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability
Lawsuits are currently scheduled for trial in 2006. The Company intends to provide a list of
such trials at its website at <U>www.Merck.com</U> which it will periodically update as appropriate.
The Company has included its website address only as an inactive textual reference and does not
intend it to be an active link to its website nor does it incorporate by reference the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merck has entered into a tolling agreement (the &#147;Tolling Agreement&#148;) with the MDL
Plaintiffs&#146; Steering Committee that establishes a procedure to halt the running of the statute of
limitations (tolling)&nbsp;as to certain categories of claims allegedly arising from the use of <I>Vioxx</I>
by non-New Jersey citizens. The Tolling Agreement applies to individuals who have not filed
lawsuits and may or may not eventually file lawsuits and only to those claimants who seek to toll
claims alleging injuries resulting from a thrombotic cardiovascular event that results in a
myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. The Tolling Agreement provides counsel additional time
to evaluate potential claims. The Tolling Agreement requires any tolled claims to be filed in
federal court. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, approximately 3,800 claimants had entered into Tolling
Agreements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, on August&nbsp;19, 2005, in a trial in state court in Texas, the jury in
Ernst vs. Merck reached a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and purported to award her a total of
$253&nbsp;million in compensatory and punitive damages. Under Texas law, the maximum amount that
could be awarded to the plaintiff is capped at approximately $26&nbsp;million. The Company intends to
appeal this verdict after the completion of post-trial proceedings in the trial court. The
Company believes that it has strong points to raise on appeal and is hopeful that the appeals
process will correct the verdict. Since the Company believes that the potential for an
unfavorable outcome is not probable, it has not established a reserve with respect to the
verdict.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
November&nbsp;3, 2005, in the case of Frederick and Mary Jackson Humeston vs. Merck, Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, a jury returned a verdict in
favor of Merck on all counts. The case was the second <I>Vioxx </I>personal injury case to go to trial.
Mr.&nbsp;Humeston, a 60-year old United States Postal employee from Idaho, alleged that he suffered a
heart attack in September&nbsp;2001 as a result of taking <I>Vioxx</I>. He sought compensatory and punitive
damages. The jury found, by an 8 to 1 vote, that Merck did not fail to provide an adequate
warning to prescribing physicians of an association between <I>Vioxx </I>and an increased risk of
serious cardiovascular events prior to Mr.&nbsp;Humeston&#146;s heart attack. The jury also unanimously
found that Merck did not violate the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act in marketing the drug to
prescribing physicians.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial of Garza v. Heart Clinic, Evans, Posada and Merck, began on January
24, 2006, in the 229<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> Judicial District Court of Starr County, Texas. The Company
believes the evidence in this case will show that <I>Vioxx </I>did not cause the heart attack of Leonel
Garza, Sr. Mr.&nbsp;Garza, 71, died of a heart attack on April&nbsp;21, 2001, following 23&nbsp;years of
cardiovascular disease and a prior heart attack. Approximately one month before his death, the
Company maintains that Mr.&nbsp;Garza was given a one-week supply of <I>Vioxx </I>25 mg samples for pain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, trial proceedings in the consolidated trial of Cona v. Merck and McDarby v.
Merck began on February&nbsp;27, 2006 in the New Jersey Superior
Court, Law Division, Atlantic County
before Judge Higbee. The Company believes the evidence will show that <I>Vioxx </I>did not cause either
Mr.&nbsp;McDarby, 77, or Mr.&nbsp;Cona, 59, to have a heart attack.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, on July&nbsp;29, 2005, a New Jersey state trial court certified a
nationwide class of third-party payors (such as unions and health insurance plans) that paid in
whole or in part for the <I>Vioxx </I>used by their plan members or insureds. The named plaintiff in
that case seeks recovery of certain <I>Vioxx </I>purchase costs (plus penalties) based on allegations
that the purported class members paid more for <I>Vioxx </I>than they would have had they known of the
product&#146;s alleged risks. Merck believes that the class was improperly certified. The trial
court&#146;s ruling is procedural only; it does not address the merits of plaintiffs&#146; allegations,
which the Company intends to defend vigorously. The New Jersey state Superior Court, Appellate
Division, has accepted Merck&#146;s appeal of the class certification order on an expedited basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously reported, the Company has also been named as a defendant in separate lawsuits
brought by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The Attorney General of
Alaska has also recently filed a lawsuit. These actions allege that the Company misrepresented
the safety of <I>Vioxx </I>and seek (i)&nbsp;recovery of the cost of <I>Vioxx </I>purchased or reimbursed by the
state and its agencies; (ii)&nbsp;reimbursement of all sums paid by the state and its agencies for

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in addition to the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits, the Company,
along with various current and former officers and directors of the Company, are defendants in a
number of putative class actions and individual lawsuits filed in (or removed to) federal court
by shareholders under the federal securities laws (the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits&#148;), all of which
have been transferred by the JPML, along with related lawsuits discussed below, to the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey before District Judge Stanley R. Chesler for
inclusion in a nationwide MDL for coordinated pretrial proceedings (the &#147;Shareholder MDL&#148;).
Judge Chesler has consolidated the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits for all purposes. On June&nbsp;9, 2005,
plaintiffs in the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits filed a Fourth Consolidated and Amended Class&nbsp;Action
Complaint superseding prior complaints in the various cases (the &#147;Complaint&#148;). Plaintiffs
request certification of a class of purchasers of Company stock between May&nbsp;21, 1999 and October
29, 2004. The Complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading statements
regarding <I>Vioxx </I>in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and the costs of suit, including attorneys&#146; fees. The
Complaint also asserts a claim under Section&nbsp;20A of the Securities and Exchange Act against
certain defendants relating to their sales of Merck stock. In addition, the Complaint includes
allegations under Sections&nbsp;11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 that certain defendants
made incomplete and misleading statements in a registration statement and certain prospectuses
filed in connection with the Merck Stock Investment Plan, a dividend reinvestment plan.
Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, which is pending.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, on August&nbsp;15, 2005, a complaint was filed in Oregon state court by
the State of Oregon through the Oregon state treasurer on behalf of the Oregon Public Employee
Retirement Fund against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors. The
complaint, which was brought under Oregon securities law, alleges that plaintiff has suffered
damages in connection with its purchases of Merck common stock at artificially inflated prices
due to the Company&#146;s alleged violations of law related to disclosures about <I>Vioxx</I>. The Company
removed this lawsuit to the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, however, plaintiff
moved to remand the case to state court, which motion was granted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, a number of shareholder derivative actions have been filed in
federal court and in New Jersey Superior Court naming the Company as a nominal defendant and
certain members of the Board (past and present), together with certain executive officers, as
defendants. The complaints arise out of substantially the same factual allegations that are made
in the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits. The derivative suits, which are purportedly brought to assert
rights of the Company, assert claims against the Board members and officers for breach of
fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, abuse of control and gross
mismanagement. All of the actions discussed in this paragraph are collectively referred to as
the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits&#148;. The JPML has transferred the <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits pending
in federal court to the Shareholder MDL. Judge Chesler has consolidated the <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative
Lawsuits for all purposes. On June&nbsp;20, 2005, the federal derivative plaintiffs filed a Verified
Consolidated Shareholders&#146; Derivative Complaint superseding prior complaints in the various
cases. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss this complaint, which is pending. In addition,
the <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits pending in New Jersey Superior Court were consolidated and
transferred to Judge Higbee in Atlantic County, and on April&nbsp;29, 2005, state plaintiffs filed a
superseding Verified Consolidated Amended Shareholder Derivative Complaint. On January&nbsp;19, 2006,
these two shareholder derivative cases were dismissed without prejudice. The cases were
dismissed when the Court granted defendants&#146; motion to stay the cases. The Court&#146;s order permits
plaintiffs to re-file their complaints once the consolidated federal shareholder derivative case
has been resolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, on October&nbsp;29, 2004, two individual shareholders made a demand on
the Board to take legal action against Mr.&nbsp;Raymond Gilmartin, former Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer and other individuals for allegedly causing damage to the Company with
respect to the allegedly improper marketing of <I>Vioxx</I>. In response to that demand letter, the
Board of Directors determined at its November&nbsp;23, 2004 meeting that the Board would take the
shareholders&#146; request under consideration and it remains under consideration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in addition to the lawsuits discussed above, the Company has been
named as a defendant in litigation relating to <I>Vioxx </I>in various countries (collectively, the
&#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Foreign Lawsuits&#148;) in Europe, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Turkey, and Israel.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on media reports and other sources, the Company anticipates that additional <I>Vioxx</I>
Product Liability Lawsuits, <I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder Lawsuits and <I>Vioxx </I>Foreign Lawsuits (collectively,
the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits&#148;) will be filed against it and/or certain of its current and former officers

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, the Company has product liability insurance for claims brought in
the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits with stated upper limits of approximately $630&nbsp;million after
deductibles and co-insurance. This insurance provides coverage for legal defense costs and
potential damage amounts that have been or will be incurred in connection with the <I>Vioxx </I>Product
Liability Lawsuits. The Company believes that this insurance coverage extends to additional
<I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits that may be filed in the future. The Company has Directors and
Officers insurance coverage applicable to the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits and <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative
Lawsuits with stated upper limits of approximately $190&nbsp;million. The Company has fiduciary and
other insurance for the <I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits with stated upper limits of approximately $275
million. Additional insurance coverage for these claims may also be available under upper-level
excess policies that provide coverage for a variety of risks. There are disputes with certain
insurers about the availability of some or all of this insurance coverage and there are likely to
be additional disputes. At this time, the Company believes that its insurance coverage with
respect to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits will not be adequate to cover its defense costs and any losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, the Company&#146;s upper level excess insurers (which provide excess
insurance potentially applicable to all of the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits) have commenced an arbitration
seeking, among other things, to cancel those policies, to void all of their obligations under
those policies and to raise other coverage issues with respect to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits. A second
arbitration against one of the Company&#146;s upper level excess insurers has also been commenced.
Merck intends to contest vigorously the insurers&#146; claims and will attempt to enforce its rights
under applicable insurance policies. The amounts actually recovered under the policies discussed
in this section may be less than the amounts specified in the preceding paragraph.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently anticipates that a number of <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits will be
tried in 2006. The Company cannot predict the timing of any trials with respect to the <I>Vioxx</I>
Shareholder Lawsuits. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the <I>Vioxx</I>
Lawsuits and will vigorously defend against them. In view of the inherent difficulty of
predicting the outcome of litigation, particularly where there are many claimants and the
claimants seek indeterminate damages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these
matters, and at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with
respect to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits. The Company has not established any reserves for any potential
liability relating to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits or the <I>Vioxx
</I>Investigations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are
accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had
established a reserve of $675&nbsp;million solely for its future legal defense costs related to the
<I>Vioxx </I>Litigation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, the Company spent $285&nbsp;million in the aggregate in legal defense costs
worldwide related to (i)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits, (ii)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder
Lawsuits, (iii)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Foreign Lawsuits, and (iv)&nbsp;the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations (collectively, the
&#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Litigation&#148;). In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a charge of $295&nbsp;million to
increase the reserve solely for its future legal defense costs related to the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation to
$685&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005. This reserve is based on certain assumptions and is the best
estimate of the amount that the Company believes, at this time, it can reasonably estimate will
be spent through 2007. Some of the significant factors considered in the establishment and
ongoing review of the reserve for the <I>Vioxx </I>legal defense costs were as follows: the actual
costs incurred by the Company up to that time; the development of the Company&#146;s legal defense
strategy and structure in light of the scope of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation; the number of cases being
brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the anticipated
timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the <I>Vioxx </I>Product
Liability Lawsuits. Events such as scheduled trials, that are expected to occur throughout 2006
and into 2007, and the inherent inability to predict the ultimate outcomes of such trials, limit
the Company&#146;s ability to reasonably estimate its legal costs beyond the end of 2007. The
Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the
associated reserves. Unfavorable outcomes in the <I>Vioxx L</I>itigation could have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

expanded the number of manufacturers to include some which, like the Company, had not been
defendants in any prior pending case. In May&nbsp;2003, the court granted the Company&#146;s motion to
dismiss the consolidated class action and dismissed the Company from the class action case.
Subsequent to the Company&#146;s dismissal, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action
complaint, which did not name the Company as a defendant. The Company and many other
pharmaceutical manufacturers are defendants in similar complaints pending in federal and state
court brought individually by a number of counties in the State of New York. The Company and the
other defendants are awaiting the final ruling on their motion to dismiss in the Suffolk County
case, which was the first of the New York county cases to be filed. In addition, as of December
31, 2005, the Company was a defendant in state cases brought by the Attorneys General of
Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama, Wisconsin, Mississippi, and Arizona, all of which are being

among different sets of pharmaceutical manufacturers to protect high prices in the United States
by impeding importation into the United States of lower-priced pharmaceuticals from Canada. The
court dismissed the federal claims in the Minnesota case with prejudice and the plaintiffs have
filed a Notice of Appeal. The state claims in that action were dismissed without prejudice.

case that was filed under seal in December&nbsp;1999 against the Company. The court issued an order
unsealing the complaint, which was filed by a physician in Louisiana, and ordered that the

certain Louisiana hospitals led to increases in costs to Medicaid, was dismissed. An amended

non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the patents. Generic manufacturers have
received FDA approval to market a generic form of <I>Prilosec</I>. The Company has filed patent
infringement suits in federal court against companies filing ANDA&#146;s for generic alendronate

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously announced by the Company, on July&nbsp;20, 2004, the Opposition Division (the
&#147;Opposition Division&#148;) of the European Patent Office (the &#147;EPO&#148;) rendered an oral decision to
revoke the Company&#146;s patent in Europe that covers the once-weekly administration of alendronate.
On August&nbsp;19, 2004, the written opinion was issued confirming the oral decision revoking the
Company&#146;s patent. On September&nbsp;16, 2004, the Company filed an appeal of this decision. The
hearing on the appeal is scheduled for March&nbsp;14 and 15, 2006. Decisions in such proceedings are
typically rendered at the end of the hearing. If the decision is upheld, the Company will not be entitled to market exclusivity for <I>Fosamax</I> in most major European markets after&nbsp;2007. In addition, Merck&#146;s basic patent covering the use of alendronate has been challenged in several European countries and if the Company is unsuccessful in those countries the Company could lose exclusivity rights to <I>Fosamax</I> before 2007 in such
countries. The Company is defending the alendronate weekly
product in other major European markets based on other patents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;5, 2004, in an action in Australia challenging the validity of the Company&#146;s
Australian patent for the once-weekly administration of alendronate, the patent was found to be
invalid. The Company has appealed the decision.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as previously disclosed, in Japan a proceeding has been filed challenging the
validity of the Company&#146;s Japanese patent for the once-weekly administration of alendronate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;18, 2006, the Company sued Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc.
(&#147;Hi-Tech&#148;) of Amityville, New York
for patent infringement in response to Hi-Tech&#146;s application to the FDA seeking approval of a
generic version of Merck&#146;s ophthalmic drugs <I>Trusopt </I>and <I>Cosopt</I>, which are used for treating
elevated intraocular pressure in people with ocular hypertension or glaucoma. In the lawsuit,
Merck sued to enforce a patent covering an active ingredient dorzolamide, which is present in
both <I>Trusopt </I>and <I>Cosopt</I>. Merck has elected not to enforce two U.S. patents listed with the FDA
which cover the combination of dorzolamide and timolol, the two active ingredients in <I>Cosopt</I>.
This lawsuit will automatically stay FDA approval of Hi-Tech&#146;s ANDA&#146;s for 30&nbsp;months or until an
adverse court decision, whichever may occur earlier. The patent covering dorzolamide provides
exclusivity for <I>Trusopt </I>and <I>Cosopt </I>until October&nbsp;2008 (including six months of pediatric
exclusivity). After such time, the Company expects sales of these products to decline.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of omeprazole, the trial court in the United States rendered an opinion in
October&nbsp;2002 upholding the validity of the Company&#146;s and AstraZeneca&#146;s patents covering the
stabilized formulation of omeprazole and ruling that one defendant&#146;s omeprazole product did not
infringe those patents. The other three defendants&#146; products were found to infringe the
formulation patents. In December&nbsp;2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
affirmed the decision of the trial court. With respect to the Company&#146;s patent infringement
claims against certain other generic manufacturers&#146; omeprazole products, trial is scheduled for
March&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and AstraZeneca received notice in October&nbsp;2005 that Ranbaxy Laboratories
Limited (&#147;Ranbaxy&#148;) has filed an ANDA for esomeprazole magnesium. The ANDA contains Paragraph&nbsp;IV
challenges to patents on <I>Nexium</I>. On November&nbsp;21, 2005, the Company and AstraZeneca sued Ranbaxy
in the United States District Court in New Jersey. Accordingly, FDA approval of Ranbaxy&#146;s ANDA
is stayed for 30&nbsp;months until April&nbsp;2008 or until an adverse court decision, if any, whichever
may occur earlier.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of finasteride, an ANDA has been filed seeking approval of a generic version of
<I>Propecia </I>and alleging invalidity of the Company&#146;s patents. The Company filed a patent
infringement lawsuit in the District Court of Delaware in September&nbsp;2004. A trial is scheduled
for June&nbsp;2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe, the Company is aware of various companies seeking registration for generic
losartan (the active ingredient for <I>Cozaar</I>). The Company has patent rights to losartan via
license from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (&#147;du Pont&#148;). The Company and du Pont have filed
patent infringement proceedings against various companies in Portugal.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Other Litigation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;27, 2005, Merck was served with a further shareholder derivative suit filed in the
New Jersey Superior Court for Hunterdon County against the Company and certain current and former
officers and directors. This lawsuit seeks to recover or cancel compensation awarded to the
Company&#146;s executive officers in 2004, and asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and
unjust enrichment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, an individual shareholder delivered a letter to the Board alleging that
the Company had sustained damages through the Company&#146;s adoption of its Change in Control
Separation Benefits Plan (the &#147;CIC Plan&#148;) in November&nbsp;2004. The shareholder made a demand on the
Board to take legal action against the Board&#146;s current or former members for allegedly causing
damage to the Company with respect to the adoption of the CIC Plan. In response to that demand
letter, the independent members of the Board determined at the November&nbsp;22, 2005 Board meeting
that the Board would take the shareholder&#146;s request under consideration and it remains under
consideration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, on July&nbsp;6, 2004, the United States District Court for the District
of New Jersey granted a motion by the Company, Medco Health Solutions, Inc. (&#147;Medco Health&#148;) and
certain officers and directors to dismiss a purported class action complaint involving claims
related to the Company&#146;s revenue recognition practice for retail co-payments paid by individuals
to whom Medco Health provides pharmaceutical benefits as well as other allegations. The
complaint was dismissed with prejudice. On August&nbsp;20, 2004, the same court granted the Company&#146;s
motion to dismiss with prejudice a related shareholder derivative action. Plaintiffs in both
actions appealed the decisions. On December&nbsp;15, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit upheld the District Court&#146;s decision dismissing the class action complaint. In a
separate decision issued the same day, the Court of Appeals upheld most of the District Court&#146;s
decision dismissing the shareholder derivative suit, and sent the issue of whether the Company&#146;s
Board of Directors properly refused the shareholder demand relating to the Company&#146;s treatment of
retail co-payments back to the District Court for reconsideration under a different legal
standard.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, prior to the spin-off of Medco Health, the Company and Medco Health
agreed to settle, on a class action basis, a series of lawsuits asserting violations of ERISA
(the &#147;Gruer Cases&#148;). The Company, Medco Health and certain plaintiffs&#146; counsel filed the
settlement agreement with the federal district court in New York, where cases commenced by a
number of plaintiffs, including participants in a number of pharmaceutical benefit plans for
which Medco Health is the pharmacy benefit manager, as well as trustees of such plans, have been
consolidated. Medco Health and the Company agreed to the proposed settlement in order to avoid
the significant cost and distraction of prolonged litigation. The proposed class settlement has
been agreed to by plaintiffs in five of the cases filed against Medco Health and the Company.
Under the proposed settlement, the Company and Medco Health have agreed to pay a total of $42.5
million, and Medco Health has agreed to modify certain business practices or to continue certain
specified business practices for a period of five years. The financial compensation is intended
to benefit members of the settlement class, which includes ERISA plans for which Medco Health
administered a pharmacy benefit at any time since December&nbsp;17, 1994. The district court held
hearings to hear objections to the fairness of the proposed settlement and approved the
settlement in 2004, but has not yet determined the number of class member plans that have
properly elected not to participate in the settlement. The settlement becomes final only if and
when all appeals have been resolved. Certain class member plans have indicated that they will
not participate in the settlement. Cases initiated by three such plans and two individuals
remain pending in the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs in these cases have asserted
claims based on ERISA as well as other federal and state laws that are the same as or similar to
the claims that had been asserted by settling class members in the Gruer Cases. The Company and
Medco Health are named as defendants in these cases.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three notices of appeal were filed and the appellate court heard oral argument in May&nbsp;2005.
On December&nbsp;8, 2005, the appellate court issued a decision vacating the district court&#146;s judgment
and remanding the cases to the district court to allow the district court to resolve certain
jurisdictional issues. A hearing was held to address such issues on February&nbsp;24, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spin-off of Medco Health, Medco Health assumed substantially all of the liability
exposure for the matters discussed in the foregoing two paragraphs. These cases are being
defended by Medco Health.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various other legal proceedings, principally product liability and intellectual
property suits involving the Company, which are pending. While it is not feasible to predict the
outcome of such proceedings or the proceedings discussed in this Note, in the opinion of the
Company, all such proceedings are either adequately covered by insurance or, if not so covered,
should not ultimately result in any liability that would have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company, other than proceedings for
which a separate assessment is provided in this Note.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Environmental
Matters</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly
known as Superfund, and other
federal and state equivalents. These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous
waste disposal facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste
disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs.
The Company has been made a party to these proceedings as an alleged generator of waste disposed
of at the sites. In each case, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and
severally liable for the cleanup costs. Although joint and several liability is alleged, these
proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties
more nearly reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site situation. The
Company&#146;s potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites the potential
liability is <I>de minimis </I>and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. While
it is not feasible to predict the outcome of many of these proceedings brought by federal or
state agencies or private litigants, in the opinion of the Company, such proceedings should not
ultimately result in any liability which would have a material adverse effect on the financial
position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources of the Company. The Company has
taken an active role in identifying and providing for these costs and such amounts do not include
any reduction for anticipated recoveries of cleanup costs from insurers, former site owners or
operators or other recalcitrant potentially responsible parties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in December&nbsp;2003, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality
(&#147;VADEQ&#148;) issued a Notice of Violation of the Company&#146;s Elkton, Virginia facility for air permit
limit exceedances reported by the facility as a result of performance testing of a process train.
In 2005, the Company settled this matter with VADEQ by agreeing (i)&nbsp;to make $3.1&nbsp;million in
capital improvements at the site, (ii)&nbsp;to pay VADEQ a $200,000 fine, and (iii)&nbsp;to perform a
Supplemental Environmental Project for $300,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2005, the Company settled claims brought by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection for alleged damages to natural resources at four New Jersey Merck
remediation sites. In the settlement, the Company agreed to pay $2.38&nbsp;million, donate 10
acres of land adjacent to the Rahway River and fund a $30,000 restoration project in the Passaic
River watershed for groundwater contamination found at the Company&#146;s sites.
