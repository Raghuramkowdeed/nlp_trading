<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2004, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;)
granted a new indication for <I>Hyzaar </I>for initial use in appropriate patients with severe
hypertension.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2004, the indications for <I>Cancidas </I>were expanded with FDA approval for empirical
therapy for presumed fungal infections in febrile neutropenic patients.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Voluntary Withdrawal of Vioxx &#151; </I>On September&nbsp;30, 2004, Merck announced a voluntary worldwide
withdrawal of <I>Vioxx</I>, its arthritis and acute pain medication. The Company&#146;s decision, which was
effective immediately, was based on new three-year data from a prospective, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial, APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on <I>Vioxx</I>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial, which was stopped, was designed to evaluate the efficacy of <I>Vioxx </I>25 mg in
preventing the recurrence of colorectal polyps in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas
and to further assess the cardiovascular safety of <I>Vioxx</I>. In this study, there was an increased
relative risk for confirmed cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, beginning after
18&nbsp;months of treatment in the patients taking <I>Vioxx </I>compared to those taking placebo. The results
for the first 18&nbsp;months of the APPROVe study did not show any increased risk of confirmed
cardiovascular events on <I>Vioxx</I>, and in this respect, were similar to the results of two
placebo-controlled studies described in the most recent U.S. labeling for <I>Vioxx</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merck presented data from APPROVe at the American College of Rheumatology (&#147;ACR&#148;) Annual
Scientific Meeting in San Antonio on October&nbsp;18, 2004. The Company had requested the opportunity
to present the data at the ACR meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company estimates that there were 105&nbsp;million U.S. prescriptions written for <I>Vioxx </I>from
May&nbsp;1999 through August&nbsp;2004. Based on this estimate, the Company estimates that the number of
patients who have taken <I>Vioxx </I>in the United States since its 1999 launch is approximately 20
million. The number of patients outside the United States who have taken <I>Vioxx </I>is undetermined at
this time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2004, the Company received a letter from Senator Charles Grassley, Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Finance, requesting certain documents and information related to <I>Vioxx</I>. The
Company also received requests for information from other Congressional committees. The Company
intends to cooperate with these inquiries so that the Company can continue to describe the reasons
for the Company&#146;s voluntary withdrawal of <I>Vioxx </I>and to answer any questions related to the
Company&#146;s development and extensive testing of the medicine and its disclosures of the results of
its studies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in October&nbsp;2004, the Company received a letter from a group of five state Attorneys
General raising concerns that the Company&#146;s return and refund program for unused <I>Vioxx </I>will not
provide consumers with adequate notice and will be unduly burdensome. The Company is cooperating
with the Attorneys General to respond to their concerns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;16-18, 2005, the FDA held a joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and
the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. The committees discussed the overall
benefit to risk considerations (including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety concerns) for
COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and related agents. On February&nbsp;18, 2005, the
members of the committees were asked to vote on whether the overall risk versus benefit profile for
<I>Vioxx </I>supports marketing in the United States. The members of the committees voted 17 to 15 in
support of the marketing of <I>Vioxx </I>in the United States. The Company looks forward to discussions
with the FDA and other regulatory authorities about <I>Vioxx.</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously announced, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed a Special Committee
to review the Company&#146;s actions prior to its voluntary withdrawal of <I>Vioxx, </I>to act for the Board in
responding to shareholder litigation matters related to the withdrawal of <I>Vioxx </I>and to advise the
Board with respect to any action that should be taken as a result of the review.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Arcoxia </I>- <I>Arcoxia </I>has been launched in 51 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia. On
October&nbsp;29, 2004, the Company confirmed that it had received an &#147;approvable&#148; letter from the FDA
for the Company&#146;s New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;) for <I>Arcoxia</I>. The FDA informed Merck in the letter
that before approval of the NDA can be issued, additional safety and efficacy data for <I>Arcoxia </I>are
required. On October&nbsp;22, 2004, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (&#147;EMEA&#148;) announced that it
would conduct a review of all COX-2 inhibitors, including <I>Arcoxia</I>, in light of the worldwide
withdrawal of <I>Vioxx</I>. The EMEA said that it had been asked to conduct the review by the European
Commission as a &#147;precautionary measure&#148; and that it would look at all aspects of the cardiovascular
safety of COX-2 inhibitors, including thrombotic and cardio-renal events. On January&nbsp;18, 2005, the
EMEA&#146;s Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (&#147;CHMP&#148;) held hearings in connection with its
review. Additional meetings were held by the CHMP in mid-February to continue its review to
determine whether there is a need to make European Union (&#147;EU&#148;)-wide changes to the products&#146;
marketing authorizations, including labeling, and to determine whether additional studies are
needed. On February&nbsp;17, 2005, CHMP announced that it had concluded that the available data show an
increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events for COX-2 inhibitors as a class relative to placebo
and some NSAIDS. According to CHMP, the data also suggested an association between duration of use
and dose and the probability of suffering a cardiovascular event and therefore recommended use of
the lowest effective dose of COX-2 inhibitors for the shortest possible duration of treatment.
Further, CHMP introduced a contra-indication for all COX-2 inhibitors in patients with ischemic
heart disease or stroke, and expanded the contra-indication for certain patients having higher
classes of congestive heart failure. Specifically with respect to <I>Arcoxia, </I>CHMP also introduced a
contra-indication in patients with hypertension whose blood pressure is not under control, and
advised that <I>Arcoxia </I>may be associated with more frequent and severe effects on blood pressure,
particularly at higher doses, than some other COX-2 inhibitors, and recommended monitoring of blood
pressure for all patients taking <I>Arcoxia. </I>CHMP stated that these are interim measures pending the
finalization of the class review which is expected in April&nbsp;2005. Finally, CHMP concluded that
more research is needed in the field to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of COX-2 inhibitors, and
that ongoing cardiovascular trials should continue as planned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merck is working with other regulatory agencies in the countries where <I>Arcoxia </I>is approved to
assess whether changes to the prescribing information for the coxib class of drugs, including
<I>Arcoxia, </I>are warranted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acquisitions </I><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#190;</FONT> In March&nbsp;2004, the Company acquired Aton Pharma, Inc. (&#147;Aton&#148;), a
privately held biotechnology company focusing on the development of novel treatments for cancer and
other serious diseases. Aton&#146;s clinical pipeline of histone deacetylase inhibitors represents a
class of anti-tumor agents with potential for efficacy based on a novel mechanism of action. The
lead product candidate, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is currently in Phase II clinical
trials for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, MSD (Japan) Co., Ltd., completed
tender offers to acquire the remaining 49% of the common shares of Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
(&#147;Banyu&#148;) that it did not already own for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5
billion. On March&nbsp;30, 2004, Merck completed its acquisition of Banyu. Full ownership of Banyu
enhances Merck&#146;s position in Japan, the world&#146;s second-largest pharmaceutical market.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Joint Ventures </I><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#190;</FONT> In 2000, the Company and Schering-Plough Corporation
(&#147;Schering-Plough&#148;) entered into agreements to create separate equally-owned partnerships to
develop and market in the United States new prescription medicines in the cholesterol-management
and respiratory therapeutic areas. In December&nbsp;2001, the cholesterol-management partnership
agreements were expanded to include all the countries of the world, excluding Japan. In October
2002, <I>Zetia (</I>ezetimibe) (branded <I>Ezetrol </I>outside the United States), the first in a new class of
cholesterol-lowering agents, was launched in the United States. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, <I>Ezetrol</I>
has been launched in more than 50 countries outside the United States. In July&nbsp;2004, <I>Vytorin</I>
(ezetimibe/simvastatin) (marketed as <I>Inegy </I>in many countries outside the United States), a
combination product containing the active ingredients of both <I>Zetia </I>and <I>Zocor, </I>was approved in the
United States. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, in addition to the United States, <I>Vytorin </I>had been
approved in 15 countries.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2004, Merck and Schering-Plough announced a new clinical trial for <I>Vytorin,</I>
IMPROVE IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: <I>Vytorin </I>Efficacy International Trial). This trial
will evaluate <I>Vytorin </I>in reducing major cardiovascular events through intensive lipid lowering of
LDL cholesterol in 10,000 patients with acute coronary syndrome. IMPROVE IT is the fourth
large-scale outcomes trial being conducted on <I>Vytorin.</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, the Company entered into an agreement with Astra AB (&#147;Astra&#148;) to develop and market
Astra products in the United States. In 1994, the Company and Astra formed an equally owned joint
venture that developed and marketed most of Astra&#146;s new prescription medicines in the United States
including <I>Prilosec</I>, the first of a class of medications known as proton pump inhibitors, which
slows the production of acid from the cells of the stomach lining.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, the Company and Astra restructured the joint venture whereby the Company acquired
Astra&#146;s interest in the joint venture, renamed KBI Inc. (&#147;KBI&#148;), and contributed KBI&#146;s operating
assets to a new U.S. limited partnership named Astra Pharmaceuticals, L.P. (the &#147;Partnership&#148;), in
which the Company maintains a limited partner interest. The Partnership, renamed AstraZeneca LP,
became the exclusive distributor of the products for which KBI retained rights. The Company earns
certain Partnership returns as well as ongoing revenue based on sales of current and future KBI
products. The Partnership returns include a priority return provided for in the Partnership
Agreement, variable returns based, in part, upon sales of certain former Astra USA, Inc. products,
and a preferential return representing the Company&#146;s share of undistributed Partnership GAAP
earnings. In conjunction with the 1998 restructuring, for a payment of $443.0&nbsp;million, Astra
purchased an option to buy the Company&#146;s interest in the KBI products, excluding the Company&#146;s
interest in the gastrointestinal medicines <I>Nexium </I>and <I>Prilosec</I>. The Company also granted Astra an
option (the &#147;Shares Option&#148;) to buy the Company&#146;s common stock interest in KBI, at an exercise
price based on the net present value of estimated future net sales of <I>Nexium </I>and <I>Prilosec</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;1999, Astra merged with Zeneca Group Plc, forming AstraZeneca AB (&#147;AstraZeneca&#148;). As
a result of the merger, in exchange for the Company&#146;s relinquishment of rights to future Astra
products with no existing or pending U.S. patents at the time of the merger, Astra paid $967.4
million, which is subject to a true-up calculation in 2008 that may require repayment of all or a
portion of this amount. The merger also triggers a partial redemption of the Company&#146;s limited
partner interest in 2008. Furthermore, as a result of the merger, AstraZeneca&#146;s option to buy the
Company&#146;s interest in the KBI products is exercisable in 2010 and the Company has the right to
require AstraZeneca to purchase such interest in 2008. In addition, the Shares Option is
exercisable two years after Astra&#146;s purchase of the Company&#146;s interest in the KBI products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, the Company formed a joint venture with Johnson &#038; Johnson to develop, market and
manufacture consumer health care products in the United States. This 50% owned joint venture was
expanded into Europe in 1993, and into Canada in 1996. Significant joint venture products are
<I>Pepcid AC </I>(famotidine), an over-the-counter form of the Company&#146;s ulcer medication <I>Pepcid</I>
(famotidine), as well as <I>Pepcid Complete, </I>an over-the-counter product which combines the Company&#146;s
ulcer medication with antacids (calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide). In March&nbsp;2004, the
Company sold to Johnson &#038; Johnson its interest in the European joint venture which is discussed
further on page 9 under <I>Divestitures</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective April&nbsp;1992, the Company, through the Merck Vaccine Division, and Connaught
Laboratories, Inc. (now Sanofi Pasteur S.A.), agreed to collaborate on the development and
marketing of combination pediatric vaccines and to promote selected vaccines in the United States.
The research and marketing collaboration enables the companies to pool their resources to expedite
the development of vaccines combining several different antigens to protect children against a
variety of diseases, including <U>Haemophilus</U> <U>influenzae</U> type b, hepatitis B,
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis. While combination vaccine development efforts
continue under this agreement, no vaccines are currently being promoted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, the Company, through the Merck Vaccine Division, and Pasteur M&#233;rieux Connaught (now
Sanofi Pasteur S.A.) formed a joint venture to market human vaccines in Europe and to collaborate
in the development of combination vaccines for distribution in the then existing EU and the
European Free Trade Association. The

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Company and Sanofi Pasteur contributed, among other things, their European vaccine businesses for
equal shares in the joint venture, known as Pasteur M&#233;rieux MSD, S.N.C. (now Sanofi Pasteur MSD,
S.N.C.). The joint venture is subject to monitoring by the EU, to which the partners made certain
undertakings in return for an exemption from European Competition Law, effective until December
2006. The joint venture maintains a presence, directly or through affiliates or branches in
Belgium, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Austria, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and
through distributors in the rest of its territory.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the Company and Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc S.A. (now Sanofi-Aventis S.A.) combined their
respective animal health and poultry genetics businesses to form Merial Limited (&#147;Merial&#148;), a fully
integrated animal health company, which is a stand-alone joint venture, equally owned by each
party. Merial provides a comprehensive range of pharmaceuticals and vaccines to enhance the
health, well-being and performance of a wide range of animal species.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Competition </I><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#190;</FONT> The markets in which the Company&#146;s pharmaceutical business is conducted
are highly competitive and often highly regulated. Global efforts toward health care cost
containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and access.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such competition involves an intensive search for technological innovations and the ability to
market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development,
the Company is well prepared to compete in the search for technological innovations. Additional
resources to meet competition include quality control, flexibility to meet customer specifications,
an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. The Company is active
in acquiring and marketing products through joint ventures and licenses and has been refining its
sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions. To enhance its
product portfolio, the Company continues to pursue external alliances, from early-stage to
late-stage product opportunities, including joint ventures and targeted acquisitions. However, the
introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and
product replacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds
available to treat diseases typically increases over time and has resulted in slowing the growth in
sales of certain of the Company&#146;s products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation enacted in all states in the United States, particularly in the area of human
pharmaceutical products, allows, encourages or, in a few instances, in the absence of specific
instructions from the prescribing physician, mandates the use of &#147;generic&#148; products (those
containing the same active chemical as an innovator&#146;s product) rather than &#147;brand-name&#148; products.
Governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products have significantly
reduced the sales of certain of the Company&#146;s products no longer protected by patents, such as
<I>Vasotec </I>and <I>Vaseretic </I>(enalapril maleate in combination with hydrochlorothiazide)<I>, </I>the U.S. rights
to which have been sold. In addition, <I>Zocor </I>has lost patent protection in certain countries
outside the United States and the Company has experienced a decline in <I>Zocor </I>sales in those
countries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Distribution </I><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#190;</FONT> The Company sells its human health products primarily to drug wholesalers
and retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and managed health care providers such as
health maintenance organizations and other institutions. Vaccines are also sold directly to
physicians. The Company&#146;s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and
value of the Company&#146;s products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices
and managed care organizations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company implemented a new distribution program for U.S.
wholesalers to moderate the fluctuations in sales caused by wholesaler investment buying and
improve efficiencies in the distribution of Company pharmaceutical products. The new program
lowered previous limits on average monthly purchases of Company pharmaceutical products by U.S.
customers. Following the implementation of the program, fluctuations in 2004 sales caused by
wholesaler investment buying have significantly moderated.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Government Regulation and Investigation </I><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#190;</FONT> The pharmaceutical industry is subject to
global regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies. Of particular importance is the
FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety,
effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In many
cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new
products and bring them to market in the United States. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration
Modernization Act (the &#147;FDA Modernization Act&#148;) was passed and was the culmination of a
comprehensive legislative reform effort designed to streamline regulatory procedures within the FDA
and to improve the regulation of drugs, medical devices and food. The legislation was principally
designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and effective drugs and biologics by expediting
the premarket review process for new products. A key provision of the legislation is the
re-authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, which permits the continued
collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers to augment FDA resources earmarked for
the review of human drug applications. This helps provide the resources necessary to ensure the
prompt approval of safe and effective new drugs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the government made significant progress in expanding health care access
by enacting the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which was
signed into law in December&nbsp;2003. This statute added a voluntary drug discount card for Medicare
beneficiaries in June&nbsp;2004 and will add prescription drug coverage on January&nbsp;1, 2006.
Implementation of the new benefit will support the Company&#146;s goal of improving access to medicines
by expanding insurance coverage, while preserving market-based incentives for pharmaceutical
innovation. At the same time, the benefit is designed to assure that prescription drug costs will
be controlled by competitive pressures and by encouraging the appropriate use of medicines. The
Company has taken a leadership role in contributing to the success of the new Medicare-endorsed
discount cards by providing its medicines free for low-income Medicare beneficiaries who exhaust
their $600 transitional assistance allowance in Medicare-endorsed drug discount cards. This action
is consistent with the Company&#146;s long-standing Patient Assistance Program, which provides free
medicines to patients in the United States who lack drug coverage and cannot afford their
medicines. During 2005, the Company will be negotiating with prescription drug plans under the new
Medicare drug benefit to offer Merck products to Medicare beneficiaries beginning January&nbsp;1, 2006
under the terms of the new benefit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing cost containment outside of Medicare, the Company has made a continuing effort
to demonstrate that its medicines can help save costs in overall patient health care. In addition,
pricing flexibility across the Company&#146;s product portfolio has encouraged growing use of its
medicines and mitigated the effects of increasing cost pressures.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the pharmaceutical industry has been under federal and state oversight with
the approval process for new drugs, drug safety, advertising and promotion, drug purchasing and
reimbursement programs and formularies variously under review. The Company believes that it will
continue to be able to conduct its operations, including the introduction of new drugs to the
market, in this regulatory environment. One type of federal initiative to contain federal health
care spending is the prospective or &#147;capitated&#148; payment system, first implemented to reduce the
rate of growth in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. Such a system establishes in advance a flat
rate for reimbursement for health care for those patients for whom
the payor is fiscally
responsible. This type of payment system and other cost containment systems are now widely used by
public and private payors and have caused hospitals, health maintenance organizations and other
customers of the Company to be more cost-conscious in their treatment decisions, including
decisions regarding the medicines to be made available to their patients. The Company continues to
work with private and federal employers to slow increases in health care costs. Further, the
Company&#146;s efforts to demonstrate that its medicines can help save costs in other areas, and pricing
flexibility across its product portfolio, have encouraged the use of the Company&#146;s medicines and
have helped offset the effects of increasing cost pressures.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, federal and state governments have pursued methods to directly reduce the cost of drugs
and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal laws require the Company to pay specified
rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid, to provide discounts for outpatient medicines
purchased by certain Public Health Service entities and &#147;disproportionate share&#148; hospitals
(hospitals meeting certain criteria), and to provide minimum

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">discounts of 24% off of a defined &#147;non-federal average manufacturer price&#148; for purchases by certain
components of the federal government such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department
of Defense.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiatives in some states seek rebates beyond the minimum required by Medicaid legislation,
in some cases for patients beyond those who are eligible for Medicaid. Under the Federal Vaccines
for Children entitlement program, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#147;CDC&#148;) funds
and purchases recommended pediatric vaccines at a public sector price for the immunization of
Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, native American and certain underinsured children. The Company was
awarded a CDC contract in 2004 for the supply of $322&nbsp;million of pediatric vaccines for the
Vaccines for Children program. As of January&nbsp;1, 2006, patients previously eligible for Medicaid
who are also Medicare beneficiaries (65&nbsp;years and older or disabled) will leave the
state-administered Medicaid system to be covered by the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the United States, the Company encounters similar regulatory and legislative issues in
most of the countries where it does business. There, too, the primary thrust of governmental
inquiry and action is toward determining drug safety and effectiveness, often with mechanisms for
controlling the prices of prescription drugs and the profits of prescription drug companies. The
EU has adopted directives concerning the classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale
distribution and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use. The Company&#146;s
policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives;
consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company&#146;s business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies and is, therefore,
subject to potential administrative actions. Such actions may include seizures of products and
other civil and criminal sanctions. Under certain circumstances, the Company on its own may deem
it advisable to initiate product recalls. The Company believes that it should be able to compete
effectively within this environment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, certain countries within the EU, recognizing the economic importance of the
research-based pharmaceutical industry and the value of innovative medicines to society, are
working with industry representatives and the European Commission on proposals to complete the
&#147;Single Market&#148; in pharmaceuticals and improve the competitive climate through a variety of means
including market deregulation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy issues in countries around the world,
including the United States and the EU. In the United States and the EU, governments have pursued
legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding privacy, including federal privacy regulations and
recently enacted state privacy laws concerning health and other personal information, which have
affected the Company&#146;s operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Patents, Trademarks and Licenses </I><FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#190;</FONT> Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to
be of material importance in the Company&#146;s marketing of human health products in the United States
and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products <I>per se</I>, pharmaceutical formulations,
processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products or the uses of products.
Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the date of grant
and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also
vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally provide market
exclusivity. Basic patents are in effect for the following major products in the United States:
<I>Arcoxia, Cancidas, Comvax </I>(<U>Haemophilus</U> b conjugate and hepatitis B &#091;recombinant&#093; vaccine)<I>, Cosopt,
Cozaar, Crixivan</I>, <I>Emend </I>(aprepitant)<I>, Fosamax, Hyzaar</I>, <I>Invanz, Maxalt </I>(rizatriptan benzoate)<I>,

Vioxx and Zocor</I>. Basic patents are also in effect in the United States for <I>Zetia </I>and <I>Vytorin</I>,
which were developed by the Merck/Schering-Plough partnership. A basic patent is also in effect
for <I>Sustiva/Stocrin</I>. Bristol-Myers Squibb, under an exclusive license from the
Company, sells <I>Sustiva </I>in the United States, Canada and certain European countries. The Company
markets <I>Stocrin </I>in other countries throughout the world. The basic patent for <I>Aggrastat </I>(tirofiban

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, <I>Zocor </I>lost its basic patent protection in Canada and certain countries in Europe,
including the United Kingdom and Germany, and the Company experienced a decline in <I>Zocor </I>sales in
those countries. In June&nbsp;2006, <I>Zocor </I>will lose its market exclusivity in the United States and the
Company expects a decline in U.S. <I>Zocor </I>sales.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an
additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States for indications of new or
currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant.
These exclusivity provisions were re-authorized until October&nbsp;1, 2007 by the &#147;Best Pharmaceuticals
for Children Act&#148; passed in January&nbsp;2002. In 2004, the FDA granted an additional six months of
market exclusivity in the United States to <I>Trusopt </I>until October&nbsp;2008. In 2003, the FDA granted an
additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States to <I>Fosamax </I>until February&nbsp;2008,
and <I>Fosamax </I>Once Weekly until January&nbsp;2019. However, on January&nbsp;28, 2005, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. found the Company&#146;s patent claims for
once-weekly administration of <I>Fosamax </I>to be invalid. Based on the Court of Appeals&#146; decision,
<I>Fosamax </I>will lose its market exclusivity in the United States in February&nbsp;2008 and the Company
expects a decline in U.S. <I>Fosamax </I>sales at that time. Prior to the decision, Merck&#146;s patent for
once-weekly administration of <I>Fosamax </I>was set to expire in July&nbsp;2018. Merck disagrees with the
decision of the Court of Appeals and has requested reconsideration by the Court of Appeals. For
further information with respect to the Company&#146;s patents, see
&#147;Patent Litigation&#148; on page 22.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for
the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from: (i)
later-granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of
manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii)&nbsp;patents relating to the use of such
product; (iii)&nbsp;patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and (iv)&nbsp;in the United
States, market exclusivity that may be available under federal law. The effect of product patent
expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of
the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and
economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the
requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and
regulations in other countries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additions to market exclusivity are sought in the United States and other countries through
all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in
patent life have been partially offset by a general increase in the number of, incentives for and
use of generic products. Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in
the United States and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and
implementation of international treaties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide, all of the Company&#146;s important products are sold under trademarks that are
considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection continues in some
countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed
terms and can be renewed indefinitely.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalties received during 2004 on patent and know-how licenses and other rights amounted to
$113.9&nbsp;million. The Company also paid royalties amounting to $734.1&nbsp;million in 2004 under patent
and know-how licenses it holds.

effected by way of a pro rata dividend to Company stockholders of all the outstanding shares of
common stock of Medco Health. Based on a letter ruling the Company received from the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service, receipt of Medco Health shares in the distribution was tax-free for U.S. federal

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for
existing products through a strong research and development program. Approximately 13,100 people
are employed in the Company&#146;s research activities. Expenditures for the Company&#146;s research and
development programs were $4.0&nbsp;billion in 2004, $3.2&nbsp;billion in 2003 and $2.7&nbsp;billion in 2002 and
are estimated to continue at the same level as the full-year 2004 expense in 2005. The Company
maintains its ongoing commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and clinical
development in support of new products. Total expenditures for the period 1995 through 2004
exceeded $23.1&nbsp;billion with a compound annual growth rate of 13%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in
biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. Projects
related to human health are being carried on in various fields such as bacterial, fungal, and viral
infections, cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis, cancer, depression, diabetes, obesity,
neurodegenerative disease, psychiatric disease, pain and inflammation, immunology, respiratory
diseases, ophthalmology, respiratory diseases, osteoporosis and men/women health programs,
endoparasitic and ectoparasitic diseases, companion animal diseases, and production improvement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of human health products, industry practice and government regulations in
the United States and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and
safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation.
Before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, recorded data on preclinical and clinical
experience are included in the NDA or the biological Product License Application (&#147;PLA&#148;) to the FDA
for the required approval. The development of certain other products is also subject to government
regulations covering safety and efficacy in the United States and many foreign countries. There
can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the
regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
stated above, the Company maintains basic research programs in a number of areas directed toward product development. Once
the Company&#146;s scientists discover a new compound that they believe has promise to treat a medical
condition, the Company commences preclinical testing with that compound. Preclinical testing
includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry, pharmacology
and toxicology. Compounds that are selected for study in humans then must undergo further testing
to determine how they are metabolized and excreted in animals and then prepared in a stable dose
form that is bioavailable. The preclinical testing phase takes about six years on average. If the
compound continues to show promise, the Company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with
established regulatory requirements. The three phases of clinical
testing take a total of six years on average
to complete. The clinical testing begins with Phase I studies which are used to determine that the
compound is safe in humans, usually using healthy volunteers. Phase I studies are concerned with
detecting adverse effects and usually do not provide data on the
efficacy of the compound to treat the
targeted medical condition. If Phase I studies do not identify human tolerability problems, the
compound then enters Phase II which is the first time the compound is studied in patients with the disease
that the compound is being studied to treat. Phase II dose and efficacy trials are commenced to
determine the appropriate dosing for the compound, to confirm the compound&#146;s efficacy and to
determine whether any adverse effects will limit the compound&#146;s usefulness. If the results from the
Phase II trials are satisfactory, the Company commences large-scale Phase III trials to confirm the compound&#146;s efficacy and safety. Upon completion of those trials, if
satisfactory, the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies
around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing. In the United States, the
FDA approval process begins once a complete NDA is submitted and received by the FDA. Pursuant to
the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA review period targets for
efficacy NDAs or supplemental
NDAs is either six months, for priority review, or ten months, for a standard review. Within 60
days after receipt of an NDA, the FDA determines if the application is sufficiently complete to
permit a substantive review. The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether the application will be
granted a priority review or standard review. According to FDA guidelines, a priority review is
granted if the compound is considered to constitute a &#147;significant improvement, compared to
marketed products, including non-drug products/therapies in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention
of a disease.&#148; The determination of whether the application is &#147;filable&#148; and type of review (i.e.,
standard or priority) are then communicated to the Company. Once the review timelines are defined,
it is generally assumed that the FDA will act upon the application within those timelines, unless a
major amendment has been submitted (either at the Company&#146;s own initiative or the FDA&#146;s request) to
the pending application. If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review
of the new information, but by no more than 180&nbsp;days. Extensions to the review period are
communicated to the Company. The average time period from the start of preclinical testing to FDA
approval is approximately 14&nbsp;years.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2004, the Company announced it had filed a Biologics License Application for
<I>ProQuad </I>(measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (Oka/Merck) virus vaccine live) with the FDA.
<I>ProQuad </I>is an investigational vaccine for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella
and varicella in children 12&nbsp;months to 12&nbsp;years of age. <I>ProQuad </I>combines two established Merck
vaccines, <I>M-M-R </I>II and <I>Varivax</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s late-stage pipeline includes three Phase III vaccines which are expected to be
submitted for FDA approval in 2005. The three vaccines are
<I>Gardasil, </I>a vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus (&#147;HPV&#148;) infection and the associated development of cervical
cancer and genital warts; a vaccine for the prevention of zoster (shingles)&nbsp;and the reduction of
pain associated with it; and <I>RotaTeq</I>, a vaccine to protect against rotavirus, a highly contagious
virus that is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children. The
Company expects to file PLAs with the FDA for the zoster vaccine and <I>RotaTeq </I>in the second quarter
of 2005 and for <I>Gardasil </I>in the second half of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;2, 2005, the Company announced that it and GlaxoSmithKline plc (&#147;GSK&#148;) entered
into a cross-license and settlement agreement for certain patent rights related to HPV vaccines.
Pursuant to the agreement, GSK will receive an upfront payment and
royalties from the Company based on
sales of <I>Gardasil, </I>upon development and launch. The agreement resolves competing intellectual
property claims related to the Company&#146;s and GSK&#146;s vaccine candidates. The Company will continue
with its research, development and, after appropriate regulatory reviews, commercialization
activities, if approved, for <I>Gardasil</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is also studying a DPP-IV inhibitor, a glucose-lowering mechanism, used alone and
in combination for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The compound is currently in Phase III
clinical studies and the Company expects to submit an NDA to the FDA in 2006.

Alzheimer&#146;s disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, endocrine disorders, glaucoma,
infectious diseases, obesity, osteoporosis, psychiatric disease, neurodegenerative disease, pain,
respiratory disease, urogenital disorders and vaccines. The Company supplements its internal
research with an aggressive licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum
of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as new technologies. In
2004, the Company completed 50 transactions, including research collaborations, preclinical and
clinical compounds, and technology transactions. Transactions completed in 2004 include agreements
with the following companies: H. Lundbeck A/S (&#147;Lundbeck&#148;) for the treatment of sleep disorders,
Bristol-Myers Squibb (&#147;BMS&#148;) for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated (&#147;Vertex&#148;) for the treatment of cancer; DOV Pharmaceutical, Inc. (&#147;DOV&#148;) for the
treatment of depression and related psychiatric disorders, Nastech Pharmaceutical Inc. (&#147;Nastech&#148;)
for the treatment of obesity and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (&#147;Ono&#148;) for the treatment of acute
stroke.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2004, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with Lundbeck for
the exclusive development and commercialization in the United States of gaboxadol, a compound
licensed to Lundbeck by a third party that is currently in Phase III development for the treatment
of sleep disorders. Merck and Lundbeck will jointly complete the ongoing Phase III clinical
program. The companies anticipate that Merck will file an NDA with the FDA between late 2006 and
early 2007. Following FDA approval, the companies plan to co-promote gaboxadol in the United
States. In June&nbsp;2004, Merck and Lundbeck announced an extension of their agreement for the
exclusive development and commercialization of gaboxadol to Japan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the Company acquired Aton, a privately held biotechnology company focusing on
the development of novel treatments for cancer and other serious diseases. Aton&#146;s clinical
pipeline of histone deacetylase inhibitors represents a class of anti-tumor agents with potential
for efficacy based on a novel mechanism of action. Aton&#146;s lead product candidate, suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2004, Merck and BMS entered into a worldwide collaborative agreement for
muraglitazar, BMS&#146;s product for use in treating patients with Type 2 diabetes. Merck and BMS will
globally develop and market muraglitazar. In December&nbsp;2004, BMS submitted an NDA to the FDA for
muraglitazar. Muraglitazar has the potential to be the first in a novel class of drugs known as
glitazars. This class of dual alpha/gamma PPAR agonists, including muraglitazar, is thought to
control blood sugar. In clinical trials, muraglitazar has reduced blood glucose levels, decreased
triglyceride levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)&nbsp;cholesterol levels in Type 2
diabetes patients and has been generally well tolerated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2004, Merck and Vertex entered into a global collaboration to develop and
commercialize VX-680, Vertex&#146;s lead Aurora kinase inhibitor that is in Phase I clinical development
for the treatment of cancer. Aurora kinases are implicated in the onset and progression of many
different human cancers and novel Aurora kinase inhibitors, such as VX-680, have the potential to
play an important future role in the treatment and management of a wide range of tumor types.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2004, Merck and DOV announced an agreement for the development and commercialization
of DOV&#146;s novel triple-uptake inhibitors being developed for depression and related psychiatric
disorders. Merck has licensed exclusive worldwide rights to DOV 21,947, which is in Phase I, for
all therapeutic indications.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2004, Merck and Nastech announced a global alliance to develop and commercialize
Peptide YY (PYY)&nbsp;3-36 Nasal Spray, Nastech&#146;s product for the treatment of obesity, which is
currently in Phase I development. The investigational PYY 3-36 Nasal Spray is designed to deliver
the natural, appetite-regulating hormone PYY directly to the bloodstream.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2004, Merck and Ono announced that they signed an agreement granting Merck the
worldwide license for ONO-2506 ((2R)-2-propyloctanoic acid), a novel intravenous compound currently
in Phase II development for the treatment of acute stroke. In addition, Ono received exclusive
rights in Japan to develop and market <I>Emend </I>(aprepitant), Merck&#146;s drug for use in combination with
other antiemetic agents for prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with
initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin. Ono also
received rights in Japan to co-market a second brand of MK-431, Merck&#146;s investigational oral
compound for the treatment of diabetes, under a yet to be determined trademark.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chart below reflects the Company&#146;s research pipeline as of February&nbsp;15, 2005. Candidates
shown in Phase III include specific products. Candidates shown in Phase I and II include the most
advanced compound with a specific mechanism in a given therapeutic area. Back-up compounds,
regardless of their phase of development, additional indications in the same therapeutic areas and
additional line extensions or formulations for in-line products are not shown. Preclinical areas
shown are those where the Company has initiated Good Laboratory Practices studies in compounds with
mechanisms distinct from those in Phase I and II. The Company&#146;s programs are generally designed to
focus on the development of novel medicines to address large, unmet medical needs.

approximately 32,700 employed in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Approximately 22% of
worldwide employees of the Company are represented by various collective bargaining groups.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company announced plans to eliminate 4,400 positions as part of a cost-reduction
initiative that was completed at the end of 2004. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had
eliminated 5,100 positions, as the Company identified additional opportunities to eliminate
positions and reduce costs. Most of the additional eliminations came from contractor positions.
This action is expected to result in approximately $300&nbsp;million in savings in 2005 without
impacting either key productivity initiatives or the Company&#146;s ability to meet its business
objectives.

years 2005 through 2009. These amounts do not consider potential recoveries from insurers or other

management&#146;s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters which are probable and
reasonably estimable have been accrued. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the
outcome of these environmental matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not
believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of those provided
should result in a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of

&#147;expects,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;forecasts,&#148; &#147;projects&#148; and other words of similar

results, product approvals and development programs. One must carefully consider any such

from the Company&#146;s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a
broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are
not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.

    <TD>On September&nbsp;30, 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew <I>Vioxx </I>from the
market. Numerous product liability lawsuits as well as a number
of putative class actions have been filed against the Company in
state and federal courts relating to the sale and use of <I>Vioxx</I>.
In addition to these lawsuits, a number of purported class actions
have been brought against the Company and several current and
former officers and directors of the Company alleging that the
Company made false and misleading statements regarding <I>Vioxx </I>in
violation of the federal securities laws and the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;). In addition, a number
of shareholders have filed derivative suits asserting claims
against the Board members and Company officers. The Company has
also been named as a defendant in actions in various countries
outside the United States. The Company anticipates that
additional lawsuits relating to <I>Vioxx </I>will be filed against it.
The Company is also being investigated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), the U.S. Department of Justice,
certain Congressional committees and the District Attorney&#146;s
Office in Munich, Germany. The Company has stated that it is
reasonably possible that its insurance coverage will not be
adequate to cover its defensive costs and any losses.
Unfavorable outcomes in the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits (as defined on page
18) or resulting from the

agents, sold by prescription, for the treatment and prevention of human disorders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operations outside the United States are conducted primarily through
subsidiaries. Sales worldwide by subsidiaries outside the United States were 41% of sales in 2004,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s worldwide business is subject to risks of currency fluctuations, governmental
actions and other governmental proceedings abroad. The Company does not regard these risks as a

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal
to its business, including product liability, intellectual property, and commercial litigation, as
well as additional matters such as antitrust actions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Vioxx </I></B><B>Litigation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Product Liability Lawsuits</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, federal and state product liability lawsuits involving individual
claims, as well as several putative class actions have been filed against the Company with respect
to <I>Vioxx</I>. As of January&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company has been served or is aware that it has been named
as a defendant in approximately 850 lawsuits, which include approximately 2,425 plaintiff groups
alleging personal injuries resulting from the use of <I>Vioxx</I>. Certain of these lawsuits include
allegations regarding gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events, thrombotic events or kidney
damage. The Company has also been named as a defendant in approximately 90 putative class actions
alleging personal injuries or seeking (i)&nbsp;medical monitoring as a result of the putative class
members&#146; use of <I>Vioxx</I>, (ii)&nbsp;disgorgement of certain profits under common law unjust enrichment
theories, and/or (iii)&nbsp;various remedies under state consumer fraud and fair business practice
statutes, including recovering the cost of <I>Vioxx </I>purchased by individuals and third-party payors
such as union health plans (all of the actions discussed in this paragraph are collectively
referred to as the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits&#148;). The actions filed in the state courts of
California and New Jersey, respectively, have been transferred to a single judge in each state for
coordinated proceedings. In addition, the Company filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation (the &#147;JPML&#148;) seeking to transfer to a single federal judge and coordinate
for pretrial purposes all federal cases alleging personal injury and/or economic loss relating to
the purchase or use of <I>Vioxx</I>; several plaintiffs in certain <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits
pending in federal court have made similar requests. On February&nbsp;16, 2005, the JPML granted the
motions to transfer all <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into
one Multidistrict Litigation (&#147;MDL&#148;) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. The MDL has been
transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana before
District Judge Eldon E. Fallon.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Shareholder Lawsuits</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in addition to the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits, a number of
purported class action lawsuits were filed in late 2003 and early 2004 by several shareholders in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana naming as defendants the
Company and several current or former officers and directors of the Company. These cases have
been consolidated. After the announcement of the withdrawal of <I>Vioxx</I>, the Company was named as a
defendant in additional purported securities class action lawsuits filed in federal courts in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana. These actions allege that the defendants made false and
misleading statements regarding <I>Vioxx </I>in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, including with respect to the withdrawal of <I>Vioxx, </I>and seek unspecified
compensatory damages and the costs of suit, including attorneys&#146; fees. Plaintiffs request
certification of a class of purchasers of Company stock during various periods between May&nbsp;21,
1999 and October&nbsp;29, 2004. In addition, two shareholders filed an individual securities action
in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois seeking compensatory
damages and costs. Certain complaints include allegations under Sections&nbsp;11, 12 and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 that certain officers and directors made incomplete and misleading
statements in a registration statement and certain prospectuses filed in connection with the
Merck Stock Investment Plan, a dividend reinvestment plan (all of the actions discussed in this
paragraph are collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits&#148;). Several plaintiffs
have dismissed their complaints without prejudice. As of January&nbsp;31, 2005, a total of 14 <I>Vioxx</I>
Securities Lawsuits were pending in various federal courts.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in March&nbsp;2004, two shareholder derivative actions were filed in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana naming the Company as a nominal
defendant and certain members of the Board (past and present), together with certain executive
officers, as defendants. The complaints arise out of substantially the same factual allegations
that are made in the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits. The derivative suits, which are purportedly
brought to assert rights of the Company, assert claims against the Board members and officers for
breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, abuse of control and
gross mismanagement. After the withdrawal of <I>Vioxx, </I>additional shareholder derivative actions
were filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for Hunterdon County and in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain officers and
members of the Board (past and present) (all of the actions discussed in this paragraph are
collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits&#148;). Two of the <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative
Lawsuits include allegations that certain directors made false and misleading statements in
connection with certain Proxy Statements filed with the SEC in violation of Section 14(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933. As of January&nbsp;31, 2005, a total of seven <I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits were
pending.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;29, 2004, two individual shareholders made a demand on the Board to take legal
action against Mr.&nbsp;Raymond Gilmartin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and other
individuals for allegedly causing damage to the Company with respect to the allegedly improper
marketing of <I>Vioxx. </I>In response to that demand letter, the Board of Directors determined at its
November&nbsp;23, 2004 meeting that the Board would take the shareholders&#146; request under consideration
and it remains under consideration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these shareholder actions, since the announcement of the withdrawal of <I>Vioxx</I>,
putative class actions have been filed against the Company in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Louisiana and in the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey (the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits&#148; and, together with the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits and the
<I>Vioxx </I>Derivative Lawsuits, the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder Lawsuits&#148;) on behalf of certain of the
Company&#146;s current and former employees who are participants in certain of the Company&#146;s
retirement plans asserting claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;).
The lawsuits make similar allegations to the allegations contained in the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities
Lawsuits. As of January&nbsp;31, 2005, a total of 11 <I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits were pending.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2004, the plaintiff in one of the <I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits filed a motion with the JPML
to transfer to a single federal judge and coordinate for pretrial purposes all of the <I>Vioxx </I>ERISA
Lawsuits. In November&nbsp;2004, the Company responded to that motion and filed its own motion
seeking coordination of all of the <I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder Lawsuits. On February&nbsp;23, 2005, the JPML
granted the motions to transfer all <I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder Lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide
into one MDL for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. The MDL has been transferred to the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey before District Judge Stanley R. Chesler.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>International Lawsuits</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the lawsuits discussed above, the Company has been named as a defendant in
actions in various countries in Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Israel related to <I>Vioxx</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Additional Lawsuits</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on media reports and other sources, the Company anticipates that additional <I>Vioxx</I>
Product Liability Lawsuits and <I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder Lawsuits (collectively, the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits&#148;)
will be filed against it and/or certain of its current and former officers and directors in the
future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Insurance</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has product liability insurance for claims brought in the <I>Vioxx </I>Product
Liability Lawsuits of up to approximately $630&nbsp;million after deductibles and co-insurance. This
insurance provides coverage for legal defense costs and potential damage amounts that have been
or will be incurred in connection with the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits. The Company
believes that this insurance coverage extends to additional <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits that
may be filed in the future. The Company currently believes that it has at least approximately
$190&nbsp;million of Directors&#146; and Officers&#146; insurance coverage for the <I>Vioxx </I>Securities Lawsuits and

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Vioxx </I>Derivative
Lawsuits. The Company has fiduciary and other insurance for the
<I>Vioxx </I>ERISA Lawsuits with stated upper limits of
$275&nbsp;million. Additional insurance coverage for these claims may also be
available under upper level excess policies that provide coverage for a variety of risks. There are likely to be disputes with
insurers about the availability of some or all of this insurance coverage. At this time, the
Company believes it is reasonably possible its insurance coverage with respect to the <I>Vioxx</I>
Lawsuits will not be adequate to cover its defense costs and any losses.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently,
Merck received notice that the Company&#146;s upper level excess
insurers (which provide excess insurance potentially applicable to
all of the <I>Vioxx</I> Lawsuits) commenced an arbitration seeking, among
other things, to cancel those policies and to void all of their
obligations under those policies with respect to the <I>Vioxx</I> Lawsuits,
and also to void their coverage obligations with respect to certain
other types of losses covered by those policies. The notice also
purports to reserve the right of the insurers to raise other coverage
defenses, including with respect to the application of exclusions,
the definition of loss, compliance with policy conditions, exhaustion
of applicable underlying and upper coverage limits, and satisfactory
proof of loss. As most of those insurers also issued
lower level excess policies to Merck, it is likely that such insurers will also dispute their
obligation to provide coverage under other policies. Merck intends to contest vigorously the
insurers&#146; claims and will attempt to enforce its rights under
applicable insurance policies. The amounts actually recovered under
the policies discussed in this section may be less than the amounts
specified in the preceding paragraph.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company notes that the
discussion contained in this section updates the disclosure entitled &#147;Contingencies and Environmental
Liabilities&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;<I>Vioxx</I> Litigation&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Insurance&#148; in
Note&nbsp;11 to the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements
filed with the SEC on February&nbsp;28, 2005 on Form&nbsp;8-K and
contained in the Company&#146;s 2004 Annual Report to stockholders which is
incorporated by reference in this Form&nbsp;10-K.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Investigations</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2004, the Company was advised by the staff of the SEC that it was commencing an
informal inquiry concerning <I>Vioxx</I>. On January&nbsp;28, 2005, the Company announced that it received
notice that the SEC issued a formal notice of investigation. Also, the Company received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information related to the Company&#146;s research,
marketing and selling activities with respect to <I>Vioxx </I>in a federal health care investigation under
criminal statutes. There are also ongoing investigations by certain Congressional committees.
Also, the District Attorney&#146;s Office in Munich, Germany notified the Company&#146;s subsidiary in
Germany that it received complaints and commenced an investigation in order to determine whether
any criminal charges should be brought in Germany concerning <I>Vioxx </I>(together with the previously
mentioned investigations, the &#147;<I>Vioxx </I>Investigations&#148;). The Company will cooperate with all of the
<I>Vioxx </I>Investigations. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries; however, they
could result in a potential civil disposition from the SEC and/or potential civil or criminal
dispositions from the Justice Department.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Reserves</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently anticipates that one or more of the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits
may go to trial in the first half of 2005. The Company cannot predict the timing of any trials
with respect to the <I>Vioxx </I>Shareholder Lawsuits. The Company believes that it has meritorious
defenses to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits and will vigorously defend against them. In view of the inherent
difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, particularly where there are many claimants
and the claimants seek indeterminate damages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of
these matters, and at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss
with respect to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits. The Company has not established any reserves for any
potential liability relating to the <I>Vioxx </I>Lawsuits or the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations (collectively, the
"<I>Vioxx </I>Litigation&#148;). The Company has established a reserve of $675&nbsp;million solely for its future
legal defense costs related to the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation. This reserve is based on certain
assumptions and is the minimum amount that the Company believes at this time it can reasonably
estimate will be spent over a multi-year period. The Company significantly increased the reserve
when it had the ability to reasonably estimate its future legal defense costs for the <I>Vioxx</I>
Litigation. Some of the significant factors that were considered in the establishment of the
reserve for the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation were as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company up to
that time; the development of the Company&#146;s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the
expanded scope of the <I>Vioxx </I>Litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company;
and the anticipated timing, progression and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in
the <I>Vioxx </I>Product Liability Lawsuits. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense
costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves. Unfavorable outcomes in the <I>Vioxx</I>
Lawsuits or resulting from the <I>Vioxx </I>Investigations could have a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Commercial Litigation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in 1993, the Company was named in a number of antitrust suits, certain of which were
certified as class actions, instituted by most of the nation&#146;s retail pharmacies and consumers in
several states. In 1994, these actions, except for those pending in state courts, were
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the federal court in Chicago, Illinois. In 1996, the
Company and several other defendants settled the federal class action, which represented the single
largest group of claims. Since that time, the Company has settled substantially all of the
remaining cases on satisfactory terms; the few remaining cases have been inactive for several
years. The Company has not engaged in any conspiracy and no admission of wrongdoing was made nor
was included in any settlement agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, the Company was joined in ongoing litigation alleging manipulation by
pharmaceutical manufacturers of Average Wholesale Prices (&#147;AWP&#148;), which are sometimes used in
calculations that determine public and private sector reimbursement levels. In 2002, the JPML
ordered the transfer and consolidation of all pending federal AWP cases to federal court in Boston,
Massachusetts. Plaintiffs filed one consolidated class action complaint, which aggregated the
claims previously filed in various federal district court actions and also expanded the number of
manufacturers to include some which, like the Company, had not been defendants in any prior pending
case. In May&nbsp;2003, the court granted the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss the consolidated class action
and dismissed the Company from the class action case. Subsequent to the Company&#146;s dismissal, the
plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint, which did not name the Company as
a defendant. The Company and 30 other pharmaceutical manufacturers remain defendants in six
similar complaints pending in federal court in Massachusetts filed by the New York Counties of
Suffolk, Rockland, Nassau, Westchester, Onondaga and New York City and three cases pending in
Kentucky, Alabama and Wisconsin. The Company and the other defendants have filed and argued their
motion to dismiss the Suffolk case and are awaiting the court&#146;s final decision on the motion. In
addition, the Company is a defendant in cases brought on behalf of the citizens of Kentucky and
Wisconsin alleging fraudulent practices regarding AWP, which the Company will vigorously defend.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, the Company has been named as a defendant in antitrust cases in
federal court in Minnesota and in state court in California, each alleging an unlawful conspiracy
among different sets of pharmaceutical manufacturers to protect high prices in the United States by
impeding importation into the United States of lower-priced pharmaceuticals from Canada. The
Company and the other defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, a suit in federal court in Alabama by two providers of health
services to needy patients alleges that 15 pharmaceutical companies overcharged the plaintiffs and
a class of those similarly situated, for pharmaceuticals purchased by the plaintiffs under the
program established by Section&nbsp;340B of the Public Health Service Act. The Company and the other
defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on numerous grounds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in January&nbsp;2003, the U.S. Department of Justice notified the federal
court in New Orleans, Louisiana that it was not going to intervene at that time in a pending
Federal False Claims Act case that was filed under seal in December&nbsp;1999 against the Company. The
court issued an order unsealing the complaint, which was filed by a physician in Louisiana, and
ordered that the complaint be served. The complaint, which alleged that the Company&#146;s discounting
of <I>Pepcid </I>in certain Louisiana hospitals led to increases in costs to Medicaid, was dismissed. An
amended complaint was filed under seal and the case has been administratively closed by the court
until the seal is lifted. The allegations contained in the amended complaint are unknown.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Governmental Proceedings</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, the Company has received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of
Justice in connection with its investigation of the Company&#146;s marketing and selling activities.
The Company has also reported that it has received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Attorney
General of Texas regarding the Company&#146;s

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">marketing and selling activities relating to Texas. In April&nbsp;2004, the Company received a subpoena from the office of the Inspector General for the District of Columbia in connection with an investigation of
the Company&#146;s interactions with physicians in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. In
November&nbsp;2004, the Company received a letter request from the Department of Justice in connection
with its investigation of the Company&#146;s pricing of <I>Pepcid</I>. The Company is cooperating with all of
these investigations. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these investigations; however, it
is possible that unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial position, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, from time to time, other
federal or state regulators may seek information about practices in the pharmaceutical industry in
inquiries other than the investigations discussed in this paragraph. It is not feasible to predict
the outcome of any such inquiries.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Vaccine Litigation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a party in claims brought under the Consumer Protection Act of 1987 in the
United Kingdom, which allege that certain children suffer from a variety of conditions as a result
of being vaccinated with various bivalent vaccines for measles and rubella and/or trivalent
vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella, including the Company&#146;s <I>M-M-R </I>II. The conditions include
autism, with or without inflammatory bowel disease, epilepsy, diabetes, encephalitis,
encephalopathy, deafness, chronic fatigue syndrome and transverse myelitis. In early September
2003, the Legal Services Commission (&#147;LSC&#148;) announced its decision to withdraw public funding of
the litigation brought by the claimants. This decision was confirmed on appeal by the Funding
Review Committee (&#147;FRC&#148;) on September&nbsp;30, 2003. The claimants&#146; application for judicial review of
the decision to withdraw public funding was dismissed in February&nbsp;2004 and the April&nbsp;2004 trial
date was vacated. The lead claimants have decided not to apply to the Court of Appeals for
permission to appeal the decision. As a result, legal aid for all lead claimants has now been
discharged. The non-lead claimants were subject to a &#147;show cause&#148; procedure to withdraw legal aid
unless the claimants could show cause as to why it should not be withdrawn. The FRC heard 37 of
the &#147;show cause&#148; appeals by the non-lead claimants in October&nbsp;2004. The appeals involving autism
(26)&nbsp;were unsuccessful, but funding was reinstated for 11 appeals involving other non-autism
conditions such as epilepsy, deafness, encephalitis and transverse myelitis. In light of the 11
successful appeals, the LSC has reconsidered the cases of some other claimants and, to date,
funding has been reinstated in an additional 86 non-lead, non-autism cases, to the limited extent
necessary to allow solicitors to provide a report on the individual cases to the LSC. It is not
yet known how many of the 97 appeals involve claimants suing the Company. All claimants for all
conditions had until February&nbsp;28, 2005 to give notice of their intention to continue or discontinue
with their claims, irrespective of whether or not they had secured legal aid funding. Directions
for further conduct of the litigation will be made at a case management hearing scheduled to take
place on March&nbsp;17 and 18, 2005. The Company will vigorously defend against these lawsuits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previous disclosed, the Company is also a party to individual and class action product
liability lawsuits and claims in the United States involving pediatric vaccines (i.e., hepatitis B
vaccine and <U>Haemophilus</U> <U>influenza</U> type b vaccine) that contained thimerosal, a
preservative used in vaccines. Merck has not distributed thimerosal-containing pediatric vaccines
in the United States since the fall of 2001. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, there were approximately 300
active thimerosal related lawsuits with approximately 820 plaintiffs. Other defendants include
vaccine manufacturers who produced pediatric vaccines containing thimerosal as well as
manufacturers of thimerosal. In these actions, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that
they have suffered neurological injuries as a result of exposure to thimerosal from pediatric
vaccines. Two state court cases and two federal district court cases are scheduled for trial in
2005. The Company will vigorously defend against these lawsuits; however, it is possible that
unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position,
liquidity and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has been successful in having cases of this type either dismissed or stayed on the
ground that the action is prohibited under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program
(&#147;NVICP&#148;). The NVICP prohibits any person from filing or maintaining a civil action (in state or
federal court) seeking damages against a vaccine manufacturer for vaccine-related injuries unless a
petition is first filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims (hereinafter the &#147;Vaccine
Court&#148;). Under the NVICP, before filing a civil action against a vaccine manufacturer, the
petitioner must either (a)&nbsp;pursue his or her petition to conclusion in Vaccine Court and then
timely

numerous cases pending in Vaccine Court involving allegations that thimerosal-containing vaccines

Vaccine Court proceedings because the petitions are brought against the Department of Health and
Human Services.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Patent Litigation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products file Abbreviated New Drug
Applications (&#147;ANDAs&#148;) with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of the Company&#146;s products prior
to the expiration of relevant patents owned by the Company. Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers
have submitted ANDAs to the FDA seeking to market in the United States generic forms of <I>Fosamax</I>,
<I>Prilosec </I>and <I>Propecia </I>prior to the expiration of the Company&#146;s (and AstraZeneca&#146;s in the case of
<I>Prilosec) </I>patents concerning these products. The generic companies&#146; ANDAs generally include
allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the patents. Generic
manufacturers have received FDA approval to market a generic form of <I>Prilosec</I>. The Company has
filed patent infringement suits in federal court against companies filing ANDAs for generic
alendronate and finasteride, and AstraZeneca and the Company have filed patent infringement suits
in federal court against companies filing ANDAs for generic omeprazole. Similar patent challenges
exist in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company intends to vigorously defend its patents,
which it believes are valid, against infringement by generic companies attempting to market
products prior to the expiration dates of such patents. As with any litigation, there can be no
assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly shortened periods of
exclusivity for these products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trial in the United States with respect to the alendronate daily product concluded in
November&nbsp;2001. In November&nbsp;2002, a decision was issued by the U.S. District Court in Delaware
finding the Company&#146;s patent valid and infringed. On October&nbsp;30, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit affirmed the validity and infringement of the Company&#146;s basic U.S. patent
covering the use of alendronate in any form. A request for rehearing was denied. A trial in the
United States involving the alendronate weekly product was held in March&nbsp;2003. On August&nbsp;28, 2003,
the U.S. District Court in Delaware upheld the validity of the Company&#146;s U.S. patent covering the
weekly administration of alendronate. However, on January&nbsp;28, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. found the Company&#146;s patent claims for once-weekly
administration of <I>Fosamax </I>to be invalid. Based on the Court of Appeals&#146; decision, <I>Fosamax </I>will
lose its market exclusivity in the United States in February&nbsp;2008 and the Company expects a decline
in U.S. <I>Fosamax </I>sales at that time. Prior to the decision, Merck&#146;s patent for once-weekly
administration of <I>Fosamax </I>was set to expire in July&nbsp;2018. Merck disagrees with the decision of the
Court of Appeals and has requested reconsideration by the Court of Appeals.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the High Court of Justice for England and Wales held that patents of the
Company protecting the alendronate daily and weekly products were invalid in the United Kingdom.
On November&nbsp;6, 2003, the Court of Appeals of England and Wales affirmed the ruling by the High
Court of Justice for England and Wales. European countries permit companies seeking approval of a
generic product to reference data of the innovative product in certain circumstances under data
exclusivity regulations. The Company has been granted leave to appeal a decision of the U.K.
regulatory authority that its data for weekly alendronate may be referenced by companies seeking
approval of generic weekly alendronate products. The Company has also filed an appeal of a grant
by the Swedish regulatory authority of approval of generic weekly alendronate products which
referenced the Company&#146;s data on weekly alendronate for their approval.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously announced by the Company, on July&nbsp;20, 2004, the Opposition Division of the
European Patent Office rendered an oral decision to revoke the Company&#146;s patent in Europe that
covers the weekly administration of alendronate. On August&nbsp;19, 2004, the written opinion was
issued confirming the oral decision revoking the Company&#146;s patent. On September&nbsp;16, 2004, the
Company filed an appeal of this decision. Based on other patents, the alendronate weekly product
is protected in most major European markets until at least 2007.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;5, 2004, in an action in Australia challenging the validity of the Company&#146;s
Australian patent for the weekly administration of alendronate, the patent was found to be invalid.
The Company has appealed the decision.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in Japan a proceeding has been filed challenging the validity of the Company&#146;s
Japanese patent for the weekly administration of alendronate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of omeprazole, the trial court in the United States rendered an opinion in October
2002 upholding the validity of the Company&#146;s and AstraZeneca&#146;s patents covering the stabilized
formulation of omeprazole and ruling that one defendant&#146;s omeprazole product did not infringe those
patents. The other three defendants&#146; products were found to infringe the formulation patents. In
December&nbsp;2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the decision of the trial
court. With respect to certain other generic manufacturers&#146; omeprazole products, no trial date has
yet been set.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of finasteride, an ANDA has been filed seeking approval of a generic version of
<I>Propecia </I>and alleging invalidity of the Company&#146;s patents. The Company filed a patent infringement
lawsuit in the District Court of Delaware in September&nbsp;2004. A trial is not anticipated before
2006.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Litigation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, on July&nbsp;6, 2004, the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey granted a motion by the Company, Medco Health and certain officers and directors to
dismiss a purported class action complaint involving claims related to the Company&#146;s revenue
recognition practice for retail co-payments paid by individuals to whom Medco Health provides
pharmaceutical benefits as well as other allegations. The complaint was dismissed with prejudice.
On August&nbsp;20, 2004, the same court granted the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss with prejudice a related
shareholder derivative action. Plaintiffs in both actions have appealed the decisions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the spin-off of Medco Health, the Company and Medco Health agreed to settle, on a
class action basis, a series of lawsuits asserting violations of ERISA (the &#147;Gruer Cases&#148;). The
Company, Medco Health and certain plaintiffs&#146; counsel filed the settlement agreement with the
federal district court in New York, where cases commenced by a number of plaintiffs, including
participants in a number of pharmaceutical benefit plans for which Medco Health is the pharmacy
benefit manager, as well as trustees of such plans, have been consolidated. The proposed class
settlement has been agreed to by plaintiffs in five of the cases filed against Medco Health and the
Company. Under the proposed settlement, the Company and Medco Health have agreed to pay a total of
$42.5&nbsp;million, and Medco Health has agreed to modify certain business practices or to continue
certain specified business practices for a period of five years. The financial compensation is
intended to benefit members of the settlement class, which includes ERISA plans for which Medco
Health administered a pharmacy benefit at any time since December&nbsp;17, 1994. In 2003, the district
court preliminarily approved the settlement and held hearings to hear objections to the fairness of
the proposed settlement. The district court approved the settlement in 2004, but has not yet
determined the number of class member plans that have properly elected not to participate in the
settlement. The settlement becomes final only if and when all appeals have been resolved. Three
notices of appeal have been filed and the appellate court is expected to hear arguments regarding
the appeals in March&nbsp;2005 and decide the appeals thereafter. Currently, certain class member plans
have indicated that they will not participate in the settlement. Cases initiated by three such
plans and two individuals remain pending in the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs in these
cases have asserted claims based on ERISA as well as other federal and state laws that are the same
as or similar to the claims that had been asserted by settling class members in the Gruer Cases.
The Company and Medco Health are named as defendants in these cases. Medco Health and the Company
agreed to the proposed settlement in order to avoid the significant cost and distraction of
prolonged litigation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spin-off of Medco Health, Medco Health assumed substantially all of the liability
exposure for the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph. These cases are being defended by
Medco Health.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various other legal proceedings, principally product liability and intellectual
property suits involving the Company, which are pending. While it is not feasible to predict the
outcome of such proceedings or the proceedings discussed above, in the opinion of the Company, all
such proceedings are either adequately covered by insurance or, if not so covered, should not
ultimately result in any liability that would have a material adverse effect on the financial
position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company other than proceedings for which a
separate assessment is provided.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Environmental Matters</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in December&nbsp;2003, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality
(&#147;VADEQ&#148;) issued a Notice of Violation to the Company&#146;s Elkton, Virginia facility for air permit
limit exceedances reported by the facility as a result of performance testing of a process train.
The Company is currently in discussions with VADEQ and believes that its discussions will result in
capital improvements together with monetary sanctions which will be immaterial but will exceed
$100,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other
federal and state equivalents. These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous waste
disposal facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste disposed
of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. The
Company has been made a party to these proceedings as an alleged generator of waste disposed of at
the sites. In each case, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally
liable for the cleanup costs. Although joint and several liability is alleged, these proceedings
are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more nearly
reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site situation. The Company&#146;s potential
liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites the potential liability is <I>de minimis</I>
and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. While it is not feasible to
predict the outcome of many of these proceedings brought by federal or state agencies or private
litigants, in the opinion of the Company, such proceedings should not ultimately result in any
liability which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
operations, liquidity or capital resources of the Company. The Company has taken an active role in
identifying and providing for these costs and such amounts do not include any reduction for
anticipated recoveries of cleanup costs from insurers, former site owners or operators or other
recalcitrant potentially responsible parties.
