TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE CONSUMER, SMB, EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE, GOVERNMENT, AND CREATIVE MARKETS. THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, AND CATALOGUERS.

NO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 2008, 2007, OR 2006. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS OWN SALES

FORCE AND RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES.

COMPETITION

THE

COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE MARKETS FOR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, PERSONAL COMPUTERS, RELATED SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS, DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES AND RELATED SERVICES, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION

DEVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE CAPABILITIES AND USE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, OTHER DIGITAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES, AND

MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS WITH COMPETITIVE PRICE, FEATURE, AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN THESE MARKETS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY

INTENSE. THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE PRICE, PRODUCT FEATURES, RELATIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN

INNOVATION, AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERALS, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AND CORPORATE REPUTATION. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN

INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER, SIMPLER, AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE FACED SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC AND CONTENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE OFFERING FREE PEER-TO-PEER

MUSIC AND VIDEO SERVICES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CURRENTLY RETAINS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BY OFFERING SUPERIOR INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE ENTIRE SOLUTION INCLUDING THE HARDWARE (PERSONAL COMPUTER, IPOD, AND IPHONE), SOFTWARE (ITUNES), AND

DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT (ITUNES STORE AND ITUNES WI-FI MUSIC STORE). HOWEVER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPETITION IN THIS SPACE TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO TIGHTLY INTEGRATING THESE ELEMENTS WITHIN THEIR

OWN OFFERINGS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE INTEGRATED THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. SOME OF THESE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS TO COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS OFFERINGS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES INCLUDING THE IPHONE. THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH SEVERAL LARGE, WELL-FUNDED, AND EXPERIENCED COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY FACES COMPETITION FROM MOBILE

COMMUNICATION DEVICE COMPANIES THAT MAY ATTEMPT TO IMITATE SOME OF THE IPHONES FUNCTIONS AND APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN SMART PHONES. THIS INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, EVOLVING

DESIGN APPROACHES AND TECHNOLOGIES, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND OFFER NEW INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN EACH OF ITS MARKETS.

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, ENCLOSURES, CERTAIN LCDS, CERTAIN OPTICAL DRIVES, AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

(ASICS) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, WHICH SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY OF THESE AND OTHER KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO NAND FLASH MEMORY, DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (DRAM), AND CERTAIN LCDS, ARE SUBJECT AT TIMES TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO

CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SUPPLY OF KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND LCDS AT FAVORABLE PRICING, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, UPON EXPIRATION OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY

SHORTAGES AND/OR PRICE INCREASES THAT CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY AND OTHER

PARTICIPANTS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME

CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE

COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED. IF THE

COMPANYS SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, IF SUCH COMPONENTS WERE AVAILABLE ONLY AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES, OR IF A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED

PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO

OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS DECIDED

TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS.

SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE

COMPANYS MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS, IPHONES, LOGIC BOARDS, AND OTHER ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, PRIMARILY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF THIS OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY

PERFORMED BY ONLY A FEW OF THE COMPANYS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS AND MANUFACTURING OUTSOURCING FOR MANY OF THE COMPANYS KEY

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS, IPHONES AND MOST OF THE COMPANYS IMACS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON

MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANYS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR

PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE COMPANY COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY LIMITED, ASUSTEK CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., ATHEROS COMMUNICATIONS INC., AU

OPTRONICS CORPORATION, BROADCOM CORPORATION, CHI MEI OPTOELECTRONICS CORPORATION, CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION, HITACHI GLOBAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES, HON HAI PRECISION INDUSTRY CO., LTD., INFINEON TECHNOLOGIES AG, INTEL CORPORATION, INVENTEC

APPLIANCES CORPORATION, LG DISPLAY, LSI CORPORATION, MATSUSHITA, MURATA MANUFACTURING CO., LTD., NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION, NVIDIA CORP., INC., QUANTA COMPUTER, INC., RENESAS SEMICONDUCTOR CO. LTD., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, SONY CORPORATION,

SYNAPTICS, INC., TEXAS INSTRUMENTS, AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON

ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUAL AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE AREAS OF COMPUTER

HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS, MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, SYSTEM SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS, AND INTERNET SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY MAY EXPAND THE

RANGE OF ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THROUGH LICENSING AND/OR ACQUISITION OF THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOTALED $1.1 BILLION, $782 MILLION, AND $712 MILLION

IN 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, IPODS, IPHONE, PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED, AND/OR HAS

APPLIED TO REGISTER, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE U.S. AND A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR APPLE, THE APPLE LOGO, MACINTOSH, MAC, IPOD, ITUNES, ITUNES STORE,

IPHONE, APPLE TV, MOBILEME AND NUMEROUS OTHER TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS

BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES DEPEND IN PART ON THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF, THE COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE, AND MARKETING ABILITIES OF ITS PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY FILES PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT INVENTIONS ARISING FROM ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND IS CURRENTLY PURSUING THOUSANDS OF PATENT

APPLICATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. OVER TIME, THE COMPANY HAS ACCUMULATED A PORTFOLIO OF SEVERAL THOUSAND ISSUED PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. NO SINGLE PATENT OR COPYRIGHT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS THAT IT HAS BEEN GRANTED IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF ITS

PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE, AND SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO

SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS; HOWEVER,

THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH LICENSES COULD BE OBTAINED AT ALL. BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER, DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER AND MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW

PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE

INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE U.S. REPRESENTS THE COMPANYS LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY 57% OF THE COMPANYS NET SALES IN 2008 CAME FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS INSIDE

THE U.S. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN CALIFORNIA, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA (KOREA), THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF

CHINA (CHINA) AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, THE SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN THE U.S., CHINA, JAPAN, KOREA, MALAYSIA, PHILIPPINES, TAIWAN, THAILAND, AND

SINGAPORE. SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK PRO, MACBOOK, MACBOOK AIR, IPODS, IPHONE, AND MOST OF THE COMPANYS IMACS. MARGINS ON

SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

INFORMATION REGARDING FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 8

OF THIS FORM 10-K AND IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT NOTE 9, SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA.

SEASONAL BUSINESS

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN ITS FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR DUE

TO SEASONAL DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. THIS HISTORICAL PATTERN SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY

ON MOST OF ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS AND IPHONES. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORIGINAL END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION,

CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE THE APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN, WHICH EXTENDS SERVICE COVERAGE ON MANY OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS

FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG OFTEN INCREASES IN ANTICIPATION OF OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AS DEALERS ANTICIPATE SHORTAGES. BACKLOG IS OFTEN REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN

SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND

FOREIGN LAWS ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TO DATE HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN THE FUTURE, THESE LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN

SOME INSTANCES, THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN

SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS COUNTRIES WITHIN EUROPE AND ASIA, CERTAIN CANADIAN PROVINCES, AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE

FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS POSES A RISK AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES MAY POSTPONE SPENDING IN RESPONSE TO

TIGHTER CREDIT, NEGATIVE FINANCIAL NEWS AND/OR DECLINES IN INCOME OR ASSET VALUES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEMAND COULD ALSO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS

EXPECTATIONS SINCE THE COMPANY GENERALLY RAISES PRICES ON GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD OUTSIDE THE U.S. TO OFFSET THE EFFECT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, A TREND WHICH HAS BEEN VERY PRONOUNCED RECENTLY. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD INFLUENCE

DEMAND INCLUDE CONTINUING INCREASES IN FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, CONDITIONS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE MARKETS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, ACCESS TO CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING CONSUMER

SPENDING BEHAVIOR. THESE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE CURRENT FINANCIAL TURMOIL AFFECTING THE BANKING SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY CONSOLIDATE OR GO OUT OF

BUSINESS HAVE RESULTED IN A TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, A LOW LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IN MANY FINANCIAL MARKETS, AND EXTREME VOLATILITY IN FIXED INCOME, CREDIT, CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKETS. THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF FOLLOW-ON

EFFECTS FROM THE CREDIT CRISIS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING INSOLVENCY OF KEY SUPPLIERS RESULTING IN PRODUCT DELAYS; INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE PURCHASES OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND/OR CUSTOMER, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNER, INSOLVENCIES; AND FAILURE OF DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE COMPANYS TREASURY OPERATIONS. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

COULD ALSO VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RELATED TO DEBT SECURITIES AS WELL AS EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS; INTEREST RATES; CASH BALANCES; AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS. THE CURRENT VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OVERALL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY INCREASES THE RISK THAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS REALIZED IN THE FUTURE ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD DIFFER

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FAIR VALUES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THEM.

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO CONTINUE TO INCREASE

THE VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE.

THE MATTERS RELATING TO THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND THE RESTATEMENT OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION.

THE FINDINGS FROM THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATION INTO ITS PAST

STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES AND THE RESULTING RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 (THE 2006 FORM 10-K) HAVE EXPOSED THE COMPANY TO

GREATER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEVERAL DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS AND A CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT HAVE BEEN FILED IN

STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERTAINING TO ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED THE RESULTS OF ITS INVESTIGATION TO THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC) AND THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, AND THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO THEIR REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ITS FULL COOPERATION.

ON APRIL 24, 2007, THE SEC FILED AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST TWO FORMER OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. IN

ANNOUNCING THE LAWSUIT, THE SEC STATED THAT IT WOULD NOT BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY BASED IN PART ON THE COMPANYS SWIFT, EXTENSIVE, AND EXTRAORDINARY COOPERATION IN THE COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION.

ACCORDING TO THE SECS STATEMENT, THE COMPANYS COOPERATION CONSISTED OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROMPT SELF-REPORTING, AN INDEPENDENT INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, THE SHARING OF THE RESULTS OF THAT INVESTIGATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW CONTROLS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF FRAUDULENT CONDUCT. THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST EACH OF THESE FORMER OFFICERS HAVE NOW BEEN SETTLED.

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN REGARDING THE OUTCOMES FROM LITIGATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THESE AND RELATED MATTERS HAVE REQUIRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, THE COMPANY TO INCUR

SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES FOR LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. IF THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO ADVERSE FINDINGS, IT COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES AND

PENALTIES AND MIGHT FACE ADDITIONAL REMEDIES THAT COULD HARM ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

GLOBAL MARKETS FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS,

DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES, MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, AND RELATED PERIPHERALS AND SERVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE MARKETS, ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN GLOBAL MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CHARACTERIZED BY

AGGRESSIVE PRICE CUTTING, WITH ITS RESULTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID

ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF NEW INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT DESIGNS AND DEVELOPS NEARLY THE ENTIRE SOLUTION

FOR ITS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, SEVERAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND RELATED SERVICES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT AND AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS AND HAS REGISTERED AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER NUMEROUS PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. BY CONTRAST, MANY OF THE COMPANYS

COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE PRIMARILY THROUGH AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE MARGINS OR IF OTHER COMPANIES

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFRINGE ON THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AND HAVE A

MATERIALLY ADVERSE AFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS, THE COMPANY FACES A

SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BROADER PRODUCT LINES, LOWER PRICED PRODUCTS, AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES. CONSOLIDATION IN THIS MARKET HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS. PRICE COMPETITION HAS

BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS SELLING WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED PRODUCT MARGINS. THE COMPANY ALSO FACES INCREASED COMPETITION IN KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, SMB, EDUCATION,

ENTERPRISE, GOVERNMENT, AND CREATIVE MARKETS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANYS EXISTING

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY AUTHORIZED MAKER OF HARDWARE USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS USING COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY WINDOWS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE MAC

PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES. USE OF UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF THE MAC OS ON OTHER COMPANIES HARDWARE PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS, AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON CERTAIN MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, SUCH AS IPHONE;

CONSUMER ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING THE IPOD FAMILY OF DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS, AND DIGITAL CONTENT DISTRIBUTION. THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND OTHER

RESOURCES, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS. THE COMPANY HAS ONLY RECENTLY ENTERED THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET, AND MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS IN THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER EXPERIENCE, PRODUCT BREADTH, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES WITH ILLEGITIMATE WAYS TO OBTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT. BECAUSE SOME CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND

EXPERIENCE AND A LOWER COST STRUCTURE, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH

TO PROVIDING THESE COMPONENTS SEAMLESSLY WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND,

THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW AND UPGRADED PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS

OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES, THE

AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND COSTS TO MEET

ANTICIPATED DEMAND, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS ON ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSET RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR PRODUCT AND COMPONENT INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR EXCEED ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND ACCRUES

NECESSARY CANCELLATION FEE RESERVES FOR ORDERS OF EXCESS PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, IT RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY, ASSET, AND RELATED PROVISIONS ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, NO

ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT, GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL INVENTORY OR ASSET RELATED

CHARGES. SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD, AND COULD HAVE, A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY MUST

ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SHIPMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN

ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR 30 TO 150 DAYS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND

PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND ORDER OR PRODUCE EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND COULD BE

IN THE FUTURE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND LCDS AT FAVORABLE PRICES AND IN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OBTAINS CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, ENCLOSURES, CERTAIN LCDS,

CERTAIN OPTICAL DRIVES, AND ASICS, FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY OF THESE AND OTHER KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO NAND

FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND CERTAIN LCDS, ARE SUBJECT AT TIMES TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO

MICROPROCESSORS, NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND LCDS AT FAVORABLE PRICING, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, UPON EXPIRATION OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN FAVORABLE

PRICING IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND/OR PRICE INCREASES THAT CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EXPERIENCE

DECREASES IN ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AS COMPARED TO LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING 2008 AND 2007, DUE LARGELY TO THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING ON NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE HIGHER

COST STRUCTURES, BOTH EXPECTED AND POTENTIAL FUTURE COST INCREASES FOR KEY COMPONENTS, AND HIGHER LOGISTICAL COSTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REFER TO PART II, ITEM 7, MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, UNDER THE SUBHEADING GROSS MARGIN, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE COMPANY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS

IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT

COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS OR MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A

NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT

ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT

FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, IF SUCH COMPONENTS WERE AVAILABLE ONLY AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES, OR IF A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON COMPONENT AND PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICAL

SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

MOST OF THE COMPANYS COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN

WHOLE OR IN PART BY A FEW THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. MANY OF THESE MANUFACTURERS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., AND ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER OPERATING COSTS,

THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANYS DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE COMPANYS FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO

CHANGING CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO ADHERE TO THE COMPANYS SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT. ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE

COMPANY MAY REMAIN RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

FINAL ASSEMBLY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IS

CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN CALIFORNIA, KOREA, CHINA AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, THE SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED

THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN THE U.S., CHINA, JAPAN, KOREA, MALAYSIA, PHILIPPINES, TAIWAN, THAILAND AND SINGAPORE. SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

MACBOOK PRO, MACBOOK, MACBOOK AIR, IPODS, IPHONES AND MOST OF THE COMPANYS IMACS. IF MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, MILITARY

ACTIONS OR ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL ISSUES, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH THE COMPANYS ITUNES STORE. THE COMPANY PAYS SUBSTANTIAL FEES TO OBTAIN THE

RIGHTS TO AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT. THE COMPANYS LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE SHORT-TERM AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE CONTINUATION OR RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. SOME THIRD-PARTY CONTENT

PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OR IN THE FUTURE MAY OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE THEIR CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. OTHER CONTENT OWNERS, PROVIDERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAY

SEEK TO LIMIT THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO, OR INCREASE THE TOTAL COST OF, SUCH CONTENT. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTENT AT REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC

REACH, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS REQUIRE THAT

THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT (DRM) AND OTHER SECURITY SOLUTIONS. IF THESE REQUIREMENTS CHANGE, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE THESE SOLUTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE

COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED OR MAY PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DRM, WHICH COULD LESSEN THE

PROTECTION OF CONTENT AND SUBJECT IT TO PIRACY AND ALSO COULD AFFECT ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMPANYS CONTENT PROVIDERS.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON

ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND IN THE FUTURE THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING

TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY

LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND

MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE THE PATENTS OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING SUCH RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF MERIT, RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS CAN CONSUME SIGNIFICANT TIME AND

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPENSE. AT PRESENT, THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING MORE THAN 21 PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES, 13 OF WHICH WERE FILED DURING FISCAL 2008, AND SEVERAL

PENDING CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT

LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IF THE COMPANY IS FOUND TO BE INFRINGING SUCH RIGHTS, IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES. IF THERE IS A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR A

SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRES IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A THIRD PARTY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT CAN DEVELOP

NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY. WHILE IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY KNOWN CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, THE RESULTS OF SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL

IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WITH THE JUNE 2007 INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE, THE COMPANY HAS BEGUN TO COMPETE WITH MOBILE

COMMUNICATION DEVICE COMPANIES THAT HOLD SIGNIFICANT PATENT PORTFOLIOS. REGARDLESS OF THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF SUCH PATENTS OR THE MERITS OF ANY POTENTIAL PATENT CLAIMS BY COMPETITORS, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED

LITIGATION, ENTER INTO EXPENSIVE AGREEMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS AND/OR MODIFY ITS PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED

AND MAINTAINED FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY

CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ITS MACS, IPODS AND IPHONES, ARE OFTEN BASED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WILL

CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL, AND DISCONTINUANCE OR DELAY OF THESE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

WITH RESPECT TO ITS MAC PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

SERVICES DEPENDS IN PART ON THE DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COMPARED TO WINDOWS-BASED PRODUCTS. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED

ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF MAC OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. IF THE

COMPANYS MINORITY SHARE OF THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET CAUSES DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANYS PROSPECTS, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO

DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. THE COMPANYS DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS, SUCH AS

MICROSOFT, ADOBE, AND GOOGLE, TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. MAC OS X LEOPARD, WHICH BECAME AVAILABLE IN OCTOBER 2007, INCLUDES A NEW FEATURE THAT ENABLES INTEL-BASED

MAC SYSTEMS TO RUN MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP AND WINDOWS VISTA OPERATING SYSTEMS. THIS FEATURE MAY DETER DEVELOPERS FROM CREATING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR MAC OS X IF SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORM.

WITH RESPECT TO IPHONE AND IPOD TOUCH, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPELLING AND INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. AS WITH

APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS, THE AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE APPLICATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON DEVELOPERS PERCEPTIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS RATHER

THAN ITS COMPETITORS, INCLUDING DEVICES THAT USE COMPETING PLATFORMS. IF DEVELOPERS FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THESE COMPETING PLATFORMS, THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS DEVICES MAY SUFFER.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED

SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND

MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE SOFTWARES INTENDED OPERATION. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, HARM

TO REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSES, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

THE

COMPANYS PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANYS SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS.

GROSS MARGINS ON THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS VARY ACROSS PRODUCT LINES AND CAN CHANGE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, PRICING AND CONFIGURATION CHANGES, AND COMPONENT, WARRANTY, AND OTHER COST FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANYS

DIRECT SALES GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED GROSS MARGINS THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES THROUGH ITS CHANNEL PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, NEW PRODUCTS, COMPONENT COST INCREASES, OR PRICE COMPETITION. THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED GREATER NET SALES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS COMPARED

TO THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS FROM TIME-TO-TIME DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER THAN

IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANYS KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS

SUPPLY, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., THE COMPANY RELIES ON A SINGLE CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIER TO PROVIDE SERVICE FOR IPHONE.

IN THE U.S., U.K., FRANCE,

GERMANY, SPAIN, IRELAND, AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY HAS CONTRACTED WITH A SINGLE CARRIER TO PROVIDE CELLULAR NETWORK SERVICES FOR IPHONE ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS. IF THESE EXCLUSIVE CARRIERS CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH OTHER CARRIERS

IN THEIR MARKETS FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE QUALITY AND COVERAGE OF WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES, PERFORMANCE AND TIMELY BUILD-OUT OF ADVANCED WIRELESS NETWORKS, AND PRICING AND OTHER TERMS OF CONDITIONS OF END-USER

CONTRACTS, OR IF THESE EXCLUSIVE CARRIERS FAIL TO PROMOTE IPHONE AGGRESSIVELY OR FAVOR OTHER HANDSETS IN THEIR PROMOTION AND SALES ACTIVITIES OR SERVICE PLANS, SALES MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY-IMPOSED STANDARDS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES IN THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES ARE EXTENSIVE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. SUCH CHANGES,

WHICH COULD INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF THE DEVICE, LOCKING THE DEVICE TO A CARRIERS NETWORK, OR MANDATING THE USE OF THE DEVICE ON MORE THAN ONE CARRIERS NETWORK,

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, SUCH AS IPHONE, ARE

SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AND STANDARDIZATION BODIES, AS WELL AS BY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS FOR USE ON THEIR NETWORKS. THESE CERTIFICATION PROCESSES ARE EXTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND COULD RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT DATES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, NETWORK DISRUPTIONS AND BREACHES IN DATA

SECURITY.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, NETWORK DISRUPTIONS AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS BY

CAUSING DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNER, ORDERS, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE COMPANYS ONLINE OFFERINGS AND SERVICES, IMPEDING THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS, PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS AND REPORTING FINANCIAL

RESULTS, RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR COMPANY INFORMATION, OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPANYS REPUTATION. WHILE MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BY IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL

CONTROL MEASURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR DATA SECURITY BREACH WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILE.

THE

COMPANYS STOCK HAS AT TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS, OR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE ALSO HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THESE COMPANIES OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS STOCK PRICE REFLECTS HIGH FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS ITS STOCK PRICE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE.

POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

WAR, TERRORISM, GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL

COMMERCE AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THUS COULD HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS, LOGISTICS PROVIDERS, MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

INTERRUPTION BY NATURAL DISASTERS, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE

IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. SHOULD MAJOR

PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING PANDEMICS, ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN

REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE

HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOES NOT CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR

DIRECT QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES AND SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME COULD BE REQUIRED TO RESUME OPERATIONS, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE.

THE COMPANYS SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CEO, ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AND KEY EMPLOYEES IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS.

EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE MOST OF THE COMPANYS KEY EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THE COMPANY HAS RELIED ON EQUITY AWARDS

AS ONE MEANS FOR RECRUITING AND RETAINING THIS HIGHLY SKILLED TALENT. ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WHICH HAS CAUSED THE COMPANY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

STOCK-BASED AWARDS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL. ADDITIONALLY, SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE VOLATILITY IN THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE COULD RESULT IN A STOCK OPTIONS

EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDING THE UNDERLYING STOCKS MARKET VALUE OR A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) GRANTED, THUS LESSENING THE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFECTIVENESS OF RETAINING EMPLOYEES THROUGH STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN

KEY PERSONNEL.

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS AND ARE NOT YET RESOLVED AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS

MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE. RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. REGARDLESS OF ITS MERIT, LITIGATION MAY BE BOTH TIME-CONSUMING AND DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF

MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. IN RECOGNITION OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO MATERIAL SETTLEMENTS. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN CERTAIN MATTERS, OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME

REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANY MAY BE FACED WITH SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST IT THAT WOULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT A PORTION OF ITS BUSINESS AND MIGHT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A LARGE AND GROWING PORTION OF ITS REVENUE AND EARNINGS FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS

COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR

VERSUS LOCAL CURRENCIES. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA, AS WELL AS NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKENING OF FOREIGN

CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, AND GENERALLY WILL LEAD THE COMPANY TO RAISE INTERNATIONAL PRICING, POTENTIALLY REDUCING DEMAND

FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, DUE TO COMPETITION OR OTHER REASONS, THE COMPANY MAY DECIDE NOT TO RAISE LOCAL PRICES TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE DOLLARS STRENGTHENING, OR AT ALL, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S.

DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHILE GENERALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, COULD CAUSE THE

COMPANY TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL PRICING, THEREBY LIMITING THE BENEFIT. AS STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COMPANYS COST OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS DENOMINATED IN THOSE CURRENCIES.

THE COMPANY HAS USED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, TO HEDGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET ANY OR MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE LIMITED TIME THE HEDGES ARE IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL BUSINESS HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES.

THROUGH SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD OPENED 247 RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES HAVE REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL

FIXED INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH TERMS RANGING FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY

OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS. CERTAIN STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS

AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. DUE TO THE HIGH FIXED COST STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT, A DECLINE IN SALES OR THE CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF

INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIPLE STORES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEASE TERMINATION COSTS, WRITE-OFFS OF EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND SEVERANCE COSTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, POSE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENTS FUTURE RESULTS, CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS THE COMPANYS INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE

CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION, INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS, FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS, MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF RETAIL INVENTORY, AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS AND PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY INVEST, IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ACQUISITIONS. SUCH ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,

INCLUDING DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM CURRENT OPERATIONS, INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY, INADEQUATE RETURN OF CAPITAL, AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANYS DUE

DILIGENCE. BECAUSE THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS, CARRIERS, AND OTHER RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, AND CATALOGUERS, MANY OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE

PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END-USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL

STORES. IPHONE IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE COMPANY, ITS CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS.

MANY

RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SOME RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS AS

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. SUCH A PERCEPTION COULD DISCOURAGE RESELLERS FROM INVESTING RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKENS, IF RESELLERS STOPPED DISTRIBUTING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING

SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS AND IMPROVING PRODUCT PLACEMENT DISPLAYS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED ANY MATERIAL LOSSES ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, FUTURE DECLINES IN THEIR MARKET VALUES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. GIVEN THE GLOBAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTMENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO IS OFTEN CONCENTRATED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, WHICH HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE RECENT MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. CREDIT RATINGS AND PRICING OF THESE INVESTMENTS CAN BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LIQUIDITY, CREDIT DETERIORATION OR

LOSSES, FINANCIAL RESULTS, OR OTHER FACTORS. AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COULD DECLINE AND RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY

AGREEMENTS. THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE

RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES RESULTING FROM THE SALE BY THE COMPANY OF COMPONENTS TO VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE

COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES, ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE MAY

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN A PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS COUNTRIES WITHIN EUROPE AND ASIA, CERTAIN CANADIAN PROVINCES AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS BASED ON THE NATURE

OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR

THEIR INTERPRETATION. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE

EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COVERAGE OF INSURANCE.

FOR CERTAIN RISKS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR AVAILABILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS SOME PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE

RISKS, AND IN SOME CASES SELF-INSURES COMPLETELY, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

NEEDED TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS DISCUSSED BELOW, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND

CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY RESOLVED AND THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD

INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL

MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY SETTLED CERTAIN MATTERS DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 THAT DID NOT INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS TO CONSUMER, SMB, EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE, GOVERNMENT

AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS THAT GREATLY ENHANCE THEIR EVOLVING DIGITAL LIFESTYLES. THE COMPANY IS THE ONLY PARTICIPANT IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES THAT CONTROLS THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENTIRE PERSONAL COMPUTER,

INCLUDING THE HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, AND SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AS WELL AS THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS, MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, AND A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS FOR OBTAINING AND

ENJOYING DIGITAL CONTENT. THE COMPANY IS THEREFORE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO OFFER SUPERIOR AND WELL-INTEGRATED DIGITAL LIFESTYLE PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS, WHICH ARE FURTHER ENHANCED BY THE COMPANYS EMPHASIS ON EASE-OF-USE AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIAL

DESIGNS.

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, INCLUDING PERSONAL COMPUTERS WITH ITS MAC LINE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS WITH ITS IPOD PRODUCT FAMILIES, MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS WITH IPHONE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH ITS ONLINE ITUNES STORE. WHILE THE COMPANY IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A LEADING INNOVATOR IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MARKETS AS WELL AS A LEADER IN THE EMERGING MARKET FOR DISTRIBUTION OF DIGITAL CONTENT, THESE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE PRICING. TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT INCREASED

INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN OR EXPAND ITS POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE IT COMPETES. THE COMPANYS R&D SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON FURTHER DEVELOPING ITS EXISTING MAC LINE OF

PERSONAL COMPUTERS, ITS OPERATING SYSTEM, APPLICATION SOFTWARE, IPHONE AND IPODS; DEVELOPING NEW DIGITAL LIFESTYLE CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS; AND INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT AREAS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES

INCREASED INVESTMENT IN MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS IS CRITICAL TO INCREASING PRODUCT AND BRAND AWARENESS.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF DIRECT

AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF ITS INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE ENHANCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE SALESPERSONS WHO CAN CONVEY THE VALUE OF THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERAL INTEGRATION, DEMONSTRATE

THE UNIQUE DIGITAL LIFESTYLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ONLY ON MAC COMPUTERS, AND DEMONSTRATE THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE MAC WITH THE WINDOWS PLATFORM AND NETWORKS. THE COMPANY FURTHER BELIEVES PROVIDING A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND AFTER-SALES SUPPORT

EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING NEW AND RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS. TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY BUYING EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN WHICH SERVICE AND EDUCATION ARE EMPHASIZED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE ITS DISTRIBUTION

CAPABILITIES BY OPENING ITS OWN RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE COMPANY HAD 247 STORES OPEN AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008.

THE COMPANY

HAS ALSO INVESTED IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING THE APPLE SALES CONSULTANT PROGRAM, WHICH PLACES APPLE EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS AT SELECTED THIRD-PARTY RESELLER LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES PROVIDING DIRECT CONTACT WITH ITS

TARGETED CUSTOMERS IS AN EFFICIENT WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF ITS MAC COMPUTERS AND OTHER PRODUCTS OVER THOSE OF ITS COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND THROUGH ITS

DIRECT SALES FORCE.

THE COMPANYS IPODS ARE SOLD THROUGH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DISTRIBUTION POINTS TO PROVIDE BROAD ACCESS. IPODS CAN BE PURCHASED

IN CERTAIN DEPARTMENT STORES, MEMBER-ONLY WAREHOUSE STORES, LARGE RETAIL CHAINS, AND SPECIALTY RETAIL STORES, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE CHANNELS FOR MAC DISTRIBUTION LISTED ABOVE.

IPHONE IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE COMPANY, ITS CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNED MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS CELLULAR NETWORK

CARRIERS AUTHORIZING THEM TO DISTRIBUTE AND PROVIDE CELLULAR NETWORK SERVICES FOR IPHONE 3G IN OVER 70 COUNTRIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT EXCLUSIVE WITH A SPECIFIC CARRIER, EXCEPT IN THE U.S., U.K., FRANCE, GERMANY, SPAIN, IRELAND, AND

CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO SHIP IPHONE 3G IN OVER 70 COUNTRIES BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2008.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND

ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THE

COMPANYS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE

AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND

SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANYS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE

RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, WARRANTY COSTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL BECAUSE

THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANYS SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS

REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, MUSIC PRODUCTS, DIGITAL CONTENT,

PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE), OR ANY PRODUCT THAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SOFTWARE-RELATED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE IN

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) NO. 03-5,

APPLICABILITY OF AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 97-2 TO NON-SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINING MORE-THAN-INCIDENTAL SOFTWARE

, (E.G., MAC COMPUTERS, IPOD PORTABLE

DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS AND IPHONE) PURSUANT TO AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED. FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT

SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE-RELATED, (E.G., DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE AND CERTAIN MAC, IPOD AND IPHONE SUPPLIES AND ACCESSORIES), THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT

EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER

RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT TO BE, FIXED OR DETERMINABLE,

REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE AND ALL OTHER CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET.

FOR BOTH

APPLE TV AND IPHONE, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT FROM TIME-TO-TIME IT MAY PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED FEATURES AND ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. THEREFORE, SALES OF APPLE TV AND IPHONE HANDSETS ARE RECOGNIZED UNDER

SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP NO. 97-2. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE AND COST OF GOODS SOLD ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED 24-MONTH ECONOMIC LIVES OF THESE PRODUCTS, WITH ANY LOSS

RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE. COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ENGINEERING, SALES, MARKETING, AND WARRANTY ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE COMPANY RECORDS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE

PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. THE COMPANYS POLICY

REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER

OF THE DATE AT

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE

PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT

IN ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE

AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM ITS

CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK. IN ADDITION, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN

AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA AND BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANYS DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY

BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT-RISK-SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY

COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE CREDIT WORTHINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THOSE SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY RECORDS

AN ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES TO THE AMOUNT THAT IT REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR ALL OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH BAD

DEBTS, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND THE AGING OF SUCH RECEIVABLES. IF THERE IS A DETERIORATION OF A MAJOR CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL CONDITION, IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE

OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT-WORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON TRADE RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL

ACCOUNTS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH FISCAL QUARTER THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE

FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND

UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.

THE COMPANY ACCRUES RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND

SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION

FEES THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WARRANTY COSTS

THE

COMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC

PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS

SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SOP NO. 97-2, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR

REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY PROVIDES UPDATES TO ITS APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO MAINTAIN THE SOFTWARES COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS. THE ESTIMATED COST TO DEVELOP SUCH UPDATES IS ACCOUNTED FOR

AS WARRANTY COST THAT IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME RELATED SOFTWARE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS RELATED TO SUCH UPDATES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF UNITS DELIVERED, THE NUMBER OF UPDATES EXPECTED TO OCCUR,

AND THE HISTORICAL COST AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COST OF THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THESE UPDATES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123 (REVISED 2004),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE AWARDS FAIR-VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON (BSM) OPTION-PRICING

MODEL AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL REQUIRES VARIOUS JUDGMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, FORFEITURE RATES, AND EXPECTED OPTION LIFE.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED IN THE FUTURE.

INCOME

TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE

INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. EFFECTIVE AT

THE BEGINNING OF 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FINANCIAL INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXESAN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

. FURTHER INFORMATION MAY BE FOUND IN NOTE 5,

INCOME TAXES IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE

EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF FIN 48 AND OTHER COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH

MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IN NOTE 8 COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

,

THE COMPANY RECORDS A CONTINGENT LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE

LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

NET SALES

FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2007 SPANNED 52 WEEKS WHILE FISCAL YEAR 2006 SPANNED 53 WEEKS. AN ADDITIONAL WEEK IS

FISCAL YEAR 2008 VERSUS 2007

NET SALES DURING 2008 INCREASED 35% OR $8.5 BILLION FROM 2007. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE INCREASES INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



MAC NET SALES INCREASED $4.0 BILLION OR 38% DURING 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, WHILE MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 2.7 MILLION UNITS OR 38%. NET SALES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS MAC SHIPMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR 44% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL NET REVENUE. HIGHER MAC UNIT SALES, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASES IN NET SALES, WERE DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES OF ALL OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE

POPULARITY OF THE IMAC, WHICH EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 62% OF THE COMPANYS PERSONAL COMPUTER

SHIPMENTS IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS BOTH INCREASED BY 38% DURING 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THIS GROWTH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR ALL THE PORTABLE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY THE

MACBOOK, WHICH HAD DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND THE ADDITION OF THE MACBOOK AIR, WHICH WAS INTRODUCED TO THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCT LINE IN JANUARY 2008. GROWTH OF THE COMPANYS DESKTOP

SYSTEMS WAS ALSO STRONG, WITH INCREASED NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF 39% AND 37%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2008 DUE PRIMARILY TO STRONG SALES OF THE IMAC IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS.



NET SALES OF IPODS INCREASED $848 MILLION OR 10% DURING 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WHEREAS UNIT SALES OF IPODS INCREASED 6% COMPARED TO 2007. THE IPOD UNIT GROWTH WAS

DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR THE IPOD TOUCH, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER UNIT SALES OF THE IPOD SHUFFLE DUE TO A PRICE REDUCTION IN FEBRUARY 2008. IPOD NET SALES GREW FASTER THAN IPOD UNIT SALES DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES CAUSED BY A SHIFT

IN OVERALL IPOD PRODUCT MIX TO THE HIGHER PRICED IPOD TOUCH.



NET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $1.8 BILLION FOR 2008, WITH IPHONE HANDSET UNIT SALES TOTALING 11.6 MILLION. DURING 2008, SALES OF IPHONE

EXPANDED BEYOND THE U.S. AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE SHIPPING IPHONES IN OVER 70 COUNTRIES BY THE END OF DECEMBER 2008. NET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $123 MILLION IN 2007, WHICH REPRESENTED SALES FOR ONE FISCAL

QUARTER. IPHONE NET SALES INCLUDE THE PORTION OF HANDSET REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING OVER THE PRODUCTS 24-MONTH ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE, AS WELL AS REVENUE FROM SALES OF IPHONE ACCESSORIES AND FROM CARRIER

AGREEMENTS.



NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $844 MILLION OR 34% DURING THE 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, DUE PRIMARILY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED NET

SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE IN EACH OF THE COMPANYS GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS SUCCESS IS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, THE EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO

CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND RENT VIA THE ITUNES STORE, AND THE LAUNCH OF THE ITUNES APP STORE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS ITUNES CONTENT OFFERINGS AROUND THE WORLD.



NET SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE INCREASED $399 MILLION OR 32% COMPARED TO 2007 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN WIRELESS NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND OTHER HARDWARE

ACCESSORIES, INCLUDING PRINTERS AND SCANNERS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS



NET SALES OF SOFTWARE, SERVICE, AND OTHER SALES ROSE $699 MILLION OR 46% DURING 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THIS GROWTH WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO INCREASED SALES OF

APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND INCREASED NET SALES OF APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN (APP) EXTENDED SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS.

FISCAL YEAR 2007 VERSUS 2006

NET SALES DURING 2007 INCREASED

24% OR $4.7 BILLION FROM 2006 EVEN THOUGH FISCAL YEAR 2007 SPANNED 52 WEEKS WHILE FISCAL YEAR 2006 SPANNED 53 WEEKS. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE INCREASES INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



MAC NET SALES INCREASED $3 BILLION OR 40% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, WHILE MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 1.75 MILLION UNITS OR 33%. THE 33% MAC UNIT SALES

GROWTH RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE ESTIMATED GROWTH RATE OF THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY DURING THAT TIMEFRAME. UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 62% OF THE COMPANYS PERSONAL COMPUTER

SHIPMENTS IN 2007, UP FROM 54% IN 2006. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCREASED 55% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THIS GROWTH WAS DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR THE MACBOOK, WHICH INCREASED IN EACH

OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS THE MACBOOK PRO, WHICH INCREASED IN EACH OPERATING SEGMENT EXCEPT JAPAN. MAC DESKTOP NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 21% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2007 DUE TO STRONGER SALES OF THE IMAC

IN EACH OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE MAC DESKTOP NET SALES GROWTH WAS GREATER THAN THE UNIT SALES GROWTH DUE PRIMARILY TO A SHIFT IN DESKTOP PRODUCT MIX AWAY FROM THE LOWER-PRICE MAC MINI AND DISCONTINUED EMAC AND TOWARD THE IMAC.



NET SALES OF IPODS INCREASED $629 MILLION OR 8% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. UNIT SALES OF IPODS INCREASED 31% COMPARED TO 2006. THE IPOD GROWTH WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY INCREASED SALES OF THE IPOD SHUFFLE AND IPOD NANO PARTICULARLY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IPOD UNIT SALES GROWTH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN IPOD NET SALES DUE TO A SHIFT IN OVERALL IPOD PRODUCT MIX, AS WELL AS DUE TO LOWER SELLING

PRICES FOR THE IPOD CLASSIC, IPOD NANO AND IPOD SHUFFLE IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006.



NET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $123 MILLION IN 2007. IPHONE NET SALES INCLUDE THE PORTION OF IPHONE HANDSET REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING OVER THE PRODUCTS 24-MONTH ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE, AS WELL AS SALES OF IPHONE ACCESSORY PRODUCTS AND REVENUE FROM CARRIER AGREEMENTS. IPHONE UNIT SALES WERE 1.39 MILLION IN 2007.



NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $611 MILLION OR 32% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS GROWTH WAS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING DIGITAL CONTENT AND THE EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE VIA THE ITUNES STORE.



NET SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE INCREASED $160 MILLION OR 15% COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN WIRELESS NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND OTHER HARDWARE

ACCESSORIES, INCLUDING PRINTERS AND SCANNERS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS.



NET SALES OF SOFTWARE, SERVICE, AND OTHER SALES ROSE $229 MILLION OR 18% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THIS GROWTH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED NET SALES

OF APP EXTENDED SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND INCREASED SALES OF APPLE BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMERICAS

DURING

2008, NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED $3.0 BILLION OR 26% COMPARED TO 2007. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THIS GROWTH WERE THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN SALES OF THE IPOD TOUCH, MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS, CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES STORE,

AND IPHONE. THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIPPING IPHONE IN JUNE 2007 AND THE GROWTH IN IPHONE SALES IN 2008 RESULTED FROM A FULL YEAR OF IPHONE SHIPMENTS. THE INCREASE IN MAC NET SALES OF $1.3 BILLION OR 30% AND MAC UNIT SALES OF 961 MILLION OR 32% IS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN ALL OF THE MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY THE MACBOOK, AND HIGHER SALES OF THE IMAC. NET SALES OF IPODS INCREASED DUE TO A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD HIGHER PRICED IPODS, PARTICULARLY THE IPOD TOUCH, WHICH WAS UPGRADED

IN JUNE 2008. IN 2008, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED 45% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED TO 48% IN THE SAME PERIOD OF 2007. DURING 2008, U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL NET SALES AND MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 14% AND 19%, RESPECTIVELY,

A SHIFT IN DESKTOP PRODUCT MIX AWAY FROM THE MAC MINI AND DISCONTINUED EMAC AS WELL AS THE STRONG RECEPTION OF THE NEW IMAC INTRODUCED IN AUGUST 2007. SALES OF IPODS GREW DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR THE IPOD NANO AND IPOD SHUFFLE AND THE

INTRODUCTION OF THE IPOD TOUCH IN SEPTEMBER 2007. DURING 2007, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED 48% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED TO 49% IN THE SAME PERIOD OF 2006. DURING 2007, U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL NET SALES AND MAC UNIT SALES

EUROPE

FOR 2008, NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN EUROPE INCREASED 40%

AND 39%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2007. THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THIS GROWTH WERE STRONG SALES OF MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS AND IMAC, INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE, AND IPHONE. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WERE

2008. MAC DESKTOP SALES ALSO INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO THE POPULARITY OF THE IMAC, WHICH WAS UPDATED IN APRIL 2008. SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE GREW SUBSTANTIALLY BY 79% FROM 2007 AS A RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING DIGITAL

CONTENT AND THE EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE VIA THE ITUNES STORE. THE EUROPE SEGMENT REPRESENTED 23% OF TOTAL NET SALES IN 2008, CONSISTENT WITH 2007.

EUROPE SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED $1.4 BILLION OR 33% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THIS GROWTH WERE MAC

PORTABLE PRODUCTS, IMACS, IPODS, AND THE SALES OF THIRD-PARTY CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES STORE. SALES OF MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCREASED DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF BOTH THE MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO. SALES OF IMACS GREW DUE TO A SHIFT IN DESKTOP PRODUCT

MIX AWAY FROM THE MAC MINI AND DISCONTINUED EMAC AS WELL AS THE STRONG RECEPTION OF THE NEW IMAC INTRODUCED IN AUGUST 2007. SALES OF IPODS GREW DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR THE IPOD NANO AND IPOD SHUFFLE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

GROWTH IN ITUNES STORE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING DIGITAL CONTENT AND THE EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE VIA THE ITUNES STORE.

JAPAN

JAPAN NET SALES INCREASED $427 MILLION OR 39% IN 2008 COMPARED

TO 2007. THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GROWTH IN NET SALES WERE INCREASES IN SALES OF IPODS, IMAC, MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS, AND STRONG SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE. NET SALES, UNIT SALES AND THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF IPODS INCREASED DURING 2008

COMPARED TO 2007, DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR IPOD TOUCH AND IPOD NANO. ADDITIONALLY, MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES GREW 42% AND 29%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES OF THE IMAC AND MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY

MACBOOK, AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION OF MACBOOK AIR IN JANUARY 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JAPANS NET SALES DECLINED BY $129 MILLION OR 11% IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. TOTAL MAC UNIT SALES IN JAPAN DECLINED

1% DURING 2007. THE DECREASE IN THE JAPAN SEGMENTS OVERALL NET SALES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO DECREASES IN IPOD AND MAC DESKTOP SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM MACBOOKS AND SALES OF THIRD-PARTY CONTENT FROM THE

ITUNES STORE. THE DECLINE IN NET SALES AND MAC UNIT SALES IS PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO JAPANS DECLINING CONSUMER PC MARKET, AND THE IPOD SALES DECLINE IS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE WAYS

TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE RESULTS OF ITS JAPAN SEGMENT.

RETAIL

RETAIL NET SALES GREW BY 53% DURING 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, DUE IN LARGE PART TO INCREASED SALES OF MAC PORTABLE AND DESKTOP PRODUCTS, STRONG DEMAND FOR THE IPHONE AND IPOD TOUCH, AND NEW STORE OPENINGS. THE COMPANY OPENED 50 NEW RETAIL

STORES DURING 2008, INCLUDING A TOTAL OF 19 INTERNATIONAL STORES, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OPEN STORES TO 247 AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008. THIS COMPARES TO 197 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND 165 OPEN STORES AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 211 STORES AND 178 STORES OPENED DURING 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE INCREASED TO $29.9 MILLION FOR 2008, COMPARED TO $23.1 MILLION IN 2007.

RETAIL MAC NET SALES AND MAC UNIT SALES GREW BY 42% AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2008 COMPARED TO THE 2007, DUE PRIMARILY TO STRONG DEMAND FOR MACBOOK, IMAC, AND MACBOOK

AIR, INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 2008. NET SALES OF IPODS INCREASED DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF THE IPOD TOUCH, WHICH WAS UPGRADED IN JUNE 2008, AND A HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICE COMPARED TO 2007. THE HIGHER IPOD AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS DUE TO STRONG

DEMAND FOR THE IPOD TOUCH.

THE RETAIL SEGMENTS NET SALES INCREASED BY 27% TO $4.1 BILLION DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. RETAIL SEGMENT MAC UNIT SALES

INCREASED 56% DURING 2007 AS COMPARED TO 2006. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 178 STORES OPEN DURING 2007, AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE WAS $23.1 MILLION, COMPARED TO $22.9 MILLION IN 2006. THE INCREASE IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS

DUE PRIMARILY TO STRONGER SALES OF MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS, IMACS, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICES. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET PRIMARILY BY LOWER NET SALES OF IPODS AND OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS DUE TO THE EXPANDED AVAILABILITY OF THOSE PRODUCTS

THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS.

AS MEASURED BY THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENT REPORTING, THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF $1.3 BILLION

DURING 2008 AS COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF $875 MILLION AND $600 MILLION DURING 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IMPROVEMENT IN 2008 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO THE SIGNIFICANT RETAIL NET SALES GROWTH OF 53% AS COMPARED TO 2007.

EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE

COMMITMENTS, PERSONNEL, AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $389 MILLION IN 2008, BRINGING THE TOTAL CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES SINCE INCEPTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT TO $1.4 BILLION. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY 15,900 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES OF $1.4 BILLION. THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR

SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IF IT WERE TO CLOSE MULTIPLE RETAIL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

OTHER SEGMENTS

THE COMPANYS OTHER SEGMENTS, WHICH CONSIST OF ITS ASIA PACIFIC AND FILEMAKER OPERATIONS, EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN

NET SALES OF $707 MILLION, OR 40% DURING 2008 AS COMPARED TO 2007. THESE INCREASES ARE RELATED PRIMARILY TO STRONG GROWTH IN SALES OF ALL MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS, IPODS, THE IMAC, AND CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES STORE IN THE COMPANYS ASIA PACIFIC

REGION. SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE IN THE COMPANYS ASIA PACIFIC REGION GREW SIGNIFICANTLY BY 109% OVER 2007. MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES GREW BY 52% AND 50%, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF THE IMAC AND ALL MAC PORTABLES.

THE COMPANYS OTHER SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF $406 MILLION, OR 30% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THIS INCREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO A 58%

INCREASE IN SALES OF MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS AND STRONG IPOD SALES IN THE COMPANYS ASIA PACIFIC REGION.

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2008 AS COMPARED TO 2007. GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE OF 34.0% IN 2007

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 29.0% IN 2006. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THIS INCREASE WERE MORE FAVORABLE COSTS ON CERTAIN COMMODITY COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NAND FLASH MEMORY AND DRAM MEMORY, HIGHER OVERALL REVENUE THAT PROVIDED FOR MORE LEVERAGE ON FIXED

PRODUCTION COSTS AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE FROM THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES CHANNELS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO

DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS COMPARED TO LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING 2008 AND 2007, AND ANTICIPATES GROSS MARGIN LEVELS OF ABOUT 30% IN 2009. THIS EXPECTED DECLINE IS DUE LARGELY TO THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING ON

NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES, BOTH EXPECTED AND POTENTIAL FUTURE COST INCREASES FOR KEY COMPONENTS, A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR, AND HIGHER LOGISTICAL COSTS.

THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANYS EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE ARE FORWARD-LOOKING AND COULD DIFFER FROM ANTICIPATED LEVELS BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CERTAIN OF

THOSE SET FORTH BELOW IN PART I, ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS UNDER THE SUBHEADING 

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, NAND FLASH

MEMORY, DRAM AND LCDS AT FAVORABLE PRICES AND IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES

, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT TARGETED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE LEVELS WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND

MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRODUCT PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND

EXPECTED INCREASES IN THE COST OF KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, NAND FLASH MEMORY, DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (DRAM) AND LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS (LCDS), AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE

COSTS OF OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANYS SALES MIX TOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRODUCT PRICING

ACTIONS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS EFFECTIVELY AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE

COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

EXPENDITURES FOR R&D INCREASED 42% OR $327 MILLION TO $1.1 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN R&D HEADCOUNT IN

THE CURRENT YEAR TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES AND HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES. IN 2008, $11 MILLION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE CAPITALIZED

RELATED TO MAC OS X VERSION 10.6 SNOW LEOPARD AND EXCLUDED FROM R&D EXPENSE, WHILE R&D EXPENSE FOR 2007 EXCLUDED $75 MILLION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS RELATED TO MAC OS X LEOPARD AND IPHONE. ALTHOUGH TOTAL R&D EXPENSE INCREASED 42% DURING 2008, IT REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES GIVEN THE 35% INCREASE IN REVENUE DURING 2008. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO

BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANYS CORE

BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCREASE SPENDING IN R&D TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.

EXPENDITURES FOR R&D INCREASED 10% OR $70

MILLION TO $782 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASES IN R&D EXPENSE WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN R&D HEADCOUNT IN 2007 TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ONE LESS WEEK OF EXPENSES IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2007 AND THE CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS MENTIONED ABOVE.

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (SG&A)

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A INCREASED $798 MILLION OR 27% TO $3.8 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THESE INCREASES ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, HIGHER VARIABLE SELLING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY INCURRED HIGHER SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING DURING 2008 COMPARED TO 2007.

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A INCREASED

$530 MILLION OR 22% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT CHANNEL VARIABLE SELLING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES IN 2007, THE COMPANYS

CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND HIGHER SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ONE LESS WEEK OF EXPENSES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

INTEREST RATE EARNED OF 3.44%. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS HIGHER CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT BALANCES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING 2008 AS COMPARED TO

2007. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WAS 5.27% AND 4.58% DURING 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY HAD NO DEBT OUTSTANDING AND

ACCORDINGLY DID NOT INCUR ANY RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 30% FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND 29% FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE RATES DIFFER

FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF $2.1 BILLION BEFORE BEING

OFFSET AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED LIABILITIES FOR PRESENTATION ON THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY RELEASED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5 MILLION SINCE IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE ASSOCIATED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED. THE COMPANY

WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THE INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE (THE IRS) HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2003 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS CONTESTED CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE

IRS APPEALS OFFICE. ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2002 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY

ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS

EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS,

WHICH DEFINES FAIR VALUE, PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 APPLIES TO OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS; IT DOES NOT

REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) NO. FAS 157-1,

APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157 TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 13 AND OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT

, EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157

. FSP 157-1 AMENDS SFAS NO. 157 TO REMOVE CERTAIN LEASING

TRANSACTIONS FROM ITS SCOPE. FSP 157-2 DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS NO. 157 TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008 FOR ALL NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND NON-FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED

OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY) AND WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP NO. 157-3,

DETERMINING THE

FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE

, TO CLARIFY THE APPLICATION OF SFAS 157 IN INACTIVE MARKETS FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS. FSP 157-3 BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE AND SFAS NO. 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL

YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007 AND WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 157, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE

ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIESINCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115.

SFAS NO. 159 ALLOWS COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT

FAIR VALUE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. SFAS NO. 159 REQUIRES THAT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED BE REPORTED IN EARNINGS AT EACH REPORTING DATE. SFAS NO. 159 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007 AND WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 159, MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 141 (REVISED 2007),

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR HOW AN ACQUIRER RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED,

AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. SFAS NO. 141R ALSO ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AROUND HOW GOODWILL ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR A GAIN FROM A BARGAIN PURCHASE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED, AS

WELL AS PROVIDES GUIDELINES ON THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. SFAS NO. 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008 AND WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE

COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 141R, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIESAN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133,

WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT ITS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HOW THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, AND HOW THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS NO. 161 ALSO REQUIRES COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES IN THEIR HEDGED POSITIONS. SFAS NO. 161 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008 AND

IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 161, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD $24.5 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS,

AN INCREASE OF $9.1 BILLION FROM SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THIS NET INCREASE WERE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $9.6 BILLION, PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER STOCK PLANS OF $483 MILLION AND

EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $757 MILLION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OF $1.1 BILLION, PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, NET OF

CASH ACQUIRED, OF $220 MILLION AND PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $108 MILLION. THE COMPANYS CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED ITS NET INCOME DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LARGE INCREASE IN DEFERRED

REVENUE, NET OF DEFERRED COSTS, ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING FOR IPHONE.

THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED

PRIMARILY IN HIGHLY RATED SECURITIES WITH A MINIMUM RATING OF SINGLE-A. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, $11.3 BILLION AND $6.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. THE COMPANY HAD $117 MILLION IN NET UNREALIZED LOSSES ON ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES RANGING FROM

ONE TO FIVE YEARS, AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, AND NET UNREALIZED LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION ON ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS, AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THE

COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD SUCH INVESTMENTS FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS INVESTED. ACCORDINGLY, NONE OF THESE DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANYS

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS

WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

CAPITAL ASSETS

THE COMPANYS CASH PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES WERE $1.1 BILLION DURING 2008,

CONSISTING OF $389 MILLION FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND $702 MILLION FOR REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS AND CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES UTILIZING APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION FOR CAPITAL

ASSET PURCHASES DURING 2009, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION FOR RETAIL FACILITIES AND APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION FOR CORPORATE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS ON NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES OF $1.8 BILLION, $1.4 BILLION OF WHICH RELATED TO THE LEASE OF RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS MAJOR

FACILITY LEASES ARE GENERALLY FOR TERMS OF 3 TO 20 YEARS AND GENERALLY PROVIDE RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR TERMS OF 1 TO 5 ADDITIONAL YEARS. LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR TERMS OF 5 TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS, AND OFTEN CONTAIN

MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS.

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF FINISHED

PRODUCTS. THESE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS

PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET WARRANTY OBLIGATION FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SOP NO. 97-2 WHEREBY THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS, COMPONENT

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, AND ESTIMATED WARRANTY COMMITMENTS OF $5.4 BILLION.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX

SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY PREPAID $1.25 BILLION

FOR FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS DURING 2006, WHICH WILL BE APPLIED TO CERTAIN INVENTORY PURCHASES MADE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH RESPECTIVE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY UTILIZED $567 MILLION OF THE PREPAYMENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF $28 MILLION WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS.

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER OBLIGATIONS

OTHER OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS WERE $471 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, WHICH RELATED TO ADVERTISING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48. THE COMPANY HAD HISTORICALLY CLASSIFIED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AND UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS AS CURRENT LIABILITIES, BUT BEGINNING WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48 THE COMPANY HAS RECLASSIFIED GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES AND UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PAYMENT OR RECEIPT OF CASH WITHIN ONE YEAR AS

NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $506 MILLION AND GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES OF $219 MILLION, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS

NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TIMING OF TAX AUDIT OUTCOMES; THEREFORE,

SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TABLE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN

INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A

LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS AS OF

EITHER SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 OR SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY

REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANYS

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE HEDGES WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION,

THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR RECOGNITION OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLDS LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANYS INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS

MOST SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES. AS SUCH, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, THE VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS,

AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES.

THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY ATTEMPTS PRIMARILY TO PRESERVE

CAPITAL AND MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS CASH IS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL MANAGERS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICY AND TO AN OBJECTIVE MARKET BENCHMARK. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL PORTFOLIO

IS BENCHMARKED AGAINST EXTERNAL MANAGER PERFORMANCE, ALLOWING FOR DIFFERENCES IN LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY RATED SECURITIES AND ITS POLICY GENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS TO BE RATED SINGLE-A OR BETTER WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH INITIAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS

CASH

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUIVALENTS, WHILE HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH INITIAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS. THE REMAINDER

ALL HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. THE COMPANY MAY SELL ITS INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, IN ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION, OR FOR DURATION MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NO

MATERIAL NET GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006 RELATED TO SUCH SALES.

TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD

CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $46 MILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $16 MILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS

PRIOR TO MATURITY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

IN GENERAL,

THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED

IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES,

TYPICALLY FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS.

TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE 3,000

RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL

LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON

THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $60 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $13 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, LOSSES INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

PERFORMED AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 DUE TO THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES, AND THE COMPANYS ACTUAL EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. THE COMPANYS FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2007 CONTAINED 13 WEEKS AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL

YEAR 2006 CONTAINED 14 WEEKS. THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2007 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDED 52 WEEKS, WHILE FISCAL YEAR 2006 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 INCLUDED 53 WEEKS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH

MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANYS DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE

APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DESIGNATIONS AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT

FAIR VALUE. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DEFINED AS HEDGES IN STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

AS AMENDED, MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE

THROUGH EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES,

THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE

HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES

TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE

THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE NET

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION IS REPORTED IN

THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF

EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, COMPUTED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD, OR MARKET. IF THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE,

PROVISIONS ARE MADE CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANYS INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINISHED GOODS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH FOR BUILDINGS IS THE LESSER OF 30 YEARS OR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING BUILDING, UP TO 5 YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR 10 YEARS FOR

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $363 MILLION, $249 MILLION, AND $180 MILLION DURING 2008, 2007, AND 2006

RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

COMPANY RECORDS OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

. THE COMPANY REVIEWS LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR NORMAL USE OF THE ASSETS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A LEGAL OBLIGATION EXISTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY FOR AN

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY IS ADDED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSET AND THIS ADDITIONAL CARRYING

AMOUNT IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW AND ITS PRESENT VALUE IS ACCRETED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED LEASE AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE. ALL OF THE COMPANYS EXISTING ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT LIABILITY WAS $21 MILLION AND $18 MILLION AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET

MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS DURING 2008, 2007, AND 2006.

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES SHOULD NOT BE AMORTIZED BUT RATHER BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON OR

ABOUT AUGUST 31 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2008, 2007, OR 2006. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING

GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT.

SFAS NO. 142 ALSO

REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY AMORTIZING ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE

LIVES OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO 10 YEARS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS INTERNATIONAL NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUE AND EXPENSES

FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE CREDITED OR CHARGED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REMEASURE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT EXCHANGE RATES IN

EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, AND INVENTORIES, PROPERTY, AND NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, MUSIC PRODUCTS, DIGITAL CONTENT, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. FOR ANY PRODUCT WITHIN THESE GROUPS THAT EITHER IS SOFTWARE, OR IS CONSIDERED SOFTWARE-RELATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

GUIDANCE IN EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) NO. 03-5,

APPLICABILITY OF AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 97-2 TO NON-SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINING MORE-THAN-INCIDENTAL SOFTWARE

(E.G., MAC COMPUTERS, IPOD

PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS AND IPHONES), THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REVENUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION

(SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED. THE COMPANY APPLIES STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION,

FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE-RELATED, SUCH

AS DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE AND CERTAIN MAC, IPOD AND IPHONE SUPPLIES AND ACCESSORIES.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE

EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS

REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT

TO BE, FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE AND ALL OTHER CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET.

REVENUE FROM SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE COVERAGE PERIODS. THESE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, REPAIR SERVICES, WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES,

DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AND EXTEND THE SERVICE COVERAGE OFFERED UNDER THE COMPANYS ONE-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

THE COMPANY SELLS SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY GENERALLY ESTABLISHES

ITS OWN PRICING AND RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN SALES TRANSACTIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS, AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR THE SALE

OF PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED.

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT CONSIST ONLY OF

SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE-RELATED PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP NO. 97-2. IF A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES DELIVERABLES THAT ARE NEITHER SOFTWARE NOR SOFTWARE-RELATED, THE COMPANY APPLIES EITF NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES,

TO DETERMINE IF THOSE DELIVERABLES CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FROM THE SOP NO. 97-2 DELIVERABLES. IF THE COMPANY CAN SEPARATE THE DELIVERABLES, THE COMPANY APPLIES SOP NO. 97-2 TO THE SOFTWARE AND

SOFTWARE-RELATED DELIVERABLES AND APPLIES OTHER APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE (E.G., SAB NO. 104) TO THE DELIVERABLES OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF SOP NO. 97-2. REVENUE ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES

IS ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT. EACH ELEMENTS ALLOCATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR THAT ELEMENT HAVE BEEN MET. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY VENDOR

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE), WHICH IS BASED ON THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN EACH ELEMENT IS SOLD SEPARATELY. IF THE COMPANY CANNOT OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY UNDELIVERED ELEMENT INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT

ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL ALL ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED AND SERVICES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED, OR UNTIL FAIR VALUE CAN OBJECTIVELY BE DETERMINED FOR ANY REMAINING UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DELIVERED ELEMENT HAS NOT

BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE COMPANY USES THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS DETERMINABLE. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF

THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE.

THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN

THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. REVENUE IS RECORDED NET OF TAXES COLLECTED

FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WITH THE COLLECTED TAXES RECORDED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES UNTIL REMITTED TO THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.

GENERALLY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT OFFER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH SOFTWARE SALES OR THE SALE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. WHEN THE COMPANY DOES OFFER

SPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHT UNTIL THE FUTURE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED OR WHEN THE RIGHT TO THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE EXPIRES. ADDITIONALLY, A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE WITH MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED FUTURE UPGRADES OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM ON A WHEN AND IF AVAILABLE BASIS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MAINTENANCE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER

THE MAINTENANCE TERM.

IN 2007, THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIPPING APPLE TV AND IPHONE. FOR APPLE TV AND IPHONE, THE COMPANY INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME-TO-TIME

PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED FEATURES AND ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, APPLE TV AND IPHONE HANDSETS SALES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP NO. 97-2. AS SUCH, THE

COMPANYS POLICY IS TO DEFER THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE AND COST OF GOODS SOLD AT THE TIME OF SALE, AND RECOGNIZE BOTH ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED 24-MONTH ECONOMIC LIFE OF THESE PRODUCTS, WITH ANY LOSS RECOGNIZED AT THE

TIME OF SALE. COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ENGINEERING, SALES, MARKETING AND WARRANTY ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE AGE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES, CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO PAY.

SHIPPING COSTS

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS RELATED TO SHIPPING AND HANDLING ARE CLASSIFIED AS REVENUE, AND THE COMPANYS SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE

COMPANY GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED

ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES. FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SOP NO. 97-2, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS

AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 86,

COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED

. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN

ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE, COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND GENERALLY MOST SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED $11 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.6 SNOW LEOPARD. IN 2007, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT BOTH

MAC OS X VERSION 10.5 LEOPARD (MAC OS X LEOPARD) AND IPHONE ACHIEVED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY. DURING 2007, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED $75 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEOPARD AND IPHONE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

NO. 86, THE CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO MAC OS X LEOPARD AND IPHONE ARE AMORTIZED TO COST OF SALES COMMENCING WHEN EACH RESPECTIVE PRODUCT BEGINS SHIPPING AND ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE

UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY.

TOTAL AMORTIZATION RELATED TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS $27 MILLION, $13 MILLION, AND $18 MILLION IN 2008, 2007, AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING

COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $486 MILLION, $467 MILLION, AND $338 MILLION FOR 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY APPLIES SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

, FOR STOCK-BASED PAYMENT

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISES EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED BY

THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON (BSM) OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE THE FAIR-VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER SFAS NO. 123R.

SFAS NO. 123R PROHIBITS RECOGNITION OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR AN EXCESS TAX BENEFIT THAT HAS NOT BEEN REALIZED. THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE A BENEFIT FROM

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN EQUITY IF AN INCREMENTAL TAX BENEFIT IS

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

REALIZED BY FOLLOWING THE ORDERING PROVISIONS OF THE TAX LAW. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON THE

RESEARCH TAX CREDIT, THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT, AND THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION THROUGH THE INCOME STATEMENT.

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 6, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND NOTE 7, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

INCOME TAXES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY

METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARDS (FASB) FINANCIAL INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXESAN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

. FIN 48 CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES BY CREATING A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR HOW COMPANIES SHOULD RECOGNIZE, MEASURE, PRESENT, AND DISCLOSE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER FIN 48, THE COMPANY MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH

POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED TAX POSITIONS, BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATIONS,

ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. SEE NOTE 5, INCOME TAXES FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ADOPTION ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS

PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES

HAD BEEN ISSUED. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, AND UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS). THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE

SECURITIES IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD, AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT FROM

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES.

THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY AND AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. CORPORATE

SECURITIES, AND FOREIGN SECURITIES WERE CAUSED PRIMARILY BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, SPECIFICALLY, WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS TO BE RATED SINGLE-A OR BETTER WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING

THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE DECLINES TO BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHEN EVALUATING THE INVESTMENTS FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY REVIEWS FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT

FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, WHICH MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON ITS OUTSTANDING SECURITIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CONSIDER ANY OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK

ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA AND BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE

COMPANYS DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM

TWO OF THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 15% AND 10% OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, WHILE ONE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 11% OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL

PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. THESE NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, TOTALED $2.3 BILLION AND $2.4 BILLION

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REFLECT THE SALE OF THESE COMPONENTS IN NET SALES AND DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PROFITS ON THESE SALES UNTIL THE RELATED PRODUCTS ARE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, AT

WHICH TIME THE PROFIT IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION OF COST OF SALES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE USED TO OFFSET THE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUE AND COST OF SALES. THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE

BASED ON WHETHER THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGE OR NON-HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, NET FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 (IN MILLIONS).

NOTE 2FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS AND PREVAILING FINANCIAL MARKET

INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING

EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE SOME PORTION OF ITS MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, OR LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

TO HELP PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS U.S. DOLLAR

FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE, AND THE COMPANYS NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES SELLING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE

SUBSIDIARIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED SALES ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE AND

INVENTORY PURCHASES FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THE

FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A SUBSEQUENT 2 MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN CURRENT EARNINGS UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

RECOGNIZED ANY MATERIAL NET GAINS DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RELATED TO THE LOSS OF A HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF

APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION, NET OF TAXES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS BY THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009.

THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE IS INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A NET LOSS ON NET INVESTMENT HEDGES OF $12.2 MILLION AND $2.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT.

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES. DUE TO CURRENCY MARKET MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE CAN LEAD TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

THE FOREIGN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF $3.5 BILLION, $2.2 BILLION, AND $1.5

BILLION IN 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, $11.3 BILLION AND $6.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE FOR

ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE FROM UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. U.S. INCOME TAXES

HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $3.8 BILLION OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS, AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE

THE COMPANYS INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY THE TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSACTIONS WERE $770 MILLION, $398 MILLION, AND $419 MILLION IN 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE REFLECTED AS AN INCREASE TO COMMON STOCK IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

ON OCTOBER 3, 2008, THE TAX EXTENDERS AND ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THIS BILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RETROACTIVELY

EXTENDED THE EXPIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE RETROACTIVE EFFECTS OF THE RESEARCH CREDIT

EXTENSION.

PAYMENT OR RECEIPT OF CASH WITHIN ONE YEAR AS NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF FIN 48 WAS $475 MILLION, OF WHICH $209 MILLION, IF

RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $506 MILLION, OF WHICH $253 MILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE. THE COMPANYS TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ARE CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE AGGREGATE

CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, WHICH EXCLUDES INTEREST AND PENALTIES, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, IS AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

THE COMPANYS POLICY TO INCLUDE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DID NOT CHANGE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING FIN 48. AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION, THE COMPANY HAD ACCRUED $203 MILLION FOR THE GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATING TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE

TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES ACCRUED WAS $219 MILLION, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. IN 2008, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED INTEREST EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH TAX MATTERS OF $16 MILLION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION AND FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND IN MANY STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. FOR U.S.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, ALL YEARS PRIOR TO 2002 ARE CLOSED. THE YEARS 2002-2003 HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE IRS) AND DISPUTED ISSUES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY

EXAMINING THE 2004-2006 YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. IN MAJOR STATES AND MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, THE YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 1988 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, GENERALLY

REMAIN OPEN AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT AN ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS

THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE

COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS. ALTHOUGH TIMING OF THE RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE OF AUDITS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ITS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WOULD MATERIALLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANY HAS FIVE MILLION SHARES OF AUTHORIZED PREFERRED STOCK, NONE OF WHICH IS ISSUED OR OUTSTANDING. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPANYS RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS AUTHORIZED TO DETERMINE OR ALTER

THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES, PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE COMPANYS AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

CEO RESTRICTED STOCK

AWARD

ON MARCH 19, 2003, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS GRANTED 10 MILLION SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK TO THE COMPANYS CEO

THAT VESTED ON MARCH 19, 2006. THE AMOUNT OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD EXPENSED BY THE COMPANY WAS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND WAS AMORTIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER THE THREE-YEAR REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. UPON VESTING DURING 2006, THE 10 MILLION SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $646.6 MILLION AND HAD GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF $7.48 PER SHARE. THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WAS NET-SHARE

SETTLED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY WITHHELD SHARES WITH VALUE EQUIVALENT TO THE CEOS MINIMUM STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR THE APPLICABLE INCOME AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES

WITHHELD OF 4.6 MILLION WERE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD ON THE VESTING DATE AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CLOSING STOCK PRICE OF $64.66. THE REMAINING SHARES NET OF THOSE WITHHELD WERE DELIVERED TO THE COMPANYS

CEO. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE CEOS TAX OBLIGATIONS TO THE TAXING AUTHORITIES WAS $296 MILLION IN 2006 AND ARE REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENT HAD THE EFFECT OF

SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY AS IT REDUCED AND RETIRED THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANYS CEO HAS NO REMAINING SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

2006, COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK WAS $4.6 MILLION.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS, AND LOSSES THAT

THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND NET DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS

UPON VESTING, THE RSUS ARE GENERALLY NET SHARE-SETTLED TO COVER THE REQUIRED WITHHOLDING TAX AND THE REMAINING

AMOUNT IS CONVERTED INTO AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE MAJORITY OF RSUS VESTED IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, WERE NET-SHARE SETTLED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY WITHHELD SHARES WITH VALUE EQUIVALENT TO THE EMPLOYEES MINIMUM STATUTORY

OBLIGATION FOR THE APPLICABLE INCOME AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES WITHHELD WERE APPROXIMATELY 857,000, 20,000, AND 986,000 FOR 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS

BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RSUS ON THEIR VESTING DATE AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CLOSING STOCK PRICE. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS TO THE TAXING AUTHORITIES WERE $124 MILLION, $3 MILLION, AND $59 MILLION IN 2008,

2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THESE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENTS HAD THE EFFECT OF SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY AS THEY REDUCED AND RETIRED THE NUMBER OF

SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THE VESTING AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $516

MILLION, $242 MILLION AND $163 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE CAPITALIZED AS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 OR

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS $169 MILLION, $81 MILLION, AND $39 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS EXPECTED TO VEST WAS $1.4 BILLION AND $631 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION

COST AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 2.92 YEARS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 7STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES THE USE OF A VALUATION MODEL TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE

COMPANY USES THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL INCORPORATES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE, AND INTEREST RATES. THE EXPECTED

VOLATILITY IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER THE MOST RECENT PERIOD COMMENSURATE WITH THE ESTIMATED EXPECTED LIFE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS INCLUDING IMPLIED VOLATILITY

IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY BASES ITS EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION ON ITS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE STOCK AWARDS IT GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS

ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE AWARDS FAIR-VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR RSUS IS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS AMORTIZED

RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDED

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO

OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER ITS BASIC LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME RELATED

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES,

HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS

NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES. FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SOP NO. 97-2, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY PROVIDES UPDATES TO ITS APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO MAINTAIN THE SOFTWARES COMPLIANCE WITH PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS. THE ESTIMATED

COST TO DEVELOP SUCH UPDATES IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS WARRANTY COSTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME RELATED SOFTWARE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS RELATED TO SUCH UPDATES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF UNITS

DELIVERED, THE NUMBER OF UPDATES EXPECTED TO OCCUR, AND THE HISTORICAL COST AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COST OF THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THESE UPDATES.

BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, ENCLOSURES, CERTAIN LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS (LCDS), CERTAIN OPTICAL DRIVES, AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED

CIRCUITS (ASICS) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, WHICH SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY OF THESE AND OTHER KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO NAND FLASH MEMORY, DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (DRAM), AND CERTAIN LCDS, ARE SUBJECT AT TIMES TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED

INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND LCDS AT FAVORABLE PRICING, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE

AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, UPON EXPIRATION OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND/OR PRICE INCREASES THAT CAN HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND

MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR

THEIR PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS

AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE

SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED. IF THE COMPANYS SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, IF SUCH COMPONENTS WERE AVAILABLE ONLY AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES, OR IF A KEY

MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES,

OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS.

SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS, IPHONES, LOGIC BOARDS, AND OTHER ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, PRIMARILY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT

CONCENTRATION OF THIS OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY ONLY A FEW OF THE COMPANYS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIER OF COMPONENTS AND

MANUFACTURING OUTSOURCING FOR MANY OF THE COMPANYS KEY PRODUCTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS, IPHONES AND MOST OF THE COMPANYS IMACS. ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANYS

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS.

LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF

NAND FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY PREPAID $1.25 BILLION FOR FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS DURING 2006, WHICH WILL BE APPLIED TO CERTAIN INVENTORY PURCHASES MADE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH RESPECTIVE

AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY UTILIZED $567 MILLION OF THE PREPAYMENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008.

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN THE

OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF THE COMPANY FAILED TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR IF SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE

OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND

COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL, PRODUCT SAFETY AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS COUNTRIES WITHIN EUROPE AND ASIA, CERTAIN CANADIAN PROVINCES AND

CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

NOTE 9SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

, THE COMPANY

REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE

SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DETERMINED ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF ITS CUSTOMERS, TO BE THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, ASIA-PACIFIC, RETAIL, AND FILEMAKER OPERATIONS. THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS CONSIST OF AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL

OPERATIONS. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE ASIA PACIFIC, WHICH ENCOMPASSES AUSTRALIA AND ASIA EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, AND THE COMPANYS FILEMAKER, INC. SUBSIDIARY. THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENTS EXCLUDE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO

THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. EACH REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES TO THE SAME TYPES OF CUSTOMERS. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1,

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES AND OPERATING

INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE LOCATION OF CUSTOMERS, WHILE RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES ARE BASED ON SALES FROM THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT INCLUDES NET SALES TO THIRD

PARTIES, RELATED COST OF SALES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT. ADVERTISING

EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN THE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IN WHICH THE EXPENDITURES ARE INCURRED. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE AND CERTAIN EXPENSES MANAGED OUTSIDE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE VARIOUS CORPORATE EXPENSES, SUCH AS MANUFACTURING COSTS AND VARIANCES NOT INCLUDED IN STANDARD COSTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, VARIOUS NONRECURRING CHARGES, AND OTHER SEPARATELY MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FOR

ASSETS. EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENT. CASH PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $389 MILLION, $294 MILLION, AND $200 MILLION FOR

2008, 2007, AND 2006 RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN RETAIL STORES THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND

AWARENESS AND SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. THE

COMPANY ALLOCATES CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS HIGH-PROFILE STORES TO CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSE TO REFLECT THE ESTIMATED COMPANY-WIDE BENEFIT. THE ALLOCATION OF THESE OPERATING COSTS TO CORPORATE EXPENSE IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT

INCURRED FOR A HIGH-PROFILE STORE IN EXCESS OF THAT INCURRED BY A MORE TYPICAL COMPANY RETAIL LOCATION. THE COMPANY HAD OPENED A TOTAL OF 11 HIGH-PROFILE STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008. EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE MARKETING RESULTING FROM

THE OPERATIONS OF HIGH-PROFILE STORES WERE $53 MILLION, $39 MILLION, AND $33 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 RESPECTIVELY.

AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR

AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF APPLE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR

WE HAVE AUDITED APPLE INC.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). APPLES MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR

AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED

RISK. OUR AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE

DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN

OUR OPINION, APPLE INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF

APPLE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON AN

EVALUATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS

DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (EXCHANGE ACT) WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN REPORTS THAT

IT FILES OR SUBMITS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS (I) RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES AND FORMS AND (II) ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS OVER INTERNAL CONTROLS

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED

TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

(I)

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS;

(II)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND THAT THE COMPANYS RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND

(III)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, DOES NOT EXPECT

THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM ARE

MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO

EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. ALSO, ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS IN FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THOSE

INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED). MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS

EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008. THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, KPMG LLP, HAS ISSUED AN AUDIT

REPORT ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARS ON PAGE 89 OF THIS FORM 10-K.
