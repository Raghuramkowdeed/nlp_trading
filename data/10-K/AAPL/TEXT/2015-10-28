COMPETITION

THE MARKETS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND THE COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASED THE CAPABILITIES AND USE OF MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES, PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND OTHER DIGITAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES. THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS THAT SELL MOBILE DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS

HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS

MARGINS. PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE PRICE, PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING SECURITY FEATURES), RELATIVE PRICE AND PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN INNOVATION, A STRONG THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE AND

ACCESSORIES ECOSYSTEM, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT AND CORPORATE REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ITS

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES. THESE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDE MANY LARGE, WELL-FUNDED AND EXPERIENCED PARTICIPANTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPETITION IN THESE MARKETS TO

INTENSIFY SIGNIFICANTLY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN

THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, EVOLVING DESIGN APPROACHES AND TECHNOLOGIES, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS AND

PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANYS DIGITAL CONTENT SERVICES HAVE FACED SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM OTHER

COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC AND CONTENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE OFFERING FREE PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC AND VIDEO SERVICES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND OFFER NEW INNOVATIVE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN EACH OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT COMPETES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT OFFERS SUPERIOR INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE ENTIRE SOLUTION INCLUDING THE HARDWARE (IOS DEVICES, MAC, APPLE WATCH AND APPLE TV), SOFTWARE (IOS, OS X,

WATCHOS AND TVOS), ONLINE SERVICES AND DISTRIBUTION OF DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS (INTERNET SERVICES). SOME OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS TO COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS OFFERINGS.

SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ARE CURRENTLY

OBTAINED FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COMPETES FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKETS FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS. THEREFORE, MANY COMPONENTS USED BY THE

COMPANY, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGE AND SIGNIFICANT PRICING FLUCTUATIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

UTILIZES CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. IF THE

COMPANYS SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR IF AN OUTSOURCING PARTNER DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM

AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS CONCENTRATED ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS

REQUIREMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF MANY COMPONENTS; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE

ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

WHILE SOME MAC COMPUTERS ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE U.S. AND IRELAND, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY

MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS THAT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF THIS MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING

PARTNERS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS AND MANUFACTURERS FOR MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANYS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE

COMPANY COMPETES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUAL AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE

MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TO EXPAND THE RANGE OF ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS THROUGH R&D, LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ACQUISITION OF THIRD-PARTY BUSINESSES AND

TECHNOLOGY. TOTAL R&D EXPENSE WAS $8.1 BILLION, $6.0 BILLION AND $4.5 BILLION IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND

LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS HARDWARE DEVICES, ACCESSORIES, SOFTWARE

AND SERVICES. THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED OR HAS APPLIED FOR TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE U.S. AND A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IS AN

IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES DEPEND IN PART ON SUCH OWNERSHIP, THE COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE AND MARKETING ABILITIES OF ITS PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY FILES PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT INNOVATIONS ARISING FROM ITS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN, AND IS CURRENTLY PURSUING

THOUSANDS OF PATENT APPLICATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. OVER TIME, THE COMPANY HAS ACCUMULATED A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF ISSUED PATENTS AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY HOLDS COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. NO

SINGLE PATENT OR COPYRIGHT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DURATION OF ITS PATENTS IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF ITS PRODUCTS.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK

OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND SERVICES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS IN THE PAST, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH LICENSES COULD BE

OBTAINED IN THE FUTURE ON REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN

COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND SERVICES MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR

OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

DURING 2015, THE COMPANYS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL NET SALES ACCOUNTED FOR 35% AND 65%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL NET

SALES. INFORMATION REGARDING FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE SOME MAC COMPUTERS ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE U.S. AND IRELAND, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS THAT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. THE SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED OUTSOURCING PARTNERS IN THE U.S., ASIA AND EUROPE. MARGINS ON

SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES. INFORMATION REGARDING CONCENTRATION IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K

IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 10, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

BUSINESS SEASONALITY AND PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED HIGHER NET SALES IN ITS FIRST QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR DUE IN PART TO SEASONAL

HOLIDAY DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT NET SALES, PRODUCT COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE COMPANYS NET SALES TO ITS INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AS THESE

CHANNELS ARE FILLED WITH NEW PRODUCT INVENTORY FOLLOWING A PRODUCT INTRODUCTION, AND OFTEN, CHANNEL INVENTORY OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT DECLINES AS THE NEXT RELATED MAJOR PRODUCT LAUNCH APPROACHES. NET SALES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED WHEN CONSUMERS AND

DISTRIBUTORS ANTICIPATE A PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. HOWEVER, NEITHER HISTORICAL SEASONAL PATTERNS NOR HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE PATTERN OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS,

FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE

COMPANY OFFERS A LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON MOST OF ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE ORIGINAL END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A

90-DAY

BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, LOCAL LAW REQUIRES THAT MANUFACTURERS GUARANTEE THEIR PRODUCTS FOR A PERIOD PRESCRIBED

BY STATUTE, TYPICALLY AT LEAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, WHERE AVAILABLE, CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE APP OR AC+, WHICH EXTENDS SERVICE COVERAGE ON MANY OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF

PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG OFTEN INCREASES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AS CUSTOMERS ANTICIPATE SHORTAGES. BACKLOG IS OFTEN

REDUCED ONCE CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD

APPROXIMATELY 110,000 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES.

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE

RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING OTHER STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART II, ITEM 7, MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN PART II, ITEM 8, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K.

THE BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHETHER CURRENTLY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN,

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, ANY ONE OR MORE OF WHICH COULD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, CAUSE THE COMPANYS ACTUAL FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM PAST, OR FROM ANTICIPATED FUTURE, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, PAST FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT GLOBAL AND REGIONAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS POSES A RISK AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES MAY POSTPONE SPENDING IN RESPONSE TO TIGHTER CREDIT, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, NEGATIVE FINANCIAL NEWS, DECLINES IN INCOME OR

ASSET VALUES AND/OR OTHER FACTORS. THESE WORLDWIDE AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEMAND ALSO COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS

AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BECAUSE THE COMPANY GENERALLY RAISES PRICES ON GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD OUTSIDE THE U.S. TO CORRESPOND WITH THE EFFECT OF A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD INFLUENCE WORLDWIDE OR

REGIONAL DEMAND INCLUDE CHANGES IN FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, CONDITIONS IN THE REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE MARKETS, UNEMPLOYMENT, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, ACCESS TO CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING CONSUMER

SPENDING BEHAVIOR. THESE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN THE

EVENT OF FINANCIAL TURMOIL AFFECTING THE BANKING SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, ADDITIONAL CONSOLIDATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OR SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTION FAILURES, THERE COULD BE TIGHTENING IN THE

CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY AND EXTREME VOLATILITY IN FIXED INCOME, CREDIT, CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKETS. THIS COULD HAVE A NUMBER OF EFFECTS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE INSOLVENCY OR FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF

OUTSOURCING PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS OR THEIR INABILITY TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS RESULTING IN PRODUCT DELAYS; INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE PURCHASES

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS; FAILURE OF DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ISSUE NEW DEBT. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE ALSO COULD VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS

DEPENDING ON GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RESULTING FROM REVALUATIONS OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS; CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES; INCREASES OR

DECREASES IN CASH BALANCES; VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES; AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. INCREASED VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OVERALL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF THE ACTUAL

AMOUNTS REALIZED IN THE FUTURE ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FAIR VALUES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THEM.

GLOBAL MARKETS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND THE

COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE MARKETS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COMPETE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL

MARKETS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICE CUTTING AND RESULTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE

CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT

DESIGNS AND DEVELOPS NEARLY THE ENTIRE SOLUTION FOR ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, NUMEROUS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN R&D. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS AND HAS REGISTERED AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER NUMEROUS PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. IN CONTRAST, MANY OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE PRIMARILY THROUGH

AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES, AND EMULATING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND INFRINGING ON ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH

ATTRACTIVE MARGINS OR IF COMPETITORS INFRINGE ON THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY MARKETS CERTAIN MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES BASED ON THE IOS MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM

AND ALSO MARKETS RELATED THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THESE MARKETS FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER RESOURCES, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED

HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS; AND THE COMPANY HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE GLOBAL SMARTPHONE MARKET. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION AS COMPETITORS REDUCE THEIR SELLING PRICES AND

ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS PRODUCT FEATURES AND APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH

BUSINESS MODELS THAT INCLUDE CONTENT PROVIDED TO USERS FOR FREE. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES WITH ILLEGITIMATE WAYS TO OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. SOME OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER EXPERIENCE, PRODUCT BREADTH

AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN THE COMPANY. BECAUSE SOME CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND/OR EXPERIENCE AND A LOWER COST STRUCTURE, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A

LOSS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO PROVIDING COMPONENTS SEAMLESSLY WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE IOS AND IOS DEVICES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES.

THE COMPANY IS THE ONLY AUTHORIZED MAKER OF HARDWARE USING OS X, WHICH HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET. THIS MARKET HAS BEEN

CONTRACTING AND IS DOMINATED BY COMPUTER MAKERS USING COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY WINDOWS. IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND ACCESSORIES, THE COMPANY FACES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BROADER PRODUCT

LINES, LOWER PRICED PRODUCTS AND A LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASE. HISTORICALLY, CONSOLIDATION IN THIS MARKET HAS RESULTED IN LARGER COMPETITORS. PRICE COMPETITION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS SELLING WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS

HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED PRODUCT MARGINS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET-ENABLED DEVICES THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE

COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE MAC PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN ITS FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND, THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW AND UPGRADED PRODUCTS AND SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE TRANSITION TO THESE NEW AND UPGRADED PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCT PRODUCTION RAMP-UP ISSUES, THE

AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND AT EXPECTED COSTS TO

MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS OR DEFICIENCIES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND

TRANSITIONS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS, CARRIERS AND OTHER RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, MANY OF

WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS ITS PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS AND SMALL AND MID-SIZED

BUSINESSES THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES.

CARRIERS PROVIDING CELLULAR NETWORK SERVICE FOR IPHONE TYPICALLY SUBSIDIZE USERS PURCHASES OF

THE DEVICE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH SUBSIDIES WILL BE CONTINUED AT ALL OR IN THE SAME AMOUNTS UPON RENEWAL OF THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CARRIERS OR IN AGREEMENTS THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO WITH NEW CARRIERS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANY RESELLERS HAVE NARROW OPERATING MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY WEAK ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. SOME RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS AS DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. SUCH A PERCEPTION COULD DISCOURAGE RESELLERS FROM

INVESTING RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING

STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS, AND IMPROVING PRODUCT PLACEMENT DISPLAYS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE. THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS COULD WEAKEN, THESE RESELLERS COULD STOP DISTRIBUTING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, OR UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR SOME OR ALL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COULD CAUSE RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING

AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSET RISK IN ADDITION TO PURCHASE

COMMITMENT CANCELLATION RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR PRODUCT AND COMPONENT INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR EXCEED

ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND ACCRUES NECESSARY CANCELLATION FEE RESERVES FOR ORDERS OF EXCESS PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING CAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS FACILITIES

AND INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, IT RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS PROVISIONS RELATED TO INVENTORY, CAPITAL ASSETS, INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE

GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL RELATED CHARGES GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES.

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SHIPMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND OPEN ORDERS, IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT

PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE,

COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND ORDER OR PRODUCE EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS, OR NOT FULLY UTILIZE FIRM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN COMPONENTS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OBTAINS COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY

COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF MANY COMPONENTS,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. A NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS MAY SUFFER FROM POOR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO BUSINESS FAILURE FOR THE

SUPPLIER OR CONSOLIDATION WITHIN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY, FURTHER LIMITING THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF COMPONENTS. THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON THE COMPANYS SUPPLIERS, DESCRIBED

IN 

GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY

ABOVE, ALSO COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN COMPONENTS.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS

OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES.

THE COMPANY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKETS FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES AND PERSONAL

COMPUTERS ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THESE INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANYS NEW

PRODUCTS OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED.

CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING IF THOSE SUPPLIERS DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET

THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. THE SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT COULD BE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR COULD DELAY SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON COMPONENT AND PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY

OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING IS PERFORMED IN

WHOLE OR IN PART BY A FEW OUTSOURCING PARTNERS LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER OPERATING COSTS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANYS

DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE COMPANYS FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE PARTNERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND COULD EXPERIENCE AN UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT

OR WARRANTY LIABILITY. WHILE THE COMPANY RELIES ON ITS PARTNERS TO ADHERE TO ITS SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT, MATERIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT COULD OCCUR.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON SOLE-SOURCED OUTSOURCING PARTNERS IN THE U.S., ASIA AND EUROPE TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS, AND ON

OUTSOURCING PARTNERS PRIMARILY LOCATED IN ASIA, FOR FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. ANY FAILURE OF THESE PARTNERS TO PERFORM MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COST OR SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS

OR FINISHED GOODS. IN ADDITION, MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN THESE LOCATIONS OR TRANSIT TO FINAL DESTINATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM

FAILURES, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, MILITARY ACTIONS OR ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL ISSUES.

THE COMPANY HAS

INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, MUCH OF WHICH IS HELD AT CERTAIN OF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, AND HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS HELP ENSURE THE

SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS AND FINISHED GOODS, IF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE SEVERE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR BUSINESS, SUCH CONTINUED SUPPLY COULD BE REDUCED OR TERMINATED AND THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF

THESE ASSETS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM TIME TO TIME

THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN AND HARM TO THE COMPANYS REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY SELLS COMPLEX HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN CONTAIN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE

SOFTWARES INTENDED OPERATION. THE COMPANYS ONLINE SERVICES MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE OUTAGES, SERVICE SLOWDOWNS, OR ERRORS. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSES AND HARM TO THE COMPANYS REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS

OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH NUMEROUS THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT. THIS INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO SELL CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE MUSIC, MOVIES, TV SHOWS AND BOOKS. THE LICENSING OR OTHER DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE FOR RELATIVELY SHORT TERMS AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE CONTINUATION OR RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT

ALL. SOME THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS AND DISTRIBUTORS CURRENTLY OR IN THE FUTURE MAY OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE THEIR

CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. OTHER CONTENT OWNERS, PROVIDERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAY SEEK TO LIMIT THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO, OR INCREASE THE COST OF, SUCH CONTENT. THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTENT AT REASONABLE

PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH. FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO MAKE AVAILABLE THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, OR TO MAKE AVAILABLE SUCH CONTENT ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

SOME THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT PROVIDERS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

PROVIDE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT AND OTHER SECURITY SOLUTIONS. IF REQUIREMENTS CHANGE, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE THESE SOLUTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH

SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED OR MAY PROPOSE AND ADOPT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD LESSEN THE PROTECTION OF

CONTENT AND SUBJECT IT TO PIRACY AND ALSO COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMPANYS CONTENT PROVIDERS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE DEPENDS IN PART ON SUPPORT FROM

THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ITS HARDWARE

PRODUCTS DEPEND IN PART ON THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO ITS MAC PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

SERVICES DEPENDS IN PART ON THE DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COMPARED TO WINDOWS-BASED PRODUCTS. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED

ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE MARKET POSITION OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, EXPECTED FUTURE GROWTH OF MAC SALES AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. IF THE COMPANYS MINORITY

SHARE OF THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET CAUSES DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE MACS PROSPECTS, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO

DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET.

WITH RESPECT TO IOS DEVICES, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND

DEVELOPMENT OF COMPELLING AND INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A SINGLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, THE APP STORE. IOS DEVICES ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND, IF THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS ARE UNABLE TO OR CHOOSE

NOT TO KEEP UP WITH THIS PACE OF CHANGE, THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS MIGHT NOT SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE AND MAY RESULT IN DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS. AS WITH APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS, THE AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE

APPLICATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON DEVELOPERS PERCEPTIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING OR UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS IOS DEVICES RATHER THAN ITS COMPETITORS PLATFORMS, SUCH AS ANDROID. IF

DEVELOPERS FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THESE COMPETING PLATFORMS, THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS IOS DEVICES MAY SUFFER.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS OR AT ALL.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH REQUIRES LICENSES FROM THOSE THIRD

PARTIES. BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY CAN BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO USE THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR TO USE SUCH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, COULD PRECLUDE THE COMPANY FROM SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

SUCH AS BEING FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT

HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY RESOLVED AND THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE.

FOR

EXAMPLE, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, INCLUDING MANY OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS, FREQUENTLY ENTER INTO LITIGATION BASED ON ALLEGATIONS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, PATENT HOLDING COMPANIES

SEEK TO MONETIZE PATENTS THEY HAVE PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED. AS THE COMPANY HAS GROWN, THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CLAIMS AGAINST IT HAVE INCREASED AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE. IN PARTICULAR, THE COMPANYS CELLULAR ENABLED PRODUCTS

COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS FROM MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICE COMPANIES THAT HOLD SIGNIFICANT PATENT PORTFOLIOS, AND THE NUMBER OF PATENT CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING

INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS IN COURTS IN A NUMBER OF U.S. JURISDICTIONS AND BEFORE THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION, AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS FREQUENTLY SEEK INJUNCTIONS AND SUBSTANTIAL

DAMAGES.

REGARDLESS OF THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF SUCH PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR THE MERITS OF ANY CLAIMS BY POTENTIAL OR

ACTUAL LITIGANTS, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION. IF THE COMPANY IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ONE OR MORE PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT CAN DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY, IT MAY BE

REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES TO A THIRD-PARTY, OR IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS.

IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES

CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. THESE LICENSES MAY ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COMPANYS OPERATING EXPENSES.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF PARTICULAR CLAIMS, LITIGATION MAY BE EXPENSIVE, TIME-CONSUMING, DISRUPTIVE TO THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT. IN RECOGNITION OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO SETTLE LITIGATION.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, THERE IS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS

OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A

REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHER, SUCH AN OUTCOME COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

COMPENSATORY, PUNITIVE OR TREBLED MONETARY DAMAGES, DISGORGEMENT OF REVENUE OR PROFITS, REMEDIAL CORPORATE MEASURES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, CHANGES TO WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPANYS COSTS AND INDIVIDUALLY OR IN

THE AGGREGATE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. THESE U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN AREAS OF LABOR, ADVERTISING, DIGITAL CONTENT, CONSUMER PROTECTION, REAL ESTATE,

BILLING, E-COMMERCE, PROMOTIONS, QUALITY OF SERVICES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA, TELEVISION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND INFRINGEMENT, TAX, IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS

AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-COMPETITION, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY.

BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, LAWS AND

REGULATIONS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICES IN THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES ARE EXTENSIVE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. SUCH CHANGES COULD INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURE,

DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF DEVICES, LOCKING DEVICES TO A CARRIERS NETWORK, OR MANDATING THE USE OF DEVICES ON MORE THAN ONE CARRIERS NETWORK. THESE DEVICES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AND STANDARDIZATION

BODIES, AS WELL AS BY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS FOR USE ON THEIR NETWORKS. THESE CERTIFICATION PROCESSES ARE EXTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS, OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT

DATES, OR COULD PRECLUDE THE COMPANY FROM SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS MAY BE ONEROUS

AND EXPENSIVE, AND THEY MAY BE INCONSISTENT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION, FURTHER INCREASING THE COST OF COMPLIANCE AND DOING BUSINESS. ANY SUCH COSTS, WHICH MAY RISE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN

THEIR INTERPRETATION, COULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MAKE THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, DELAY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS IN ONE OR MORE REGIONS, OR CAUSE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE

OR LIMIT ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS WILL NOT

VIOLATE SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE COMPANYS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUE AND EARNINGS FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. COMPLIANCE

WITH APPLICABLE U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS, TAX LAWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, LABOR LAWS

AND ANTI-COMPETITION REGULATIONS, INCREASES THE COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, A VIOLATION BY THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES,

CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS COULD NEVERTHELESS OCCUR. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BRAND, INTERNATIONAL GROWTH EFFORTS AND BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY ALSO COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ECONOMIC AND

LABOR CONDITIONS, INCREASED DUTIES, TAXES AND OTHER COSTS AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING DUTIES, TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CUSTOMERS IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY CAN EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES HAVE REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES HAVE REQUIRED

SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE. CERTAIN STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO

SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN THE

COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. DUE TO THE HIGH COST STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES, A DECLINE IN SALES OR THE CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIPLE STORES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEASE

TERMINATION COSTS, WRITE-OFFS OF EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND SEVERANCE COSTS.

MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS, SOME OF WHICH

ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, POSE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS THE COMPANYS

INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION, THE COMPANYS FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS EXISTING RETAIL PARTNERS, MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF RETAIL INVENTORY, AND THE COMPANYS INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND ACQUISITIONS COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS AND PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY

CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY INVEST, IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ACQUISITIONS. SUCH ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE

SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM CURRENT OPERATIONS, GREATER THAN EXPECTED LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES, INADEQUATE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANYS DUE

DILIGENCE. THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND REPUTATION MAY BE

IMPACTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES OR NETWORK DISRUPTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM

FAILURES AND NETWORK DISRUPTIONS. THESE MAY BE CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER DISRUPTIONS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR OTHER EVENTS OR DISRUPTIONS.

SYSTEM REDUNDANCY MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR INADEQUATE, AND THE COMPANYS DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES. SUCH FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVENT ACCESS TO THE COMPANYS ONLINE

STORES AND SERVICES, PRECLUDE RETAIL STORE TRANSACTIONS, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND RESULT IN DELAYED OR CANCELLED ORDERS. SYSTEM FAILURES AND DISRUPTIONS COULD ALSO IMPEDE THE MANUFACTURING AND SHIPPING OF PRODUCTS, DELIVERY OF ONLINE

SERVICES, TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THERE MAY BE BREACHES OF THE COMPANYS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

THAT MATERIALLY DAMAGE BUSINESS PARTNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, CURTAIL OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT ACCESS TO ONLINE STORES AND SERVICES, OR SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL, FINANCIAL, LEGAL AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS REQUIRES IT TO USE AND STORE CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND BUSINESS PARTNER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

(PII). THIS MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER INFORMATION, NAMES, ADDRESSES, PHONE NUMBERS, EMAIL ADDRESSES, CONTACT PREFERENCES, TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS AND PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH MALICIOUS ATTACKS TO GAIN ACCESS TO PII AFFECT

MANY COMPANIES ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES, THE COMPANY IS AT A RELATIVELY GREATER RISK OF BEING TARGETED BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH PROFILE AND THE AMOUNT OF PII IT MANAGES.

THE COMPANY REQUIRES USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS IN ORDER TO ACCESS ITS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ENCRYPTION AND AUTHENTICATION

TECHNOLOGIES DESIGNED TO SECURE THE TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OF DATA AND PREVENT ACCESS TO COMPANY DATA OR ACCOUNTS. AS WITH ALL COMPANIES, THESE SECURITY MEASURES ARE SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY SECURITY BREACHES, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE, FAULTY

PASSWORD MANAGEMENT, OR OTHER IRREGULARITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THIRD PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO FRAUDULENTLY INDUCE EMPLOYEES OR CUSTOMERS INTO DISCLOSING USER NAMES, PASSWORDS OR OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION, WHICH MAY IN TURN BE USED TO ACCESS THE

COMPANYS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. TO HELP PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY MONITORS ACCOUNTS AND SYSTEMS FOR UNUSUAL ACTIVITY AND MAY FREEZE ACCOUNTS UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE DELAY OR LOSS OF

CUSTOMER ORDERS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO NETWORK SECURITY, DATA ENCRYPTION AND OTHER SECURITY MEASURES

TO PROTECT ITS SYSTEMS AND DATA, BUT THESE SECURITY MEASURES CANNOT PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY WAS TO EXPERIENCE A BREACH OF ITS SYSTEMS AND WAS UNABLE TO PROTECT SENSITIVE DATA, SUCH A BREACH COULD MATERIALLY DAMAGE

BUSINESS PARTNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND CURTAIL OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT ACCESS TO ONLINE STORES AND SERVICES. MOREOVER, IF A COMPUTER SECURITY BREACH AFFECTS THE COMPANYS SYSTEMS OR RESULTS IN THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF PII,

THE COMPANYS REPUTATION AND BRAND COULD BE MATERIALLY DAMAGED, USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD DECREASE, AND THE COMPANY COULD BE EXPOSED TO A RISK OF LOSS OR LITIGATION AND POSSIBLE LIABILITY. WHILE THE COMPANY MAINTAINS

INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT, SUBJECT TO POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT SELF-INSURED RETENTION, IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CYBER RISKS, SUCH INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL LOSSES OR ALL TYPES

OF CLAIMS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AREA OF CYBER RISK.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S.

AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS, RULES, POLICIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS REGARDING DATA PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND

INTERNATIONAL LAWS RELATING TO THE COLLECTION, USE, RETENTION, SECURITY AND TRANSFER OF PII. IN MANY CASES, THESE LAWS APPLY NOT ONLY TO THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, BUT ALSO TO TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND

AMONG THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER PARTIES WITH WHICH THE COMPANY HAS COMMERCIAL RELATIONS. SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE PASSED LAWS IN THIS AREA, AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS. THESE LAWS CONTINUE

TO DEVELOP AND MAY BE INCONSISTENT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. COMPLYING WITH EMERGING AND CHANGING INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES.

NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES OR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL LIABILITY.

THE COMPANYS PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH INCLUDES RELATED PRACTICES

CONCERNING THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF DATA, IS POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. ANY FAILURE BY THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS OR OTHER PARTIES WITH WHOM THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS TO COMPLY WITH ITS POSTED PRIVACY POLICY OR WITH OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR

INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY-RELATED OR DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE COMPANY BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR OTHERS.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO PAYMENT CARD ASSOCIATION RULES AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS CONTRACTS WITH PAYMENT CARD PROCESSORS. UNDER THESE RULES AND

OBLIGATIONS, IF INFORMATION IS COMPROMISED, THE COMPANY COULD BE LIABLE TO PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO FOLLOW PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY SECURITY STANDARDS, EVEN IF NO CUSTOMER

INFORMATION IS COMPROMISED, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT FINES OR EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTION COSTS.

THE COMPANYS SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND SERVICE OF KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

EXECUTIVE TEAM AND OTHER HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN SILICON VALLEY, WHERE MOST OF THE COMPANYS KEY PERSONNEL ARE

LOCATED.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND

OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS.

WAR, TERRORISM, GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS HAVE CAUSED

AND COULD CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THUS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS, LOGISTICS PROVIDERS, MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY, AMONG OTHERS, NATURAL DISASTERS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE OR OTHERWISE, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER HOSTILE

ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING PANDEMICS, ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS R&D ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT

SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE IN LOCATIONS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL RECOVERY TIME AND EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT

EXPENDITURES IN ORDER TO RESUME OPERATIONS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE.

THE COMPANYS PROFIT MARGINS VARY ACROSS ITS PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANYS SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS ON THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS VARY ACROSS PRODUCT LINES AND CAN CHANGE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, PRICING AND

CONFIGURATION CHANGES, AND COMPONENT, WARRANTY, AND OTHER COST FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED GROSS MARGINS THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES THROUGH ITS CHANNEL PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS GROSS

MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, COMPONENT COST INCREASES, THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, PRICE COMPETITION,

OR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES WITH FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING.

THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY

EXPERIENCED HIGHER NET SALES IN ITS FIRST QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS DUE IN PART TO SEASONAL HOLIDAY DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT NET SALES, PRODUCT COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. FURTHER, THE

COMPANY GENERATES A MAJORITY OF ITS NET SALES FROM A SINGLE PRODUCT AND A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR THAT PRODUCT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT QUARTERLY NET SALES. THE COMPANY COULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS

LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, ISSUES WITH NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANYS LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS SUPPLY, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS.

THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY.

THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANY, THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE HAVE EXPERIENCED EXTREME STOCK PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED STOCK PRICES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THESE COMPANIES OPERATING PERFORMANCE. PRICE

VOLATILITY OVER A GIVEN PERIOD MAY CAUSE THE AVERAGE PRICE AT WHICH THE COMPANY REPURCHASES ITS OWN STOCK TO EXCEED THE STOCKS PRICE AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS STOCK PRICE SHOULD REFLECT EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE GROWTH

AND PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES ITS STOCK PRICE SHOULD REFLECT EXPECTATIONS THAT ITS CASH DIVIDEND WILL CONTINUE AT CURRENT LEVELS OR GROW AND THAT ITS CURRENT SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FULLY CONSUMMATED. FUTURE DIVIDENDS ARE

SUBJECT TO DECLARATION BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THE COMPANYS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE IT TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MEET EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO FUTURE GROWTH,

PROFITABILITY, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES OR OTHER MARKET EXPECTATIONS, ITS STOCK PRICE MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS LOCAL

CURRENCIES.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATES TO NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SALES

AND OPERATING EXPENSES WORLDWIDE. WEAKENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, AND GENERALLY LEADS THE COMPANY TO RAISE

INTERNATIONAL PRICING, POTENTIALLY REDUCING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR COMPETITIVE OR OTHER REASONS, THE COMPANY MAY DECIDE NOT TO RAISE LOCAL PRICES TO FULLY OFFSET THE DOLLARS STRENGTHENING, OR AT ALL, WHICH

WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHILE GENERALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANYS

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND INCUR LOSSES ON ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THEREBY LIMITING THE BENEFIT. ADDITIONALLY, STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COMPANYS COST OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS DENOMINATED IN THOSE CURRENCIES, THUS ADVERSELY AFFECTING GROSS MARGINS.

THE COMPANY

USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, TO HEDGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET ANY, OR MORE THAN A PORTION, OF THE

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE LIMITED TIME THE HEDGES ARE IN PLACE.

THE COMPANY

IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

GIVEN THE GLOBAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE

COMPANY HAS BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS. CREDIT RATINGS AND PRICING OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY LIQUIDITY, CREDIT DETERIORATION, FINANCIAL RESULTS, ECONOMIC RISK, POLITICAL RISK, SOVEREIGN RISK OR

OTHER FACTORS. AS A RESULT, THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES MAY FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOT REALIZED ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON ITS CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FUTURE FLUCTUATIONS IN THEIR VALUE COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REALIZED LOSS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, VENDOR NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS, AND THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. THE COMPANY ALSO

SELLS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES AND EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE RECEIVABLES IS HIGHER IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND ITS ABILITY TO MITIGATE SUCH RISKS MAY BE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED

VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES RESULTING FROM PURCHASES OF COMPONENTS BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS AND OTHER VENDORS THAT MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES WAS CONCENTRATED WITHIN CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, AND ITS VENDOR NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WERE CONCENTRATED AMONG A FEW INDIVIDUAL VENDORS LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND VENDOR

NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, AS WELL AS LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES.

THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN ITS TAX RATES, THE ADOPTION OF NEW U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL TAX LEGISLATION OR EXPOSURE TO

ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING IRELAND, WHERE A NUMBER

OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ORGANIZED. DUE TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TAX RATES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF

EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION, INCLUDING IN THE U.S. AND IRELAND. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JUNE 2014, THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION OPENED A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF IRELAND TO EXAMINE WHETHER DECISIONS BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES WITH REGARD TO THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX TO BE PAID BY TWO OF THE COMPANYS IRISH SUBSIDIARIES COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN UNION RULES ON STATE AID.

IF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WERE TO CONCLUDE AGAINST IRELAND, IT COULD REQUIRE IRELAND TO RECOVER FROM THE COMPANY PAST TAXES COVERING A PERIOD OF UP TO 10 YEARS REFLECTIVE OF THE DISALLOWED STATE AID, AND SUCH AMOUNT COULD BE MATERIAL.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE EXAMINATION OF ITS TAX RETURNS AND OTHER TAX MATTERS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES AND

GOVERNMENTAL BODIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN ADVERSE OUTCOME RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE EXAMINATIONS. IF

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S. OR IRELAND, OR IF THE ULTIMATE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS TAXES OWED IS FOR AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS DISCUSSED BELOW AS

WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY RESOLVED AND THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED

A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR ASSERTED LEGAL AND OTHER CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS

EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE THE RISK FACTOR 

ANTITRUST LITIGATION (UNITED STATES OF AMERICA V. APPLE INC., ET AL.)

ON APRIL 11, 2012, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILED A CIVIL

ANTITRUST ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND FIVE MAJOR BOOK PUBLISHERS IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ALLEGING AN UNREASONABLE RESTRAINT OF INTERSTATE TRADE AND COMMERCE IN VIOLATION OF §1 OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND

SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THE DISTRICT COURTS DECLARATION THAT THE COMPANYS AGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH THE PUBLISHERS ARE NULL AND VOID AND/OR THE DISTRICT COURTS REFORMATION OF SUCH AGREEMENTS. ON JULY 10,

2013, THE DISTRICT COURT FOUND, FOLLOWING A BENCH TRIAL, THAT THE COMPANY CONSPIRED TO RESTRAIN TRADE IN VIOLATION OF §1 OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND RELEVANT STATE STATUTES TO THE EXTENT THOSE LAWS ARE CONGRUENT WITH §1 OF THE SHERMAN

ACT. THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED A PERMANENT INJUNCTION, WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON OCTOBER 6, 2013 AND WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR FIVE YEARS UNLESS THE JUDGMENT IS OVERTURNED ON APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO COMPLY WITH THE

TERMS OF THE DISTRICT COURTS ORDER, INCLUDING RENEGOTIATING AGREEMENTS WITH THE FIVE MAJOR EBOOK PUBLISHERS, UPDATING ITS ANTITRUST TRAINING PROGRAM AND COMPLETING A TWO-YEAR MONITORSHIP WITH A COURT-APPOINTED ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE MONITOR,

WHOSE APPOINTMENT THE DISTRICT COURT ENDED IN OCTOBER 2015. THE COMPANY APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION. PURSUANT TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REACHED IN JUNE 2014, ANY DAMAGES THE COMPANY MAY BE OBLIGATED TO PAY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE

OUTCOME OF THE FINAL ADJUDICATION FOLLOWING EXHAUSTION OF ALL APPEALS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES INCREASES IN MAC

®

,

WHICH LAUNCHED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015, ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 100% OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES OF OTHER PRODUCTS. NET SALES GROWTH DURING 2015 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF WEAKNESS IN MOST FOREIGN CURRENCIES

RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AND LOWER IPAD

WHERE YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES INCREASED 84%.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN IPHONE NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2015 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE

6 AND 6 PLUS DURING 2015. OVERALL AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (ASPS) FOR IPHONE INCREASED BY 11% DURING 2015 COMPARED TO 2014, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS IN SEPTEMBER 2014, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF

WEAKNESS IN MOST FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN IPHONE NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN 2014 RESULTED

PRIMARILY FROM THE SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW IPHONES IN THE LATTER HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2013, THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2014, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION. IPHONE UNIT SALES GREW IN ALL OF THE

COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHILE IPHONE NET SALES GREW IN ALL SEGMENTS EXCEPT REST OF ASIA PACIFIC. OVERALL ASPS FOR IPHONE WERE RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013, WITH GROWTH IN ASPS IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT BEING OFFSET BY A DECLINE

IN ASPS IN THE GREATER CHINA, JAPAN AND REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENTS.

IS DUE IN PART TO A LONGER REPURCHASE CYCLE FOR IPADS AND SOME LEVEL OF CANNIBALIZATION FROM THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS. IPAD ASPS DECLINED BY 5% DURING 2015 COMPARED TO 2014, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECT OF WEAKNESS IN MOST FOREIGN

CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AND A SHIFT IN MIX TO LOWER-PRICED IPADS.

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES FOR IPAD DECLINED IN 2014 COMPARED TO

2013. IPAD NET SALES AND UNIT SALES GREW IN THE GREATER CHINA AND JAPAN SEGMENTS BUT THIS GROWTH WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN ALL OTHER SEGMENTS. OVERALL IPAD ASPS WERE RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 WITH A SHIFT IN MIX TO

HIGHER-PRICED IPADS BEING OFFSET BY THE OCTOBER 2013 PRICE REDUCTION OF IPAD MINI. ASPS INCREASED IN THE JAPAN AND REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENTS BUT WERE SLIGHTLY DOWN IN OTHER SEGMENTS.

TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NET SALES OF IPAD. IPHONE GROWTH RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE 5S AND 5C IN THE SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR 2013 AND THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS IN

OVER 20 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE IN SEPTEMBER 2014. MAC GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF MACBOOK AIR, MACBOOK PRO AND MAC PRO.

IN 2014 THE JAPAN SEGMENT

GENERATED YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF EVERY MAJOR PRODUCT CATEGORY AND EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN NET SALES OF SERVICES. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN IPHONE WAS DRIVEN BY THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 5S AND 5C IN SEPTEMBER

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2015 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN MIX TO

PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER MARGINS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES. THESE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET PRIMARILY BY HIGHER PRODUCT COST STRUCTURES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY THE EFFECT OF

WEAKNESS IN MOST FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2014 WAS DRIVEN BY

MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING LOWER COMMODITY COSTS, A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN MIX TO PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER MARGINS AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE WEAKNESS IN SEVERAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE

TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, PRICE REDUCTIONS ON SELECT PRODUCTS AND HIGHER COST STRUCTURES ON CERTAIN NEW PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES GROSS MARGIN

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016 TO BE BETWEEN 39% AND 40%. THE FOREGOING STATEMENT REGARDING THE COMPANYS EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016 IS FORWARD-LOOKING AND COULD DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE

COMPANYS FUTURE GROSS MARGINS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS AND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IN

GENERAL, THE COMPANY BELIEVES GROSS MARGINS WILL REMAIN UNDER DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRODUCT PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT

TRANSITIONS, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS, AND POTENTIAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANYS SALES MIX TOWARDS

PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRODUCT PRICING ACTIONS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS EFFECTIVELY AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING GROSS

MARGINS, COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND UPDATED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANYS

CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN 2015 AND 2014 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES,

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR 2015, 2014 AND 2013 DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 35%

DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH WAS GENERATED BY SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND, FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED WHEN SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE

THE U.S. THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DURING 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER FOREIGN TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 WAS RELATIVELY FLAT.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES AND TAX CREDITS OF $7.8

BILLION AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $24.1 BILLION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF

EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND THE AMOUNT OF A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE.

THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2012, AND ALL YEARS PRIOR TO 2010 ARE CLOSED. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. IN MAJOR STATES AND MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, THE YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2003 GENERALLY REMAIN OPEN AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING

AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS

TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

ON JUNE 11, 2014, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED AN OPENING DECISION INITIATING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION AGAINST IRELAND FOR ALLEGED STATE AID TO THE

COMPANY. THE OPENING DECISION CONCERNS THE ALLOCATION OF PROFITS FOR TAXATION PURPOSES OF THE IRISH BRANCHES OF TWO SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS ASSERTIONS ARE WITHOUT MERIT. IF THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION WERE TO CONCLUDE AGAINST IRELAND, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COULD REQUIRE IRELAND TO RECOVER FROM THE COMPANY PAST TAXES COVERING A PERIOD OF UP TO 10 YEARS REFLECTIVE OF THE DISALLOWED STATE AID. WHILE SUCH AMOUNT COULD BE MATERIAL, AS OF

SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT.

FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606) (ASU 2014-09), WHICH AMENDS THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. ASU 2014-09 IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AT AN AMOUNT AN ENTITY EXPECTS TO

BE ENTITLED WHEN PRODUCTS ARE TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS.

THE ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE FOR ASU 2014-09 WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO ADOPT

BEGINNING IN ITS FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. IN AUGUST 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-14, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE, WHICH DEFERS THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASU 2014-09 FOR ONE YEAR AND

PERMITS EARLY ADOPTION AS EARLY AS THE ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASU 2014-09. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY MAY ADOPT THE STANDARD IN EITHER ITS FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 OR 2019. THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD MAY BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR PERIOD

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED THE IPHONE UPGRADE PROGRAM, WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS WHO

PURCHASE AN IPHONE 6S AND 6S PLUS IN ONE OF ITS U.S. PHYSICAL RETAIL STORES AND ACTIVATE THE PURCHASED IPHONE WITH ONE OF THE FOUR NATIONAL CARRIERS. THE IPHONE UPGRADE PROGRAM PROVIDES CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN THAT IPHONE FOR A NEW IPHONE,

PROVIDED CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES THE CUSTOMER TO FINANCE THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE IPHONE WITH A THIRD-PARTY LENDER. UPON EXERCISE OF THE TRADE-IN RIGHT AND PURCHASE OF A NEW IPHONE, THE

COMPANY SATISFIES THE CUSTOMERS OUTSTANDING BALANCE DUE TO THE THIRD-PARTY LENDER ON THE ORIGINAL DEVICE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE TRADE-IN RIGHT AS A GUARANTEE LIABILITY AND RECOGNIZES ARRANGEMENT REVENUE NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH

RIGHT WITH SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE GUARANTEE LIABILITY RECOGNIZED WITHIN REVENUE.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS

DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE

EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF

PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND THE COMPANYS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM

THESE ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANYS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE

RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND

OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANYS SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE

FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED

OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA

ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY

RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. FOR PAYMENT TERMS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANYS STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PAYMENTS BECOME DUE UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE SALES PRICE

IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, SUCH AS A SUCCESSFUL HISTORY OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT CONCESSION, ON COMPARABLE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE

FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.

FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS FUNCTIONALITY,

UNDELIVERED SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE AND/OR UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE COMPANY USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE

(TPE) AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE

COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES, MAC, APPLE WATCH AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT

MAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES TO THE DEVICES ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE AND/OR NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES FREE OF CHARGE. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE

NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ESPS IS DEFERRED AND

RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED.

THE

COMPANYS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, THE COMPANYS ESPS AND THE FUTURE RATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE. FACTORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE INCLUDE THE

UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES OFFERED, THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED

TO BE PROVIDED.

THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE

PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION

HAVE BEEN MET. THE COMPANYS POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS,

THE ESTIMATED COST IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE

COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE

PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A

GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEMS SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS.

VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES

THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, IN THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IMPACT THE COMPANYS NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITYS COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF ANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST;

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO; AND THE COMPANYS INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANYS

ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING

RESULTS.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES

THE COMPANY MUST PURCHASE COMPONENTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND HAS INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS, INCLUDING

CAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN

FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF INVENTORY THAT CONSIDERS

MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS MANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS AND INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE, IT RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE

OF SUCH AN ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND

COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORY AND/OR MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED, UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS, OR SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS SUPPLIERS THAT HOLD ANY OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS OR TO WHOM THE COMPANY HAS MADE AN INVENTORY PREPAYMENT. SUCH WRITE-DOWNS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO INVENTORY ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR

ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES

ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150

DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, A CHANGE IN THE COMPANYS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF

WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS TYPICAL

EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS THESE ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES OR THE CURRENT INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT

FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE

ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ITS REPORTED OPERATING RESULTS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES

OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT

APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT TO BE REALIZED.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL

BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN

50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME

THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL

OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX

LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 10, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT

IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT,

THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR ASSERTED LEGAL AND OTHER CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS, BOTH ON A

STAND-ALONE

BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES. GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY

NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THESE POSITIONS WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. FURTHER, THE RECOGNITION OF THE GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATED TO THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUTSTANDING DEBT. WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO GLOBAL INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, THE COMPANYS INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE MOST SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

U.S. INTEREST RATES. CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGING AND INTEREST PAID

ON THE COMPANYS DEBT.

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY ARE FOCUSED ON PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL AND SUPPORTING THE

COMPANYS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT TO EXECUTE ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ACHIEVE ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES, AND ITS

INVESTMENT POLICY GENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE, WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. TO PROVIDE A

MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD

RESULT IN A $4.3 BILLION AND $3.4 BILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING FLOATING- AND FIXED-RATE NOTES WITH VARYING MATURITIES FOR AN

AGGREGATE CARRYING AMOUNT OF $56.0 BILLION AND $29.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED, AND MAY ENTER IN THE FUTURE, INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS OUTSTANDING TERM DEBT. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE

COMPANY TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED-RATE PAYMENTS INTO FLOATING-RATE PAYMENTS OR FLOATING-RATE PAYMENTS INTO FIXED-RATE PAYMENTS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE CORRESPONDING LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED

HEDGING INSTRUMENT. A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES WOULD CAUSE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE COMPANYS DEBT AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 TO INCREASE BY $200 MILLION AND $110 MILLION ON AN ANNUALIZED

BASIS, RESPECTIVELY.

FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANYS DEBT IS PROVIDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K

IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 6, DEBT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A

STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES

WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION

CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED, AND MAY ENTER IN THE FUTURE, INTO NON-DESIGNATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITS FOREIGN-DENOMINATED DEBT ISSUANCES. THE COMPANYS

PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A PORTION OF ITS MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES, TYPICALLY FOR UP TO 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS AND THE PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE THOUSANDS OF RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $342 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015

COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $240 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, THE LOSS IN FAIR VALUE INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 DUE TO THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGES RATES AND THE COMPANYS ACTUAL EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

APPLE INC. AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY APPLE OR THE COMPANY) DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES AND

MARKETS MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES, PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS, AND SELLS A VARIETY OF RELATED SOFTWARE, SERVICES, ACCESSORIES, NETWORKING SOLUTIONS AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY

SELLS ITS PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES, ONLINE STORES AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, AS WELL AS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SELLS A VARIETY OF

THIRD-PARTY APPLE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING APPLICATION SOFTWARE AND VARIOUS ACCESSORIES THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY SELLS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES AND EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE

BEEN ELIMINATED. IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT ALL ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE NORMAL AND RECURRING IN NATURE, NECESSARY FOR FAIR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. THE PREPARATION OF THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT

ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS 2015, 2014 AND 2013 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, RESPECTIVELY. AN ADDITIONAL WEEK IS INCLUDED IN THE FIRST FISCAL

QUARTER APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS TO REALIGN FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS. FISCAL YEARS 2015, 2014 AND 2013 EACH SPANNED 52 WEEKS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, REFERENCES TO PARTICULAR YEARS, QUARTERS, MONTHS AND PERIODS REFER TO THE

COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS ENDED IN SEPTEMBER AND THE ASSOCIATED QUARTERS, MONTHS AND PERIODS OF THOSE FISCAL YEARS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE

AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE

IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO

EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. FOR PAYMENT TERMS IN EXCESS OF

THE COMPANYS STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PAYMENTS BECOME DUE UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, SUCH AS A SUCCESSFUL HISTORY OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT CONCESSION, ON

COMPARABLE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS,

(II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.

FOR

THE SALE OF MOST THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED TO CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING FOR SUCH PRODUCTS, RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK FOR PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, IS THE

PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. FOR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS SOLD THROUGH THE APP STORE AND MAC APP STORE AND CERTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS AND IS NOT THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR SUCH SALES ON A NET BASIS BY RECOGNIZING IN NET SALES ONLY THE COMMISSION IT RETAINS FROM EACH SALE. THE PORTION OF

THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED TO CUSTOMERS THAT IS REMITTED BY THE COMPANY TO THIRD-PARTY APP DEVELOPERS AND CERTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT OWNERS IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE WHEN IT RECEIVES PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR THE

PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED FOR UNSPECIFIED AND SPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SELLS GIFT CARDS REDEEMABLE AT

ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, AND ALSO SELLS GIFT CARDS REDEEMABLE ON ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, MAC APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE FOR THE PURCHASE OF DIGITAL CONTENT AND SOFTWARE. THE COMPANY RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE UPON THE SALE OF THE CARD, WHICH IS

RELIEVED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE CARD BY THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM APPLECARE SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE COVERAGE PERIODS. APPLECARE SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE

SUPPORT, REPAIR SERVICES, WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS OFFERED UNDER THE COMPANYS STANDARD LIMITED WARRANTY.

THE COMPANY

RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED. FOR

THE COMPANYS OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. REVENUE IS RECORDED NET OF TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WITH THE COLLECTED TAXES RECORDED

AS CURRENT LIABILITIES UNTIL REMITTED TO THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED

SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, AND UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY USES

A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (TPE) AND

(III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANYS BEST

ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES

REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THE VSOE OF EACH ELEMENT, AND IF VSOE DOES NOT EXIST REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN ELEMENTS LACKING VSOE ARE DELIVERED.

FOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH (IOS DEVICES), MAC, APPLE WATCH AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT

MAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES TO THE DEVICES ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE AND/OR NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES FREE OF CHARGE. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED UP TO THREE DELIVERABLES REGULARLY INCLUDED IN ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING

THE SALE OF THESE DEVICES. THE FIRST DELIVERABLE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE ALLOCATED SALES PRICE, IS THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE DEVICE DELIVERED AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE SECOND

DELIVERABLE IS THE EMBEDDED RIGHT INCLUDED WITH QUALIFYING DEVICES TO RECEIVE ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE. THE THIRD DELIVERABLE IS THE NON-SOFTWARE

SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO QUALIFYING DEVICES. THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE BETWEEN THESE DELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THESE DELIVERABLES, THE ALLOCATION OF REVENUE IS BASED

ON THE COMPANYS ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERED HARDWARE AND THE RELATED ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE PROVIDED THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE EMBEDDED

UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED. COST OF SALES RELATED TO

DELIVERED HARDWARE AND RELATED ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ESTIMATED WARRANTY COSTS, ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE. COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES AS INCURRED, AND ENGINEERING AND SALES AND

MARKETING COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS OPERATING EXPENSES AS INCURRED.

THE COMPANYS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ITS ESP FOR DELIVERABLES WITHOUT VSOE

OR TPE CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, PRICES CHARGED BY THE COMPANY AND MARKET TRENDS IN THE PRICING FOR SIMILAR OFFERINGS, PRODUCT

SPECIFIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, LENGTH OF TIME A PARTICULAR VERSION OF A DEVICE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE, ESTIMATED COST TO PROVIDE THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES AND THE RELATIVE ESP OF THE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES AS COMPARED TO THE TOTAL

SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT.

BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY REDUCED THE COMBINED ESPS FOR IOS DEVICES AND MAC BETWEEN $5 AND $10 TO

REFLECT THE INCREASE IN COMPETITIVE OFFERS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS AT LITTLE TO NO COST FOR USERS, WHICH REDUCES THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY COULD REASONABLY CHARGE FOR THESE DELIVERABLES ON A STANDALONE BASIS.

SHIPPING COSTS

AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS RELATED TO SHIPPING

AND HANDLING ARE CLASSIFIED AS REVENUE, AND THE COMPANYS SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF SALES.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY

ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS ACCRUED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(R&D) COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND

ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND AS A RESULT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE EXPENSED AS

INCURRED.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.8 BILLION, $1.2 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION FOR 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES EXPENSE

RELATED TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH IT RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANY OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT

MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CLOSING FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE

DATE OF GRANT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST OVER THE AWARDS REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR TIME-BASED RSUS AND ON A GRADED BASIS FOR RSUS THAT ARE CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE

CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IF AN EXCESS TAX BENEFIT IS REALIZED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION ON R&D TAX CREDITS, FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 9, BENEFIT PLANS.

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED

USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOR

OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE

REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON

EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD

OF BEING REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. SEE NOTE 5, INCOME TAXES FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF

ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES HAD BEEN ISSUED. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNVESTED RSUS. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD, AN

INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT FROM POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANYS MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE

CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES THE CLASSIFICATIONS AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ITS MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AS EITHER SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM BASED ON EACH INSTRUMENTS

UNDERLYING CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATE. MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM. MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM BASED ON THE NATURE OF EACH SECURITY AND ITS AVAILABILITY FOR USE IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. THE COMPANYS MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES BELIEVED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHICH ARE REPORTED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT FAIR VALUE.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF AOCI IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS

IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT, IF ANY, IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A

LIABILITY AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, BOTH THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR TRANSLATION OF THE

NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS

FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES ARE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE

THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AGE OF THE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE BALANCES, CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO PAY.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST,

COMPUTED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD AND NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE THE COST OF INVENTORIES TO THEIR NET REALIZABLE VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANYS INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINISHED GOODS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE

STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER

THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH FOR BUILDINGS IS THE LESSER OF 30 YEARS OR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING BUILDING; BETWEEN ONE TO FIVE YEARS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS

EQUIPMENT; AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR TEN YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS

RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $9.2 BILLION, $6.9

BILLION AND $5.8 BILLION DURING 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR

IMPAIRMENT. LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS

TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES, RATHER SUCH ASSETS ARE REQUIRED TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE

ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING 2015, 2014 AND 2013. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON

ITS CURRENT REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT. IN 2015 AND 2014, THE COMPANYS GOODWILL WAS PRIMARILY

ALLOCATED TO THE AMERICAS AND EUROPE REPORTING UNITS.

THE COMPANY AMORTIZES ITS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWS THESE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY AMORTIZES ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES OVER PERIODS FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY APPLIES FAIR VALUE

ACCOUNTING FOR ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS. THE COMPANY DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE

RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSACT AND THE MARKET-BASED RISK MEASUREMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, SUCH AS

RISKS INHERENT IN VALUATION TECHNIQUES, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND CREDIT RISK. FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED BY APPLYING THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHY, WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE LEVELS AND BASES THE CATEGORIZATION WITHIN

THE HIERARCHY UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS AVAILABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

LEVEL 1

 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS

FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2

 OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS, OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 3

 INPUTS THAT ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS

WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND CERTAIN

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE DERIVED FROM QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND ALL OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

ALL OF WHICH HAVE COUNTERPARTIES WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS, WERE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR MODEL DRIVEN VALUATIONS USING SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS, COMPANIES MAY CHOOSE TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR

VALUE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ANY ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND REMEASUREMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT

AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUE AND EXPENSES FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE RECOGNIZED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCLUDED IN

AOCI IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REMEASURE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, AND INVENTORIES, PROPERTY AND

NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES.

THE COMPANY MAY SELL CERTAIN OF ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION AND DURATION MANAGEMENT. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES GENERALLY RANGE FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE OF ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO BE TEMPORARY IN

NATURE AND DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY OF ITS INVESTMENTS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES, AND ITS INVESTMENT POLICY GENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY

GENERALLY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE, WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHEN EVALUATING AN INVESTMENT

FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT THE COMPANY REVIEWS FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW ITS COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO, CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES

AND THE COMPANYS INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE INVESTMENT BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE INVESTMENTS COST BASIS.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MAY USE

DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ON NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY

MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS AND THE PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE HEDGES WILL OFFSET MORE THAN

A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES.

TO HELP PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM

FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE, AND SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT

THE U.S. DOLLAR AND WHO SELL IN LOCAL CURRENCIES MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTION CONTRACTS OR OTHER

INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THIS RISK AND MAY DESIGNATE THESE INSTRUMENTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE AND INVENTORY PURCHASES, TYPICALLY FOR UP TO 12

MONTHS.

TO HELP PROTECT THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER

INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE CHANGES IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THESE INVESTMENTS DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY USE NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH

AS ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT, AS ECONOMIC HEDGES OF ITS NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN BOTH OF THESE CASES, THE COMPANY DESIGNATES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO NON-DESIGNATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.

THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OPTIONS, OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY OFFSET A PORTION OF CHANGES IN INCOME OR EXPENSE, OR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS TERM DEBT OR INVESTMENTS.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE COMPANYS HEDGED INTEREST RATE TRANSACTIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN 10 YEARS.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE EFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES

ARE RECORDED IN AOCI UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE ARE RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED, AND DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW

HEDGES OF INTEREST INCOME OR EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED INCOME OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS AND AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS TESTING OF CASH FLOW HEDGES

ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A SUBSEQUENT TWO-MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN AOCI ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECLASSIFIED

IMMEDIATELY INTO OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE EFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF NET INVESTMENT

HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AS A PART OF THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS AND AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS TESTING OF NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER

INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATED TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS ALONG WITH A CORRESPONDING LOSS OR GAIN RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM.

NON-DESIGNATED DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED

AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM TO WHICH THE DERIVATIVE RELATES.

THE COMPANY

RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS BASED ON ITS HEDGE DESIGNATION. THE FOLLOWING TABLES SHOW THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS FOR OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME

OUTSTANDING AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COMPANYS GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING OR

UNSETTLED IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED ON

THEN-CURRENT

CURRENCY OR INTEREST RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS

AND MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES CHANGE. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE NOTIONAL AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH

THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET

CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE

CREDIT RISK BY PERMITTING NET SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. TO FURTHER LIMIT CREDIT RISK, THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS THAT PROVIDE FOR COLLATERAL TO BE RECEIVED OR POSTED WHEN THE NET

FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FLUCTUATES FROM CONTRACTUALLY ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS. THE COMPANY PRESENTS ITS DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AT THEIR GROSS FAIR VALUES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE NET CASH

COLLATERAL RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER ITS COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WAS $1.0 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND $2.1 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014.

UNDER MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE COUNTERPARTIES TO THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY IS ALLOWED TO NET

SETTLE TRANSACTIONS WITH A SINGLE NET AMOUNT PAYABLE BY ONE PARTY TO THE OTHER. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THESE RIGHTS OF SET-OFF ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS,

INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF COLLATERAL, WOULD BE A REDUCTION TO BOTH DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF $2.2 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF $78 MILLION AND $549

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES OUTSTANDING WITH ITS THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS,

SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES AND EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK. IN

ADDITION, WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OR BY REQUIRING THIRD-PARTY FINANCING, LOANS OR LEASES TO SUPPORT CREDIT EXPOSURE. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD ONE CUSTOMER THAT REPRESENTED 10% OR MORE OF TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 12%. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD TWO CUSTOMERS THAT REPRESENTED 10% OR MORE OF TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES, ONE OF WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 16% AND THE OTHER 13%. THE COMPANYS CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS ACCOUNTED FOR 71% AND 72% OF TRADE

RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF COMPONENTS TO THESE VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE

SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM THREE OF THE COMPANYS VENDORS ACCOUNTED FOR 38%, 18% AND 14% OF TOTAL VENDOR NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND THREE OF THE COMPANYS VENDORS ACCOUNTED FOR 51%, 16% AND 14% OF TOTAL VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014.

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

TAX POSITIONS ARE EVALUATED IN A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE COMPANY FIRST DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

UPON EXAMINATION. IF A TAX POSITION MEETS THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD IT IS THEN MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO RECOGNIZE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE TAX POSITION IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT

THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES AND UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PAYMENT OR RECEIPT OF CASH WITHIN ONE YEAR AS

NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS

$6.9 BILLION, OF WHICH $2.5 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $4.0 BILLION, OF WHICH $1.4 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD

AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION AND FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND IN MANY

STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE IRS) IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2012, AND ALL YEARS PRIOR TO 2010 ARE CLOSED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL AND

FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. IN MAJOR STATES AND MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, THE YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2003 GENERALLY REMAIN OPEN AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT AN ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX

AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS. ALTHOUGH TIMING OF THE RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE OF AUDITS IS NOT CERTAIN, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WOULD MATERIALLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT

12 MONTHS.

ON JUNE 11, 2014, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED AN OPENING DECISION INITIATING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION AGAINST IRELAND FOR

ALLEGED STATE AID TO THE COMPANY. THE OPENING DECISION CONCERNS THE ALLOCATION OF PROFITS FOR TAXATION PURPOSES OF THE IRISH BRANCHES OF TWO SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS ASSERTIONS ARE WITHOUT

MERIT. IF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WERE TO CONCLUDE AGAINST IRELAND, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COULD REQUIRE IRELAND TO RECOVER FROM THE COMPANY PAST TAXES COVERING A PERIOD OF UP TO 10 YEARS REFLECTIVE OF THE DISALLOWED STATE AID. WHILE SUCH AMOUNT

COULD BE MATERIAL, AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT.

EXCHANGE FOR UP-FRONT PAYMENTS, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DELIVER SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK DURING THE PURCHASE PERIODS OF EACH ASR. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY DELIVERED, AND THEREFORE THE AVERAGE REPURCHASE PRICE PAID

PER SHARE, IS DETERMINED AT THE END OF THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE PERIOD OF EACH ASR BASED ON THE VOLUME WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK DURING THAT PERIOD. THE SHARES RECEIVED ARE RETIRED IN THE PERIODS THEY ARE DELIVERED,

AND THE UP-FRONT PAYMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN THE PERIODS THE PAYMENTS ARE MADE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS THE ASRS AS A REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK IN THE

PERIOD DELIVERED FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE AND AS FORWARD CONTRACTS INDEXED TO ITS OWN COMMON STOCK. THE ASRS MET ALL OF THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION, AND THEREFORE WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

QUARTER OF 2014, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE 2014 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN (THE 2014 PLAN) AND TERMINATED THE COMPANYS AUTHORITY TO GRANT NEW AWARDS UNDER THE 2003 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN (THE 2003 PLAN). THE 2014 PLAN PROVIDES

FOR BROAD-BASED EQUITY GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND PERMITS THE GRANTING OF RSUS, STOCK GRANTS, PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, AS WELL AS CASH BONUS AWARDS. RSUS GRANTED UNDER THE

2014 PLAN GENERALLY VEST OVER FOUR YEARS, BASED ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT, AND ARE SETTLED UPON VESTING IN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS. EACH SHARE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO RSUS GRANTED UNDER THE 2014 PLAN REDUCES THE

NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE PLAN BY TWO SHARES. RSUS CANCELLED AND SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2014 PLAN UTILIZING A FACTOR OF TWO TIMES THE

NUMBER OF RSUS CANCELLED OR SHARES WITHHELD. CURRENTLY, ALL RSUS GRANTED UNDER THE 2014 PLAN HAVE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS (DERS), WHICH ENTITLE HOLDERS OF RSUS TO THE SAME DIVIDEND VALUE PER SHARE AS HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK. DERS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE SAME VESTING AND OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE CORRESPONDING UNVESTED RSUS. DERS ARE ACCUMULATED AND PAID WHEN THE UNDERLYING SHARES VEST. UPON APPROVAL OF THE 2014 PLAN, THE COMPANY RESERVED 385 MILLION SHARES PLUS THE

NUMBER OF SHARES REMAINING THAT WERE RESERVED BUT NOT ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 PLAN. SHARES SUBJECT TO OUTSTANDING AWARDS UNDER THE 2003 PLAN THAT EXPIRE, ARE CANCELLED OR OTHERWISE TERMINATE, OR ARE WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO RSUS, WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS UNDER THE 2014 PLAN. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, APPROXIMATELY 442.9 MILLION SHARES WERE RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2014 PLAN.

OR QUARTERLY VESTING. RSUS GRANTED UNDER THE 2003 PLAN GENERALLY VEST OVER TWO TO FOUR YEARS, BASED ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AND ARE SETTLED UPON VESTING IN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS. ALL RSUS, OTHER THAN RSUS

HELD BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GRANTED UNDER THE 2003 PLAN HAVE DERS. DERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME VESTING AND OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE CORRESPONDING UNVESTED RSUS. DERS ARE ACCUMULATED AND PAID WHEN THE UNDERLYING SHARES VEST. IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT NEW AWARDS UNDER THE 2003 PLAN.

STOCK OPTIONS TO THE COMPANYS NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, (II) PROVIDES FOR AUTOMATIC INITIAL GRANTS OF RSUS UPON A NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR JOINING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND AUTOMATIC ANNUAL GRANTS OF RSUS AT EACH ANNUAL MEETING OF

SHAREHOLDERS, AND (III) PERMITS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO PROSPECTIVELY CHANGE THE RELATIVE MIXTURE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS FOR THE INITIAL AND ANNUAL AWARD GRANTS AND THE METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THESE GRANTS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. EACH SHARE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO RSUS GRANTED UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE PLAN BY TWO SHARES. THE DIRECTOR PLAN EXPIRES

NOVEMBER 9, 2019. ALL RSUS GRANTED UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN ARE ENTITLED TO DERS. DERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME VESTING AND OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE CORRESPONDING UNVESTED RSUS. DERS ARE ACCUMULATED AND PAID WHEN THE UNDERLYING SHARES

VEST. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILLION SHARES WERE RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015, SECTION 16 OFFICERS TIMOTHY D. COOK, ANGELA AHRENDTS, LUCA MAESTRI, DANIEL RICCIO, PHILIP SCHILLER AND

JEFFREY WILLIAMS HAD EQUITY TRADING PLANS IN PLACE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 10B5-1(C)(1) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. AN EQUITY TRADING PLAN IS A WRITTEN DOCUMENT THAT PRE-ESTABLISHES THE AMOUNTS, PRICES AND DATES (OR FORMULA FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS,

THE FAIR VALUE AS OF THE RESPECTIVE VESTING DATES OF RSUS WAS $4.8 BILLION, $3.4 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION FOR 2015, 2014

AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF RSUS THAT VESTED IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WERE NET-SHARE SETTLED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY WITHHELD SHARES WITH VALUE EQUIVALENT TO THE EMPLOYEES MINIMUM STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR THE APPLICABLE INCOME AND

OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES WITHHELD WERE APPROXIMATELY 14.1 MILLION, 15.6 MILLION AND 15.5 MILLION FOR 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE BASED ON THE

VALUE OF THE RSUS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE VESTING DATES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CLOSING STOCK PRICE. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS TO TAXING AUTHORITIES WERE $1.6 BILLION, $1.2 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2015, 2014

AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THESE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENTS HAD THE EFFECT OF SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY AS THEY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD

HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THE VESTING AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANY HAD 1.2 MILLION STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE PER SHARE OF $15.08 AND

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM OF 4.1 YEARS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH ARE EXERCISABLE. THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 WAS $120 MILLION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE PERIOD IN EXCESS OF THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS OUTSTANDING. TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS AT TIME OF EXERCISE WAS $479 MILLION, $1.5

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS

THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN

INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION OF END-USERS OF ITS

OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 OR SEPTEMBER 27, 2014.

IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED THE IPHONE UPGRADE PROGRAM, WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE AN IPHONE 6S AND 6S PLUS IN ONE

OF ITS U.S. PHYSICAL RETAIL STORES AND ACTIVATE THE PURCHASED IPHONE WITH ONE OF THE FOUR NATIONAL CARRIERS. THE IPHONE UPGRADE PROGRAM PROVIDES CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN THAT IPHONE FOR A NEW IPHONE, PROVIDED CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. ONE

OF THE CONDITIONS OF THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES THE CUSTOMER TO FINANCE THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE IPHONE WITH A THIRD-PARTY LENDER. UPON EXERCISE OF THE TRADE-IN RIGHT AND PURCHASE OF A NEW IPHONE, THE COMPANY SATISFIES THE CUSTOMERS

OUTSTANDING BALANCE DUE TO THE THIRD-PARTY LENDER ON THE ORIGINAL DEVICE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE TRADE-IN RIGHT AS A GUARANTEE LIABILITY AND RECOGNIZES ARRANGEMENT REVENUE NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH RIGHT WITH SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE

GUARANTEE LIABILITY RECOGNIZED WITHIN REVENUE.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH

INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION

CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ARE CURRENTLY

OBTAINED FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COMPETES FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKETS FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS. THEREFORE, MANY COMPONENTS USED BY THE

COMPANY, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGE AND SIGNIFICANT PRICING FLUCTUATIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

APPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMONLY USED BY ITS COMPETITORS, AND NEW PRODUCTS

INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING

CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. IF THE COMPANYS SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR IF AN OUTSOURCING PARTNER DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE,

OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS CONCENTRATED ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF

COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF MANY COMPONENTS; HOWEVER,

THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES THAT COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY

OUTSOURCING PARTNERS THAT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF THIS MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ARE THE

SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS AND MANUFACTURERS FOR MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANYS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS.

OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS

OPERATING LEASES

THE COMPANY LEASES VARIOUS EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING RETAIL SPACE, UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CURRENTLY UTILIZE ANY OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE MAJOR FACILITY LEASES ARE TYPICALLY FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING 10 YEARS AND GENERALLY CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL

OF 463 RETAIL STORES. LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR TERMS RANGING FROM FIVE TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS, AND OFTEN CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE COMPANYS TOTAL FUTURE MINIMUM

LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE $6.3 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.6 BILLION RELATED TO LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE.

RENT EXPENSE UNDER

ALL OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH CANCELABLE AND NONCANCELABLE LEASES, WAS $794 MILLION, $717 MILLION AND $645 MILLION IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES HAVING REMAINING TERMS

INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES

COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT

ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF $29.5 BILLION.

IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAD OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS OF $7.3

AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, ENERGY AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY

ADJUDICATED, CERTAIN OF WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS AND IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IN THE OPINION OF

MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR ASSERTED LEGAL AND OTHER CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE

OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN

EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

APPLE INC. V. SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD, ET AL.

ON

AUGUST 24, 2012, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AWARDING THE COMPANY $1.05 BILLION IN ITS LAWSUIT AGAINST SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD AND AFFILIATED PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SAN JOSE DIVISION. ON

MARCH 6, 2014, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED FINAL JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $930 MILLION. ON MAY 18, 2015, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REVERSED IN PART,

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF APPLE INC.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPLE INC. AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, AND THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 26, 2015. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT.

AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF APPLE INC. AT SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), APPLE INC.S INTERNAL

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF APPLE INC.

WE HAVE AUDITED APPLE INC.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (2013 FRAMEWORK) (THE COSO CRITERIA). APPLE INC.S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, APPLE INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, BASED

ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

2015 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF APPLE INC. AND OUR REPORT DATED OCTOBER 28, 2015 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION THEREON.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON AN EVALUATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER

AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT) WERE EFFECTIVE

AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR SUBMITS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS (I) RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE

TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES AND FORMS AND (II) ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE

TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS OVER INTERNAL CONTROLS

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT.

(I)

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE COMPANYS

ASSETS;

(II)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THAT THE

COMPANYS RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND

(III)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE

OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM ARE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS

IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. ALSO, ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS IN FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE RISK THAT THOSE INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE

13A-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT). MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (2013 FRAMEWORK). BASED ON THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ERNST & YOUNG LLP, HAS

ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH APPEARS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

QUARTER OF 2015, WHICH WERE IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH MANAGEMENTS EVALUATION REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH (D) OF RULES 13A-15 AND 15D-15 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT,
