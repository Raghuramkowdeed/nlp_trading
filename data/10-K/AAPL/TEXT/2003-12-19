MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS MARKETS. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE ATTRACTED TO MACINTOSH COMPUTERS FOR A VARIETY OF

REASONS, INCLUDING THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF TRAINING RESULTING FROM THE MACINTOSH COMPUTER'S INTUITIVE EASE OF USE, ADVANCED GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FEATURES OF THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE

PRODUCTS, AND ABILITY OF MACINTOSH COMPUTERS TO NETWORK AND COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS. APPLE PERSONAL COMPUTERS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE LATE

1970S. OVER 18% OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2003 WERE TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING SALES TO ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS.

THE

COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS. NO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 2003, 2002 OR

RESPECTIVELY.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE MARKET FOR THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SALE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED SOFTWARE

AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THIS MARKET CONTINUES TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED

THE CAPABILITIES AND APPLICATIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS, AND HAVE RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SIGNIFICANT PRICE, FEATURE, AND PERFORMANCE COMPETITION. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY

CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS INCLUDE RELATIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN INNOVATION, AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE, PRODUCT

FEATURES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY OF HARDWARE PERIPHERALS, AND CORPORATE REPUTATION. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE

MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER, SIMPLER, AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE

COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY TAKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO RESPOND TO THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BEING PLACED ON ITS PERSONAL COMPUTER SALES AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS IN COMPETING PLATFORMS.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED

FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS.

11

THE COMPANY'S INITIAL SUCCESS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN END-TO-END MUSIC OFFERING, WHICH INCLUDES THE ITUNES DIGITAL MUSIC MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, ITUNES MUSIC STORE AND IPOD

DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER, HAS ALREADY ENCOURAGED SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THIS AREA FROM OTHER COMPANIES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, AND MANUFACTURING RESOURCES THAN THOSE OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT MAINTAINS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BY MORE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING THE ENTIRE END-TO-END MUSIC SOLUTION, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE (IPOD), SOFTWARE

(ITUNES) AND MUSIC CONTENT (ITUNES MUSIC STORE).

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM

MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY WIDE AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND

SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY OR SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS

SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN

ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO

MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL RISKS BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THESE AND OTHER KEY SUPPLIERS ON PRODUCT INTRODUCTION PLANS, STRATEGIC INVENTORIES,

COORDINATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL

PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO

130 DAYS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE AGERE SYSTEMS, INC., AMBIT MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION, ASUSTEK CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., BROADCOM CORPORATION, COMPAL CORPORATION, HON HAI

PRECISION INDUSTRY CO., LTD., IBM CORPORATION, INTERNATIONAL DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY, INVENTEC APPLIANCES CORPORATION, LG. PHILLIPS CO., LTD., MATSUSHITA, MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORPORATION,

MOTOROLA, INC., NVIDIA CORP., QUANTA COMPUTER, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, SYNAPTICS, INC., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO

ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE

AREAS OF HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, SYSTEM SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS, AND THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES,

BEFORE ANY CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, TOTALED $471 MILLION, $446 MILLION, AND $430 MILLION IN 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

12

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PERIPHERAL SYSTEMS, AND SOFTWARE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

REGISTERED, AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR "APPLE," THE APPLE LOGO, "MACINTOSH," AND NUMEROUS OTHER TRADEMARKS

AND SERVICE MARKS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES DEPEND IN PART

ON THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF, THE COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE, AND MARKETING ABILITIES OF ITS PERSONNEL.

MANY

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS

OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS; HOWEVER,

THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH LICENSES COULD BE OBTAINED AT ALL. BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW

PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT

MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY 58% OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN FISCAL 2003 CAME FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS INSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CONDUCTED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, AND CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT,

CALIFORNIA, FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA, TAIWAN, KOREA, THE NETHERLANDS, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC.

CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURE OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCLUDING POWERBOOKS, IBOOKS, AND THE IPOD

ARE PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN JAPAN, TAIWAN AND CHINA. MARGINS ON SALES OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN

SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

INFORMATION

REGARDING FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT

NOTE 11, "SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA."

SEASONAL BUSINESS

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS BUSINESS TO BE HIGHLY SEASONAL, IT HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN ITS FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS, COMPARED

TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE SCHOOL YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. PAST PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE

COMPANY'S FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF

PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR APPLE SOFTWARE AND FOR APPLE SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION,

CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE EXTENDED SERVICE COVERAGE ON MOST APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S MAJOR MARKETS.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG

OFTEN INCREASES IN ANTICIPATION

13

OF

OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BECAUSE OF OVER ORDERING BY DEALERS ANTICIPATING SHORTAGES. BACKLOG OFTEN IS REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN LAWS ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TO DATE HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE SUBJECT OF THESE

LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

PRODUCTION

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMPANY

PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO RETURN TO THE COMPANY PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS

AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES, JAPAN AND CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

RECOGNIZED

IN 2002. IN 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED EMAGIC RESULTING IN A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES WITH NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE. THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED A SIMILAR CHARGE OF $11 MILLION IN 2001 RELATED TO ITS ACQUISITION OF POWERSCHOOL. NET CHARGES RELATED TO COMPANY RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS OF $26 MILLION,

$30 MILLION, $8 MILLION, AND $27 MILLION WERE RECOGNIZED IN 2003, 2002, 2000, AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2000, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE COST OF A SPECIAL EXECUTIVE BONUS FOR

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THIS SECTION AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS FORM 10-K CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CAN ALSO

BE IDENTIFIED BY WORDS SUCH AS "ANTICIPATES," "EXPECTS," "BELIEVES," "PLANS," "PREDICTS," AND SIMILAR TERMS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND THE COMPANY'S

ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE

SUBSECTION ENTITLED "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION" BELOW. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES

THERETO INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ALL INFORMATION

PRESENTED HEREIN IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FISCAL CALENDAR. THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO REVISE OR UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FOR ANY REASON, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY

LAW.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THE COMPANY'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REQUIRES THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND

METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT IT BELIEVES TO BE

REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING TO BE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THAT IS, THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS (I.E., HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERALS), AND EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE

RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 101,

REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS

SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT

BECAUSE THE COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS

20

A

PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED TO NOT BE, FIXED AND DETERMINABLE,

REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE.

THE

COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND OTHER

SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE

COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS OF REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY,

CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS

OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA

AND BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE

DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER,

CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE CREDIT WORTHINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF THOSE SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR

ALL OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH BAD DEBTS, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS,

AND THE AGING OF SUCH RECEIVABLES. IF THERE IS A DETERIORATION OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A

MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON TRADE RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH

WOULD AFFECT EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED

REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH PERIOD THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFECYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE

LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED

21

TO

RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS ARE RECORDED.

THE

COMPANY ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

30 TO 130 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF SUCH AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE.

IF SUCH ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO ITS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, EXCEPT THOSE MADE IN CONJUNCTION

WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, DETERIORATION IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN A GEOGRAPHIC REGION OR BUSINESS SEGMENT IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING DETERIORATION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL RETAIL STORES,

COULD LEAD TO SUCH IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FUTURE PERIODS IN WHICH SUCH BUSINESS ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED.

THE

COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2002. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL BUT INSTEAD PERFORMS A REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, OR EARLIER IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST. THE REVIEW

OF GOODWILL FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND REQUIRES THAT: (1) GOODWILL BE ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS TO WHICH IT RELATES; (2) THE

COMPANY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE REPORTING UNITS TO WHICH THE GOODWILL RELATES;

AND (3) THE COMPANY DETERMINE THE BOOK VALUE OF THOSE REPORTING UNITS. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS WITH ALLOCATED GOODWILL IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THEIR BOOK VALUE, THE

COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE REPORTING UNITS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION FOR AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS. THIS

REQUIRES INDEPENDENT VALUATION OF CERTAIN INTERNALLY DEVELOPED AND UNRECOGNIZED ASSETS INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY. ONCE THIS PROCESS IS

COMPLETE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, CAN BE DETERMINED.

BASED

ON THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S MARKET

CAPITALIZATION, CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECASTS, AND CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL BUSINESS STRUCTURE COULD CAUSE ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNITS TO BE VALUED DIFFERENTLY THEREBY

CAUSING AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. ADDITIONALLY, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND CHANGES IN GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY MAY STRATEGICALLY REALIGN

ITS RESOURCES AND CONSIDER RESTRUCTURING, DISPOSING, OR OTHERWISE EXITING BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, OR GOODWILL.

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF FAILURE RATES. EACH

QUARTER, THE COMPANY REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS

22

AS

NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX

CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED

TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE DETERMINED NOT TO BE REALIZABLE IN THE

FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. SIMILARLY, IF THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY REALIZES DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WERE

PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE UNREALIZABLE, THE RESPECTIVE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE REVERSED, RESULTING IN A POSITIVE ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION,

THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER

INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FISCAL YEAR 2003 VERSUS 2002

NET SALES INCREASED $465 MILLION OR 8% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DECLINED 3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO APPROXIMATELY

3 MILLION UNITS IN 2003. SEVERAL FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED FAVORABLY TO NET SALES DURING 2003 INCLUDING.



THE

RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES GREW TO $621 MILLION DURING 2003 FROM $283 MILLION IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF 119%. WHILE THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS MAY ELECT TO

PURCHASE PRODUCT FROM THEIR LOCAL APPLE RETAIL STORE RATHER THAN THROUGH OTHER PREEXISTING SALES CHANNELS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S

NET SALES IS INCREMENTAL TO TOTAL NET SALES. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING "SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE."



NET

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE ROSE $384 MILLION OR 57% DURING 2003 COMPARED 2002, WHICH FOLLOWS A $287 MILLION OR 74% INCREASE IN 2002 AS

COMPARED TO 2001. THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE $202 MILLION, OR 141%, YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPOD NET SALES TO $345 MILLION. ALL OF

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN IPOD NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2003. IPOD SALES DURING 2003 WERE FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF SUBSTANTIALLY

REDESIGNED NEW MODELS, WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH BOTH MACINTOSH AND WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND BY THE COMPANY'S INTRODUCTION OF ITS ITUNES MUSIC STORE FOR THE MACINTOSH OPERATING SYSTEM IN

APRIL 2003. THE COMPANY'S IPOD DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER IS SOLD BY A VARIETY OF RESELLERS, MANY OF WHICH DO NOT CURRENTLY MARKET THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED THIS

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK DURING 2003, WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN IPOD UNIT SALES OF 146%.

IN

ADDITION TO THE IPOD, THE INCREASE IN NET SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE DURING 2003 ALSO REFLECTS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES OF OTHER COMPUTER ACCESSORIES INCLUDING AIRPORT CARDS

AND BASE STATIONS, WHICH FACILITATE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY; THIRD PARTY DIGITAL CAMERAS AND PRINTERS; AND A NUMBER OF PORTABLE COMPUTER RELATED ACCESSORIES.



ALTHOUGH

TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE DOWN 3% IN 2003, UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE SYSTEMS WERE RELATIVELY STRONG PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 69% OR 247,000 UNIT

INCREASE IN POWERBOOK UNIT SALES, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY A 4% OR 30,000 UNIT DECREASE IN IBOOK UNIT SALES. THE INCREASE IN POWERBOOK NET SALES OF $468 MILLION OR 56% IS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SUCCESS

OF THE COMPANY'S NEW 12-INCH, 15-INCH AND 17-INCH MODELS THAT WERE INTRODUCED DURING 2003. THE DECLINE IN IBOOK CONSUMER PORTABLE SALES DURING 2003 IS PRIMARILY DUE

TO A LOWER AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT. PORTABLE SYSTEMS REPRESENTED 42% OF ALL MACINTOSH SYSTEMS SOLD IN 2003 VERSUS 33% IN 2002 AND 31% IN 2001, WHICH REFLECTS AN OVERALL INDUSTRY TREND TOWARDS PORTABLE

SYSTEMS.



THE

COMPANY'S AVERAGE NET SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD INCREASED 2% TO $1,491 IN 2003 AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS CHANGES IN OVERALL UNIT MIX TOWARDS RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED

POWERBOOK SYSTEMS AND AN INCREASE IN DIRECT SALES PRIMARILY FROM THE COMPANY'S RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, OFFSET BY SOMEWHAT LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRICING ON COMPARABLE MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH PRODUCT LINES IN RESPONSE TO INDUSTRY PRICING PRESSURE, PARTICULARLY WITH THE COMPANY'S

25

IBOOK

CONSUMER PORTABLE SYSTEMS. POWERBOOK AND POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS ACCOUNTED FOR 42% OF TOTAL UNIT SALES IN 2003 VERSUS 36% IN 2002.



NET

SALES OF SOFTWARE INCREASED $55 MILLION OR 18% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND REFLECTS HIGHER NET SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED APPLICATION AND SERVER

SOFTWARE AND THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE. NET SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED APPLICATION AND SERVER SOFTWARE INCREASED DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SEVERAL NEW SOFTWARE TITLES DURING THE YEAR INCLUDING FINAL CUT EXPRESS, ILIFE, AND KEYNOTE,

AS WELL AS FROM HIGHER SALES OF SOFTWARE RELATED TO RECENT ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING POWERSCHOOL AND EMAGIC. GROWTH IN NET SALES OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DURING 2003 WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT DUE TO STRONG SALES OF SOFTWARE BY THE COMPANY'S ONLINE STORE AND ITS RETAIL SEGMENT.



SERVICE

AND OTHER SALES ROSE $69 MILLION OR 30% DURING 2003 AND RESULTS FROM SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH

APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN (APP) EXTENDED MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S INTERNET RELATED SERVICES. INCREASED NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH APP ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

INCREASING ATTACH RATES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. INCREASED NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNET SERVICES ARE DUE TO NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE INTRODUCED IN APRIL 2003 AND

INCREASED NET SALES OF THE COMPANY'S .MAC INTERNET SERVICE.

OFFSETTING

THE FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S NET SALES DURING 2003 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.



TOTAL

UNIT SALES OF DESKTOP SYSTEMS FELL 15% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. IMAC SYSTEMS UNIT SALES DECLINED 16% FROM 2003 TO 2002 RESULTING FROM A SHIFT IN SALES AWAY FROM

DESKTOP SYSTEMS IN FAVOR OF PORTABLES. ALSO, THE CURRENT FLAT PANEL IMAC FORM FACTOR WAS IN THE EIGHTH QUARTER OF ITS LIFE CYCLE BY THE END OF 2003 AND DID NOT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS

UNTIL THE RELEASE OF THE 20-INCH FLAT-PANEL IMAC IN NOVEMBER 2003.



UNIT

SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS FELL 13% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, UNIT SALES OF POWER

MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DECREASED 24%, WHICH IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DECLINE OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS SALES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY DURING RECENT YEARS AND IS ALSO BELIEVED TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

DELAYS IN PURCHASING PENDING THE RELEASE OF THE POWER MAC G5. AS EXPECTED, THIS TREND REVERSED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 WITH UNIT SALES INCREASING 26% DURING THE QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE SAME

PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE LARGELY TO THE NEW POWER MAC G5, WHICH THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IN JUNE 2003 AND BEGAN SHIPPING AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003. THE DECLINE IN POWER MACINTOSH SALES OVER

THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ALSO REFLECTS THE SHIFT IN SALES TO PORTABLE SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY POWERBOOKS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS ARE HAVING A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE DELAYED UPGRADES OF THEIR

SYSTEMS IN ANTICIPATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE VENDORS TRANSITIONING THEIR PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED MACINTOSH SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS TO RUN NATIVELY ON MAC OS X. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MANY APPLICATIONS THAT

RUN NATIVELY ON MAC OS X, INCLUDING ADOBE'S PHOTOSHOP 7 AND QUARKXPRESS 6; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY POWER MACINTOSH

UNITS.



THE

COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE ONGOING WEAKNESS IN ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2003. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN U.S. EDUCATION DURING 2003 WERE DOWN 4% AND

6%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO 2002. THIS DECLINE WAS DUE TO A DECREASE IN K-12 SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN HIGHER EDUCATION SALES. NET SALES DECLINED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT

OF A CONTINUED SHIFT IN MIX AWAY FROM HIGHER PRICED POWER MACINTOSH AND IMAC SYSTEMS TOWARDS LOWER PRICED EMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DID EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES OF

ITS POWERBOOK SYSTEMS PRIMARILY TO HIGHER EDUCATION CUSTOMERS. PORTABLE SYSTEMS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 43% OF TOTAL UNIT SALES IN THE EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2003, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY

34% IN 2002.

26

THE

COMPANY'S ONE-TO-ONE (1:1) LEARNING SOLUTIONS ARE A COMPLETE SOLUTION CONSISTING OF AN IBOOK PORTABLE SYSTEM FOR EVERY STUDENT AND TEACHER ALONG WITH A WIRELESS NETWORK

CONNECTED TO A CENTRAL SERVER. THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN 1:1 LEARNING SOLUTIONS AND, ACCORDINGLY, HAS EXPERIENCED A LOWER SALES PRICE PER UNIT, ON AVERAGE, IN THESE

TRANSACTIONS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES WEAKNESS IN ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL, PARTICULARLY K-12, HAS BEEN CAUSED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING FUNDING PRESSURES DUE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LARGE

BUDGET DEFICITS IN MANY STATES, AND INCREASED COMPETITION PARTICULARLY FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN STEPS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS, TO ADDRESS WEAKNESS IN THE U.S.

EDUCATION CHANNEL, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE WHEN AND IF THIS NEGATIVE TREND WILL REVERSE.



THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IN GENERAL, AND THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY, CONTINUE TO SEE RELATIVELY SOFT DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. SALES OF PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER

ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS REMAIN FAR BELOW LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN FISCAL 2000 AND EARLIER. DIFFICULT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS EXACERBATED BY THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES HAVE CLEARLY HAD A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN VIRTUALLY ALL

OF ITS MARKETS. FURTHER, GROWTH IN THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS SLOWED DUE TO THE HIGH MARKET PENETRATION OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND A LENGTHENING OF CONSUMER, CREATIVE, AND BUSINESS

PERSONAL COMPUTER UPGRADE CYCLES.

FISCAL YEAR 2002 VERSUS 2001

NET SALES INCREASED $379 MILLION OR 7% DURING 2002 COMPARED TO 2001, WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR AT

APPROXIMATELY 3.1 MILLION UNITS. ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, PERFORMANCE IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET WAS RELATIVELY STRONG, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT,

WHICH OPERATED DURING 2002 EXCLUSIVELY IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE EUROPEAN AND JAPANESE MARKETS REMAINED SLUGGISH THROUGHOUT 2002. THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2002 WERE POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY

A NUMBER OF FACTORS.



FIRST,

NET SALES FROM SOFTWARE, SERVICE, PERIPHERALS, AND OTHER SOURCES ROSE $248 MILLION OR 26% IN 2002 VERSUS 2001. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS

INCLUDING A 28% INCREASE IN COMBINED THIRD-PARTY AND APPLE-BRANDED SOFTWARE SALES; $143 MILLION IN NET SALES OF IPOD, THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE

FIRST HALF OF 2002; A 9% INCREASE IN THE SALE OF COMPUTER ACCESSORIES; AND A 14% INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE CAUSED PRIMARILY BY INCREASED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH EXTENDED MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. THE GROWTH IN SOFTWARE REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED SALES OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE IN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES AND EXPANSION IN RECENT YEARS IN THE NUMBER OF

APPLE-BRANDED SOFTWARE TITLES.



SECOND,

OVERALL UNIT SALES OF MACINTOSH PORTABLE SYSTEMS GREW BY 92,000 UNITS OR 10% IN 2002 REFLECTING A GENERAL TREND IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET AWAY FROM DESKTOP

SYSTEMS TOWARDS PORTABLE SYSTEMS. DURING 2002, PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS REPRESENTED 33% OF TOTAL SYSTEMS SALES VERSUS 31% IN 2001 AND 20% IN 2000. GROWTH IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN MOST PRONOUNCED FOR

IBOOK, THE COMPANY'S EDUCATION AND CONSUMER ORIENTED PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEM. IBOOK UNIT SALES INCREASED 14% IN 2002 AND 9% IN 2001.



THIRD,

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT GREW FROM 8 STORES AT THE END OF 2001 TO 40 STORES AT THE END OF 2002. THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES GREW FROM $19 MILLION IN

2001 TO $283 MILLION IN 2002. WHILE THE RETAIL SEGMENT MAY HAVE CANNIBALIZED SOME NET SALES FROM THE COMPANY'S PREEXISTING SALES CHANNELS IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY BELIEVED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES WAS INCREMENTAL TO THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING "SEGMENT OPERATING

PERFORMANCE."

27



FOURTH,

THE COMPANY'S AVERAGE UNIT PRICING INCREASED 3% DURING 2002 AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS CHANGES IN OVERALL UNIT MIX OFFSET BY SOMEWHAT LOWER PRICING

YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON COMPARATIVE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. NET SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD DURING 2002 OF $1,462 PER UNIT REFLECTED THE SHIFT IN MIX TOWARDS RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED

PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND REFLECTED THE IMPACT ON NET SALES OF THE RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED NEW IMAC DESIGN INTRODUCED DURING 2002. THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES IN MIX WERE OFFSET BY THE DECLINE

IN UNIT SALES OF RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND BY LOWER PRICING ON COMPARATIVE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DURING 2002 FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH PRODUCT LINES IN RESPONSE TO

INDUSTRY PRICING PRESSURE.



FIFTH,

ANY COMPARISON OF NET SALES IN 2002 VERSUS 2001 MUST CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF UNUSUALLY LOW NET SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001. THIS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL

FACTORS AT THE BEGINNING OF 2001, INCLUDING CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, REBATE PROGRAMS AND PRICE CUTS INSTITUTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THAT QUARTER THAT COST

THE COMPANY APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION, AND A PLAN IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 THAT REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

THAT RESULTED IN A DECLINE IN CHANNEL INVENTORY OF APPROXIMATELY 300,000 UNITS DURING THAT QUARTER.

OFFSETTING

THE FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2002 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY SEVERAL NOTABLE FACTORS.



FIRST,

UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS FELL 18% DURING 2002 AS COMPARED TO 2001. THIS FOLLOWED A 35% DECLINE IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN 2001 FROM 2000. THE

COMPANY BELIEVED THAT WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAD A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS AND THAT MANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS CONTINUED TO

DELAY UPGRADES OF THEIR POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DUE TO THE COMPANY'S ONGOING TRANSITION TO MAC OS X, ITS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM, AND IN ANTICIPATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE VENDORS TRANSITIONING THEIR

MACINTOSH APPLICATIONS TO RUN NATIVELY IN MAC OS X. FURTHER, THE COMPANY DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN POWER MACINTOSH SALES THAT IT EXPECTED FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION

OF ADOBE'S PHOTOSHOP 7 DURING 2002. ADDITIONALLY, MANY PROFESSIONAL USERS MAY HAVE POSTPONED UPGRADING THEIR SYSTEMS UNTIL AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF MAC OS X JAGUAR RELEASED IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. OTHERS MAY HAVE DELAYED UPGRADING UNTIL AFTER THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR MAC OS X SUCH AS QUARKXPRESS.



SECOND,

DESPITE THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING 2002 IN THE AMERICAS, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO SEE WEAKNESS IN ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL. TOTAL NET SALES IN THIS

CHANNEL FELL 15% IN 2002 AND 4% IN 2001. THESE DECLINES WERE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY DATA THAT SHOWED THE COMPANY LOSING MARKET SHARE IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO FISCAL

YEARS. THE COMPANY BELIEVED THIS WEAKNESS WAS CAUSED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION IN THIS PRICE SENSITIVE MARKET FROM THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS-BASED

PERSONAL COMPUTERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S EDUCATION CUSTOMERS APPEARED TO BE DELAYING TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE WEAKER ECONOMY ON THEIR

AVAILABLE FUNDING.



THIRD,

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IN GENERAL AND THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY EXPERIENCED SOFT DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS DUE TO ADVERSE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL

UNCERTAINTIES, AND A LENGTHENING OF CONSUMER, CREATIVE, AND BUSINESS PERSONAL COMPUTER UPGRADE CYCLES.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, EXCEPT FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.

THE JAPAN SEGMENT INCLUDES ONLY JAPAN, EXCEPT FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE RETAIL SEGMENT CURRENTLY OPERATES

28

APPLE-OWNED

RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OPENED ITS FIRST INTERNATIONAL STORE IN TOKYO, JAPAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004. EACH REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT NOTE 11, "SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA."

AMERICAS

NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT DURING 2003 INCREASED $50 MILLION OR 2% COMPARED TO 2002. DURING 2003 AND 2002, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 51% AND

55%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 54% AND 56%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. THE RESULTS OF THE AMERICAS SEGMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THE

OVERALL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY AS THEY REFLECT SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER UNIT SALES AND NET SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND IMAC SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN UNIT SALES AND NET SALES OF

POWERBOOKS. THE NET SALES OF THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, AND THE COMPANY IN TOTAL, ALSO REFLECT SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER SALES OF PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 DUE PRIMARILY

TO HIGHER SALES OF IPODS AND

INTERNET SERVICES. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY WEAKNESS IN ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL. AS NOTED ABOVE, TOTAL NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN THE U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2003

WERE DOWN 4% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS DECLINE IS CAUSED BY INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET AND BY A REDUCTION IN SPENDING BY

U.S. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS DUE TO FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING CONCERNS AND TAX REVENUE SHORTFALLS RESULTING FROM THE WEAK ECONOMY. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE DECLINE DURING 2003 IN NET SALES AND UNIT

SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT WHOSE NET SALES, ALL OF WHICH OCCURRED WITHIN THE U.S., INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

DURING 2003.

NET

SALES FOR THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED 3% OR $94 MILLION IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN U.S. EDUCATION SALES IN 2002 OF

$215 MILLION. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT ALSO EXPERIENCED A 17% DECLINE IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. HOWEVER, OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL, UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER DESKTOP AND PORTABLE

SYSTEMS REBOUNDED FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES EXPERIENCED IN 2001, RISING A COMBINED 31% IN 2002. SALES OF SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, AND ACCESSORIES WERE ALSO UP IN THE AMERICAS DURING 2002. GROWTH IN

UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER ORIENTED SYSTEMS DURING 2002 IN THE AMERICAS IS SOMEWHAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIGNIFICANTLY DEPRESSED LEVEL OF NET SALES EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 AS DISCUSSED

ABOVE. HOWEVER, GROWTH IN THE AMERICAS WAS SOMEWHAT NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER-ORIENTED SYSTEMS, BY THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT IN THE U.S.

MORE THAN 70% OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DURING 2002 WERE FOR IMACS AND IBOOKS.

EUROPE

NET SALES IN EUROPE INCREASED $58 MILLION OR 5% DURING 2003 AS COMPARED TO 2002 WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DECLINED BY 5% DURING THE SAME PERIOD. EUROPE'S OPERATING

RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE TREND EXPERIENCED IN THE AMERICAS AND BY THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE. EUROPE EXPERIENCED WEAKENED DEMAND FOR POWER MACINTOSH, IMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS IN 2003, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY STRONG DEMAND FOR POWERBOOKS WHOSE NET SALES INCREASED BY 48% OR $100 MILLION FROM 2002. EUROPE ALSO REALIZED INCREASED SALES OF PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICE, PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SALES OF IPODS, ACCESSORIES AND APP.

ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN EUROPE REMAINED WEAK THROUGHOUT 2002, AND THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN THAT REGION REMAINED FLAT DURING 2002 VERSUS 2001. UNIT SALES IN EUROPE FOR 2002

REFLECT RELATIVELY STRONGER DEMAND FOR CONSUMER-ORIENTED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IBOOK WHOSE UNIT SALES INCREASED 27% IN 2002, OFFSET BY DECLINES IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES.

JAPAN

NET SALES IN JAPAN DECREASED $12 MILLION OR 2% DURING 2003 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, THE WEAKEST YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS. JAPAN'S MACINTOSH UNIT

29

SALES

WERE PARTICULARLY WEAK IN 2003, DECLINING 12%, AND WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER SALES OF IMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POWERBOOK SALES AS WELL AS HIGHER

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE. JAPAN'S MACINTOSH UNIT SALES REMAIN SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE SEGMENT'S HISTORIC LEVELS DUE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT REMAIN PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE IN

JAPAN.

NET

SALES IN JAPAN REMAINED FLAT DURING 2002 VERSUS 2001, WITH A SLIGHT DECLINE IN UNIT SALES OF 2%. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S OTHER GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS, DURING 2002 JAPAN SHOWED GROWTH

IN UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER SYSTEMS AND A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. JAPAN'S IMAC UNIT SALES INCREASED 85% IN 2002. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF JAPAN THE INCREASE IN IMAC UNIT

SHIPMENTS IN 2002 VERSUS 2001 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE UNUSUALLY DEPRESSED LEVEL OF NET SALES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, NET SALES

IN JAPAN ON A SEQUENTIAL AND YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARATIVE BASIS GENERALLY WORSENED AS 2002 PROGRESSED REFLECTING PARTICULARLY POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN JAPAN.

RETAIL

THE COMPANY OPENED 25 NEW RETAIL STORES DURING 2003, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OPEN STORES TO 65 AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, WHICH COMPARES TO 40 OPEN STORES AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 AND 8 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2001. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY OPENED 9 ADDITIONAL STORES INCLUDING ITS FIRST INTERNATIONAL STORE IN

THE GINZA IN TOKYO, JAPAN. THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES GREW TO $621 MILLION DURING 2003 FROM $283 MILLION IN 2002 AND FROM $19 MILLION IN 2001. THE $338 MILLION OR 119%

INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING 2003 REFLECTS THE IMPACT FROM OPENING 25 NEW STORES IN 2003, THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF 2002 STORE OPENINGS, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE. TOTAL

MACINTOSH SALES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION OF WHICH $108 MILLION RELATED TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN POWERBOOK SALES. THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS ALSO

CONTRIBUTED STRONGLY TO THE INCREASES IN NET SALES OF PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY DURING 2003. DURING 2003, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES CAME

FROM THE SALE OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES AS COMPARED TO 28% FOR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 54 STORES OPEN DURING 2003, THE RETAIL SEGMENT

ACHIEVED ANNUALIZED REVENUE PER STORE OF APPROXIMATELY $11.5 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $10.2 MILLION BASED ON AN AVERAGE OF 28 STORES OPEN IN 2002.

AS

MEASURED BY THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENT REPORTING, THE RETAIL SEGMENT IMPROVED FROM A LOSS OF $22 MILLION DURING 2002 TO A LOSS OF $5 MILLION DURING 2003. THIS IMPROVEMENT IS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT'S YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVERAGE ON OCCUPANCY, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER FIXED COSTS.

EXPANSION

OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS, PERSONNEL, AND OTHER

OPERATING EXPENSES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT SINCE ITS INCEPTION TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $290 MILLION THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL 2003, $92 MILLION OF WHICH

WAS INCURRED DURING 2003. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY 1,300 EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE SPACE AND

RELATED FACILITIES OF $354 MILLION. THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE ITS RETAIL SEGMENT OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. INVESTMENT IN A NEW BUSINESS MODEL SUCH AS THE RETAIL SEGMENT IS INHERENTLY RISKY, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

INVOLVED, THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE, AND THE FIXED NATURE OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S OPERATING EXPENSES.

GROSS

MARGIN DECREASED TO 27.5% OF NET SALES IN 2003 FROM 27.9% OF NET SALES IN 2002. THIS DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN REFLECTS RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE PRICING ACTIONS ON SEVERAL MACINTOSH MODELS INSTITUTED

BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN LATE FISCAL 2002 AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, LOWER SALES OF RELATIVELY HIGHER MARGIN POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DURING

THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2003, AND INCREASED AIR FREIGHT AND MANUFACTURING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION RAMP-UP OF THE NEW POWER MAC G5 AND 15-INCH

POWERBOOK, BOTH OF WHICH BEGAN SHIPPING IN VOLUME DURING SEPTEMBER 2003. THIS DECLINE IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RISE IN CERTAIN COMPONENT COSTS AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED. THE AFOREMENTIONED

NEGATIVE FACTORS AFFECTING GROSS MARGINS DURING 2003 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN HIGHER MARGIN SOFTWARE AND DIRECT SALES.

THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS GROSS MARGIN AND THE GROSS MARGIN OF THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY WILL REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2004 IN LIGHT OF WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

PRICE COMPETITION IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, AND POTENTIAL INCREASES IN COMPONENT PRICING. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR AIR FREIGHT CHARGES ON THE POWER MAC G5 AND

OTHER PRODUCTS DURING 2004.

THE

FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN DURING 2004, GENERAL DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, ANTICIPATED INDUSTRY COMPONENT PRICING, ANTICIPATED AIR FREIGHT CHARGES, AND

FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT GROSS MARGINS WILL BE MAINTAINED, TARGETED GROSS MARGIN LEVELS WILL BE ACHIEVED, OR CURRENT MARGINS ON EXISTING

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL BE MAINTAINED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED

INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES, AND

POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING HIGHER UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS WITH LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE DOWNWARD PRESSURES, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRICING ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY

COSTS AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING STRATEGY AND PRICING TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OVER TIME; HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

COMPANY ORDERS COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILDS INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE

IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD-PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND OUTSTANDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND TO

RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

GROSS

MARGIN INCREASED TO 27.9% OF NET SALES IN 2002 FROM 23.0% IN 2001. GROSS MARGIN IN 2001 WAS UNUSUALLY LOW RESULTING FROM NEGATIVE GROSS MARGIN OF 2% EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001. AS

A

31

PERCENTAGE

OF NET SALES, THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY GROSS MARGINS DECLINED DURING FISCAL 2002 FROM 31% IN THE FIRST QUARTER DOWN TO 26% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THIS DECLINE RESULTED FROM SEVERAL FACTORS

INCLUDING A RISE IN COMPONENT COSTS AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED AND AGGRESSIVE PRICING BY THE COMPANY ACROSS ITS PRODUCTS LINES INSTITUTED AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURES IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY'S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY RELIED UPON INNOVATION TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. R&D EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO

APPROXIMATELY 8% OF TOTAL NET SALES DURING 2003, 2002 AND 2001, UP SUBSTANTIALLY FROM APPROXIMATELY 5% OF TOTAL NET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2000 AND RECENT EARLIER PERIODS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT MAINTAINING OR INCREASING THE PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS THE BEST WAY TO RESPOND TO CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO POSITION THE COMPANY

FOR FUTURE GROWTH AS CONDITIONS IMPROVE. R&D EXPENSE INCREASED 6% OR $25 MILLION TO $471 MILLION IN 2003 AS COMPARED TO 2002, WHICH FOLLOWS A $16 MILLION INCREASE IN 2002 AS

COMPARED TO 2001. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE RELATES PRIMARILY TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND SUPPORT FOR NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. R&D SPENDING ALSO INCLUDED CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $14.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X PANTHER IN 2003; APPROXIMATELY $13.3 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF

MAC OS X JAGUAR AND APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE POWERSCHOOL ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN 2002; AND APPROXIMATELY $5.4 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF MAC OS X IN 2001. FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (SG&A)

SG&A INCREASED $103 MILLION OR 9% DURING 2003 AS COMPARED TO 2002 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND INCREASES IN HEADCOUNT.

THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CURRENT YEAR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING AND BY SAVINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2003 AND 2002 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

DESCRIBED BELOW.

SG&A

DECREASED $29 MILLION OR 3% DURING 2002 AS COMPARED TO 2001. THE DECREASE IN SG&A IN 2002 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES,

DECREASED SPENDING RELATED TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND BENEFITS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS IN 2002 AND 2001. THE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES EXPENSE IN

2002 RESULTING FROM INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT.

32

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS THAT RESULTED IN RECOGNITION OF A TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF

$2.8 MILLION. THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE SECOND QUARTER WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUPPLEMENTAL TO ACTIONS INITIATED IN THE PRIOR TWO QUARTERS AND FOCUSED ON FURTHER HEADCOUNT

REDUCTIONS IN VARIOUS SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS IN THE COMPANY'S AMERICAS AND EUROPE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND FURTHER REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH POWERSCHOOL RELATED ACTIVITIES IN THE AMERICAS

OPERATING SEGMENT. THE SECOND QUARTER ACTIONS RESULTED IN RECOGNITION OF SEVERANCE COSTS OF $2.4 MILLION FOR TERMINATION OF 93 EMPLOYEES, 92 OF WHOM WERE TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE END OF 2003 AT

A COST OF $2.2 MILLION. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, AN ADDITIONAL $400,000 WAS ACCRUED FOR ASSET WRITE-OFFS AND LEASE PAYMENTS ON AN ABANDONED FACILITY IN THE AMERICAS

OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL REDUCE QUARTERLY OPERATING EXPENSES BY $1.5 MILLION.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WITH A TOTAL COST OF $24 MILLION THAT RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS AT THE COMPANY-OWNED FACILITY IN SINGAPORE, FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN HEADCOUNT RESULTING FROM THE SHIFT IN POWERSCHOOL PRODUCT STRATEGY THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, AND

TERMINATION OF VARIOUS SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF 260 POSITIONS WORLDWIDE, ALL BUT ONE WAS

ELIMINATED BY THE END OF 2003. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL REDUCE QUARTERLY OPERATING EXPENSES BY $6 MILLION.

DURING

FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $30 MILLION RELATED TO ACTIONS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND BETTER ALIGN THE COMPANY'S OPERATING EXPENSES

WITH EXISTING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE COST OF CONTINUING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL RESULT IN REDUCED QUARTERLY OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION.

OF

THE $30 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE FOR FISCAL 2002, $6 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 RELATED TO ACTIONS DESIGNED TO REDUCE HEADCOUNT COSTS IN CORPORATE

OPERATIONS AND SALES AND TO ADJUST ITS POWERSCHOOL PRODUCT STRATEGY. HEADCOUNT ACTIONS, PRIMARILY IN CORPORATE OPERATIONS, SALES, AND POWERSCHOOL RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, RESULTED IN THE

ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 180 POSITIONS WORLDWIDE AT A COST OF $1.8 MILLION. THE SHIFT IN PRODUCT STRATEGY AT POWERSCHOOL INCLUDED DISCONTINUING DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF A POWERSCHOOL

PRODUCT THAT RESULTED IN THE IMPAIRMENT OF PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCT IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.5 MILLION. THE REMAINING CHARGE IN 2002 OF $24 MILLION

WAS INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 AND RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 425 POSITIONS WORLDWIDE, AT A COST OF $8 MILLION. POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED PRIMARILY IN THE COMPANY'S

OPERATIONS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ALSO INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S INFORMATION SYSTEMS STRATEGY RESULTING IN

TERMINATION OF EQUIPMENT LEASES AND CANCELLATION OF EXISTING PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES. RELATED LEASE AND CONTRACT CANCELLATION CHARGES TOTALED $12 MILLION, AND CHARGES FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

TOTALED $4 MILLION. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY REVERSED THE REMAINING UNUSED ACCRUAL OF $600,000.

PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D)

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED EMAGIC GMBH, A PROVIDER OF PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS FOR COMPUTER BASED MUSIC PRODUCTION, FOR APPROXIMATELY

$30 MILLION IN CASH; $551,000 OF WHICH WAS ALLOCATED TO IPR&D. THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO IPR&D WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION, BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF

PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE IPR&D RELATES PRIMARILY TO EMAGIC'S LOGIC SERIES TECHNOLOGY AND EXTENSIONS. AT THE DATE OF THE

ACQUISITION, THE PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WERE BETWEEN 43%-83% COMPLETE, AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINING WORK WOULD BE COMPLETED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2003 AT A COST OF

APPROXIMATELY $415,000. THE REMAINING EFFORTS, WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN 2003, INCLUDED FINALIZING USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED

33

USING

THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED

NET CASH FLOWS BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 25%.

IN

MAY 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED POWERSCHOOL, INC., A PROVIDER OF WEB-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR K-12 SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS THAT ENABLES SCHOOLS TO

RECORD, ACCESS, REPORT, AND MANAGE THEIR STUDENT DATA AND PERFORMANCE IN REAL-TIME, AND GIVES PARENTS REAL-TIME WEB ACCESS TO TRACK THEIR CHILDREN'S PROGRESS. OF TOTAL PURCHASE

CONSIDERATION OF $66.1 MILLION, $10.8 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO IPR&D AND WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT BEEN

ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE IPR&D RELATES TO TECHNOLOGIES REPRESENTING PROCESSES AND EXPERTISE EMPLOYED TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND DEPLOY A FUNCTIONING, SCALABLE

WEB-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR USE BY K-12 SCHOOLS. AT THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, THE POWERSCHOOL PRODUCT UNDER DEVELOPMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 50% COMPLETE, AND IT

WAS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINING 50% WOULD BE COMPLETED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2002 AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $9.25 MILLION. THE REMAINING EFFORTS, WHICH WERE COMPLETED DURING 2002,

INCLUDED COMPLETION OF CODING, FINALIZING USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE

CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED NET CASH FLOWS BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT

RATE OF 25%.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS HELD INVESTMENTS IN EARTHLINK INC. (EARTHLINK), AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (AKAMAI), ARM HOLDINGS PLC (ARM) AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE

COMPANIES. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS LONG TERM ASSETS WITHIN OTHER ASSETS AND HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE EVENT A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS OF ONE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY

INCLUDES RECOGNIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OR FROM OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 2 OF

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING

2003, THE COMPANY SOLD 1,875,000 SHARES OF AKAMAI STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION, AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANY SOLD ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN ARM STOCK, 278,000 SHARES, FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $295,000, AND A

34

GAIN

BEFORE TAXES OF $270,000, AND SOLD ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK STOCK, 6,540,000 SHARES, FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $37 MILLION, AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF

$2 MILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S REMAINING INVESTMENT IN AKAMAI AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, WAS APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION.

DURING

2002, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF THESE INVESTMENTS WERE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A

$44 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITEDOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK, A $6 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITEDOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN AKAMAI, AND A

$15 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITEDOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN A PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENT. THESE LOSSES IN 2002 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF 117,000 SHARES OF EARTHLINK

STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $2 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $223,000, THE SALE OF 250,000 SHARES OF AKAMAI STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $2 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $710,000,

AND THE SALE OF APPROXIMATELY 4.7 MILLION SHARES OF ARM STOCK FOR BOTH NET PROCEEDS AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $21 MILLION.

DURING

2001, THE COMPANY SOLD A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION SHARES OF AKAMAI STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $39 MILLION AND RECORDED A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $36 MILLION, AND SOLD A

TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 29.8 MILLION SHARES OF ARM STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $176 MILLION AND RECORDED A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $174 MILLION. THESE GAINS DURING 2001 WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A $114 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS THAT REFLECTED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK AND AN

$8 MILLION CHARGE THAT REFLECTED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENTS.

UNREALIZED LOSS ON CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES

ON OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SFAS) NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

. SFAS NO. 133 ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. SFAS

NO. 133 REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO ADJUST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE COMPONENT OF ITS INVESTMENT IN SAMSUNG TO EARNINGS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001, THE BEFORE TAX EFFECT OF WHICH

WAS AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME DECREASED $29 MILLION OR 26% TO $83 MILLION DURING 2003. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DECLINING INVESTMENT YIELDS ON THE

COMPANY'S CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS FELL TO 1.89% IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2.85% IN 2002. THE DECREASE IS OFFSET BY THE INCREASE OF $14 MILLION FROM THE GAIN ON THE SALES OF SHORT TERM

INVESTMENTS FROM THE COMPANY'S FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO, AND THE INCREASE OF $6 MILLION FROM THE GAIN ON THE FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003.

NET

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME WAS $112 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002, COMPARED TO $217 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001. THIS $105 MILLION OR 48% DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DECLINING

INVESTMENT YIELDS ON THE COMPANY'S CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS FELL TO 2.85% IN 2002 COMPARED TO 5.38% IN 2001.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2003 WAS 26% COMPARED TO THE HIGHER STATUTORY RATE DUE PRIMARILY TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDITS, A NON-TAXABLE GAIN ON

STOCK REPURCHASE AND CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES WERE PROVIDED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF $452 MILLION BEFORE BEING OFFSET AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR PRESENTATION ON THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $30 MILLION WAS

35

RECORDED

AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND

OTHER ACQUISITIONS, THE UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING

INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE

REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

ON

APRIL 10, 2003, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1998 THROUGH 2000, AND THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN

PREPAYMENTS THEREON. CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE BEING CONTESTED THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1998 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN

THE COMPANY'S TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION

OCCURS.

CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

ON MAY 15, 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 150,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH

CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

. SFAS NO. 150 REQUIRES ISSUERS TO CLASSIFY AS LIABILITIES CERTAIN FREESTANDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT EMBODY

OBLIGATIONS FOR THE ISSUER AND HAVE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 150 ON JUNE 29, 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTED THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT TO FAIR VALUE FOR A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THAT ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF

$16.64 PER SHARE. THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT IN AUGUST 2003. THE SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, WHICH

ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS. NET OF THE RELATED

INCOME TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 RESULTED IN AN UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME DURING 2003 OF APPROXIMATELY

$2 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS CUMULATIVE DEPRECIATION AND ACCRETION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 HAD THE STATEMENT BEEN APPLIED

TO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT THE TIME THEY WERE INITIALLY INCURRED.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 DURING 2001 RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION, NET OF A RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT OF

APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION.

FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NOS. 133, 143 AND 150 AND THE RESULTING CUMULATIVE ACCOUNTING EFFECTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K AT NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MEASURES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

(APB) OPINION NO. 25,

36

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

AND PROVIDES PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES OF THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF THE FAIR VALUE-BASED METHOD HAD BEEN

APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW APB OPINION NO. 25 BECAUSE, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K AT NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE ALTERNATIVE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING PROVIDED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

,

REQUIRES USE OF OPTION VALUATION MODELS THAT WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE IN VALUING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES. UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EQUALS THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE

GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

THE

FASB DECIDED ON APRIL 22, 2003 TO REQUIRE ALL COMPANIES TO EXPENSE THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. COMPANIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEASURE THE COST OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ACCORDING TO

THEIR FAIR VALUE. THE FASB HAS INDICATED THAT IT PLANS TO ISSUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2004 AN EXPOSURE DRAFT OF A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD ADDRESSING THIS MATTER. PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF

THIS EXPOSURE DRAFT, THE FASB HAS INDICATED IT WILL BE ADDRESSING SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL ISSUES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FASB MUST DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL

PERMIT ADJUSTMENTS TO RECOGNIZED EXPENSE FOR ACTUAL OPTION FORFEITURES AND ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. THIS DETERMINATION WILL AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED. ALSO, A

METHOD TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS MUST BE ESTABLISHED. CURRENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRE USE OF AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL, SUCH AS THE BLACK-SCHOLES FORMULA, TO DETERMINE

FAIR VALUE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON ADJUSTING SOME OF THE INPUT FACTORS USED IN THE MODEL. THIS VALUATION APPROACH HAS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT CRITICISM AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES THAT COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CALCULATED FAIR VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD.

AT

THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER'S MEETING ON APRIL 24, 2003, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A PROPOSAL REQUESTING THAT THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE BOARD) ESTABLISH A POLICY OF EXPENSING

THE VALUE OF ALL FUTURE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT APPRECIATE AND TAKE SERIOUSLY THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS. AS DISCUSSED IN THE

COMPANY'S FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 29, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD DECIDED NOT TO EXPENSE THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS UNTIL THE FASB FINALIZES ITS NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON THE MATTER. THE COMPANY BASED THIS DECISION ON THE FASB'S ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO SOON REQUIRE ALL COMPANIES TO EXPENSE THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND THE FASB'S

NEAR-TERM REVIEW OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WILL PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AND ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. THE COMPANY MONITORS PROGRESS AT THE FASB

AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL ISSUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION. IN THE FUTURE, SHOULD THE COMPANY EXPENSE THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, EITHER OUT OF CHOICE OR DUE TO

NEW REQUIREMENTS ISSUED BY THE FASB, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO RECOGNIZE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES

. FIN 46 CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 51 AND APPLIED IMMEDIATELY TO ANY VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED AFTER

JANUARY 31, 2003 AND TO VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH AN INTEREST IS OBTAINED AFTER THAT DATE. FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED OR ACQUIRED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003, THE

PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 MUST BE APPLIED FOR THE FIRST INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2003. THE ADOPTION OF THE PROVISION OF FIN 46 RELATED TO VARIABLE

INTERESTS CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE PROVISIONS OF

FIN 46, AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE REMAINING PROVISIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN MAY 2003, THE FASB'S EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) REACHED CONSENSUS ON EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE

DELIVERABLES

. EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS THAT INVOLVE THE DELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE

PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS TO USE ASSETS. THE PROVISIONS OF EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21 APPLY TO REVENUE TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO IN FISCAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15,

2003. ADDITIONALLY, IN AUGUST 2003, THE EITF REACHED CONSENSUS ON EITF ISSUE NO. 03-5,

APPLICABILITY OF AICPA STATEMENT OF

POSITION 97-2, "SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION," TO NON-SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINING MORE-THAN-INCIDENTAL

SOFTWARE.

EITF ISSUE NO. 03-5 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DETERMINING WHETHER NON-SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

SOP 97-2, AND ACCORDINGLY, WHETHER MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21 OR SOP 97-2.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY APPLIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOP NO. 97-2 WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR ALL MULTIPLE ELEMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE APPLICATION OF EITHER EITF

ISSUE NOS. 00-21 OR 03-5 WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO TOTALED $4.566 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $229 MILLION FROM THE END

OF FISCAL 2002. THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY AND AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES, AND FOREIGN SECURITIES.

FOREIGN SECURITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FOREIGN COMMERCIAL PAPER, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH FOREIGN

INSTITUTIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIQUID AND INVESTMENT GRADE.

AS

A RESULT OF DECLINING INVESTMENT YIELDS ON THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES DURING 2003, THE COMPANY

HAS ELECTED TO REDUCE THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF ITS PORTFOLIO TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY FOR FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHEN MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASE. ACCORDINGLY, DURING 2003 THE COMPANY

INCREASED ITS HOLDINGS IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT GRADE INSTRUMENTS, BOTH IN U.S. CORPORATE AND FOREIGN SECURITIES, THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND HAS REDUCED ITS HOLDINGS IN

LONGER-TERM U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED IN 2003, THE COMPANY'S WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 DECREASED BY $200 MILLION AS

COMPARED TO THE END OF

38

FISCAL

2002 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CURRENT YEAR RECLASSIFICATION OF THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM DEBT AS A CURRENT OBLIGATION RESULTING FROM ITS SCHEDULED MATURITY IN FEBRUARY 2004.

THE

PRIMARY SOURCES OF TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN FISCAL 2003 WERE $289 MILLION IN CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND $53 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON

STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $164 MILLION UTILIZED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $26 MILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT

OBLIGATIONS, STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

DEBT

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS DEBT OUTSTANDING IN THE FORM OF $300 MILLION OF AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 1994. THE NOTES,

WHICH PAY INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY, WERE SOLD AT 99.925% OF PAR, FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. THE NOTES, ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION OF UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED GAINS ON CLOSED

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ARE DUE IN FEBRUARY 2004 AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT DEBT AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES UTILIZING ITS EXISTING CASH

BALANCES TO SETTLE THESE NOTES WHEN DUE.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $164 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2003, $92 MILLION OF WHICH WERE FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE

COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND $72 MILLION OF WHICH WERE PRIMARILY FOR CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND OPERATING FACILITIES ENHANCEMENTS AND EXPANSIONS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES IT WILL UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2004, APPROXIMATELY $85 MILLION OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE UTILIZED FOR

FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND THE REMAINDER UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NORMAL REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CAPITAL ASSETS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO GENERAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES

NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN SEPTEMBER OF 2003 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $16.64 PER

SHARE FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. IN AUGUST 2003, THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY, AT WHICH TIME THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $22.81.

OTHER THAN THIS FORWARD PURCHASE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY TRANSACTIONS TO REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK SINCE FISCAL 2000. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN, THE

COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 6.55 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $217 MILLION. THE COMPANY WAS STILL AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON

STOCK AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY TRANSACTIONS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES WHEREBY THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SUBORDINATED RETAINED INTERESTS, DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS OR OTHER CONTINGENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL CONTINUING RISKS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION UNDER A VARIABLE INTEREST IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY

THAT PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE COMPANY.

39

LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS ON NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION, $354 MILLION OF

WHICH RELATED TO THE LEASE OF RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES. REMAINING TERMS ON THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OPERATING LEASES RANGE FROM 1 TO 12 YEARS. SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 27, 2003,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS TOTALING $64 MILLION FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 10 TO 12 YEARS.

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF FINISHED

PRODUCTS. THESE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO 3 MONTHS. THE

COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS

FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$848 MILLION.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER LICENSING AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN

THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT

CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE

CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS

SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR MUCH OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS HAS BEEN

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DIFFICULT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S EDUCATION CUSTOMERS APPEAR TO BE DELAYING TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERALL IMPACT

OF THE WEAKER ECONOMY ON THEIR AVAILABLE FUNDING. CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUES TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. SHOULD GLOBAL AND REGIONAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FAIL TO IMPROVE OR CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS COULD CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS COULD THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS,

AND RESELLERS.

WAR, TERRORISM OR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES COULD DISRUPT SUPPLY, DELIVERY OR DEMAND OF PRODUCTS WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE.

WAR, TERRORISM OR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, WHETHER IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD, HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE BY CREATING

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES

40

THAT

MAY HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS. ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH

EVENTS, SUCH EVENTS COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS, OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS,

AND COULD CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY CHAIN. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

THESE EVENTS.

THE

COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT ASIA, INCLUDING LOCATIONS IN MAINLAND CHINA, THE HONG KONG SPECIAL

ADMINISTRATIVE REGION, AND SINGAPORE, ALL OF WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) TRAVEL

ADVISORIES AT TIMES DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2003. SIMILAR TRAVEL ADVISORIES WERE ISSUED FOR TAIWAN, WHERE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND

THE IPOD ARE ASSEMBLED. SHOULD THE SEVERITY OF THE SARS THREAT INCREASE OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE NEED FOR MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL

RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN VARIOUS REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW

PRODUCTS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS.

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PERIPHERALS AND SERVICES IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THESE MARKETS, ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY

COMPETITORS, PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PERIPHERALS

HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS IN ORDER TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET

SHARE IN RESPONSE TO THE WEAKNESS IN DEMAND THAT BEGAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR 2000 FOR PERSONAL COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND

IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE PRICING PRESSURES AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS ALSO BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY, HARDWARE PERFORMANCE, AND FEATURES BASED ON EXISTING OR EMERGING INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL

PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANY'S KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING, AND DESIGN AND PUBLISHING. SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS HAVE INTRODUCED OR

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INTRODUCE DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS THAT MIMIC MANY OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN, TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND SOLUTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS CONSOLIDATION IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAT HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS IN THE COMPANY'S MARKETS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS UTILIZING

MICROSOFT'S WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

41

ARE

SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS,

INCLUDING WINDOWS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION AND RELATED CONSUMER ELECTRONIC DEVICES INCLUDING IPODS. THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM

OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, FREE PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC SERVICES, EMERGING COMPANIES, AND LARGER COMPANIES THAT MAY HAVE GREATER

RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES, AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN

THESE MARKETS. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE COMPANY HAS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, THAN MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF INNOVATIVE

AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCURS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN ITS COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL

COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. MANY OF THESE COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY ON PRICE AND MAINTAIN VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF THE EXPANSION OF THE

COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING THE COMPANY'S BRAND INCLUDING ITS UNIQUE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE COMPANY INCURS HIGHER SELLING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN MANY OF

ITS COMPETITORS. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ITS

OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.

THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE NATURE OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY

MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND UPGRADED VERSIONS OF

THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE; THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, INCLUDING PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES; THE AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS; THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND;

THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND; AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL HAVE ON ITS SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DURING

2001, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED A NEW CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM, MAC OS X, AND DELIVERED ITS FIRST MAJOR UPGRADE, MAC OS X VERSION 10.1. OTHER MAJOR UPGRADES INCLUDE MAC OS X JAGUAR IN 2002 AND MOST

RECENTLY MAC OS X PANTHER IN OCTOBER 2003. INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTIONALITY OF MAC OS X, ADVANCE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW

OPERATING SYSTEM AND ITS UPGRADES, OBTAIN THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO TRANSITION EXISTING APPLICATIONS TO RUN ON MAC OS X, OR CREATE NEW APPLICATIONS TO RUN ON MAC OS X, MAY

HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BECAUSE ORDERS FOR COMPONENTS, AND IN SOME CASES COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS, MUST BE PLACED IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE

AND ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES OF ORDERS FOR INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

42

INVENTORY

AND RELATED PROVISIONS ARE ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR

ADDITIONAL INVENTORY AND RELATED CHARGES. IN ADDITION, SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD, AND MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES,

THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS

ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE

COMPANY'S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND MAY IN

THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY OR AVAILABLE ONLY FROM LIMITED

SOURCES.

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS ARE

CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DRAM, TFT-LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS, AND OPTICAL AND MAGNETIC

DISK DRIVES), WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED

BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IN

SITUATIONS WHERE A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT UTILIZES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUPPLIERS' YIELDS HAVE MATURED. THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO

THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY INCLUDING CERTAIN MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. IF

THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED ON A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND MARKET COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY AND DESIRE OF IBM AND MOTOROLA, THE SOLE SUPPLIERS OF THE POWERPC RISC-BASED

MICROPROCESSOR FOR THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF MICROPROCESSORS WITH PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES THAT COMPARE FAVORABLY TO THOSE SUPPLIED TO THE

COMPANY'S COMPETITORS BY INTEL CORPORATION AND OTHER DEVELOPERS AND PRODUCERS OF MICROPROCESSORS USED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS USING OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. FURTHER, DESPITE ITS EFFORTS TO EDUCATE THE

MARKETPLACE TO THE CONTRARY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MANY OF ITS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIVELY SLOWER MHZ RATING OR CLOCK SPEED OF THE MICROPROCESSORS IT UTILIZES IN

ITS MACINTOSH SYSTEMS COMPARES UNFAVORABLY TO THOSE UTILIZED BY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND TRANSLATES TO SLOWER OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES IN RECENT YEARS WHERE THE

INABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE ADVANCED POWERPC G4 AND G3 MICROPROCESSORS WITH HIGHER CLOCK SPEEDS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CURRENTLY IBM IS THE COMPANY'S SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE G5 PROCESSOR USED IN CURRENT POWER MACINTOSH PRODUCTS AND MOTOROLA IS THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE G4 PROCESSORS. THE

INABILITY IN THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN MICROPROCESSORS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES WITH COMPETITIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

43

THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY MUSIC CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR MUSIC CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE COMPANY'S ITUNES MUSIC STORE. THE COMPANY PAYS SUBSTANTIAL FEES TO OBTAIN THE

RIGHTS TO OFFER TO ITS CUSTOMERS THIS THIRD-PARTY MUSIC. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND DO NOT GUARANTEE

THE FUTURE RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. CERTAIN PARTIES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENT TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR MUSIC DISTRIBUTION

OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY AND INCREASE THE FEES REQUIRED TO OFFER MUSIC CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE

VARIETY OF MUSIC CONTENT AT REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THEN SALES AND GROSS MARGINS OF THE COMPANY'S ITUNES MUSIC STORE AS

WELL AS RELATED HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, INCLUDING IPODS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THIRD-PARTY

CONTENT PROVIDERS AND ARTISTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS AND OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS. IF THE REQUIREMENTS FROM CONTENT PROVIDERS OR

ARTISTS CHANGE, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO FURTHER DEVELOP OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS SUCH NEW RIGHTS AND REQUIREMENTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR

LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND

LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER THE FIXED COST OF OPERATIONS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT

SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED, OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE COMPANY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS

WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN AT LEAST INITIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF

PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CONDUCTED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, AND CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA,

FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA, TAIWAN, KOREA, THE NETHERLANDS, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURE OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCLUDING POWERBOOKS, IBOOKS, AND THE IPOD IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN JAPAN, TAIWAN AND CHINA. IF FOR ANY REASON

MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED BY REGIONAL ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, ENVIRONMENTAL, MEDICAL, POLITICAL, OR MILITARY CONDITIONS OR EVENTS, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFITS.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS,

SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN "BUGS" THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM

THIRD-PARTIES THAT MAY BE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT

IN LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE TO REMEDY.

44

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES.

THROUGH NOVEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY HAS OPENED 74 RETAIL STORES INCLUDING ITS FIRST INTERNATIONAL STORE IN TOKYO, JAPAN. THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED

SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL

SPACE WITH LEASE TERMS RANGING FROM 5 TO 15 YEARS. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THIS INITIATIVE OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, A RELATIVELY HIGH PROPORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S COSTS ARE FIXED BECAUSE OF DEPRECIATION ON STORE CONSTRUCTION

COSTS AND LEASE EXPENSE. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WOULD RESULT SHOULD THE RETAIL SEGMENT EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN SALES FOR ANY REASON.

CERTAIN

OF THE COMPANY'S STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH PROFILE VENUES THAT FUNCTION AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE EVENTS, AND BRAND AWARENESS. BECAUSE

OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAN THE COMPANY'S MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. THE

COMPANY HAS OPENED FOUR SUCH STORES AND HAS ONE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION AND SIZE, THESE HIGH PROFILE STORES ALSO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ENTER INTO SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER OPERATING

LEASE COMMITMENTS COMPARED TO THOSE REQUIRED FOR ITS MORE TYPICAL STORES. CURRENT LEASES ON SUCH LOCATIONS HAVE TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 15 YEARS WITH TOTAL COMMITMENTS PER LOCATION OVER THE

LEASE TERMS RANGING FROM $25 MILLION TO $50 MILLION. CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THESE HIGH PROFILE STORES COULD HAVE A PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANY

OF THE GENERAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY FACES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RETAIL SEGMENT. ALSO, MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS PRESENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,

SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S FUTURE RESULTS, CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY EXPECTED, AND/OR HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY; INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION; LACK OF CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL APPROACH; FAILURE TO ATTRACT NEW USERS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM; INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS; FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS

WITH EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS; LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF APPLE-BRANDED AND

THIRD-PARTY RETAIL INVENTORY; AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT REASONABLE COST.

UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED DESKTOP SYSTEMS HAVE DECLINED SHARPLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING NET SALES AND GROSS MARGIN.

UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS FELL 13% DURING 2003 AS COMPARED TO 2002 AND FELL 18% IN 2002 FROM 2001. POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES HAVE FALLEN AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES FROM 30% IN 2001 TO 22% IN 2003. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ARE HAVING A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS PROFESSIONAL AND

CREATIVE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE THE PRIMARY USERS OF SUCH SYSTEMS. ALSO, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE

MOST LIKELY TO UTILIZE THE COMPANY'S POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIVELY SLOWER MHZ RATING OR CLOCK SPEED OF THE MICROPROCESSORS IT UTILIZES IN ITS MACINTOSH SYSTEMS COMPARES

UNFAVORABLY TO THOSE UTILIZED BY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND TRANSLATES TO SLOWER OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NET SALES, DECLINING SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OVERALL GROSS MARGIN BECAUSE POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER INDIVIDUAL GROSS MARGINS THAN THE COMPANY'S OTHER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS.

CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE NET SALES AND GROSS MARGIN. IF FUTURE UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS FAIL TO

45

PARTIALLY

OR FULLY RECOVER, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE COMPANY TO IMPROVE ITS OVERALL PROFITABILITY. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS INTRODUCED FASTER POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS UTILIZING 64-BIT

POWERPC G5 PROCESSORS DURING 2003, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT INTRODUCTION OF SUCH SYSTEMS WILL FAVORABLY IMPACT NET SALES EITHER IN THE SHORT OR LONG TERM.

THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET.

SALES IN THE UNITED STATES TO BOTH ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS, REMAIN A CORE MARKET FOR APPLE. NET SALES IN THESE MARKETS

FELL TO 18% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES IN 2003 FROM 21% AND 26% IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THE DROP IN 2003 REFLECTS DECLINES IN BOTH NET SALES AND MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN THESE MARKETS OF

4% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY, IN FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET THE EDUCATION MARKET FOR PERSONAL

COMPUTERS, WHICH COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S MARKET SHARE. IN AN EFFORT TO REGAIN MARKET SHARE AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE 1:1 LEARNING

SOLUTIONS IN EDUCATION. THESE 1:1 SOLUTIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC SALES ARE GENERALLY PRICED MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROFITABILITY OR EVEN IN FINANCIAL LOSSES,

PARTICULARLY FOR LARGER DEALS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO

INCREASE OR MAINTAIN ITS SHARE OF THE EDUCATION MARKET OR EXECUTE PROFITABLY ON LARGE STRATEGIC ARRANGEMENTS. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER RESELLERS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS, MANY OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING

MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND

CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE

STORES AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS ITS OWN PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT

MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S

DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKEN, IF RESELLERS WITHIN CONSUMER

CHANNELS WERE TO CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS' STORES WITH COMPANY EMPLOYEES. THESE PROGRAMS COULD

REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT FROM THE COMPANY, WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE TO OFFSET THIS INVESTMENT.

OVER

THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO END-USERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND THROUGH

ITS RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THIS EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AS

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. PERCEPTION OF SUCH A CONFLICT COULD DISCOURAGE THE COMPANY'S RESELLERS FROM INVESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF EXPANSION OF ITS DIRECT SALES TO

END-USERS CAUSES SOME OR ALL OF ITS RESELLERS TO CEASE OR LIMIT DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION MAY BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION,"

WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

46

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

A LARGE PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), AND

CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED. THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA AND NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. CONVERSELY, STRENGTHENING IN THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES CAN INCREASE THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MARGINS

ON SALES OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, AND INTEREST RATE SWAP AND OPTION POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN EITHER

FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES.

FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING "FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK" AND MAY BE

FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTES 1 AND 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED OR AVAILABLE FOR THE

COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THEN CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AS OPPOSED TO WINDOWS-BASED SYSTEMS, ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE FOR PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN

PART ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS' PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER

WINDOWS MARKET. THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED POTENTIAL REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF

MAC OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL LOSSES IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE MINORITY MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE COMPANY IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

MARKET, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S DECISION TO END ITS MAC OS LICENSING PROGRAM, HAVE CAUSED SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANY'S PROSPECTS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, DEVELOPERS COULD BE

LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATION SOFTWARE OR UPGRADE EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE

LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. MOREOVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE FOR MAC OS X, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SYSTEM, ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL.

IN

ADDITION, PAST AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DECISION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE

SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MARKETS AND SELLS A VARIETY OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR USE BY PROFESSIONALS, CONSUMERS, AND EDUCATION CUSTOMERS THAT

COULD INFLUENCE

47

THE

DECISION OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE MACINTOSH-COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY MARKETED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE SOFTWARE FOR PROFESSIONAL

FILM AND VIDEO EDITING, PROFESSIONAL COMPOSITING AND VISUAL EFFECTS FOR LARGE FORMAT FILM AND VIDEO PRODUCTIONS, PROFESSIONAL MUSIC PRODUCTION AND MUSIC POST PRODUCTION, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DVD

ENCODING AND AUTHORING, CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO AND DIGITAL PHOTO EDITING AND MANAGEMENT, DIGITAL MUSIC MANAGEMENT, DESKTOP-BASED DATABASE MANAGEMENT, AND HIGH-QUALITY PRESENTATIONS. THE

COMPANY ALSO MARKETS AN INTEGRATED PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATION THAT INCORPORATES WORD PROCESSING, PAGE LAYOUT, IMAGE MANIPULATION, SPREADSHEETS, DATABASES, AND PRESENTATIONS IN A SINGLE APPLICATION.

IN

AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY AND MICROSOFT CORPORATION ENTERED INTO PATENT CROSS LICENSE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS THROUGH AUGUST 2002, AND

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF MACINTOSH COMPUTERS SOLD BY THE COMPANY, MICROSOFT WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE VERSIONS OF ITS MICROSOFT OFFICE AND INTERNET EXPLORER PRODUCTS FOR THE

MAC OS. ALTHOUGH MICROSOFT HAS RELEASED MICROSOFT OFFICE AND INTERNET EXPLORER FOR MAC OS X, MICROSOFT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PRODUCE FUTURE VERSIONS OF ITS PRODUCTS SUBSEQUENT TO AUGUST 2002.

WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY AND TO ITS EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE INSTALLED BASE FOR THE MAC OS, THE COMPANY DOES

COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH MICROSOFT IN A NUMBER OF KEY AREAS. ACCORDINGLY, MICROSOFT'S INTEREST IN PRODUCING APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE MAC OS FOLLOWING EXPIRATION OF THE AGREEMENTS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY

MICROSOFT'S PERCEPTION OF ITS INTERESTS AS THE VENDOR OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. DISCONTINUANCE OF MICROSOFT OFFICE AND OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS FOR THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN JUNE OF 2003, MICROSOFT STATED THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER DEVELOP NEW VERSIONS OF INTERNET EXPLORER FOR THE MAC OS. MICROSOFT'S DECISION TO

DISCONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNET EXPLORER FOR MAC OS X APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED IN PART BY THE COMPANY'S INTRODUCTION DURING 2003 OF ITS OWN WEB BROWSER, SAFARI. IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT IMPACT,

IF ANY, MICROSOFT'S DECISION TO CEASE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNET EXPLORER FOR MAC OS X WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, IF CUSTOMERS CHOSE NOT TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS BECAUSE

INTERNET EXPLORER IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM OR SHOULD WEBSITES FAIL TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSERS OTHER THAN INTERNET EXPLORER, THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS RELIES ON ACCESS TO PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND THE COMPANY'S FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS

ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES

RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY

PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE

TERMS.

BECAUSE

OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS

AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERIT, CAN BE TIME CONSUMING, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, AND CAUSE THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. SEVERAL

PENDING CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES. HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT

SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IN THE EVENT THERE IS A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING

CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRING IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A THIRD-PARTY, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INFORMATION REGARDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INVOLVING THE COMPANY RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER MATTERS IS SET FORTH IN

48

PART I,

ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR

CLAIMS RELATED TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR

OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME

REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

THE COMPANY'S PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. AS A RESULT, THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD WILL DEPEND, IN

PART, ON THE PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC, AND CHANNEL MIX REFLECTED IN THAT PERIOD'S NET SALES.

THE TYPICAL CONCENTRATION OF NET SALES IN THE THIRD MONTH OF THE COMPANY'S FISCAL QUARTERS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF EACH QUARTER THAN IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS, A PATTERN TYPICAL IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

INDUSTRY. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL

RESULTS ACCURATELY. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANY'S KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS SUPPLIERS, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS, CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY AND ITS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MEMBERS OF ITS

EXECUTIVE TEAM, AND THOSE IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE,

ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THE COMPANY HAS RELIED ON ITS ABILITY TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AS ONE MECHANISM FOR RECRUITING AND RETAINING

THIS HIGHLY SKILLED TALENT. POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS MAY IMPAIR THE COMPANY'S FUTURE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THESE INCENTIVES WITHOUT INCURRING SIGNIFICANT

COMPENSATION COSTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF INSURANCE.

THE COMPANY HAS OBSERVED RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE INSURANCE MARKETS RELATING TO NEARLY ALL AREAS OF TRADITIONAL CORPORATE INSURANCE. SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN

HIGHER PREMIUM COSTS, HIGHER POLICY DEDUCTIBLES, AND LOWER COVERAGE LIMITS. FOR SOME RISKS, BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR AVAILABILITY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE. FOR THESE REASONS, THE

COMPANY IS RETAINING A GREATER PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS THAN IT HAS IN THE PAST AT RELATIVELY GREATER COST.

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S MAJOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, MEDICAL

CONDITIONS, AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL

BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR DIRECT QUAKE-RELATED

LOSSES. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

49

CONDITION

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER NATURAL OR MANMADE DISASTER.

FAILURE OF THE COMPANY'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF DATA COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS BY POTENTIALLY CAUSING

DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, IMPEDING THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS, OR RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR COMPANY INFORMATION. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS

TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BY ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF SOPHISTICATED NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL CONTROL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR DATA SECURITY BREACH WILL

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND RETAILERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS

MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE BY THE COMPANY OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE

COMPANY. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROCEDURES WILL

BE EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOIDING LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIES FAIL TO IMPROVE OR CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE, IT BECOMES MORE LIKELY THAT THE

COMPANY WILL INCUR A MATERIAL LOSS OR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR MANUFACTURING VENDORS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION BY VARIOUS GOVERNING BODIES,

INCLUDING THE FASB AND THE SEC, WHO INTERPRET AND CREATE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS. A CHANGE FROM CURRENT ACCOUNTING

REGULATIONS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS.

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX

RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS

EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES

50

RESULTING

FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK HAS AT TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

IN WAYS THAT HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, INCLUDING LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND INVESTORS' CONCERNS REGARDING THE CREDIBILITY OF CORPORATE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND INTEGRITY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE

COMPANY'S STOCK IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION ACTIVITY COULD DISRUPT ITS ONGOING BUSINESS AND MAY PRESENT RISKS NOT CONTEMPLATED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED AND MAY CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES THAT HAVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND

PRODUCT ROADMAP. THESE ACQUISITIONS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING DIFFICULTIES IN INCORPORATING THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES' OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES; DISTRACTION OF

MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AWAY FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS; INSUFFICIENT REVENUE GENERATION TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION; AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT

DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANY'S DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS, INCLUDING PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUES AND LEGAL CONTINGENCIES. ACQUISITIONS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY'S

PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY HAS GENERALLY PAID CASH FOR ITS

ACQUISITIONS. SHOULD THE COMPANY ISSUE ITS COMMON STOCK OR OTHER EQUITY

RELATED PURCHASE RIGHTS AS CONSIDERATION IN AN ACQUISITION, CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS' PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP AND EARNINGS PER SHARE MAY BECOME DILUTED.

51

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

TO ENSURE THE ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE HEDGE POSITIONS, AS WELL AS TO MONITOR THE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE

NON-HEDGE PORTFOLIOS, THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, AND ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP AND OPTION POSITIONS BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN

CONJUNCTION WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES, RESPECTIVELY, FROM BOTH AN ACCOUNTING AND AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE

COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES INTENDED TO HEDGE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE AFOREMENTIONED PROGRAMS WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE

ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR RECOGNITION OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO

MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 133 AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2000. SFAS NO. 133 ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ONGOING APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 133 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPANY'S HEDGING

STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES. IN THIS REGARD, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES.

THE

COMPANY'S FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, AND OPTIMIZE RETURN IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BENCHMARKS ITS PERFORMANCE BY UTILIZING EXTERNAL MONEY MANAGERS TO MANAGE A SMALL PORTION OF THE AGGREGATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE EXTERNAL MANAGERS ADHERE TO THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND ALSO PROVIDE OCCASIONAL RESEARCH AND MARKET INFORMATION THAT SUPPLEMENTS INTERNAL RESEARCH USED TO MAKE CREDIT DECISIONS IN THE INVESTMENT PROCESS.

DURING

1994, THE COMPANY ISSUED $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING REGISTERED WITH THE SEC. THE NOTES WERE SOLD AT 99.925% OF PAR, FOR AN

EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. THE NOTES PAY INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY AND MATURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2004.

THE

COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE

COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ISSUED BY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE

COMPANY'S GENERAL POLICY IS TO LIMIT THE RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF INVESTED FUNDS BY LIMITING MARKET AND CREDIT RISK. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27,

2003, APPROXIMATELY $629 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 AND 5 YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002,

$1.087 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5 YEARS. THE REMAINDER ALL HAD UNDERLYING

MATURITIES BETWEEN 3 AND 12 MONTHS. DUE TO LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR IN ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION, OR FOR THE PURPOSE OF DURATION MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE

COMPANY MAY SELL INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES. AS A RESULT OF SUCH ACTIVITY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS OF $21 MILLION IN 2003 AND $7 MILLION IN 2002.

52

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT THAT A

CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 27,

2003, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $12.9 MILLION DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $37.7 MILLION DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE COMPANY

SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY. EXCEPT IN INSTANCES NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO HOLD INVESTMENTS TO MATURITY.

THE

COMPANY SOMETIMES ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, COLLARS, AND FLOORS, WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S

FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION

OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO NO INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS DURING 2003 OR 2002 AND HAD NO OPEN INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2003.

IN

PRIOR YEARS, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAPS, WHICH QUALIFIED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, GENERALLY REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO

PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE THREE- OR SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS

EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND CONVERT A PORTION OF THE FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS TO FIXED RATE. DUE TO

PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES, DURING 2002 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED OUT DEBT SWAP POSITIONS REALIZING A GAIN OF $6 MILLION. DURING 2001 THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT

ALL OF ITS THEN EXISTING DEBT SWAP POSITIONS REALIZING A GAIN OF $17 MILLION. BOTH THE GAINS IN 2002 AND 2001 WERE DEFERRED, RECOGNIZED IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND, AS SUCH, GENERALLY BENEFITS FROM A WEAKER DOLLAR AND IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A STRONGER

DOLLAR RELATIVE TO MAJOR CURRENCIES WORLDWIDE. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND GROSS

MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING WITHIN THE TIME FRAME OF OUR HEDGED POSITIONS DUE TO COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, AND PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE

TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND LIMITED

AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE

RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

USING A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE 3000

RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN

53

EXCHANGE

PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET

CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $7.5 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS OF

$3.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, LOSSES INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL

GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 DUE TO THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES, AND THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL

EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

APPLE

COMPUTER, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS AND PERSONAL COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATING

SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS INCLUDE THE MACINTOSH LINE OF DESKTOP AND NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS, THE MAC OS X OPERATING SYSTEM, THE IPOD DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER, AND A PORTFOLIO OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND

PERIPHERALS FOR EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES, DIRECT SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY WHOLESALERS AND RESELLERS, AND ITS OWN

RETAIL STORES.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES

THERETO HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

TYPICALLY,

THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. FISCAL YEARS 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE EACH 52-WEEK YEARS. HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, THE COMPANY

REPORTS A 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR TO ALIGN ITS FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS BY ADDING A WEEK TO ITS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S

FISCAL CALENDAR.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ISSUED BY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF

THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES SUCH DESIGNATION AS OF EACH

BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS MADE INVESTMENTS IN NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AS LONG-TERM ASSETS WITHIN OTHER ASSETS. THEY ARE NOT CATEGORIZED AS CURRENT ASSETS EITHER BECAUSE, GIVEN THEIR NATURE, THEY ARE NOT READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH OR BECAUSE

THEY REPRESENT POTENTIALLY LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS BY THE COMPANY. FURTHER, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF VOLATILITY. THE COMPANY'S

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES,

NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE EVENT A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW

THE COST BASIS OF ONE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY INCLUDES RECOGNIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OR FROM

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. OCCASIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES SHORT-TERM EQUITY

DERIVATIVES TO

60

MANAGE

POTENTIAL DISPOSITIONS OF NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. ANY GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

ON MAY 15, 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 150,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF

BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

. SFAS NO. 150 REQUIRES ISSUERS TO CLASSIFY AS

LIABILITIES (OR ASSETS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES) CERTAIN FREESTANDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT EMBODY OBLIGATIONS FOR THE ISSUER AND HAVE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY. THE COMPANY

ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 150 ON JUNE 29, 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO A

FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $16.64 PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. THE

COMPANY SETTLED THIS FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT IN AUGUST 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION REPRESENTING THE INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE AGREEMENT

FROM JUNE 29, 2003 THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT DATE.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ON OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES

. SFAS NO. 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. SFAS NO. 133

REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVES BE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT HEDGES MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH INCOME. IF THE DERIVATIVE IS A HEDGE,

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE HEDGE, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL EITHER BE OFFSET AGAINST THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, OR FIRM COMMITMENTS THROUGH EARNINGS, OR

RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. NET OF THE RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133

RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION. NET OF THE RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS

NO. 133 RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WAS RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS DURING

2001. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ONGOING APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 133 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPANY'S HEDGING STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PARTICULAR RISK AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR

LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED

TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY OR AN IDENTIFIED PORTION THEREOF THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PARTICULAR RISK AND THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS

IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET

INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT

61

EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

FOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

EXCHANGE RATE. CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD HEDGE ARE BOTH MEASURED FROM THE CONTRACT RATE TO THE FORWARD

EXCHANGE RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORWARD CONTRACT'S MATURITY DATE. FOR CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION CONTRACT.

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTION TO CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE OPTION HEDGE AT

MATURITY. THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED AS COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO

EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. FOR INTEREST RATE

SWAP AGREEMENTS QUALIFYING AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO INEFFECTIVENESS BECAUSE THESE SWAPS MEET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD DEFINED IN SFAS

NO. 133.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET. IF THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE

MADE CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE DECLINING BALANCE AND STRAIGHT-LINE METHODS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH ARE 30 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, FROM 2 TO 5 YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR 10 YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE

SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, WHICH

ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS. THE STANDARD APPLIES TO

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR NORMAL USE OF THE ASSETS. SFAS NO. 143

REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE LIABILITY IS ADDED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSET AND THIS ADDITIONAL CARRYING AMOUNT IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. ALL OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2002,

GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF $9.5 MILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS.

62

AS

OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $6 MILLION LONG-TERM ASSET RETIREMENT LIABILITY AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE

PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNING CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S LEASED PROPERTIES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW OF

$9.5 MILLION AND ITS PRESENT VALUE OF $6 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2002, IS BEING ACCRETED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED LEASES AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE. NET OF THE RELATED INCOME

TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 RESULTED IN AN UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 OF

APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS CUMULATIVE DEPRECIATION AND ACCRETION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 HAD THE STATEMENT

BEEN APPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT THE TIME THEY WERE INITIALLY INCURRED.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO

GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY HAS MADE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, EXCEPT THOSE MADE IN

CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5.

THE

COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES THAT

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. PRIOR TO FISCAL 2002, GOODWILL WAS AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS TRANSITIONAL

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2001, AND ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS AT AUGUST 30, 2003 AND AUGUST 30, 2002, RESPECTIVELY, AND FOUND NO IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY

ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO

EACH REPORTING UNIT.

SFAS

NO. 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

AMORTIZING ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 3 TO 10 YEARS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS INTERNATIONAL NON-U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT

THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUE AND

63

EXPENSES

FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE CREDITED OR CHARGED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION INCLUDED IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)" IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE

THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REMEASURE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, AND INVENTORIES, PROPERTY, AND NONMONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS (HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERALS), AND EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS

AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 101,

REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED.

FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE

COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED TO NOT BE,

FIXED AND DETERMINABLE, REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE.

REVENUE

FROM EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT PERIODS. THESE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, CERTAIN

REPAIRS, WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES, DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AND EXTEND THE COMPANY'S ONE-YEAR BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY.

THE

COMPANY SELLS SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING AND RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN SALES

TRANSACTIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS, AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES AT

THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED.

REVENUE

ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES IS ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

EACH ELEMENT. ALLOCATED REVENUE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET FOR EACH ELEMENT. VSOE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN EACH ELEMENT IS SOLD

SEPARATELY.

THE

COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END USER REBATES, AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS

AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

64

GENERALLY,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT OFFER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH SOFTWARE SALES OR THE SALE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, A

LIMITED NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE WITH MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED FUTURE UPGRADES OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM ON A WHEN AND IF

AVAILABLE BASIS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MAINTENANCE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM.

SHIPPING COSTS

THE COMPANY'S SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING

WHEN A PRODUCT'S TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 86,

COMPUTER

SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED

. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE,

COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND GENERALLY ALL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.

DURING

THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2003, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.3 (CODE-NAMED "PANTHER"), WHICH

ENHANCES THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF MAC OS X, SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA

IN JUNE 2003, AND PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004. THEREFORE, DURING 2003 THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $14.7 MILLION OF

DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PANTHER. AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET BEGAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WHEN PANTHER WAS SHIPPED AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86 OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

DURING

THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2002, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.2 (CODE-NAMED "JAGUAR") SUBSEQUENT

TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA IN MAY 2002, AND PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $13.3 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF JAGUAR. AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET BEGAN IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2002 WHEN JAGUAR WAS SHIPPED AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86 OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IN ADDITION,

DURING 2002, THE COMPANY ALSO BEGAN CAPITALIZING CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF ITS NEW POWERSCHOOL ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. CAPITALIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION

BEGAN UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE FINAL VERSION OF THE ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS RELEASED IN JULY 2002.

DURING

2001 THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF MAC OS X, SUBSEQUENT TO RELEASE OF A PUBLIC BETA VERSION OF THE PRODUCT AND

PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT VERSION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $5.4 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS DURING 2001 ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X. RELATED

AMORTIZATION IS

65

COMPUTED

BY USE OF THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86 OVER A 8 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

TOTAL

AMORTIZATION RELATED TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS $5.8 MILLION, $1.2 MILLION AND $350,000 IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $193 MILLION, $209 MILLION, AND $261 MILLION FOR 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

. SFAS

NO. 146 SUPERSEDES EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 94-3,

LIABILITY RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS

TO EXIT AN ACTIVITY (INCLUDING CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A RESTRUCTURING)

AND REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED, AS OPPOSED TO WHEN MANAGEMENT COMMITS TO AN EXIT PLAN. SFAS NO. 146 ALSO ESTABLISHES THAT THE LIABILITY SHOULD INITIALLY BE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE. THIS STATEMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 146 WERE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY AFTER

THE ADOPTION DATE TO NEWLY INITIATED EXIT ACTIVITIES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY MEASURES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB)

OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES.

THE COMPANY APPLIES THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

, AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 148

, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE

AS IF THE FAIR VALUE-BASED METHOD HAD BEEN APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW APB

OPINION NO. 25 BECAUSE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE ALTERNATIVE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING PROVIDED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123 REQUIRES USE OF OPTION VALUATION MODELS THAT WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE

IN VALUING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES. UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EQUALS THE MARKET PRICE OF

THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

AS

REQUIRED UNDER SFAS NO. 123, THE PRO FORMA EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

PURCHASES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. FOR PURPOSES OF PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES, THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AND SHARES IS AMORTIZED TO PRO FORMA NET INCOME OVER THE OPTIONS' VESTING PERIOD AND THE SHARES' PLAN PERIOD.

THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE FULLY TRANSFERABLE. IN ADDITION, OPTION

VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS AND THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS, AND BECAUSE CHANGES IN THE SUBJECTIVE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY

AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE, IN

66

MANAGEMENT'S

OPINION, THE EXISTING MODELS DO NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE MEASURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES.

FOR

PURPOSES OF PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AND SHARES IS AMORTIZED TO PRO FORMA NET INCOME (LOSS) OVER THE OPTIONS' VESTING PERIOD AND THE SHARES' PLAN PERIOD. THE

COMPANY'S PRO FORMA INFORMATION FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE

PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD

INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAD BEEN ISSUED. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS WERE

EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED LOSS PER COMMON SHARE FOR FISCAL 2001 BECAUSE THEIR EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTIDILUTIVE.

TO PURCHASE 50.8 MILLION AND 58.0 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE OUTSTANDING AT THE END OF 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THAT YEAR BECAUSE THE OPTIONS' EXERCISE PRICE WAS GREATER THAN THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARES FOR THAT YEAR AND, THEREFORE, THE EFFECT WOULD BE

ANTIDILUTIVE. AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 97.2 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING, ALL OF WHICH WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED

LOSS PER SHARE FOR 2001 BECAUSE THE EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTIDILUTIVE.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS AND LOSSES THAT UNDER

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS COMPRISED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND NET DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE "MANAGEMENT" APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS

AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS, AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS IS

ALSO DISCLOSED.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA

AND BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-

69

NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS

WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. THESE NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, TOTALED $184 MILLION AND $142 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, AND

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PROFITS ON THESE SALES OR REFLECT THE SALE OF THESE COMPONENTS IN ITS NET SALES.

INVENTORY PREPAYMENT

IN APRIL 2002, THE COMPANY MADE A $100 MILLION PREPAYMENT TO AN ASIAN SUPPLIER FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPONENTS OVER THE FOLLOWING NINE MONTHS. IN RETURN FOR THIS

DEPOSIT, THE SUPPLIER AGREED TO SUPPLY THE COMPANY WITH A SPECIFIED LEVEL OF COMPONENTS DURING THE THREE CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2002. APPROXIMATELY $53 MILLION OF

THIS DEPOSIT REMAINED UNUSED AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 AND WAS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS. DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003, THE REMAINDER OF THE

DEPOSIT BALANCE WAS FULLY UTILIZED FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPONENTS. THE DEPOSIT WAS UNSECURED AND HAD NO STATED INTEREST COMPONENT. THE COMPANY IMPUTED AN AMOUNT TO COST OF SALES AND INTEREST INCOME

DURING EACH PERIOD THE DEPOSIT WAS OUTSTANDING AT A 3.25% INTEREST RATE TO REFLECT THE ECONOMICS OF THIS TRANSACTION.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE USED TO

OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUES AND COST OF SALES. FROM

TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE PROFILE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DEBT. THE COMPANY'S

THE

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AS OF YEAR-END, AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNT SHOWN IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON THESE TRANSACTIONS IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES

FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL

VARY OVER TIME AS A FUNCTION OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS USING PREVAILING FINANCIAL MARKET INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2002. IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES WHERE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, PRICE QUOTES WERE OBTAINED FROM SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS

THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS

ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET

CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING

MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR

EXPOSURES, OR LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

71

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 133, HEDGES RELATED TO PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS OF AN ANTICIPATORY NATURE ARE DESIGNATED AND DOCUMENTED AT HEDGE INCEPTION AS CASH FLOW HEDGES

AND EVALUATED FOR HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS QUARTERLY. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE

FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE. CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD HEDGE ARE BOTH MEASURED FROM THE CONTRACT RATE TO THE

FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORWARD CONTRACT'S MATURITY DATE.

FOR

CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION CONTRACT. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTION TO CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE OPTION HEDGE AT MATURITY. THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING

AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED AS COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION

AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

TO

PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANY'S U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES, AND THE

COMPANY'S NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES SELLING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED SALES ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUES AND INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER A TIME HORIZON OF 3 TO 9 MONTHS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN RECORDED ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE TRANSLATION AND ECONOMIC EXPOSURE OF A NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON FORWARDS

DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE SPOT EXCHANGE RATE. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON A

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF THE NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. ANY RESIDUAL CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE SPOT AND FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES, ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE.

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS AS ITEMS THAT PROVIDE AN OFFSET TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED

IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BASED ON CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE. DUE TO MARKET MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE CAN LEAD TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED

TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A SUBSEQUENT 2 MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH

72

SUCH

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN CURRENT

EARNINGS UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED NET GAINS OF $2.5 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LOSS

OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES AND DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. DURING 2001, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A NET GAIN OF $5.1 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECAST OF FUTURE NET

SALES AND COST OF SALES. NO NET GAINS, OR LOSSES, OF A SIMILAR NATURE WERE RECORDED IN 2003.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY SOMETIMES ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, COLLARS, AND FLOORS, WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER

MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS

LONG-TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS LONG-TERM DEBT, AND TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY

FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS GENERALLY REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE THREE- OR SIX-MONTH

U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR

DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND CONVERTED A PORTION OF THE FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS TO FIXED RATE. THE COMPANY ASSUMED NO INEFFECTIVENESS WITH REGARD TO THE DEBT INTEREST SWAPS AS EACH

DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAP MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD DEFINED IN SFAS NO. 133 FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, NO NET GAINS OR

LOSSES WERE RECORDED IN INCOME RELATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S UNDERLYING DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS. DURING FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT ALL OF ITS EXISTING DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAP POSITIONS DUE TO

PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES REALIZING A GAIN OF $17 MILLION. THIS GAIN WAS DEFERRED, RECOGNIZED IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND IS BEING AMORTIZED TO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT.

THE

UNREALIZED LOSS ON THE ASSET SWAPS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, OF $5.7 MILLION WAS DEFERRED AND THEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN 2001 AS PART OF THE SFAS NO. 133 TRANSITION

ADJUSTMENT EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2000. THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT ALL OF ITS EXISTING INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS DURING 2001 REALIZING A GAIN OF $1.1 MILLION.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING. DUE TO PERCEIVED MARKET RISK, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN

EARLY 2002. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE

UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT. THE COMPANY ASSUMED NO INEFFECTIVENESS

WITH REGARD TO THE DEBT INTEREST SWAPS AS EACH DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAP MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD DEFINED IN SFAS NO. 133 FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, NO NET GAINS OR LOSSES WERE RECORDED IN INCOME RELATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S UNDERLYING DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS DURING FISCAL 2002 UNTIL THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT THE

POSITIONS IN LATE 2002 DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES. CLOSING THE DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS RESULTED IN A REALIZED GAIN

73

OF

$6 MILLION. THIS GAIN WAS DEFERRED, RECOGNIZED IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND IS BEING AMORTIZED TO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT.

DEBT

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS DEBT OUTSTANDING IN THE FORM OF $300 MILLION OF AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 1994. THE NOTES,

WHICH PAY INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY, WERE SOLD AT 99.925% OF PAR, FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. THE NOTES, ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION OF RELATED UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED GAINS

ON CLOSED INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ARE DUE IN FEBRUARY OF 2004 AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT DEBT AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 AND SEPTEMBER 28,

2002, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE NOTES, INCLUDING UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSED DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WAS $304 MILLION AND $316 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE

FAIR VALUE WAS $302 MILLION AND $299 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTES IS BASED ON THEIR LISTED MARKET VALUES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 AND SEPTEMBER 28,

2002.

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES

THE COMPANY HAS HELD INVESTMENTS IN EARTHLINK, INC. (EARTHLINK), AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (AKAMAI), ARM HOLDINGS PLC (ARM), AND SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS

CO., LTD (SAMSUNG). THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS LONG TERM ASSETS WITHIN OTHER ASSETS AND HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ALL REALIZED GAINS ON THE SALE OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN TOTAL OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. THE COMBINED FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY WAS

ACQUISITION OF EMAGIC GMBH

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED EMAGIC GMBH (EMAGIC), A PROVIDER OF PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS FOR COMPUTER BASED MUSIC PRODUCTION, FOR

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION IN CASH; $26 MILLION OF WHICH WAS PAID IMMEDIATELY UPON CLOSING OF THE DEAL AND $4 MILLION OF WHICH WAS HELD-BACK FOR FUTURE PAYMENT

CONTINGENT ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT BY CERTAIN EMPLOYEES THAT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO FUTURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE APPROPRIATE PERIODS OVER THE NEXT 3 YEARS. DURING FISCAL 2003, CONTINGENT

CONSIDERATION TOTALING $1.3 MILLION WAS PAID. THE ACQUISITION HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE. THE PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) WAS EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY, AND THE PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY AND TO TRADENAME WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF

3 YEARS. GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF EMAGIC IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142. TOTAL CONSIDERATION WAS ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS (IN

THE

AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO IPR&D WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION, BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE

FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE IPR&D RELATES PRIMARILY TO EMAGIC'S LOGIC SERIES TECHNOLOGY AND EXTENSIONS. AT THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, THE PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WERE BETWEEN 43%-83%

COMPLETE, AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINING WORK WOULD BE COMPLETED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2003 AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $415,000. THE REMAINING EFFORTS, WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN 2003,

INCLUDED FINALIZING USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED USING AN INCOME APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE

GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED NET CASH FLOWS BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 25%.

ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF ZAYANTE, INC., PRISMO GRAPHICS, AND SILICON GRAIL

DURING FISCAL 2002 THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND PATENT RIGHTS OF ZAYANTE, INC., PRISMO GRAPHICS, AND SILICON GRAIL CORPORATION FOR A TOTAL OF

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS OF NOTHING REAL, LLC (NOTHING REAL), A PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS AND MARKETS HIGH

PERFORMANCE TOOLS DESIGNED FOR THE DIGITAL IMAGE CREATION MARKET. OF THE $15 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE, THE COMPANY HAS ALLOCATED $7 MILLION TO ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED

OVER ITS ESTIMATED LIFE OF 5 YEARS. THE REMAINING $8 MILLION, WHICH HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, RATHER THAN RECORDED AS AN ADDITIONAL COMPONENT OF THE COST OF THE

THE

AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO IPR&D WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION, BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE

FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE IPR&D RELATES TO TECHNOLOGIES REPRESENTING PROCESSES AND EXPERTISE EMPLOYED TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND DEPLOY A FUNCTIONING, SCALABLE WEB-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION

SYSTEM FOR USE BY K-12 SCHOOLS. AT THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, THE PRODUCT UNDER DEVELOPMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 50% COMPLETE, AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINING 50% WOULD BE COMPLETED

DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2002 AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $9.25 MILLION. THE REMAINING EFFORTS, WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN 2002, INCLUDED COMPLETION OF CODING, FINALIZING USER INTERFACE DESIGN

AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED USING AN INCOME APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND THAT

ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED NET CASH FLOWS BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 25%. THE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER

THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF 3 YEARS. DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRICTED STOCK AND OPTIONS IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE REQUIRED FUTURE VESTING PERIOD OF 3 YEARS.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, AN ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO INCREASE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF POWERSCHOOL BY $5.9 MILLION DUE TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED

LOSS CONTINGENCIES THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO CONSUMMATION OF THE ACQUISITION.

THE

COMPANY ALLOCATED $12.8 MILLION OF ITS PURCHASE CONSIDERATION FOR POWERSCHOOL TO DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTED THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF

STOCK OPTIONS ASSUMED THAT VEST AS FUTURE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY EMPLOYEES AND RELATED TO 445,000 COMMON SHARES ISSUED CONTINGENT ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF CERTAIN POWERSCHOOL EMPLOYEE

STOCKHOLDERS. CERTAIN POWERSCHOOL EMPLOYEE STOCKHOLDERS WERE TERMINATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 RESULTING IN THE $5 MILLION RECOGNITION OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION AS PART OF

THE COMPANY'S FIRST QUARTER RESTRUCTURING ACTION. UNAMORTIZED POWERSCHOOL RELATED DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION OF APPROXIMATELY $294,000 REMAINS AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003.

FISCAL 2003 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $26.8 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY

$7.4 MILLION IN SEVERANCE COSTS, A $5.0 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE-OFF DEFERRED COMPENSATION, $7.1 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND A $7.3 MILLION

CHARGE FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS. OF THE $26.8 MILLION, NEARLY ALL HAD BEEN SPENT BY THE END OF 2003, EXCEPT FOR APPROXIMATELY $400,000 OF SEVERANCE COSTS AND APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION

RELATED TO OPERATING LEASE COSTS ON ABANDONED FACILITIES. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, APPROXIMATELY $500,000 OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY ACCRUED FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN

EXCESS DUE TO THE SUBLEASE OF A PROPERTY SOONER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED AND AN APPROXIMATELY $500,000 SHORTFALL WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE SEVERANCE ACCRUAL DUE TO HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SEVERANCE COSTS

RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF THE COMPANY'S SINGAPORE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS HAD NO NET EFFECT ON REPORTED OPERATING EXPENSE.

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS THAT RESULTED IN RECOGNITION OF A TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $2.8 MILLION, INCLUDING

$2.4 MILLION IN SEVERANCE COSTS AND $400,000 FOR ASSET WRITE-OFFS AND LEASE PAYMENTS ON AN ABANDONED FACILITY. ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE SECOND QUARTER WERE FOR THE MOST PART

SUPPLEMENTAL TO ACTIONS INITIATED IN THE PRIOR TWO QUARTERS AND FOCUSED ON FURTHER HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN VARIOUS SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS IN THE COMPANY'S AMERICAS AND EUROPE OPERATING SEGMENTS

AND FURTHER REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH POWERSCHOOL-RELATED ACTIVITIES IN THE AMERICAS OPERATING SEGMENT, INCLUDING AN ACCRUAL FOR ASSET WRITE-OFFS AND LEASE PAYMENTS ON AN ABANDONED

FACILITY. THE SECOND QUARTER ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF 93 EMPLOYEES, 92 WERE TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE END OF 2003.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WITH A TOTAL COST OF $24 MILLION THAT RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS AT THE COMPANY-OWNED FACILITY IN SINGAPORE, FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN HEADCOUNT RESULTING FROM THE SHIFT IN POWERSCHOOL PRODUCT STRATEGY THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, AND

TERMINATION OF VARIOUS SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF 260 POSITIONS WORLDWIDE, ALL BUT ONE OF

WHICH WERE ELIMINATED BY THE END OF 2003.

CLOSURE

OF THE COMPANY'S SINGAPORE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS RESULTED IN SEVERANCE COSTS OF $1.8 MILLION AND COSTS OF $6.7 MILLION TO WRITE-OFF MANUFACTURING RELATED FIXED

ASSETS, WHOSE USE CEASED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. POWERSCHOOL RELATED COSTS INCLUDED SEVERANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $550,000 AND RECOGNITION OF $5 MILLION OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION

THAT AROSE WHEN POWERSCHOOL WAS ACQUIRED BY THE

82

COMPANY

IN 2001 RELATED TO CERTAIN POWERSCHOOL EMPLOYEE STOCKHOLDERS WHO WERE TERMINATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. TERMINATION OF SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES AND EMPLOYEES, PRINCIPALLY IN THE

UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, RESULTED IN SEVERANCE COSTS OF $2.8 MILLION AND ACCRUAL OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING LEASES ON CLOSED FACILITIES OF $6.7 MILLION. THE TOTAL NET

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $23 MILLION RECOGNIZED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 ALSO REFLECTS THE REVERSAL OF $600,000 OF UNUSED RESTRUCTURING ACCRUAL ORIGINALLY MADE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2002.

EXCEPT

FOR CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING LEASES ON CLOSED FACILITIES, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT ALL OF THE REMAINING ACCRUAL FOR SEVERANCE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $400,000 WILL

BE SPENT BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004.

PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PSE PRODUCT IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.5 MILLION.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WITH A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION. THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS RESULTED IN

THE

FOREIGN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION, $284 MILLION AND $363 MILLION IN 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. AS

OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED

IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FULLY PROVIDE FOR ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE FROM UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $822 MILLION OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE

INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS, AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS

OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED

TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES OF APPROXIMATELY $189 MILLION, WHICH EXPIRE FROM 2011 THROUGH 2023. A PORTION OF THESE

CARRYFORWARDS WAS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS, THE UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS FEDERAL CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS AND VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, THE TAX EFFECT OF WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY $117 MILLION AND WHICH EXPIRE BETWEEN 2004 AND 2023. THE REMAINING

BENEFITS FROM TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS DO NOT EXPIRE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $30 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX

LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX

85

APRIL 10, 2003, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) COMPLETED ITS AUDIT OF THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1998 THROUGH 2000 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. CERTAIN

OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE BEING CONTESTED THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1998 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS

BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY'S TAX AUDITS BE

RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

NOTE 7SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

CEO RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD

ON MARCH 19, 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN OPTION CANCELLATION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (THE AGREEMENT) WITH STEVEN P. JOBS, ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

(CEO). THE AGREEMENT CANCELLED STOCK OPTION AWARDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF 27.5 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK PREVIOUSLY GRANTED TO MR. JOBS IN 2000 AND 2001. MR. JOBS

RETAINED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 60,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK GRANTED IN AUGUST OF 1997 IN HIS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIOR TO BECOMING THE COMPANY'S CEO.

THE AGREEMENT REPLACED THE CANCELLED OPTIONS WITH A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD OF 5 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD GENERALLY VESTS THREE YEARS FROM DATE OF

GRANT. VESTING OF SOME OR ALL OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES WILL BE ACCELERATED IN THE EVENT MR. JOBS IS TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE, DIES, OR HAS HIS MANAGEMENT ROLE REDUCED FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

THE

COMPANY HAS RECORDED THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD OF $74.75 MILLION AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND IS AMORTIZING THAT AMOUNT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

THE 3-YEAR SERVICE/VESTING PERIOD. THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WAS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S

86

COMMON

STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD. TOTAL AMORTIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN 2003 AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE INCLUDED

AT APPROXIMATELY $6.2 MILLION PER QUARTER THROUGH MARCH 2006. THE 5 MILLION RESTRICTED SHARES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE UTILIZING THE

TREASURY STOCK METHOD.

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES

NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN SEPTEMBER OF 2003 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $16.64 PER

SHARE FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. IN AUGUST 2003, THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY, AT WHICH TIME THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $22.81.

OTHER THAN THIS FORWARD PURCHASE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY TRANSACTIONS TO REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK SINCE FISCAL 2000. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN, THE

COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 6.55 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $217 MILLION. THE COMPANY WAS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS

OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003.

PREFERRED STOCK

IN AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY AND MICROSOFT CORPORATION (MICROSOFT) ENTERED INTO PATENT CROSS LICENSE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, MICROSOFT PURCHASED 150,000

SHARES OF APPLE SERIES A NONVOTING CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK ("PREFERRED STOCK") FOR $150 MILLION. THESE SHARES WERE CONVERTIBLE BY MICROSOFT AFTER AUGUST 5, 2000, INTO SHARES

OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $8.25 PER SHARE. DURING 2000, 74,250 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK WERE CONVERTED TO 9 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. DURING

2001, THE REMAINING 75,750 PREFERRED SHARES WERE CONVERTED INTO 9.2 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS AND LOSSES THAT UNDER

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND NET DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

NOTE 8EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

2003 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN

AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS HELD ON APRIL 24, 2003, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO THE 1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE

PLAN TO THE 2003 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN (THE 2003 PLAN), TO PROVIDE FOR BROAD-BASED GRANTS TO ALL EMPLOYEES IN ADDITION TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES AND TO PROHIBIT FUTURE

"REPRICINGS" OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, INCLUDING

6-MONTHS-PLUS-1-DAY OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAMS, WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. BASED ON THE TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL OPTION GRANTS, OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE

2003 PLAN GENERALLY EXPIRE 7 TO 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND GENERALLY BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER A PERIOD OF 4 YEARS, BASED ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT, WITH EITHER ANNUAL OR QUARTERLY

VESTING. THE 2003 PLAN PERMITS THE GRANTING OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.

1997 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN

IN AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE 1997 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN (THE 1997 PLAN), A NON-SHAREHOLDER APPROVED PLAN FOR GRANTS OF

STOCK OPTIONS TO EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. OPTIONS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE 1997 PLAN TO EMPLOYEES AT NOT LESS THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. BASED ON THE TERMS

OF INDIVIDUAL OPTION GRANTS, OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 1997

88

PLAN

GENERALLY EXPIRE 7 TO 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND GENERALLY BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER A PERIOD OF 4 YEARS, BASED ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT, WITH EITHER ANNUAL OR QUARTERLY

VESTING. AS A RESULT OF SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE 1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN IN APRIL 2003, THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE 1997 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN AND CANCELLED ALL

REMAINING UNISSUED SHARES, FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM IN OCTOBER 2003.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM

ON MARCH 20, 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM (THE EXCHANGE PROGRAM) WHEREBY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, OTHER THAN EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE OUTSTANDING OPTIONS WITH EXERCISE PRICES AT OR ABOVE $25.00 PER SHARE FOR A PREDETERMINED SMALLER NUMBER OF NEW STOCK

OPTIONS ISSUED WITH EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ONE SHARE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE NEW AWARDS ARE ISSUED, WHICH WOULD BE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS PLUS ONE DAY

AFTER THE EXCHANGE OPTIONS ARE CANCELLED. ON APRIL 17, 2003, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ACCEPTED AND CANCELLED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 16,569,193 SHARES OF ITS COMMON

STOCK. ON OCTOBER 22, 2003, NEW STOCK OPTIONS TOTALING 6,697,368 SHARES WERE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $22.76 PER SHARE, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE

COMPANY'S STOCK ON THAT DATE. NO FINANCIAL OR ACCOUNTING IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOW WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TRANSACTION.

1997 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN

IN AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED A SHAREHOLDER APPROVED DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN (DSOP) FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY.

INITIAL GRANTS OF 30,000 OPTIONS UNDER THE DSOP VEST IN THREE EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE FIRST THROUGH THIRD

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT, AND SUBSEQUENT ANNUAL GRANTS OF 10,000 OPTIONS ARE FULLY VESTED AT GRANT.

RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING MR. TIMOTHY D. COOK AND MR. FRED D. ANDERSON, HAVE ENTERED INTO TRADING PLANS PURSUANT TO

RULE 10B5-1(C)(1) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. A TRADING PLAN IS A WRITTEN DOCUMENT THAT PRE-ESTABLISHES THE AMOUNTS, PRICES AND DATES (OR FORMULA

FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS, PRICES AND DATES) OF FUTURE PURCHASES OR SALES OF APPLE STOCK INCLUDING THE EXERCISE AND SALE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND SHARES ACQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY'S

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS A SHAREHOLDER APPROVED EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (THE PURCHASE PLAN), UNDER WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES MAY PURCHASE COMMON STOCK THROUGH PAYROLL

DEDUCTIONS AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 85% OF THE LOWER OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUES AS OF THE BEGINNING AND END OF SIX-MONTH OFFERING PERIODS. STOCK PURCHASES UNDER THE PURCHASE PLAN ARE LIMITED TO

10% OF AN EMPLOYEE'S COMPENSATION, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $25,000 IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS ALSO APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE

PLAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE BY 4 MILLION SHARES. BEGINNING WITH THE SIX-MONTH OFFERING PERIOD THAT STARTED ON JUNE 30, 2003, THE NUMBER OF

SHARES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE IS LIMITED TO A TOTAL OF 1 MILLION SHARES PER OFFERING PERIOD. DURING 2003, 2002, AND 2001, 2.1 MILLION, 1.8 MILLION AND 1.8 MILLION SHARES,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE ISSUED UNDER THE PURCHASE PLAN. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, APPROXIMATELY 4.0 MILLION SHARES WERE RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE UNDER THE PURCHASE PLAN.

89

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS AN EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN) QUALIFYING AS A DEFERRED SALARY ARRANGEMENT UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. UNDER THE

SAVINGS PLAN, PARTICIPATING U.S. EMPLOYEES MAY DEFER A PORTION OF THEIR PRE-TAX EARNINGS, UP TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMIT ($12,000 FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2003). THE

COMPANY MATCHES 50% TO 100% OF EACH EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON LENGTH OF SERVICE, UP TO A MAXIMUM 6% OF THE EMPLOYEE'S EARNINGS. THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SAVINGS PLAN

WERE APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION, $19 MILLION, AND $17 MILLION IN 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 9STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE

COMPANY HAS PROVIDED PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 1 OF THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME (LOSS) AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE AS IF THE FAIR

VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK COMPENSATION HAD BEEN USED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN PURCHASES. THESE PRO FORMA EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT THE DATE

OF GRANT AND BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL.

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123, THE OPTION AWARDS ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2003 AND THE AWARDS CANCELLED AS PART OF THE EXCHANGE PROGRAM HAVE BEEN

ACCOUNTED FOR USING MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123, THE GRANT DATE OF THE AWARDS ISSUED IS THE DATE OF ACCEPTANCE OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER BY PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES. THE

CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S OPTIONS AND REPLACEMENT WITH RESTRICTED SHARES IN MARCH 2003 IS ALSO BEING ACCOUNTED FOR USING MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING FOR

PURPOSES OF THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123.

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS USED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 HAVE BEEN BASED SOLELY ON

THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OVER THE MOST RECENT PERIOD COMMENSURATE WITH THE ESTIMATED EXPECTED LIFE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTIONS. BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2003, THE COMPANY HAS MODIFIED THIS APPROACH TO CONSIDER OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS INCLUDING IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND THE IMPACT OF UNUSUAL

FLUCTUATIONS NOT REASONABLY EXPECTED TO RECUR ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS IN DEVELOPING THE

EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION USED TO VALUE FUTURE AWARDS.

BEGINNING

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY SHORTENED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE EXPECTED LIFE OF NEW OPTIONS GRANTED TO ITS EMPLOYEES FROM 4 YEARS TO 3.5 YEARS. THE COMPANY BASES ITS

EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION ON ITS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE STOCK OPTIONS IT GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES. THE CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION MADE DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003 WAS THE RESULT OF THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF SHORTENING THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF NEW OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES FROM 10 YEARS TO 7 YEARS AND CHANGING THE VESTING PROVISIONS

OF NEW OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES FROM 4 YEAR STRAIGHT-LINE ANNUAL VESTING TO 4 YEAR STRAIGHT-LINE QUARTERLY VESTING.

NOTE 10COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

LEASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY LEASES VARIOUS EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING RETAIL SPACE, UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY UTILIZE ANY OTHER

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE MAJOR FACILITY LEASES ARE FOR TERMS OF 5 TO 10 YEARS AND GENERALLY PROVIDE RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR TERMS OF 3 TO 5 ADDITIONAL YEARS. LEASES

FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR TERMS OF 5 TO 15 YEARS AND OFTEN CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS

UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE $600 MILLION, OF WHICH $354 MILLION RELATED TO LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE.

RENT

EXPENSE UNDER ALL OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH CANCELABLE AND NONCANCELABLE LEASES, WAS $97 MILLION, $92 MILLION, AND $80 MILLION IN 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCRUED WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF

PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR APPLE SOFTWARE AND FOR APPLE SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY

PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER ITS BASIC LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE

ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, HISTORICAL WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED

COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING WARRANTY

LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE EXPECTATIONS.

COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED

AGAINST ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS AS OF EITHER SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 OR SEPTEMBER 28,

2002.

93

CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, OR ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM

MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND

SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS

OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN

ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO

MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CPUS, LOGIC BOARDS, AND ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH OCCURS IN

VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING

PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION OBLIGATIONS.

CONTINGENCIES

BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2001, THREE SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST

THE COMPANY AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THESE LAWSUITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL, AND PURPORT TO BRING SUIT ON BEHALF OF PERSONS WHO PURCHASED THE COMPANY'S PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK BETWEEN

JULY 19, 2000, AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2000. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE 1934 SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THESE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ON JUNE 4, 2002, WHICH WAS HEARD BY THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2002.

ON DECEMBER 11, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY'S

MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION, WITH LEAVE TO PLAINTIFFS TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 31, 2003, AND

ON MARCH 17, 2003, THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT. THE COURT HEARD THE COMPANY'S MOTION ON JULY 11, 2003 AND DISMISSED PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS WITH PREJUDICE ON

AUGUST 12, 2003. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THE RULING.

THE

COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE

LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCTION

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS

94

THE

ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN

PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS THAT THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECTS

IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

NOTE 11SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE

COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH

AND SOUTH AMERICA, EXCEPT FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE JAPAN SEGMENT INCLUDES ONLY

JAPAN. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE RETAIL SEGMENT CURRENTLY OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE ASIA-PACIFIC, WHICH INCLUDES

AUSTRALIA AND ASIA EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, AND THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY, FILEMAKER, INC. EACH REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES, AND

THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1, EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT.

THE

COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES. THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S PERFORMANCE IS ALSO EVALUATED BASED ON OPERATING INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE

BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT INCLUDES NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, RELATED COST OF SALES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT.

OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT ARE MANAGED OUTSIDE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE VARIOUS

CORPORATE EXPENSES, MANUFACTURING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN STANDARD COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND VARIOUS NONRECURRING CHARGES. CORPORATE EXPENSES INCLUDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CORPORATE MARKETING

EXPENSES, AND OTHER SEPARATELY MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORT OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY

TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. SEGMENT ASSETS EXCLUDE CORPORATE ASSETS. CORPORATE ASSETS INCLUDE CASH, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS,

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND RETAIL STORE CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT

TO DEPRECIATION. EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE

$92 MILLION, $106 MILLION, AND $92 MILLION IN 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

OPERATING

INCOME FOR ALL SEGMENTS EXCEPT RETAIL INCLUDES COST OF SALES AT STANDARD COST. CERTAIN MANUFACTURING EXPENSES AND RELATED ADJUSTMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN SEGMENT COST OF SALES, INCLUDING

VARIANCES BETWEEN STANDARD AND ACTUAL MANUFACTURING COSTS AND THE MARK-UP ABOVE STANDARD COST FOR PRODUCT SUPPLIED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE EXPENSES.

TO

ASSESS THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN ITS RESULTS FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S

OTHER SEGMENTS. FIRST, COST OF SALES FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDES A MARK-UP ABOVE THE COMPANY'S STANDARD COST TO APPROXIMATE THE PRICE NORMALLY CHARGED TO THE COMPANY'S MAJOR CHANNEL

PARTNERS IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2001 THIS RESULTED IN THE

95

RECOGNITION

OF ADDITIONAL COST OF SALES ABOVE STANDARD COST BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND AN OFFSETTING BENEFIT TO CORPORATE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $106 MILLION, $52 MILLION, AND

$4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SECOND,

THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDES IN ITS NET SALES PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND ALSO RECOGNIZES RELATED COST OF SALES BASED ON THE AMOUNT AT WHICH

SUCH CONTRACTS ARE NORMALLY SOLD TO THE COMPANY'S RESELLERS OPERATING RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS TREATMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE COMPANY'S MAJOR RESELLERS ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES AND

COST OF THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EARNED THE REVENUE OR INCURRED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THESE CONTRACTS, AN OFFSET TO THESE

AMOUNTS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT'S NET SALES AND COST OF SALES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL

SEGMENT, WITH

CORRESPONDING OFFSETS IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, OF $30 MILLION AND $20 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF NET SALES

AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WITH CORRESPONDING OFFSETS IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, OF $8 MILLION AND $6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN FISCAL 2001.

THIRD,

A PORTION OF THE OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN HIGH PROFILE RETAIL STORES ARE ALLOCATED FROM THE RETAIL SEGMENT TO CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSE. ALLOCATION OF THESE EXPENSES

REFLECTS THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THESE STORES WHICH, GIVEN THEIR LARGER SIZE AND EXTRAORDINARY DESIGN ELEMENTS, FUNCTION AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING EVENTS,

AND BRAND AWARENESS. ALLOCATED OPERATING COSTS ARE THOSE IN EXCESS OF OPERATING COSTS INCURRED BY ONE OF THE COMPANY'S MORE TYPICAL RETAIL LOCATIONS. STORES WERE OPEN IN THREE SUCH HIGH PROFILE

LOCATIONS IN NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, AND CHICAGO AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003. EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE MARKETING RESULTING FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THESE THREE STORES WERE $6 MILLION

AND $1 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

THE FORM AND AMOUNT OF DIRECTOR COMPENSATION IS DETERMINED BY THE BOARD AFTER A REVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE. THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF THE BOARD IS

THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF A DIRECTOR'S ANNUAL RETAINER BE EQUITY-BASED. IN 1998, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE 1997 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN (THE "

DIRECTOR

PLAN"

) AND 800,000 SHARES WERE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER. PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTOR PLAN, THE COMPANY'S NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS ARE GRANTED AN OPTION TO

ACQUIRE 30,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UPON THEIR INITIAL ELECTION TO THE BOARD ("

INITIAL OPTIONS"

). THE INITIAL OPTIONS VEST AND BECOME EXERCISABLE IN

THREE EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE FIRST THROUGH THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF A NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR'S INITIAL ELECTION TO THE BOARD AND

ON EACH SUBSEQUENT ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER, THE DIRECTOR WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE 10,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ("

ANNUAL

OPTIONS"

). ANNUAL OPTIONS ARE FULLY VESTED AND IMMEDIATELY EXERCISABLE ON THEIR DATE OF GRANT. AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THERE WERE OPTIONS FOR 370,000 SHARES

OUTSTANDING UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN. SINCE ACCEPTING THE POSITION OF CEO, MR. JOBS IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN. DIRECTORS ALSO RECEIVE A $50,000 ANNUAL RETAINER

PAID IN QUARTERLY INCREMENTS. DIRECTORS DO NOT RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION FOR SERVING ON COMMITTEES OR AS COMMITTEE CHAIRPERSON.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ARE MESSRS. WILLIAM V. CAMPBELL, MILLARD S. DREXLER, ALBERT GORE, JR. AND DR. ARTHUR B. LEVINSON, NONE OF WHOM
