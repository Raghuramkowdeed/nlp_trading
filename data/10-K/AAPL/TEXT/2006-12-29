EXPLANATORY NOTE

IN THIS FORM 10-K, APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

(APPLE OR THE COMPANY) IS RESTATING ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, AND EACH OF THE QUARTERS IN FISCAL YEAR 2005.

THIS FORM 10-K ALSO REFLECTS THE

RESTATEMENT OF SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA IN ITEM 6 FOR THE FISCAL

YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2005, 2004, 2003, AND 2002, AND MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

ITEM 7 FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25,

2004.

PREVIOUSLY FILED ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K

AND QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AFFECTED BY THE RESTATEMENTS HAVE

NOT BEEN AMENDED AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON.

ON JUNE 29, 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN

INTERNAL REVIEW HAD DISCOVERED IRREGULARITIES RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF

CERTAIN STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE BETWEEN 1997 AND 2001, INCLUDING A GRANT TO

ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) STEVE JOBS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT

A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS (SPECIAL COMMITTEE) HAD BEEN FORMED

AND HAD HIRED INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES. ON OCTOBER 4, 2006, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE KEY RESULTS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES INVESTIGATION,

WHICH ARE SET FORTH IN THE COMPANYS FORM 8-K FILED ON THAT DATE.

AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL REVIEW AND THE INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, AND THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AGREES, THAT INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES WERE USED FOR

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE IN PRIOR

PERIODS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ADDITIONAL NON-CASH STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS WITH REGARD TO PAST STOCK OPTION

GRANTS, AND THE COMPANY IS RESTATING PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

THIS FORM 10-K. THESE ADJUSTMENTS, AFTER TAX, AMOUNTED TO $4

MILLION, $7 MILLION, AND $10 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THE ADJUSTMENT TO 2006 WAS RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

FISCAL YEAR 2006 DUE TO ITS INSIGNIFICANCE.

THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND ITS FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS (INVESTIGATIVE

TEAM) REVIEWED THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING STOCK OPTION GRANTS

MADE ON 259 DATES. THE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM SPENT OVER 26,500 PERSON-HOURS

SEARCHING MORE THAN ONE MILLION PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS AND

INTERVIEWING MORE THAN 40 CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,

AND ADVISORS. BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE TOTALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE APPLICABLE

LAW, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOUND NO MISCONDUCT BY CURRENT MANAGEMENT. THE

SPECIAL COMMITTEES INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF GRANTS FOR WHICH GRANT

DATES WERE INTENTIONALLY SELECTED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE EXERCISE PRICES.

THE TERMS OF THESE AND CERTAIN OTHER GRANTS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, WERE FINALIZED

AFTER THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES. THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT

THE PROCEDURES FOR GRANTING, ACCOUNTING FOR, AND REPORTING STOCK OPTION GRANTS

2

DID NOT INCLUDE SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT

MANIPULATION. ALTHOUGH THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT CEO STEVE JOBS WAS AWARE OR

RECOMMENDED THE SELECTION OF SOME FAVORABLE GRANT DATES, HE DID NOT RECEIVE OR

FINANCIALLY BENEFIT FROM THESE GRANTS OR APPRECIATE THE ACCOUNTING

IMPLICATIONS. THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ALSO FOUND THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAD

RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF TWO FORMER OFFICERS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACCOUNTING, RECORDING AND REPORTING OF STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS FROM THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL REVIEW AND THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, AN

ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED OF THE MEASUREMENT DATES FOR THE 42,077 STOCK OPTION

GRANTS MADE ON 259 DATES BETWEEN OCTOBER 1996 AND JANUARY 2003 (THE RELEVANT

PERIOD). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ANALYSIS WAS PROPERLY LIMITED TO THE

RELEVANT PERIOD. IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING ALL GRANTS MADE DURING THE RELEVANT

PERIOD, THE COMPANY SAMPLED CERTAIN GRANTS BETWEEN 1994 AND 1997 AND FOUND NONE

THAT REQUIRED ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. THE FIRST GRANTS FOR WHICH STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS REQUIRED ARE DATED DECEMBER 29, 1997. THE COMPANY

ALSO EXAMINED GRANTS MADE AFTER THE RELEVANT PERIOD AND FOUND NONE THAT

REQUIRED ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. MOREOVER, IN THE YEARS AFTER 2002, APPLE MADE

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES IN RESPONSE TO

EVOLVING LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING LITERATURE AND RECENT

GUIDANCE FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), THE GRANTS DURING

THE RELEVANT PERIOD WERE ORGANIZED INTO CATEGORIES BASED ON GRANT TYPE AND

PROCESS BY WHICH THE GRANT WAS FINALIZED. THE COMPANY ANALYZED THE EVIDENCE

RELATED TO EACH CATEGORY OF GRANTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ELECTRONIC

AND PHYSICAL DOCUMENTS, DOCUMENT METADATA, AND WITNESS INTERVIEWS. BASED ON THE

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE CONTROLLING

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO DETERMINE, FOR EVERY GRANT WITHIN EACH CATEGORY, THE

PROPER MEASUREMENT DATE. IF THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS NOT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED

GRANT DATE, ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE AS REQUIRED, RESULTING IN

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS.

THE 42,077 GRANTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS FOLLOWS: (1) 17

GRANTS TO PERSONS ELECTED OR APPOINTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (DIRECTOR

GRANTS); (2) 3,892 GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN

DESCRIBED BELOW (MONDAY/TUESDAY GRANTS); (3) 27,096 GRANTS MADE IN

BROAD-BASED AWARDS TO LARGE NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES, USUALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (FOCAL

GRANTS); (4) 9,988 OTHER GRANTS RATIFIED AT MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OR

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (MEETING GRANTS); (5) 1,082 OTHER GRANTS RATIFIED

BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT (UWC) OF THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (OTHER

UWC GRANTS); AND (6) TWO GRANTS TO THE CEO (CEO GRANTS). ALL REFERENCES

TO THE NUMBER OF OPTION SHARES, OPTION EXERCISE PRICES, AND SHARE PRICES IN

THIS EXPLANATORY NOTE HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT STOCK SPLITS.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DIRECTOR GRANTS, ALL STOCK

OPTION GRANTS WERE SUBJECT TO RATIFICATION BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE AT A MEETING OR BY UWC. FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE GRANTS AT A MEETING

OR BY UWC, THE COMPANYS LEGAL STAFF WOULD PREPARE A SECRETARYS CERTIFICATE

CERTIFYING THE RATIFICATION OF THE GRANTS. BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

DESCRIBED BELOW, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE RECIPIENTS AND TERMS OF

CERTAIN GRANTS WERE FIXED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES BEFORE RATIFICATION PURSUANT

TO PARAMETERS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

THROUGH THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN AND THE FOCAL PROCESS. AS FURTHER DISCUSSED

BELOW, WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS, MANAGEMENT HAD THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE

RECIPIENTS AND TERMS FOR EACH GRANT. THUS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE

MEASUREMENT DATES FOR THESE GRANTS OCCURRED WHEN MANAGEMENTS PROCESS FOR

ALLOCATING THESE GRANTS WAS COMPLETED AND THE GRANTS WERE READY FOR

RATIFICATION, WHICH WAS CONSIDERED PERFUNCTORY. WITH REGARD TO ALL OTHER

GRANTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE GRANTS WERE FINALIZED AND THE

MEASUREMENT DATES OCCURRED WHEN THE GRANTS WERE RATIFIED. FOR MANY GRANTS,

HOWEVER, THE DATES OF RATIFICATION CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED BECAUSE THE DATES THE

UWCS WERE EXECUTED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR RECEIVED

BY THE COMPANY ARE NOT AVAILABLE. FOR SUCH GRANTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED

THAT THE DATE OF THE PREPARATION OF THE SECRETARYS CERTIFICATE IS THE BEST

ALTERNATIVE FOR DETERMINING THE ACTUAL DATE OF RATIFICATION.

3

AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS DETERMINED

THAT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES FOR 6,428 GRANTS ON 42 DATES ARE NOT

THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. ACCORDINGLY, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR FORFEITURES,

THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $105 MILLION ON

A PRE-TAX BASIS OVER THE RESPECTIVE AWARDS VESTING TERMS. NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE

REQUIRED FOR THE REMAINING 35,649 GRANTS. THE ADJUSTMENTS WERE DETERMINED BY

CATEGORY AS FOLLOWS.

DIRECTOR GRANTSSEVENTEEN DIRECTOR GRANTS WERE MADE

DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. TWO DIRECTOR GRANTS WERE MADE PURSUANT TO A 1997

PLAN THAT DATED THE GRANTS ON THE ENACTMENT OF THE PLAN. THE REMAINING FIFTEEN

GRANTS WERE AUTOMATICALLY MADE UNDER THE DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN 1998, ON THE DATE

OF A DIRECTORS ELECTION OR APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD AND ON SUBSEQUENT

ANNIVERSARIES, BEGINNING ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY. ACCORDINGLY, THE ANALYSIS

DETERMINED THAT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATE FOR EACH DIRECTOR GRANT IS

THE MEASUREMENT DATE, AND NO ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS ARE REQUIRED.

MONDAY/TUESDAY GRANTSBEGINNING IN DECEMBER 1998,

3,892 NEW HIRE GRANTS AND GRANTS FOR PROMOTION AND RETENTION PURPOSES (PROMOTION/RETENTION

GRANTS) WERE MADE DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD UNDER THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN.

UNDER THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN, NEW HIRE GRANTS MADE WITHIN PRE-ESTABLISHED

GUIDELINES APPROVED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WERE DATED ON THE

MONDAY THAT THE RECIPIENT STARTED WORK (OR THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, IF THE

RECIPIENT STARTED ON ANOTHER DAY). THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS SHOWED THIS PROCESS

TO BE RELIABLE WITH VERY LOW ERROR RATES. PROMOTION/RETENTION GRANTS, ALSO

BASED ON PRE-ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES, WERE MADE GENERALLY ON THE FIRST TUESDAY

OF EACH MONTH. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE NEW HIRE AND

PROMOTION/RETENTION GRANTS MADE PURSUANT TO THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN WITHIN

PRE-ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES DO NOT REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SIX

GRANTS THAT WERE ERRONEOUSLY DATED BEFORE THE EMPLOYEES START DATES. FOR 120

NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION/RETENTION GRANTS MADE OUTSIDE THE GUIDELINES, HOWEVER,

THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MEASUREMENT DATES ARE THE DATES OF

RATIFICATION BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RATHER THAN THE DATES USED

FOR GRANTS WITHIN GUIDELINES. ACCORDINGLY, BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY DESCRIBED

ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $6

MILLION FROM 126 GRANTS. IF OTHER DATES IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE PREPARATION

OF THE UWC AND THE PREPARATION OF THE SECRETARYS CERTIFICATE HAD BEEN USED AS

MEASUREMENT DATES FOR GRANTS WHOSE ACTUAL RATIFICATION DATES ARE UNKNOWN, THE

TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD HAVE RANGED FROM APPROXIMATELY $3

MILLION TO $7 MILLION.

FOCAL GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, 27,096 FOCAL

GRANTS WERE MADE TO EMPLOYEES TYPICALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS PART OF AN

EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT REQUIRED SEVERAL MONTHS TO COMPLETE. PURSUANT TO LIMITS,

GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE, MANAGERS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES IN THEIR AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY. AFTER SENIOR MANAGEMENT

HAD DETERMINED THAT THE GRANTS WERE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE ESTABLISHED

LIMITS, GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES, MANAGEMENT TREATED THE GRANTS AS FINAL WHEN

THEY WERE SUBMITTED TO THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FOR RATIFICATION. THE

COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT FOR 5,595 GRANTS ON FIVE DATES, THE ORIGINALLY

ASSIGNED GRANT DATES ARE NOT THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. FOR THESE GRANTS,

MANAGEMENTS PROCESS FOR FINALIZING THE GRANTS WAS COMPLETED AFTER THE ORIGINALLY

ASSIGNED GRANT DATES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED $29 MILLION OF

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. FOR TWO OF THE FIVE GRANT DATES COMPRISING

3,744 GRANTS, THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE GRANTS WERE FINALIZED AND THE

MEASUREMENT DATE OCCURRED ONE DAY AFTER THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES. THE

GRANTS ON THESE TWO DATES REPRESENT MORE THAN $16 MILLION OF THE TOTAL $29

MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM FOCAL GRANTS.

OTHER MEETING GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD,

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WERE HELD TO RATIFY 9,988

GRANTS THAT ARE NOT MONDAY/TUESDAY, FOCAL OR CEO GRANTS. THE GRANT DATES AND

MEASUREMENT DATES FOR THESE GRANTS ARE THE MEETING DATES WHEN THE GRANTS WERE

RATIFIED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 46 GRANTS. FORTY-TWO OF THESE 46 GRANTS ARE

DATED CONCURRENT WITH A MEETING THAT CONSIDERED AND APPROVED CERTAIN GRANTS,

BUT THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ALL OF THE GRANTS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FINALIZED

UNTIL A

4

LATER DATE. ONE OF THE 46 GRANTS WAS APPROVED AND

DATED AT ANOTHER MEETING, BUT THE RECIPIENT, WHO WAS BECOMING EMPLOYED BY THE

COMPANY AS PART OF A CORPORATE ACQUISITION, DID NOT START UNTIL A LATER DATE.

TWO OTHER GRANTS WERE APPROVED BEFORE THE EMPLOYEES START DATES. ANOTHER GRANT

WAS MISTAKENLY CANCELLED AND SUBSEQUENTLY REINSTATED, REQUIRING AN ACCOUNTING

ADJUSTMENT. THUS, FOR THESE 46 GRANTS THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ORIGINALLY

ASSIGNED GRANT DATES ARE NOT THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. AS A RESULT, THE

COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED $2 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

OTHER UWC GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, 1,082

GRANTS WERE APPROVED BY UWCS FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING EXECUTIVE

RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, PROMOTION AND NEW HIRES OUTSIDE THE MONDAY/TUESDAY

PROCESS. THESE GRANTS WERE NOT MADE PURSUANT TO PRE-ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES

ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS

CONCLUDED THAT THESE GRANTS WERE NOT FINALIZED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES UNTIL

RATIFICATION BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. ACCORDINGLY, FOR 660

GRANTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES ARE

NOT THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED $48

MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. IF OTHER DATES IN THE PERIOD FROM

THE PREPARATION OF THE UWC TO THE PREPARATION OF THE SECRETARYS CERTIFICATE

HAD BEEN USED AS MEASUREMENT DATES FOR GRANTS WHOSE ACTUAL RATIFICATION DATES

ARE UNKNOWN, THE TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WOULD HAVE RANGED FROM

APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION TO $56 MILLION.

CEO GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, THE COMPANY

MADE TWO GRANTS TO CEO STEVE JOBS. THE FIRST GRANT, DATED JANUARY 12,

2000, WAS FOR 10 MILLION OPTION SHARES. THE SECOND GRANT, DATED OCTOBER 19,

2001, WAS FOR 7.5 MILLION OPTION SHARES. BOTH GRANTS WERE CANCELLED IN MARCH 2003

PRIOR TO BEING EXERCISED, WHEN MR. JOBS RECEIVED 5 MILLION SHARES OF

RESTRICTED STOCK.

WITH RESPECT TO THE GRANT DATED JANUARY 12, 2000,

THE BOARD ON DECEMBER 2, 1999, AUTHORIZED A SPECIAL CEO COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE TO GRANT MR. JOBS UP TO 15 MILLION SHARES. THE EVIDENCE

INDICATES THAT THE CEO COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FINALIZED THE TERMS OF THE GRANT

ON JANUARY 12, 2000, ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEES ACTION WAS MEMORIALIZED IN A

UWC TRANSMITTED ON JANUARY 18, 2000. BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE ORIGINALLY

ASSIGNED GRANT DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED ANY STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THIS GRANT. IF THE COMPANY HAD DETERMINED THAT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE WAS THE DATE WHEN THE UWC WAS EXECUTED OR RECEIVED, THEN

ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED.

THE GRANT DATED OCTOBER 19, 2001 WAS ORIGINALLY

APPROVED AT A BOARD MEETING ON AUGUST 29, 2001, WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$17.83. THE TERMS OF THE GRANT, HOWEVER, WERE NOT FINALIZED UNTIL DECEMBER 18,

2001. THE GRANT WAS DATED OCTOBER 19, 2001, WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$18.30. THE APPROVAL FOR THE GRANT WAS IMPROPERLY RECORDED AS OCCURRING AT A

SPECIAL BOARD MEETING ON OCTOBER 19, 2001. SUCH A SPECIAL BOARD MEETING

DID NOT OCCUR. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY CURRENT MEMBER OF

MANAGEMENT WAS AWARE OF THIS IRREGULARITY. THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED $20

MILLION IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THIS GRANT, REFLECTING THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF $18.30 AND THE SHARE PRICE ON DECEMBER 18,

2001 OF $21.01.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED

TO BRINGING THE BEST PERSONAL COMPUTING AND PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC EXPERIENCE

TO STUDENTS, EDUCATORS, CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS, BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES, AND CONSUMERS THROUGH ITS INNOVATIVE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS,

SERVICES, AND INTERNET OFFERINGS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY LEVERAGES ITS

UNIQUE ABILITY TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP ITS OWN OPERATING SYSTEM, HARDWARE,

APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES TO PROVIDE ITS CUSTOMERS NEW PRODUCTS AND

SOLUTIONS WITH SUPERIOR EASE-OF-USE, SEAMLESS INTEGRATION, AND INNOVATIVE

INDUSTRIAL DESIGN. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CONTINUAL INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT IS CRITICAL TO FACILITATE INNOVATION OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGIES. BESIDES UPDATES TO ITS EXISTING LINE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS

AND RELATED SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PERIPHERALS, AND NETWORKING SOLUTIONS, THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO CAPITALIZE ON THE CONVERGENCE OF DIGITAL CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS AND THE PERSONAL COMPUTER BY CREATING AND REFINING INNOVATIONS LIKE

THE IPOD AND ITUNES STORE. THE COMPANYS STRATEGY ALSO INCLUDES EXPANDING ITS

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO EFFECTIVELY REACH MORE OF ITS TARGETED CUSTOMERS AND

WITH KNOWLEDGEABLE SALESPERSONS THAT CAN CONVEY THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES GREATLY ENHANCES ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN

THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS,

EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND BUSINESSES THROUGH ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES. THE

COMPANY HAS ALSO INVESTED IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING THE

APPLE SALES CONSULTANT PROGRAM, WHICH PLACES APPLE EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS AT

PRODUCT FAMILY IN ORDER TO MAKE ITS PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT LOCATIONS WHERE ITS

CUSTOMERS SHOP.

BY THE END OF FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY HAD OPENED A

TOTAL OF 165 RETAIL STORES, INCLUDING 147 STORES IN THE U.S. AND A TOTAL OF 18

OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2006. THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY LOCATED ITS

STORES AT HIGH-TRAFFIC LOCATIONS IN QUALITY SHOPPING MALLS AND URBAN SHOPPING

DISTRICTS.

ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE RETAIL INITIATIVE IS TO BRING NEW CUSTOMERS TO

THE COMPANY AND EXPAND ITS INSTALLED BASE THROUGH SALES TO COMPUTER USERS WHO

CURRENTLY DO NOT OWN A MACINTOSH COMPUTER AND FIRST TIME PERSONAL COMPUTER

BUYERS. BY OPERATING ITS OWN STORES AND BUILDING THEM IN DESIRABLE HIGH-TRAFFIC

LOCATIONS, THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO BETTER CONTROL THE CUSTOMER RETAIL EXPERIENCE

AND ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS. THE STORES ARE DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY AND ENHANCE THE

PRESENTATION AND MARKETING OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PRODUCTS. TO THAT

END, RETAIL STORE CONFIGURATIONS HAVE EVOLVED INTO VARIOUS SIZES IN ORDER TO

ACCOMMODATE MARKET DEMANDS. THE STORES EMPLOY EXPERIENCED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE

PERSONNEL WHO PROVIDE PRODUCT ADVICE AND CERTAIN HARDWARE SUPPORT SERVICES. THE

STORES OFFER A WIDE SELECTION OF THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND VARIOUS

OTHER COMPUTING PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES SELECTED TO COMPLEMENT THE COMPANYS OWN

PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE STORES PROVIDE A FORUM IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS ABLE

TO OFFER SPECIALIZED SERVICE AND PERSONALIZED TRAINING.

REPRESENTATION OF STUDENT THOUGHT AND IDEAS. THE COMPANY CREATES SOLUTIONS THAT

ENABLE NEW MODES OF CURRICULUM DELIVERY, BETTER WAYS OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH,

AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF FACULTY, STUDENTS, AND STAFF.

MACBOOK®, VIDEO CREATION AND EDITING SOLUTIONS, WIRELESS NETWORKING,

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS, AND ONE-TO-ONE (1:1) LEARNING SOLUTIONS. A

1:1 LEARNING SOLUTION

TYPICALLY CONSIST OF A

PORTABLE COMPUTER FOR EVERY STUDENT AND TEACHER ALONG WITH THE INSTALLATION OF

A WIRELESS NETWORK.

CREATIVE

PROFESSIONALS

MOST IMPORTANT MARKETS FOR BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. THIS MARKET IS

ALSO IMPORTANT TO MANY THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WHO PROVIDE MACINTOSH-COMPATIBLE

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS. CREATIVE CUSTOMERS UTILIZE THE COMPANYS

MARKETS AND

DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS

ARE PRIMARILY IN THE EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS MARKETS. THE

COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND

REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS. NO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE

THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 2006, 2005, OR 2004. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF

ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR

MARKETS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS, EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND BUSINESSES THROUGH ITS

OWN SALES FORCE AND RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES. TEN PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET

SALES IN 2006 WERE THROUGH ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL, INCLUDING SALES TO ELEMENTARY

AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS, AND INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN

ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE MARKETS FOR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, PERSONAL

COMPUTERS AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE CAPABILITIES AND

USE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND OTHER DIGITAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND HAVE

RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS WITH COMPETITIVE PRICE,

FEATURE, AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE

COMPETITION IN THESE MARKETS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANYS

COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS HAVE

AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN

MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION CAN

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON

GROSS MARGINS. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE PRICE, RELATIVE

PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN INNOVATION,

AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE, PRODUCT FEATURES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY OF HARDWARE PERIPHERALS, AND

CORPORATE REPUTATION. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS

CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET

DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER, SIMPLER, AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL

COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE FACED

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC

AND CONTENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE OFFERING FREE PEER-TO-PEER

MUSIC AND VIDEO SERVICES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CURRENTLY RETAINS A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FROM INNOVATION AND BY MORE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING THE

ENTIRE SOLUTION INCLUDING THE HARDWARE (PERSONAL COMPUTER AND IPOD), SOFTWARE

(ITUNES), AND DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT (ITUNES STORE). HOWEVER, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS COMPETITION IN THIS SPACE TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO

IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO TIGHTLY INTEGRATE THESE COMPONENTS WITHIN

THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO

OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE INTEGRATED THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. SOME

OF THESE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY

BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT

A LOSS TO COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS OFFERINGS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM

AND TO THE COMPANYS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES RELATED TO DIGITAL CONTENT

TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING

PLATFORMS.

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS

INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ASICS)

ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY

COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE

AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS AND PRICING

PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS UNCOMMON TO THE REST

OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS

INTRODUCED BY

17

THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS

OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS

A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF

A KEY OR SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR

CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS OF

COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED

PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE

COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL RISKS

BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THESE AND OTHER KEY SUPPLIERS ON PRODUCT INTRODUCTION

PLANS, STRATEGIC INVENTORIES, COORDINATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND INTERNAL

AND EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL

PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND

INFORMATION. THE COMPANYS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150

DAYS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE

ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE

COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND

FINANCIAL POSITION. AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE AGERE SYSTEMS, INC.,

AMBIT MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION, AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY LIMITED, ASUSTEK

CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., ATHEROS COMMUNICATIONS INC., AU

OPTRONICS CORPORATION, BROADCOM CORPORATION, CHI MEI OPTOELECTRONICS

CORPORATION, CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION, HITACHI GLOBAL STORAGE

TECHNOLOGIES, HON HAI PRECISION INDUSTRY CO., LTD., INTEL CORPORATION, INVENTEC

APPLIANCES CORPORATION, LG. PHILLIPS CO., LTD., MATSUSHITA, NVIDIA CORP.,

PORTALPLAYER, INC., QUANTA COMPUTER, INC., RENESAS SEMICONDUCTOR CO.

LTD., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, SONY CORPORATION, SYNAPTICS, INC., TEXAS

INSTRUMENTS, AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IS

HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE

EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE AREAS OF HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, CONSUMER ELECTRONIC

PRODUCTS, SYSTEM SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS

SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS, AND THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY MAY EXPAND THE RANGE OF

ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THROUGH LICENSING AND/OR

ACQUISITION OF THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOTALED $712 MILLION, $535 MILLION (AS

RESTATED

(1)

),

AND $491 MILLION (AS RESTATED

(1)

)

IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

PATENTS,

TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND

COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, IPODS,

PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED,

AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE U.S. AND A

NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR APPLE, THE APPLE LOGO, MACINTOSH, IPOD, ITUNES,

ITUNES STORE, AND NUMEROUS OTHER TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND

SERVICE MARKS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES

DEPEND IN PART ON THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF, THE COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE

INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE, AND MARKETING ABILITIES OF ITS

PERSONNEL.

NOTE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PART I, ITEM 1 AND NOTE 2, RESTATEMENT OF

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K.

18

MANY OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM

THIRD-PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW

LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH

LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS; HOWEVER,

THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH LICENSES COULD BE OBTAINED AT ALL. BECAUSE OF

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT

COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN

COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE

EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED

THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OF THIRD-PARTIES.

FOREIGN AND

DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE U.S. REPRESENTS THE COMPANYS LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC

MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE COMPANYS NET SALES IN 2006 CAME FROM

SALES TO CUSTOMERS INSIDE THE U.S. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN CORK,

IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA; FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA;

TAIWAN; THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA; THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA; AND THE CZECH

REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURING OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN TAIWAN, CHINA, JAPAN,

KOREA, AND SINGAPORE. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS

PORTABLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK PROS, MACBOOKS, AND IPODS, IS PERFORMED BY

THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN

FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED

FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND

ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

INFORMATION REGARDING

FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM 10-K AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AT NOTE 11, SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA.

SEASONAL BUSINESS

THE COMPANY HAS

HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN ITS FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL

QUARTERS COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND

RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. THIS

HISTORICAL PATTERN SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE

COMPANYS FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC

LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY

PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY

THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS

SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION,

CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE EXTENDED SERVICE COVERAGE ON MOST OF THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS IN ALL OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF

PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS

FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG OFTEN INCREASES IN

ANTICIPATION OF OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AS DEALERS

ANTICIPATE SHORTAGES. BACKLOG IS OFTEN REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND CUSTOMERS

BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG SHOULD

NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY

PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

19

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN

LAWS ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TO DATE HAD NO MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

IN THE FUTURE, THESE LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF

ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR

RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED

IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS

EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE

BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006, THE COMPANY HAD 17,787 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AND AN ADDITIONAL

2,399 TEMPORARY EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS.

ITEM 1A. RISK

FACTORS

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING

FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE

A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE

HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE MATTERS RELATING TO THE INVESTIGATION BY THE

SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

ON JUNE 29, 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN

INTERNAL REVIEW HAD DISCOVERED IRREGULARITIES RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF

CERTAIN STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE BETWEEN 1997 AND 2001, INCLUDING A GRANT TO

ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO), STEVE JOBS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED A

SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS (SPECIAL COMMITTEE) HAD BEEN FORMED

AND HAD HIRED INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES. AS DESCRIBED IN THE

EXPLANATORY NOTE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PART I, ITEM 1, AND IN NOTE 2 RESTATEMENT

OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K, AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL REVIEW AND

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, AND THE AUDIT AND FINANCE

COMMITTEE AGREES, THAT INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES WERE USED FOR FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE IN

20

CERTAIN PRIOR PERIODS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS

RECORDED ADDITIONAL NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND RELATED TAX

EFFECTS, WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTS, AND THE COMPANY HAS RESTATED

CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-K.

THE INTERNAL REVIEW, THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION,

AND RELATED ACTIVITIES HAVE REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES

FOR LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, TAX AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, HAVE DIVERTED

MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, AND COULD IN THE FUTURE HARM

ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MADE APPROPRIATE

JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE CORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES FOR ITS STOCK OPTION

GRANTS, THE SEC MAY DISAGREE WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED

FOR AND REPORTED, OR NOT REPORTED, THE FINANCIAL IMPACT. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS

A RISK THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO FURTHER RESTATE ITS PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

AMEND PRIOR FILINGS WITH THE SEC, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS NOT CURRENTLY

CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES AND

THE RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE EXPOSED THE COMPANY TO

GREATER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENT

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

SEVERAL DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS AND A CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT HAVE BEEN FILED IN

STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERTAINING TO ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED THE RESULTS OF ITS INTERNAL REVIEW AND INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION TO THE SEC AND THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, AND IN THAT REGARD THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED

TO INFORMAL REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO CONTINUE FULL COOPERATION. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN REGARDING THE

OUTCOMES FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS OR GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS RELATING TO THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THE RESOLUTION

OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE, AND WILL DISTRACT

MANAGEMENT FROM THE CONDUCT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, IF THE

COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO ADVERSE FINDINGS IN LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS OR

GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES OR

PENALTIES OR HAVE OTHER REMEDIES IMPOSED, WHICH COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

IN AUGUST 2006, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED A NASDAQ STAFF DETERMINATION LETTER STATING THAT, AS A RESULT

OF THE DELAYED FILING OF THE COMPANYS FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER

ENDED JULY 1, 2006 (THE THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q), THE COMPANY

WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUED LISTING AS SET

FORTH IN MARKETPLACE RULE 4310(C)(14) AND WAS THEREFORE SUBJECT TO

DELISTING FROM THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET. ON OCTOBER 24, 2006, THE

NASDAQ LISTING QUALIFICATIONS PANEL GRANTED THE COMPANYS REQUEST FOR CONTINUED

LISTING, SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY FILING THE THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q,

AND ANY REQUIRED RESTATEMENTS, WITH THE SEC BY DECEMBER 29, 2006. ON DECEMBER 29,

2006, THE COMPANY FILED THE THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q WITH THE SEC. WITH

THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

REMEDIED ITS NON-COMPLIANCE WITH MARKETPLACE RULE 4310(C)(14), SUBJECT TO

NASDAQS AFFIRMATIVE COMPLETION OF ITS COMPLIANCE PROTOCOLS AND ITS

NOTIFICATION OF THE COMPANY ACCORDINGLY. HOWEVER, IF THE SEC DISAGREES WITH THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED, OR NOT REPORTED,

THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTS, THERE COULD BE FURTHER DELAYS

IN FILING SUBSEQUENT SEC REPORTS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN DELISTING OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK FROM THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET.

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3

OF THIS FORM 10-K. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS AND WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. RESULTS OF LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IN ADDITION, LITIGATION MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMPANYS NORMAL

21

BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SHOULD

THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL EVENTS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH

OF ITS SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING

PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND

ABROAD. AT TIMES IN THE PAST, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAS BEEN

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DIFFICULT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND RELATED OPERATING RESULTS. SHOULD GLOBAL AND/OR REGIONAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS COULD THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS SUPPLIERS,

DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DISRUPT SUPPLY, DELIVERY, OR DEMAND OF PRODUCTS, WHICH

COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, WHETHER IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD, HAVE CAUSED AND COULD

CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL

COMMERCE

AND GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THUS MAY HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY,

THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANYS SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS. THE

COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY EARTHQUAKE,

OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER

HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS

CONTROL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL

BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING

VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR DIRECT QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES, THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE

DISASTER.

ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, SUCH EVENTS

COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT

DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS OR

TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES

IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. IN ADDITION, SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES

INCLUDING PANDEMICS ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY MORE

STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF

PRODUCTS BETWEEN VARIOUS REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS,

AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND

COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED

PERIPHERALS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES AND RELATED

SERVICES, IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY

COMPETE IN THESE MARKETS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT

PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT

ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS, AND A

LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS

AND RELATED PERIPHERALS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS WHO SELL

WINDOWS AND LINUX BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND

LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS FOR PERSONAL COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY

CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE PRICING

PRESSURES AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

22

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS ALSO BEEN

CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY,

HARDWARE PERFORMANCE, AND FEATURES BASED ON EXISTING OR EMERGING INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE

MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT

ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR

MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE

COMPANY HAVE TARGETED CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING

CONSUMER, EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING, AND

DESIGN AND PUBLISHING. SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS HAVE INTRODUCED

DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS AND/OR ONLINE STORES OFFERING DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION

THAT MIMIC MANY OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN, TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND SOLUTIONS OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY

OF WHOM HAVE BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES THAN

THOSE OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS

CONSOLIDATION IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAT HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND

POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS IN THE COMPANYS MARKETS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE

USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS UTILIZING COMPETING

OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING WINDOWS AND LINUX. THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO

CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN

PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS. ADDITIONALLY,

IF UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF THE MAC OS ARE USED ON OTHER COMPANIES HARDWARE

PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS,

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION AND RELATED CONSUMER

ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING IPODS. THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION

FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS INCLUDING MP3

PLAYERS, MUSIC ENABLED CELL PHONES, FREE PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC AND VIDEO SERVICES,

AND FREE STREAMING OF DIGITAL CONTENT VIA THE INTERNET. THESE COMPETITORS

INCLUDE BOTH NEW ENTRANTS WITH DIFFERENT MARKET APPROACHES, SUCH AS

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES MODELS, AND ALSO LARGER COMPANIES THAT MAY HAVE

SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND OTHER RESOURCES, AS WELL AS

ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS.

FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPETITION IN THIS SPACE

TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO

TIGHTLY INTEGRATING THESE COMPONENTS WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK

MORE COLLABORATIVELY WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE

INTEGRATED THAN THOSE THEY OFFER CURRENTLY. SOME OF THESE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL

COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS TO COMPETE WITH THE

COMPANYS OFFERINGS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO

CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THESE

MARKETS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO HAVE TO RESPOND TO PRICE COMPETITION BY LOWERING

PRICES AND/OR INCREASING FEATURES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

MUSIC PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS AS WELL AS OVERALL COMPANY GROSS MARGINS.

THE COMPANY ALSO FACES

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET. U.S. ELEMENTARY AND

SECONDARY SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS, REMAIN A CORE

MARKET FOR THE COMPANY. IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE AND REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE ONE-TO-ONE (1:1) LEARNING

SOLUTIONS IN EDUCATION.

1:1 LEARNING

SOLUTIONS

TYPICALLY CONSIST OF A

PORTABLE COMPUTER FOR EVERY STUDENT AND TEACHER ALONG WITH THE INSTALLATION OF

A WIRELESS NETWORK.

THESE 1:1

LEARNING SOLUTIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC SALES ARE GENERALLY PRICED MORE

AGGRESSIVELY AND COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROFITABILITY OR FINANCIAL

LOSSES, PARTICULARLY FOR LARGER DEALS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS

TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET, THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN ITS

SHARE OF THE EDUCATION MARKET OR EXECUTE PROFITABLY ON LARGE STRATEGIC

23

ARRANGEMENTS. FAILURE TO

DO SO MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS, INCLUDING

MICROPROCESSORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY OR AVAILABLE ONLY FROM

LIMITED SOURCES.

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS

ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS ARE

CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY

COMPONENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DRAM, NAND FLASH-MEMORY, AND TFT-LCD

FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS), WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES.

IN ADDITION, NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE

CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED

WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS.

IN SITUATIONS WHERE A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT UTILIZES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE

MATURED. THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE

COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER OR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS

REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED ON A

NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT, THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE

CUSTOMER DEMAND.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE

CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

ADVANCES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES,

ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE

CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND UPGRADED VERSIONS OF THE COMPANYS

EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE; THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE

THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION TO

INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES; THE AVAILABILITY

OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS; THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND; THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND COSTS TO MEET

ANTICIPATED DEMAND; AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER

DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT

DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT NEW PRODUCTS WILL HAVE ON ITS SALES OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2005, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO BEGIN USING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN ITS

COMPUTERS. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED NEW INTEL-BASED MODELS OF THE

MACBOOK PRO, MACBOOK, MAC PRO, IMAC, AND MAC MINI COMPUTERS. THE COMPANYS

TRANSITION TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS FOR MACINTOSH SYSTEMS WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2006,

AND ITS TRANSITION FOR XSERVE WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2006. THIS

TRANSITION HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDING THE TIMELY INNOVATION AND DELIVERY OF RELATED HARDWARE

AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT INTEL MICROPROCESSORS, MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF

INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND AVAILABILITY ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OF COMPONENTS AND SERVICES ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE THE COMPANY TO

TIMELY DELIVER INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

DEPENDENT ON THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS SUCH AS MICROSOFT AND ADOBE TO

TIMELY DEVELOP CURRENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL-BASED

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. UNIVERSAL VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE AND ADOBES

CREATIVE SUITE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. ADDITIONALLY,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS

24

HISTORICAL GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGES ON ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, WHICH

MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE

QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFITS.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY

COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND

MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS

THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE

WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND

PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD-PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF

REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSE TO REMEDY.

BECAUSE ORDERS FOR COMPONENTS, AND IN SOME CASES

COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS, MUST BE PLACED IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER

ORDERS, THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF

ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR

CANCELLATION FEES FOR ORDERS OF PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

CANCELLED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY AND RELATED PROVISIONS

ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT

OBSOLESCENCE IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES AND THE

TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT

THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL INVENTORY AND RELATED CHARGES. IN

ADDITION, SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD, AND MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER

COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT

SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID

TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, AND BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND

PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF

PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY

ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN

ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING

REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANYS OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY

LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON MANUFACTURING AND

LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE

OF THE U.S.

MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN

WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUTSOURCING

ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER THE COST OF OPERATIONS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANYS

DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT

SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED OR SERVICES RENDERED, OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE COMPANY TO RESPOND

TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS RELIANT ON

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO ADHERE TO THE COMPANYS SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT. MOREOVER,

ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR

WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN AT LEAST INITIALLY

RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT

DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER

PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

25

FINAL ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS

SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING

FACILITY IN CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA;

FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA; TAIWAN; THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA; THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF

CHINA; AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURING OF MANY OF THE

COMPONENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS

IN TAIWAN, CHINA, JAPAN, KOREA, AND SINGAPORE. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK PROS, MACBOOKS, AND

IPODS, IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA. IF FOR ANY REASON

MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED BY REGIONAL

ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL ISSUES,

OR DUE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES OR MILITARY ACTIONS, THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS

DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, AND CATALOGUERS, MANY

OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN

MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END-USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS,

AND CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS RETAIL

STORES. MANY OF THE COMPANYS RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS AND

HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT

INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL

PARTNERS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKENS, IF RESELLERS

WITHIN CONSUMER CHANNELS WERE TO CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS,

OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS

TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY

HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE

RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH COMPANY

EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENT FROM THE COMPANY, WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR

INCREMENTAL REVENUE TO OFFSET THIS INVESTMENT.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF THE COMPANYS NET SALES HAVE BEEN MADE BY

THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO END-USERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD

AND THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, AND THE U.K. SOME OF

THE COMPANYS RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THIS EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT

SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AS

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. PERCEPTION OF SUCH A

CONFLICT COULD DISCOURAGE THE COMPANYS RESELLERS FROM INVESTING ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM

TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF EXPANSION OF ITS

DIRECT SALES TO END-USERS CAUSES SOME OR ALL OF ITS RESELLERS TO CEASE OR LIMIT

DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY RELIES

ON THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER

THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE COMPANYS ITUNES STORE. THE

COMPANY PAYS SUBSTANTIAL FEES TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS TO OFFER TO ITS CUSTOMERS

THIS THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT. THE COMPANYS LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

THESE THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND DO NOT GUARANTEE

THE FUTURE RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, IF

AT ALL. CERTAIN PARTIES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HAVE CONSOLIDATED AND FORMED

ALLIANCES, WHICH COULD LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY AND INCREASE THE FEES REQUIRED TO

OFFER DIGITAL CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE. SOME THIRD-PARTY

CONTENT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OR MAY IN THE FUTURE OFFER MUSIC PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THAT COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD

TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE

THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. FURTHER, OTHER DISTRIBUTORS OF THIRD-PARTY

CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OWNERS MAY SEEK TO LIMIT

26

THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE TOTAL COST OF

SUCH CONTENT. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF

DIGITAL CONTENT AT REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE

TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH OUTSIDE THE U.S., THEN SALES AND GROSS MARGINS

OF THE COMPANYS ITUNES STORE, AS WELL AS RELATED HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS,

INCLUDING IPODS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THIRD-PARTY CONTENT

PROVIDERS AND ARTISTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS

MANAGEMENT (DRM) SOLUTIONS AND OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS. IF THE REQUIREMENTS

FROM CONTENT PROVIDERS OR ARTISTS CHANGE, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO

FURTHER DEVELOP OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS SUCH NEW RIGHTS AND

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION OR MAY

PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DRM SOLUTIONS

SO THAT CONTENT WOULD BE INTEROPERABLE WITH COMPETITOR DEVICES, WHICH COULD

LESSEN THE PROTECTION OF CONTENT SUBJECTING IT TO PIRACY AND COULD AFFECT

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMPANYS CONTENT SUPPLIERS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE

COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST

AND IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON

SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED OR AVAILABLE FOR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE

PRODUCTS, THEN CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO

PURCHASE THE COMPANYS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AS OPPOSED TO WINDOWS-BASED

SYSTEMS, ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE

AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION

AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING

SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS VERSUS SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS

MARKET OR GROWING LINUX MARKET. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS

THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED

POTENTIAL REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF MAC

OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE

MINORITY MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE COMPANY IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET HAS

CAUSED SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANYS PROSPECTS IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER MARKET, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATION

SOFTWARE OR UPGRADE EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND MORE

INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE

LARGER WINDOWS MARKET OR GROWING LINUX MARKET. THE COMPANYS RECENT

ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT PLANS TO ADD A FEATURE TO THE NEXT VERSION OF MAC OS X

THAT WILL ENABLE INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS TO RUN WINDOWS XP MAY DETER

DEVELOPERS FROM CREATING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR MAC OS X IF SUCH

APPLICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORM. MOREOVER, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE FOR MAC OS X ON

A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL.

IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO

BEGIN USING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN ITS COMPUTERS. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

INTRODUCED NEW INTEL-BASED MODELS OF THE MACBOOK PRO, MACBOOK, MAC PRO, IMAC,

AND MAC MINI COMPUTERS. THE COMPANYS TRANSITION TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS FOR

MACINTOSH SYSTEMS WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2006, AND ITS TRANSITION FOR

XSERVE WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2006. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO TIMELY DEVELOP CURRENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS THAT RUN

ON INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. UNIVERSAL VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE AND ADOBES

CREATIVE SUITE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE LACK OF

APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, INCLUDING MICROSOFT

OFFICE AND ADOBE CREATIVE SUITE, COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN ADDITION, PAST AND

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

SOLUTIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DECISION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, SUCH AS

MICROSOFT AND ADOBE, TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE

FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MARKETS AND SELLS A VARIETY

OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR USE BY PROFESSIONALS, CONSUMERS, AND EDUCATION

CUSTOMERS THAT COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS

TO DEVELOP OR

27

UPGRADE

MACINTOSH-COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY

MARKETED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE SOFTWARE FOR PROFESSIONAL FILM AND VIDEO

EDITING, PROFESSIONAL COMPOSITING AND VISUAL EFFECTS FOR LARGE FORMAT FILM AND

VIDEO PRODUCTIONS, PROFESSIONAL MUSIC PRODUCTION AND MUSIC POST PRODUCTION,

PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DVD ENCODING AND AUTHORING, PROFESSIONAL DIGITAL

PHOTO EDITING AND WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO AND DIGITAL PHOTO

EDITING AND MANAGEMENT, DIGITAL MUSIC MANAGEMENT, DESKTOP-BASED DATABASE

MANAGEMENT, WORD PROCESSING, AND HIGH-QUALITY PRESENTATIONS. DISCONTINUANCE OF

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS NET SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS RELIES ON ACCESS TO PATENTS AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND THE COMPANYS FUTURE

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED

ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN

THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS

PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST

EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL

CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE

PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE

CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY

UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO

TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS, REGARDLESS

OF THEIR MERIT, CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, AND

CAUSE THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. SEVERAL PENDING

CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE

DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES.

HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IN THE EVENT THERE IS A

TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM

MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRING IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A

THIRD-PARTY, THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION INVOLVING THE COMPANY RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND

OTHER MATTERS IS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY

FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED

TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS

THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF SUCH

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL

TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS

FORM 10-K OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR

REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED AND WILL

CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS

SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD

OPENED 165 RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANYS RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED

SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION

SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO

SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH LEASE TERMS

RANGING FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS. THE COMPANY

COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THESE COMMITMENTS

OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, A RELATIVELY HIGH

PROPORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENTS COSTS ARE FIXED BECAUSE OF PERSONNEL COSTS,

28

DEPRECIATION OF STORE CONSTRUCTION COSTS, AND LEASE

EXPENSE. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WOULD RESULT SHOULD THE RETAIL SEGMENT

EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES FOR ANY REASON.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS STORES

HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES THAT

FUNCTION

AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE EVENTS, AND BRAND

AWARENESS. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE

STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT IN

EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL

RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY HAS OPENED EIGHT SUCH STORES THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2006.

BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION AND SIZE, THESE HIGH-PROFILE STORES ALSO REQUIRE THE

COMPANY TO ENTER INTO SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS COMPARED

TO THOSE REQUIRED FOR ITS MORE TYPICAL STORES. CURRENT LEASES ON SUCH LOCATIONS

HAVE TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 14 YEARS WITH TOTAL REMAINING COMMITMENTS PER LOCATION

RANGING FROM $4 MILLION TO $33 MILLION. CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF

THESE HIGH-PROFILE STORES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANY OF THE GENERAL RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY FACES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS

RETAIL SEGMENT. ALSO, MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS PRESENT

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,

SOME OF WHICH

ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETAIL

SEGMENTS FUTURE RESULTS, CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE

CURRENTLY EXPECTED, AND/OR HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES UNIQUE TO RETAIL

OPERATIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY; INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE

CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION; INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS; FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING

RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS; LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS

OUTSIDE THE U.S.; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE

OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY RETAIL INVENTORY; AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND

RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES

COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS AND MAY PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY

CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS AND MAY IN

THE FUTURE INVEST IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS THAT

COMPLEMENT THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND PRODUCT ROADMAP. SUCH

ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AWAY FROM CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS;

INSUFFICIENT REVENUE GENERATION TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY; AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE

COMPANYS DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS. BECAUSE THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY

RISKY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DECLINES IN THE SALES OF THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL

PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, OR SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS, OR INCREASES

IN SALES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPODS, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK

PRO AND MAC PRO SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS, GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN THE COMPANYS CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE IMAC, MAC MINI, MACBOOK, IPOD, AND CONTENT FROM THE

ITUNES STORE. A SHIFT IN SALES MIX AWAY FROM HIGHER MARGIN PROFESSIONAL

PRODUCTS TOWARDS LOWER MARGIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FUTURE GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES. THE COMPANYS

TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE TO BUY CONSUMER PRODUCTS,

SPECIFICALLY THE IMAC AND MACBOOK, INSTEAD OF PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS.

PROFESSIONAL USERS MAY CHOOSE TO BUY THE IMAC DUE TO ITS RELATIVE PRICE

PERFORMANCE AND UNIQUE DESIGN FEATURING A FLAT PANEL SCREEN. PROFESSIONAL USERS

MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO PURCHASE MACBOOKS INSTEAD OF THE COMPANYS

PROFESSIONAL-ORIENTED PORTABLE PRODUCTS DUE TO THEIR PRICE PERFORMANCE AND

SCREEN SIZE. ADDITIONALLY, SIGNIFICANT FUTURE GROWTH IN IPOD SALES WITHOUT

29

CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCT SALES

COULD ALSO REDUCE GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS

ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF

REASONS.

THE COMPANYS PROFIT

MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANYS

DIRECT SALES, PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, GENERALLY HAVE

HIGHER ASSOCIATED PROFITABILITY THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES. AS A RESULT, THE

COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL

PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT,

GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, OR NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THE

TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCT DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF EACH QUARTER THAN IT

DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS, A PATTERN TYPICAL IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE

PRESSURE ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A

QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL

RESULTS ACCURATELY. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED GREATER

NET SALES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN

THE FISCAL YEAR DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE

BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS

LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS

FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANYS KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS

SUPPLIERS, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS, COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ON

THE COMPANY AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY HAS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, THAN

MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS AND REVENUE GROWTH

IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF

INNOVATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY GENERALLY INCURS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN ITS COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON

OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. MANY OF THESE COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY

ON PRICE AND MAINTAIN VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF THE

EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS RETAIL SEGMENT AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING

THE COMPANYS BRAND INCLUDING ITS UNIQUE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE COMPANY INCURS

HIGHER SELLING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW

PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ITS OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. THIS RISK IS

HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES

ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND RETAILERS AND DIRECTLY

TO CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY

COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE

BY THE COMPANY OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE

SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND

FLASH-MEMORY AND HAS PREPAID A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS.

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS LONG-TERM

PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN

LIMITING ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOIDING LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY OR REGIONAL ECONOMIES DETERIORATE, THE COMPANY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO

INCUR A MATERIAL LOSS OR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR MANUFACTURING VENDORS.

30

THE COMPANYS

SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS

OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED

PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MEMBERS OF ITS EXECUTIVE

TEAM, AND THOSE IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED

PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND

COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY,

WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS KEY EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THE COMPANY HAS

RELIED ON ITS ABILITY TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AS ONE MECHANISM FOR RECRUITING

AND RETAINING THIS HIGHLY SKILLED TALENT. RECENT ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS

REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

STOCK-BASED AWARDS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT

TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COVERAGE OF INSURANCE.

FOR CERTAIN RISKS, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR

AVAILABILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS SOME PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS,

AND IN SOME CASES SELF INSURES COMPLETELY, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES IN

EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FAILURE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BREACHES

IN THE SECURITY OF DATA UPON WHICH THE COMPANY RELIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEM FAILURES AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS BY POTENTIALLY CAUSING

DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, IMPEDING THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT

OF PRODUCTS, OR RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR

COMPANY INFORMATION. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS FOR ITS

OWN SYSTEMS BY IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL CONTROL

MEASURES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR DATA

SECURITY BREACH OF THE COMPANY OR A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

A LARGE PORTION OF THE COMPANYS REVENUE IS DERIVED

FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS,

POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES),

AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH

THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED. THE COMPANYS

PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO

NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND

CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA AND NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE

JAPANESE YEN AND THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED SALES. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING IN THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN

CURRENCIES CAN CAUSE THE COMPANY TO MODIFY INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND AFFECT THE

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN DENOMINATED SALES, AND IN SOME CASES, MAY ALSO

INCREASE THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF SOME PRODUCT COMPONENTS.

MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN

COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM

FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND

ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE

EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH

HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL

IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED

TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7A OF

THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AND MAY

BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTES 1 AND 3

OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF

ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR

RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED

IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS

EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE

FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE

IS NO ASSURANCE SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

CHANGES IN

ACCOUNTING RULES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

THESE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION BY VARIOUS GOVERNING BODIES,

INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) AND THE SEC, WHO

CREATE AND INTERPRET APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. A CHANGE FROM CURRENT

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE THAT

ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS, STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) (SFAS NO. 123R),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

, WHICH THE COMPANY

ADOPTED IN 2006. IN 2006, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REDUCED DILUTED

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.14. ALTHOUGH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS

NO. 123R IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE CHANGES TO VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR-VALUE OF AWARDS ISSUED OR THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF EQUITY

AWARDS GRANTED CREATE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN

THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANYS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE

LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE

THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE

OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANYS STOCK

PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANYS STOCK HAS AT

TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS

BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. THE STOCK MARKET HAS

EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET

PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THE

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

STOCK PRICE REFLECTS HIGH FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS. IF THE

COMPANY FAILS TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS ITS STOCK PRICE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY

DECLINE. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE MAY RESULT IN

GREATER DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE.

ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE COMPANY IS

ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN

THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY

RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR

IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY

OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED

AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A

PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY

SETTLED CERTAIN MATTERS DURING 2006 THAT DID NOT INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE

AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AND THE COMPANYS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REQUIRE THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS,

ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE

REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR

MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE

COMPANYS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO

REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION AND

INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, WARRANTY COSTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND

INCOME TAXES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY

ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT

MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THE COMPANYS SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS

REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE

AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE

OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, DIGITAL CONTENT, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING

50

STANDARDS, INCLUDING AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED, AND SEC STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE

EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS

FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA

ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS,

FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES,

THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE

COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF

AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS

NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT TO BE, FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND

SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE AND ALL OTHER

CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET.

THE COMPANY RECORDS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND

FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND

OTHER SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO

BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY

ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. IF

REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE

ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE

PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF

THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE

PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED

FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE

MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE

CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS

THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH PROGRAMS

ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE

MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE

INCENTIVE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS

OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF

CUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD

ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ALLOWANCE FOR

DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION,

CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK. IN ADDITION, WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY

DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE

FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA AND BY

ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS

AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANYS DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE

CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING

COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME

ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL,

THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE

COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF

THE COLLECTIBILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF

THE CREDIT WORTHINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THOSE SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE

THE SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE

COLLECTIBLE

. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS AN

ALLOWANCE FOR ALL OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING

HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE WITH BAD DEBTS, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC

51

ENVIRONMENT, THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND THE AGING OF SUCH RECEIVABLES.

IF THERE IS A DETERIORATION OF A MAJOR

CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL CONDITION, IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR IF FUTURE

ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON TRADE RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR

DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS

WERE MADE.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND

BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A

WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY

PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED

DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF

INVENTORY EACH FISCAL QUARTER THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND

FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES

LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER

ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT

AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET

CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF

UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT

INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS WHICH

WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE

RECORDED.

THE COMPANY ACCRUES

RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE

BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE

ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND

INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS FOR

PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL

DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED

CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, THE

COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES

THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION

FEES ARE IDENTIFIED.

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST

FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL

AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT

ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY

REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY

LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO

WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS

DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE

REQUIRED AND COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY

PROVIDES UPDATES TO ITS APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO MAINTAIN THE

SOFTWARES COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS. THE ESTIMATED COST TO DEVELOP SUCH

UPDATES IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS WARRANTY COSTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME

RELATED SOFTWARE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING

APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS RELATED TO SUCH UPDATES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF UNITS

DELIVERED, THE NUMBER OF UPDATES EXPECTED TO OCCUR, AND THE HISTORICAL COST AND

ESTIMATED FUTURE COST OF THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THESE UPDATES.

STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123R. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R,

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE AWARDS

FAIR VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON (BSM) OPTION-PRICING

MODEL AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE RATABLY OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE

BSM MODEL REQUIRES VARIOUS HIGHLY

52

JUDGMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING VOLATILITY,

FORFEITURE RATES, AND EXPECTED OPTION LIFE. IF ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

THE BSM MODEL CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER

MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE

COMPANYS RESTATEMENT OF ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS

APPLIED JUDGMENT IN CHOOSING WHETHER TO REVISE MEASUREMENT DATES FOR PRIOR

OPTION GRANTS. INFORMATION REGARDING THE RESTATEMENT, INCLUDING RANGES OF

POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IF OTHER MEASUREMENT DATES

HAD BEEN SELECTED FOR CERTAIN GRANTS, IS SET FORTH IN THE EXPLANATORY NOTE

IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PART I, ITEM 1 AND IN NOTE 2, RESTATEMENT OF

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE

ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAXES

, THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET

AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR

OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO

TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED

TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE

REALIZED.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF

CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE

DETERMINED NOT TO BE REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

SIMILARLY, IF THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY REALIZES DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WERE

PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE UNREALIZABLE, THE RESPECTIVE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

WOULD BE REVERSED, RESULTING IN A POSITIVE ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD

SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES

INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER

INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FISCAL YEAR 2006 VERSUS 2005

NET SALES DURING

2006 INCREASED 39% OR $5.4 BILLION FROM 2005. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE IN PART TO

THE FACT THAT 2006 SPANNED 53 WEEKS WHILE 2005 SPANNED 52 WEEKS. SEVERAL OTHER

FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE INCREASES INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.

·

NET SALES OF

IPODS INCREASED $3.1 BILLION OR 69% DURING 2006

COMPARED TO 2005. UNIT SALES OF IPODS TOTALED 39.4 MILLION IN 2006, WHICH

REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 75% FROM 22.5 MILLION IPOD UNITS SOLD IN 2005. STRONG

IPOD SALES DURING 2006 REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT SALES OF BOTH

THE HARD-DRIVE BASED IPOD THAT SUPPORTS VIDEO,

FIRST INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER OF 2005 AND THE IPOD NANO, INTRODUCED IN SEPTEMBER 2005,

AS WELL AS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF IPOD DISTRIBUTION POINTS.

DURING 2006,

THE NET SALES PER IPOD UNIT SOLD DECREASED BY 3% COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE

TO AN OVERALL DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR ALL IPODS AS WELL AS A

SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TO THE IPOD NANO. FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IPOD IN

2002 THROUGH 2006, THE COMPANY HAS SOLD APPROXIMATELY 68 MILLION IPODS.

·

MACINTOSH NET SALES

INCREASED $1.1 BILLION OR 18% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. MACINTOSH UNIT

SALES INCREASED BY 769,000 UNITS OR 17% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005.

THESE INCREASES WERE MAINLY DUE TO STRONG DEMAND

FOR THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO SYSTEMS AND REFLECT A SHIFT IN

PRODUCT MIX TO PORTABLE PRODUCTS IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS. NET

SALES AND UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCREASED 43% AND 42%,

RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. MACINTOSH DESKTOP NET SALES AND

UNIT SALES BOTH DECREASED BY 3% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE DECREASE IN

SALES OF THE COMPANYS MACINTOSH DESKTOPS WAS DUE TO DECLINES IN SALES OF THE

COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL-ORIENTED DESKTOP PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE

DECLINE IN THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL-ORIENTED DESKTOP PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO

CUSTOMERS DELAYING PURCHASES OF SUCH PRODUCTS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE RELEASE OF

THE INTEL-BASED MAC PRO, WHICH DID NOT BEGIN SHIPPING UNTIL AUGUST 2006,

AND UPDATED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CAPABLE OF RUNNING ON INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH

COMPUTERS, AND THE TREND TOWARD PORTABLE COMPUTERS. A SLIGHT INCREASE OF 1%

DURING 2006 IN NET SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD WAS DUE TO A SHIFT IN MIX TO

HIGHER-PRICED PORTABLE PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRICE REDUCTIONS ON

CERTAIN MACINTOSH SYSTEMS.

·

OTHER

MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONSISTS OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ITUNES STORE AND IPOD SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES. NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC

RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $986 MILLION OR 110% DURING 2006

COMPARED TO 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES FROM

THE ITUNES STORE AND APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD ACCESSORIES AND

SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE STEMMED FROM SIGNIFICANT

GROWTH IN U.S. SALES AND THE OPENING OF THE ITUNES STORE IN JAPAN DURING AUGUST 2005

AND AUSTRALIA DURING OCTOBER 2005. THE INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES

STORE WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF VIDEOS, TELEVISION SHOWS,

AND FEATURE-LENGTH MOVIE DOWNLOADS.

·

NET SALES OF SOFTWARE,

SERVICE, AND OTHER SALES INCREASED $188 MILLION OR 17% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO

2005. THE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED NET SALES OF

APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN (APP) EXTENDED SERVICE

AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS

AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE IN SALES OF MAC OS X.

MAC OS X

SALES WERE PARTICULARLY HIGH IN 2005 DUE TO THE RELEASE OF MAC OS X TIGER IN APRIL 2005.

OFFSETTING THE

FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANYS NET SALES DURING 2006 WERE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING.

·

NET SALES OF

PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE DECLINED $26 MILLION

OR 2% COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE DECREASES AND A DECREASE IN NET

SALES OF DISPLAYS RELATING TO A SHIFT IN MIX FROM DESKTOP TO PORTABLE SYSTEMS. THE

DECREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS FOR 2006 IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL

DECREASE IN UNIT SALES OF MACINTOSH PROFESSIONAL DESKTOP SYSTEMS.

55

FISCAL YEAR 2005 VERSUS 2004

DURING 2005, NET

SALES INCREASED 68% OR $5.7 BILLION FROM 2004. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED

FAVORABLY TO NET SALES DURING 2005.

·

NET SALES OF

IPODS ROSE $3.2 BILLION OR 248% DURING 2005 COMPARED

TO 2004. UNIT SALES OF IPODS TOTALED 22.5 MILLION IN 2005, WHICH REPRESENTED AN

INCREASE OF 409% FROM THE 4.4 MILLION IPOD UNITS SOLD IN 2004. STRONG SALES OF

IPODS DURING 2005 WERE EXPERIENCED IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS

AND WAS DRIVEN BY

STRONG DEMAND FOR THE IPOD

SHUFFLE INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 2005, THE RELEASE OF AN UPDATED VERSION OF

THE IPOD MINI IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE RELEASE OF THE IPOD NANO IN SEPTEMBER 2005,

AND EXPANSION OF THE IPODS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK

. NET SALES PER IPOD

UNIT SOLD DECREASED 32% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE LOWER PRICED

IPOD SHUFFLE IN JANUARY 2005 AND IPOD MINI PRICING REDUCTIONS IN FEBRUARY 2005.

FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IPOD IN 2002 THROUGH 2005, THE COMPANY HAD SOLD

APPROXIMATELY 28 MILLION IPODS.

·

NET

SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $621 MILLION OR

223% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH IN

SALES OF IPOD SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN OVERALL

IPOD UNIT SALES FOR 2005. THE INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OF NET SALES IN THE U.S. AND EXPANSION IN

EUROPE, CANADA, AND JAPAN.

·

TOTAL

MACINTOSH NET SALES INCREASED $1.4 BILLION OR 27% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004.

UNIT SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS INCREASED 1.2 MILLION UNITS OR 38% DURING 2005

COMPARED TO 2004. THE INCREASES IN MACINTOSH NET SALES AND UNIT SALES RELATED

PRIMARILY TO STRONG DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS DESKTOP PRODUCTS, WHICH WAS

EXPERIENCED IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE IPOD HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MACINTOSH NET SALES BY

INTRODUCING NEW CUSTOMERS TO THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS. DESKTOP DEMAND WAS

STIMULATED IN 2005 DUE TO THE IMAC G5 AND THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MAC MINI IN JANUARY 2005.

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF DESKTOP PRODUCTS INCREASED 45% AND 55%,

RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. MACINTOSH NET SALES AND UNIT SALES

ALSO INCLUDED SALES OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS, WHICH INCREASED 11% AND

21%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2004.

NET SALES PER MACINTOSH

UNIT SOLD DECREASED 7% ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS. THE DECREASE WAS THE RESULT

OF CHANGES IN THE OVERALL UNIT MIX TOWARDS RELATIVELY LOWER-PRICED CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, SPECIFICALLY THE IMPACT OF THE MAC MINI PRODUCT, AND DESKTOP AND

PORTABLE PRICE REDUCTIONS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

THE PROPORTION OF DIRECT SALES.

·

NET

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE ROSE BY 18% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO

2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS AND OTHER COMPUTER

ACCESSORIES.

NET SALES

OF OTHER

HARDWARE INCLUDE AIRPORT CARDS AND BASE STATIONS, XSERVE RAID STORAGE, ISIGHT

DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERAS, AND THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE PRODUCTS.

·

NET SALES OF SOFTWARE, SERVICE AND OTHER SALES

ROSE $270 MILLION OR 33% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THIS GROWTH WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED NET SALES IN APP EXTENDED SERVICE AND

SUPPORT CONTRACTS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER ASSOCIATED MACINTOSH COMPUTER

SALES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN NET SALES OF .MAC

INTERNET SERVICE, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER APPLICATIONS, THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE,

AND MAC OS X THAT WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RELEASE OF VERSION 10.4

TIGER IN APRIL 2005.

SEGMENT OPERATING

PERFORMANCE

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS

BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE OPERATING

SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE

AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND JAPAN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACTIVITIES

RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND

SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE

56

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.

THE RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S., CANADA,

JAPAN, AND THE U.K. DURING 2006. EACH REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT

PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES. FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN NOTE 11,

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K.

AMERICAS

DURING 2006, NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT

INCREASED $2.7 BILLION, OR 41%, COMPARED TO 2005. THE MAIN FACTORS FOR THIS

INCREASE WERE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN NET SALES OF IPODS, OTHER MUSIC RELATED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, MACINTOSH PORTABLE SYSTEMS, AND APP. SALES OF IPODS

INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UPDATED IPOD WITH

VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES IN OCTOBER 2005 AND THE IPOD NANO DURING SEPTEMBER 2005.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WAS DUE TO INCREASES

IN SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD ACCESSORIES AND SALES FROM THE

ITUNES STORE. THE INCREASE IN SALES OF MACINTOSH PORTABLE SYSTEMS IN THE

AMERICAS WAS DUE TO STRONG SALES OF THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO

DURING 2006. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECLINE IN NET SALES OF DESKTOPS, DISPLAYS, AND MAC OS X. THE DECREASE IN

DESKTOP PRODUCTS AND DISPLAYS NET SALES REFLECTS THE OVERALL SHIFT IN PRODUCT

MIX TOWARD PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. MAC OS X SALES DECREASED FROM 2005 SINCE

THE COMPANY HAS NOT RELEASED A NEW VERSION OF MAC OS X SINCE TIGER BEGAN

SHIPPING IN APRIL 2005. DURING 2006, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 48% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED TO 47% IN THE

SAME PERIOD OF 2005. DURING 2006, U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL NET SALES AND

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 13% AND 11%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2005.

NET SALES FROM THE HIGHER EDUCATION MARKET GREW 22% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO

2005 DUE TO STRONG SALES OF MACINTOSH PORTABLE PRODUCTS AND IPODS. NET SALES

WERE RELATIVELY FLAT FOR K-12 DUE TO CONTINUED BUDGET CONSTRAINTS.

DURING 2005, NET SALES IN

THE AMERICAS SEGMENT GREW 64% OR $2.6 BILLION COMPARED TO 2004. THE INCREASE IN

NET SALES DURING 2005 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIGNIFICANT

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPOD SALES, SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES, AND STRONG SALES OF DESKTOP AND PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. THIS

INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SHIFT IN SALES TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WHICH

HAD 117 STORES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA AS OF THE END OF 2005. MACINTOSH UNIT

SALES ALSO INCREASED BY 30% IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY

STRONG SALES OF DESKTOP SYSTEMS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRONG SALES FROM THE

UPDATED IMAC, WHICH BEGAN SHIPPING IN SEPTEMBER 2004, AND THE MAC MINI,

WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 2005. DURING 2005 AND 2004, THE AMERICAS

SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 47% AND 49%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS

TOTAL NET SALES AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 48% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, OF

TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN BOTH U.S.

EDUCATION CHANNEL NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF 21% FOR 2005 COMPARED TO 2004.

STRENGTH IN HIGHER EDUCATION SALES RELATED PRIMARILY TO STRONG IMAC AND

PORTABLE SYSTEM SHIPMENTS. THIS STRENGTH DROVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET

SALES OF 32% FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2005. DESPITE CHALLENGES

IN THE K-12 MARKET FROM CONTINUED BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES, THE COMPANYS K-12 NET SALES GREW YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY 11% DURING

2005 DUE TO INCREASED IBOOK SALES AND 1:1 EDUCATION SALES.

EUROPE

EUROPE SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED $1.0 BILLION OR 33%

DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, THESE

INCREASES WERE A RESULT OF STRONG GROWTH IN IPOD SALES, OTHER MUSIC RELATED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MACINTOSH PORTABLE SYSTEMS. SALES OF IPODS INCREASED

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UPDATED IPOD WITH VIDEO-PLAYING

CAPABILITIES IN OCTOBER 2005 AND THE IPOD NANO DURING SEPTEMBER 2005.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WAS DUE TO INCREASES

IN SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD ACCESSORIES AND SALES FROM THE

ITUNES STORE. THE INCREASE IN SALES OF PORTABLE SYSTEMS IN EUROPE WAS DUE TO

STRONG SALES OF THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO THAT WERE INTRODUCED

DURING 2006. IN ADDITION, EUROPE ALSO REPORTED INCREASED SALES IN APP RELATED

TO THE INCREASE IN MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A DECREASE IN DESKTOP AND

57

MAC OS X NET SALES DURING 2006 COMPARED TO

2005. THE DECREASE IN DESKTOP NET SALES WAS DUE TO THE SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD

PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. MAC OS X SALES HAVE DECREASED FROM 2005 SINCE THE

COMPANY HAS NOT RELEASED A NEW VERSION OF MAC OS X SINCE TIGER BEGAN SHIPPING

IN APRIL 2005.

DURING 2005, NET SALES IN

THE EUROPE SEGMENT GREW $1.3 BILLION OR 71% FROM 2004. TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT

SALES IN EUROPE ALSO EXPERIENCED GROWTH DURING THE CURRENT YEAR BY INCREASING

47% IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, EUROPE

EXPERIENCED STRONG NET SALES OF DESKTOP PRODUCTS, IPOD, OTHER MUSIC RELATED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND SOFTWARE AND SERVICE SALES. DEMAND IN EUROPE DURING

2005 WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG FOR THE COMPANYS DESKTOP COMPUTERS, WHICH

EXPERIENCED A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE OF 56% FROM 2004. SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS

OF THE COMPANYS OTHER SEGMENTS, NET SALES OF IPODS, PERIPHERALS AND SOFTWARE

WERE STRONG IN 2005.

JAPAN

JAPANS NET SALES INCREASED $288 MILLION OR 31% DURING

2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE JAPAN SEGMENT EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN

IPODS,

MACINTOSH PORTABLE PRODUCTS,

AND OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS

OTHER SEGMENTS, JAPAN EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN SALES OF IPODS DUE TO THE

INTRODUCTION OF THE IPOD WITH VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES AND THE IPOD NANO IN OCTOBER AND

SEPTEMBER OF 2005, RESPECTIVELY. JAPAN ALSO EXPERIENCED STRONG SALES OF

THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK AND INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE. THESE

INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NET SALES OF MACINTOSH DESKTOP

PRODUCTS, DISPLAYS, AND MAC OS X. THE DECREASES IN DESKTOP PRODUCTS AND

DISPLAYS REFLECT THE OVERALL SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD PORTABLE MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS.

MAC OS X SALES HAVE DECREASED FROM

2005 SINCE THE COMPANY HAS NOT RELEASED A NEW VERSION OF MAC OS X SINCE TIGER

BEGAN SHIPPING IN APRIL 2005.

TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DURING

2006 REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO 2005. THE RELATIVELY FLAT GROWTH IN

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IS PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO JAPANS OVERALL SLOW CONSUMER

PC MARKET GROWTH. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE WAYS TO IMPROVE ITS

INDIRECT AND DIRECT CHANNEL SALES IN JAPAN.

JAPANS NET SALES AND

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE UP 36% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2005 COMPARED TO

2004. JAPAN EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN DESKTOP PRODUCTS, IPOD, AND

OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DESKTOP NET SALES AND UNIT SALES

INCREASED BY 31% AND 41%, RESPECTIVELY, AND IPOD SALES INCREASED BY 220% DURING

2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A DECLINE IN PORTABLE SYSTEM NET SALES DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, WHICH

THE COMPANY BELIEVES MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SHIFT IN SALES FROM

PORTABLES TO THE IMAC G5 AND MAC MINI, AND A SHIFT TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AS A

RESULT OF OPENING TWO ADDITIONAL STORES IN JAPAN DURING 2005.

RETAIL

THE COMPANY OPENED 41 NEW RETAIL STORES DURING 2006,

INCLUDING A TOTAL OF 10 INTERNATIONAL STORES IN THE U.K., JAPAN, AND CANADA,

BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OPEN STORES TO 165 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THIS

COMPARES TO 124 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AND 86 OPEN STORES AS

OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004.

THE RETAIL SEGMENTS NET SALES INCREASED BY 43% TO

$3.4 BILLION DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. RETAIL SEGMENT MACINTOSH UNIT SALES

INCREASED 45% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005.

WITH AN AVERAGE OF 142 STORES OPEN DURING 2006, AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE

INCREASED TO $23.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $22.4 MILLION DURING 2005 AND $15.6

MILLION IN 2004. THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG

SALES OF MACINTOSH PORTABLE AND DESKTOP PRODUCTS, IPODS, AND OTHER MUSIC

RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SALES OF

IPODS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UPDATED IPOD WITH

VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES IN OCTOBER 2005 AND THE IPOD NANO DURING SEPTEMBER 2005.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WAS DUE TO INCREASED

SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD ACCESSORIES. MACINTOSH PORTABLE AND

DESKTOP SALES INCREASED DUE TO STRONG SALES OF THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK, MACBOOK

PRO, AND IMAC.

AS MEASURED BY THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENT

REPORTING, THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF $198 MILLION DURING

2006 AS COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF $151 MILLION DURING 2005 AND

58

OPERATING INCOME OF $39 MILLION DURING 2004. THIS

IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF OPENING NEW STORES AND

THE SEGMENTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE, WHICH

RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVERAGE ON OCCUPANCY, DEPRECIATION, AND OTHER FIXED COSTS.

EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL

SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN

FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS,

PERSONNEL, AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH

THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $200 MILLION IN 2006, BRINGING THE TOTAL CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES SINCE INCEPTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT TO APPROXIMATELY $729

MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY

5,787 EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

RETAIL STORE SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $887 MILLION. THE

COMPANY WOULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IF IT WERE TO CLOSE ITS RETAIL STORES.

SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K.

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE OF 29.0% IN 2006 REMAINED FLAT

AS COMPARED TO 2005. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED MORE FAVORABLE PRICING ON CERTAIN

COMMODITY COMPONENTS INCLUDING LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS AND DRAM MEMORY AND

HIGHER OVERALL REVENUE THAT PROVIDED FOR MORE LEVERAGE ON FIXED PRODUCTION

COSTS, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOWER MARGIN IPOD SALES AND OTHER MUSIC-RELATED

SERVICES.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS GROSS MARGIN AND THE

GROSS MARGINS OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES WILL

BE UNDER PRESSURE DUE TO PRICE COMPETITION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE TO DECLINE SEQUENTIALLY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF A SHIFT IN THE MIX OF REVENUE TOWARD LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS SUCH AS

THE IPOD AND CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES STORE.

THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANYS

EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT CURRENT GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WILL BE MAINTAINED OR TARGETED GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE LEVELS WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND

MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPODS, WILL REMAIN UNDER SIGNIFICANT

DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY

WIDE GLOBAL PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND

OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES, AND POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCT

MIX, INCLUDING HIGHER UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS WITH LOWER AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRICING ACTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS AND TO

STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN

THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

THE COMPANY ORDERS COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND

BUILDS INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS

ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A

59

RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE

OR ORDER FROM THIRD-PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR

PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS. THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND OUTSTANDING PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS AND TO RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND

PATTERNS.

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

INCREASED IN 2005 TO 29.0% OF NET SALES FROM 27.3% OF NET SALES IN 2004. THE

COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN DURING 2005 INCREASED DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE PRICING ON

CERTAIN COMMODITY COMPONENTS INCLUDING LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS AND DRAM MEMORY;

AN INCREASE IN HIGHER MARGIN SOFTWARE SALES; A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN DIRECT SALES

RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES; AND HIGHER OVERALL

REVENUE THAT PROVIDED FOR MORE LEVERAGE ON FIXED PRODUCTION COSTS. THESE

INCREASES TO GROSS MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOWER MARGIN

IPOD SALES.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

EXPENDITURES FOR R&D

INCREASED 33% OR $177 MILLION TO $712 MILLION IN 2006 COMPARED TO $535 MILLION

IN 2005. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN R&D HEADCOUNT IN

THE CURRENT YEAR TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES, AN INCREASE OF $46

MILLION IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED AS R&D EXPENSE RESULTING

FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, AND HIGHER OVERALL EXPENSES DUE TO

THE 14TH WEEK ADDED TO THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF

2006

TO REALIGN THE COMPANYS FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS.

IN ADDITION, DURING 2005, THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $29.7 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X TIGER. NO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE CAPITALIZED

DURING 2006. FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION OF

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K

AT NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DESPITE THE INCREASE

IN EXPENDITURES, R&D AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT

IN 2006 AS COMPARED TO 2005 DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN REVENUE. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL

TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE

DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE

CENTRAL TO THE COMPANYS CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN R&D TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.

SELLING, GENERAL,

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (SG&A)

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A INCREASED $569 MILLION OR

31% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THESE INCREASES ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AN INCREASE OF $50 MILLION IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE RECOGNIZED AS

60

SG&A EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R,

A CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING,

HIGHER DIRECT AND CHANNEL SELLING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASE IN NET

SALES AND EMPLOYEE SALARY MERIT INCREASES, AND

THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 14TH WEEK ADDED TO THE FIRST FISCAL

QUARTER OF 2006

. DESPITE THE INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES, SG&A AS A

PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES IN 2006 REMAINED FLAT AS COMPARED TO 2005.

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A

INCREASED $434 MILLION OR 30% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THESE INCREASES ARE

DUE PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT IN

BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, A CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN

DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, AND HIGHER DIRECT AND

CHANNEL SELLING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASE IN NET SALES AND EMPLOYEE

SALARY MERIT INCREASES. SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES IN 2005 WAS

13%, DOWN FROM 17% IN 2004, WHICH IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES OF

68% FOR THE COMPANY DURING 2005.

FISCAL 2004 RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS

DURING 2004, THE COMPANY

RECORDED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $23.0 MILLION, INCLUDING

APPROXIMATELY $14.0 MILLION IN SEVERANCE COSTS, $5.5 MILLION IN ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS, AND $3.5 MILLION FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS. THE LEASE CANCELLATIONS

RELATE TO VACATING A LEASED SALES FACILITY AS A RESULT OF A EUROPEAN WORKFORCE

REDUCTION DURING 2004. OF THE $23.0 MILLION CHARGES, $21.3 MILLION HAD BEEN

UTILIZED BY THE END OF 2006, WITH THE REMAINDER CONSISTING OF $1.7 MILLION FOR

LEASE CANCELLATIONS. THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF 452

POSITIONS.

OF THESE NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS WERE $4 MILLION IN 2004.

INTEREST AND OTHER

TOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET INCREASED $200

MILLION OR 121% TO $365 MILLION DURING 2006 COMPARED TO $165 MILLION IN

2005 AND $53 MILLION IN 2004. THESE INCREASES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO

HIGHER CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT BALANCES AND INCREASING INVESTMENT YIELDS

RESULTING FROM HIGHER MARKET INTEREST RATES AND

THE 14TH WEEK ADDED TO THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2006

. THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED TO 4.58% IN 2006 COMPARED TO

THE 2.70% AND 1.38% RATES EARNED DURING 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE

CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FOREIGN

CURRENCY HEDGING EXPENSES.

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2004

CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF INTEREST ON THE COMPANYS $300 MILLION AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT UNSECURED NOTES, WHICH WERE REPAID UPON THEIR MATURITY IN FEBRUARY 2004.

THE UNSECURED NOTES

61

WERE SOLD AT 99.925% OF

PAR FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. TOTAL DEFERRED GAIN RESULTING

FROM THE CLOSURE OF DEBT SWAPS OF APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION WAS FULLY AMORTIZED

AS OF THE NOTES MATURITY IN FEBRUARY 2004.

PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 WAS APPROXIMATELY 29%. THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE RATE DIFFERS FROM THE

STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED

FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE

INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $20 MILLION DUE TO SETTLEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR

TAX AUDITS IN THE U.S., AND A NET BENEFIT OF $20 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE

DIVIDEND REPATRIATION UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (AJCA) AND

INTERNATIONAL TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPATRIATION AS

FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES,

AND TAX CREDITS OF $739 MILLION BEFORE BEING OFFSET AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED

LIABILITIES AND A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR PRESENTATION ON THE COMPANYS BALANCE

SHEET. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME,

INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING

STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL

BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5 MILLION WAS

RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF STATE OPERATING

LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE

REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR

AND AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE AJCA WAS SIGNED INTO LAW.

THE AJCA INCLUDED A PROVISION FOR THE DEDUCTION OF 85% OF CERTAIN FOREIGN

EARNINGS THAT WERE REPATRIATED, AS DEFINED IN THE AJCA, WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME

FRAME. AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS, DIVIDENDS QUALIFYING FOR THE 85% DEDUCTION

MUST BE REINVESTED IN THE UNITED STATES IN CERTAIN QUALIFIED INVESTMENTS

PURSUANT TO A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN APPROVED BY THE CEO AND BOARD OF

DIRECTORS. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS. OF THE EARNINGS REPATRIATED, $755 MILLION IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE

REDUCED TAX RATE PROVIDED BY THE AJCA. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX

CHARGE OF $51 MILLION RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF THE AJCA. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $71 MILLION

RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES TO RECOGNIZE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY NOT RECOGNIZABLE WITHIN CERTAIN

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS SUBSTANTIALLY

COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE

YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2003 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY INTENDS

TO CONTEST CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2002 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY

RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE

PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX

AUDITS BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS,

THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE

PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC ISSUED SAB NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS

WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SAB

NO. 108 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS SHOULD BE

CONSIDERED WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER THE CURRENT YEARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

MATERIALLY MISSTATED. SAB NO. 108 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING

AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2006. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE

THE APPLICATION OF SAB NO. 108, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE

ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS,

WHICH DEFINES

FAIR VALUE, PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE

DISCLOSURES REQUIRED FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 APPLIES TO

OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS; IT DOES

NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007 AND IS REQUIRED TO BE

ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE

66

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY

WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 157, MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION

NO. (FIN) 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY

IN INCOME TAXES-AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

. FIN

NO. 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES BY

CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW COMPANIES SHOULD RECOGNIZE, MEASURE, PRESENT, AND

DISCLOSE IN THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT THEY HAVE

TAKEN OR EXPECT TO TAKE IN A TAX RETURN. FIN NO. 48 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2006 AND IS REQUIRED TO BE

ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008. ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF FIN NO. 48,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN MAY 2005, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 154,

ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND

ERROR CORRECTIONS,

WHICH REPLACES APB OPINION NO. 20,

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

AND SFAS NO. 3,

REPORTING

ACCOUNTING CHANGES IN INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAN AMENDMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 28.

SFAS NO. 154 REQUIRES RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PRIOR PERIODS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A VOLUNTARY CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPAL UNLESS IT IS

NOT PRACTICABLE. SFAS NO. 154 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND

CORRECTIONS OF ERRORS MADE IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2005 AND IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2007. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF

SFAS NO. 154, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006, THE COMPANY HAD $10.11 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, AN INCREASE OF $1.85 BILLION OVER THE SAME BALANCES AT THE END OF

2005. THE PRINCIPAL

67

COMPONENTS OF THIS

INCREASE WERE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $2.22 BILLION, PROCEEDS

OF $318 MILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER STOCK PLANS, AND EXCESS

TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $361 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

CASH USED TO PURCHASE PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OF $657 MILLION AND

REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OF $355 MILLION IN CONJUNCTION WITH NET-SHARE

SETTLEMENTS ON VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. CASH

GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE $1.25 BILLION

PREPAYMENT FOR NAND FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUID

INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, APPROXIMATELY $4.1 BILLION OF THE

COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S.

INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES

THE COMPANYS TOTAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $657 MILLION DURING 2006, CONSISTING OF $200 MILLION

FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RETAIL

SEGMENT, $263 MILLION FOR REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS

FOR THE COMPANYS SECOND CORPORATE CAMPUS AND FOR A NEW DATA CENTER

,

AND $194 MILLION FOR CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS

ENHANCEMENTS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATES IT WILL UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY $675 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

DURING 2007, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $360 MILLION FOR EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS

RETAIL SEGMENT, APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION FOR REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SECOND CORPORATE CAMPUS AND ITS NEW DATA CENTER, AND

APPROXIMATELY $265 MILLION TO SUPPORT NORMAL REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CAPITAL

ASSETS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO GENERAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

STOCK REPURCHASE

PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE

COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP

TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE

COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY

SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANY HAS REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 13.1 MILLION

SHARES AT A COST OF $217 MILLION UNDER THIS PLAN AND WAS AUTHORIZED TO

REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS ON NONCANCELABLE OPERATING

LEASES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, $887 MILLION OF WHICH RELATED TO THE

LEASE OF RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES. LEASE TERMS ON THE COMPANYS EXISTING

MAJOR FACILITY OPERATING LEASES RANGE FROM 5 TO 15 YEARS.

PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO

MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL

ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. THESE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ACQUIRE

COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE

COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE

COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY

OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY

ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER

CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS FORECASTED COMPONENT AND

MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX SEMICONDUCTOR, INC.,

INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD.,

AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR

YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY PREPAID $1.25 BILLION FOR

FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS DURING 2006. THESE PREPAYMENTS WILL BE APPLIED TO

INVENTORY PURCHASES MADE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH RESPECTIVE AGREEMENT.

ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANYS ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY

SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS OF APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION WILL BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE

OBLIGATIONS.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANYS OTHER

OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTERNET AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF

ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE

SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS

ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER

WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN

INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER,

THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING

FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED

THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A LIABILITY

RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

69

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY REGULARLY

REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS AND ITS INTEREST RATE

SWAP AND OPTION POSITIONS, BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION

WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES.

HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THE HEDGES WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT

RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN

ADDITION, THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR RECOGNITION OF GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT

COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC

EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLDS LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE

COMPANYS INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE

GENERAL LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES. IN THIS REGARD, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST

RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

HEDGES.

THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT POLICY AND

STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS,

AND OPTIMIZE RETURN IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT. A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS CASH IS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL MANAGERS

WITHIN THE GUIDELINES OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICY AND TO AN OBJECTIVE

MARKET BENCHMARK. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL PORTFOLIO IS BENCHMARKED AGAINST

EXTERNAL MANAGER PERFORMANCE, ALLOWING FOR DIFFERENCES IN LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE

COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ISSUED BY

HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE COMPANYS GENERAL POLICY IS TO LIMIT THE RISK OF

PRINCIPAL LOSS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF INVESTED FUNDS BY LIMITING MARKET AND

CREDIT RISK. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH INITIAL MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS

WITH INITIAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, APPROXIMATELY $921 MILLION OF THE

COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5

YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, $287 MILLION OF THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5 YEARS. THE REMAINDER

ALL HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. THE COMPANY MAY SELL ITS

INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, IN ANTICIPATION

OF CREDIT DETERIORATION OR FOR DURATION MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET

LOSSES BEFORE TAXES OF $434,000 AND $137,000 IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY,

AND A NET GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $1 MILLION IN 2004 AS A RESULT OF SUCH SALES.

TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL

ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT

A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON

INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS

POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $15.2

MILLION DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN

A $19.9 MILLION DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF

THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY.

70

FOREIGN CURRENCY

RISK

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A

STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS NET SALES

AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THE

COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING DUE TO COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND

OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY

COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY

OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO

IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND

LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING A

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN

EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO

GENERATE 3,000 RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS

IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN

EXCHANGE PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT

INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND

MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE

MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR

VALUE OF $9.2 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM

ONE-DAY LOSS OF $10.0 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005. BECAUSE THE

COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, LOSSES INCURRED

ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 DUE TO

THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE CHANGES IN THE TIMING

AND AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES, AND THE COMPANYS

ACTUAL EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS

HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS

REPORTED IN THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR

AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

TYPICALLY, THE COMPANYS

FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. FISCAL YEARS 2005 AND 2004

WERE EACH 52-WEEK

YEARS. HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, THE COMPANY REPORTS A 53-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR TO ALIGN ITS FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS BY ADDING A

WEEK TO ITS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER. THE COMPANY ADDED THIS ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE

FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF ITS FISCAL YEAR 2006. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN

IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS FISCAL CALENDAR.

COMMON STOCK SPLIT

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005,

THE COMPANY EFFECTED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF FEBRUARY 18,

2005. ALL SHARE AND PER SHARE INFORMATION HAS BEEN RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID

INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES

GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANYS DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN

CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. MANAGEMENT

DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES THE

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DESIGNATIONS AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THESE SECURITIES

ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES,

REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS

BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS

EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT FAIR VALUE. DERIVATIVES THAT

ARE NOT DEFINED AS HEDGES IN STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

AS AMENDED, MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE

THROUGH EARNINGS. IF THE DERIVATIVE IS A HEDGE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

HEDGE,

77

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(CONTINUED)

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL EITHER BE OFFSET AGAINST

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, OR FIRM COMMITMENTS

THROUGH EARNINGS, OR RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED

ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN

THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS

EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES TO

EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY

AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT

PERIOD. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION IS REPORTED

IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD CONTRACTS

DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF

EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT

THE LOWER OF COST, COMPUTED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD, OR MARKET. IF

THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE MADE

CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANYS

INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINISHED GOODS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

PROPERTY, PLANT,

AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND

EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH FOR BUILDINGS IS

THE LESSER OF 30 YEARS OR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING BUILDING, UP TO

5 YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR 10 YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT

STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH

RANGE FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND

EQUIPMENT WAS $180 MILLION, $141 MILLION, AND $126 MILLION DURING 2006, 2005,

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET RETIREMENT

THE COMPANY RECORDS OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT

COSTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

. THE COMPANY REVIEWS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM THE

ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR NORMAL USE OF THE ASSETS. IF IT

IS DETERMINED THAT A LEGAL OBLIGATION EXISTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY

FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS

INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE LIABILITY IS ADDED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSET AND THIS

ADDITIONAL CARRYING AMOUNT IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW AND ITS

78

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY

ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND

CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY

OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF PROPERTY,

PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE

IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. FOR THE THREE

FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL

IMPAIRMENT OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, EXCEPT FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN

ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 6 OF

THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES SHOULD NOT BE AMORTIZED BUT RATHER BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON OR ABOUT AUGUST 30 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY

DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2006,

2005, OR 2004. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT

REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL

HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH

REPORTING UNIT.

SFAS NO. 142 ALSO

REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY AMORTIZING ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

DEFINITE LIVES OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 3 TO 10 YEARS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

ITS INTERNATIONAL NON-U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS

USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUE AND EXPENSES

FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN

EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE CREDITED

OR CHARGED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

79

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN

MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT

USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REMEASURE MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH  PERIOD, AND INVENTORIES, PROPERTY, AND

NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

THESE TRANSLATIONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE

OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, DIGITAL CONTENT, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS, INCLUDING AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE

REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE

EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS

FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA

ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS,

FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES,

THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE

COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING

TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT TO BE, FIXED OR DETERMINABLE,

REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND

PAYABLE.

REVENUE FROM SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED

AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE COVERAGE PERIODS. THESE CONTRACTS

TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, REPAIR SERVICES, WEB-BASED SUPPORT

RESOURCES, DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AND EXTEND THE SERVICE COVERAGE OFFERED UNDER THE

COMPANYS ONE-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY.

THE COMPANY SELLS SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS

OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING AND

RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN SALES TRANSACTIONS

WITH ITS CUSTOMERS, AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS

CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS

OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED.

REVENUE ON ARRANGEMENTS

THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES IS

ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT.

EACH ELEMENTS ALLOCATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN REVENUE RECOGNITION

CRITERIA FOR THAT ELEMENT HAVE BEEN MET. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY

VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE), WHICH IS BASED ON THE PRICE

CHARGED WHEN EACH ELEMENT IS SOLD SEPARATELY. IF THE COMPANY CANNOT OBJECTIVELY

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY UNDELIVERED ELEMENT INCLUDED IN A

MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL ALL ELEMENTS ARE

DELIVERED AND SERVICES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED, OR UNTIL FAIR VALUE CAN OBJECTIVELY

BE DETERMINED FOR ANY REMAINING UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF A

DELIVERED ELEMENT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE COMPANY USES THE RESIDUAL METHOD

TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS

DETERMINABLE. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED

ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS

ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE.

VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A

REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE  PERIOD THE

COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

GENERALLY, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT OFFER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN

CONNECTION WITH SOFTWARE SALES OR THE SALE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. WHEN THE COMPANY DOES OFFER SPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS, THE COMPANY

DEFERS REVENUE FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHT UNTIL THE

FUTURE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED OR WHEN THE RIGHT TO THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE

EXPIRES. ADDITIONALLY, A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE

AVAILABLE WITH MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO

UNSPECIFIED FUTURE UPGRADES OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM ON A WHEN AND IF

AVAILABLE BASIS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MAINTENANCE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY

OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM.

ALLOWANCE FOR

DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE AGE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

BALANCES, CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO PAY.

SHIPPING COSTS

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED,

AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS RELATED TO SHIPPING AND HANDLING ARE CLASSIFIED AS

REVENUE, AND THE COMPANYS SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF

SALES.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR

THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING

WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR

OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCTS

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS

AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 86,

COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED.

IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE, COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO

ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND

GENERALLY ALL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY EXPENSED.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY BEGAN

INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAC OS X VERSION 10.4

TIGER (TIGER) SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS

EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION IN AUGUST 2004 AND THE SUBSEQUENT

RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA VERSION OF THE PRODUCT. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED

APPROXIMATELY $29.7 MILLION AND $4.5 MILLION DURING 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIGER. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 86, AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET TO COST OF SALES BEGAN IN APRIL 2005

WHEN THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIPPING TIGER AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A THREE-YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

DURING 2004, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL

DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FILEMAKER PRO 7 SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A

DEVELOPER BETA VERSION, AND PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE

PRODUCT IN MARCH 2004. THEREFORE, DURING 2004, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED

APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF

FILEMAKER PRO 7. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86, AMORTIZATION OF THIS

ASSET TO COST OF SALES BEGAN IN MARCH 2004 WHEN THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIPPING

FILEMAKER PRO 7 AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A

THREE-YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

TOTAL AMORTIZATION RELATED

TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS $17.8 MILLION, $15.7 MILLION, AND

$10.7 MILLION IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $338 MILLION, $287 MILLION, AND

$206 MILLION FOR 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123

(REVISED 2004) (SFAS NO. 123R),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

,

WHICH ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN

ENTERPRISE RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISES EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED BY THE

ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. IN JANUARY 2005, THE SEC ISSUED SAB NO. 107,

WHICH PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR SFAS NO. 123R.

SFAS NO. 123R ELIMINATES THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD UNDER ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING

FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

, AND INSTEAD GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT

SUCH TRANSACTIONS BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING A FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD. THE COMPANY

USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON (BSM) OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE THE

FAIR-VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER SFAS NO. 123R, CONSISTENT WITH THAT

USED FOR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES UNDER SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING

FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE

MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD AS PERMITTED BY SFAS NO. 123R AND

ACCORDINGLY PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF SFAS NO. 123R.

THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD REQUIRES THAT STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE BE RECORDED FOR ALL NEW AND UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS,

RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES THAT ARE ULTIMATELY EXPECTED TO VEST AS THE REQUISITE SERVICE IS

RENDERED BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2005, THE FIRST DAY OF THE COMPANYS

FISCAL YEAR 2006. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 25,

2005 IS BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR-VALUE AS DETERMINED UNDER THE PRO FORMA

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED INCREMENTAL STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $117 MILLION DURING 2006 AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 123R. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS REDUCED BY $0.10 FOR

THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS

NO. 123R. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123R, BEGINNING IN 2006 THE

COMPANY HAS PRESENTED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARDS AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

CASH FLOWS.

NO STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION COSTS HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE

INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS $39 MILLION

FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006,

$375.2 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS

AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

PERIOD OF 2.91 YEARS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

SFAS NO. 123R PROHIBITS RECOGNITION OF A DEFERRED

TAX ASSET FOR AN EXCESS TAX BENEFIT THAT HAS NOT BEEN REALIZED. THE COMPANY

WILL RECOGNIZE A BENEFIT FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN EQUITY IF AN

INCREMENTAL TAX BENEFIT IS REALIZED BY FOLLOWING THE ORDERING PROVISIONS OF THE

TAX LAW. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON THE RESEARCH TAX CREDIT, THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT,

AND THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION THROUGH THE INCOME STATEMENT.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, THE

COMPANY MEASURED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY APB OPINION NO. 25.

THE COMPANY APPLIED THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 AS AMENDED

BY SFAS NO. 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE,

AS IF THE FAIR-VALUE-BASED

METHOD HAD BEEN APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE. UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25,

WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WAS EQUAL TO

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT, NO

COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE

ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AFTER TAXES AND NET INCOME PER COMMON

SHARE AS IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF

EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY

DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER

OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE

PERIOD INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK HAD BEEN ISSUED. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, RESTRICTED

STOCK, AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY

APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2RESTATEMENT OF

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE COMPANY IS RESTATING ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS

ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, AND EACH OF THE

QUARTERS IN FISCAL YEAR 2005.

PREVIOUSLY FILED ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K

AND QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AFFECTED BY THE RESTATEMENTS HAVE

NOT BEEN AMENDED AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON.

ON JUNE 29, 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN

INTERNAL REVIEW HAD DISCOVERED IRREGULARITIES RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF

CERTAIN STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE BETWEEN 1997 AND 2001, INCLUDING A GRANT TO

ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) STEVE JOBS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT

A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS (SPECIAL COMMITTEE) HAD BEEN FORMED

AND HAD HIRED INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES.

AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL REVIEW AND THE INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, AND THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AGREES, THAT INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES WERE USED FOR

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE IN PRIOR

PERIODS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ADDITIONAL NON-CASH STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS WITH REGARD TO PAST STOCK OPTION

GRANTS, AND THE COMPANY IS RESTATING PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

THIS FORM 10-K. THESE ADJUSTMENTS, AFTER TAX, AMOUNTED TO $4

MILLION, $7 MILLION, AND $10 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THE ADJUSTMENT TO 2006 WAS RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

FISCAL YEAR 2006 DUE TO ITS INSIGNIFICANCE.

THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND ITS FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS (INVESTIGATIVE

TEAM) REVIEWED THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING STOCK OPTION GRANTS

MADE ON 259 DATES. BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE TOTALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE

APPLICABLE LAW, THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOUND NO MISCONDUCT BY CURRENT

MANAGEMENT. THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF GRANTS

FOR WHICH GRANT DATES WERE INTENTIONALLY SELECTED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE

EXERCISE PRICES. THE TERMS OF THESE AND CERTAIN OTHER GRANTS, AS DISCUSSED

BELOW, WERE FINALIZED AFTER THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES. THE SPECIAL

COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THE PROCEDURES FOR GRANTING, ACCOUNTING FOR, AND

REPORTING STOCK OPTION GRANTS DID NOT INCLUDE SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT

MANIPULATION. ALTHOUGH THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT CEO STEVE JOBS WAS AWARE OR

RECOMMENDED THE SELECTION OF SOME FAVORABLE GRANT DATES, HE DID NOT RECEIVE OR FINANCIALLY

BENEFIT FROM THESE GRANTS OR APPRECIATE THE ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS. THE

SPECIAL COMMITTEE ALSO FOUND THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAD RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS

REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF TWO FORMER OFFICERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCOUNTING,

RECORDING AND REPORTING OF STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS FROM THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL REVIEW AND THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, AN

ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED OF THE MEASUREMENT DATES FOR THE 42,077 STOCK OPTION

GRANTS MADE ON 259 DATES BETWEEN OCTOBER 1996 AND JANUARY 2003 (THE RELEVANT

PERIOD). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ANALYSIS WAS PROPERLY LIMITED TO THE

RELEVANT PERIOD. IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING ALL GRANTS MADE DURING THE RELEVANT

PERIOD, THE COMPANY SAMPLED CERTAIN GRANTS BETWEEN 1994 AND 1997 AND FOUND NONE

THAT REQUIRED ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. THE FIRST GRANTS FOR WHICH STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS REQUIRED ARE DATED DECEMBER 29, 1997. THE COMPANY

ALSO EXAMINED GRANTS MADE AFTER THE RELEVANT PERIOD AND FOUND NONE THAT

REQUIRED ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. MOREOVER, IN THE YEARS AFTER 2002, APPLE MADE

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES IN RESPONSE TO

EVOLVING LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING LITERATURE AND RECENT

GUIDANCE FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), THE GRANTS DURING

THE RELEVANT PERIOD WERE ORGANIZED INTO CATEGORIES BASED ON GRANT

85

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2RESTATEMENT

OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

TYPE AND PROCESS BY WHICH THE GRANT WAS FINALIZED. THE

COMPANY ANALYZED THE EVIDENCE RELATED TO EACH CATEGORY OF GRANTS INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, ELECTRONIC AND PHYSICAL DOCUMENTS, DOCUMENT METADATA, AND

WITNESS INTERVIEWS. BASED ON THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY

APPLIED THE CONTROLLING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO DETERMINE, FOR EVERY GRANT

WITHIN EACH CATEGORY, THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATE. IF THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS

NOT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATE, ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE AS

REQUIRED, RESULTING IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX

EFFECTS.

THE 42,077 GRANTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS FOLLOWS: (1) 17

GRANTS TO PERSONS ELECTED OR APPOINTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (DIRECTOR

GRANTS); (2) 3,892 GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN

DESCRIBED BELOW (MONDAY/TUESDAY GRANTS); (3) 27,096 GRANTS MADE IN

BROAD-BASED AWARDS TO LARGE NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES, USUALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (FOCAL

GRANTS); (4) 9,988 OTHER GRANTS RATIFIED AT MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OR

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (MEETING GRANTS); (5) 1,082 OTHER GRANTS RATIFIED

BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT (UWC) OF THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (OTHER

UWC GRANTS); AND (6) TWO GRANTS TO THE CEO (CEO GRANTS). ALL REFERENCES

TO THE NUMBER OF OPTION SHARES, OPTION EXERCISE PRICES, AND SHARE PRICES IN

THIS NOTE 2 HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT STOCK SPLITS.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DIRECTOR GRANTS, ALL STOCK

OPTION GRANTS WERE SUBJECT TO RATIFICATION BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE AT A MEETING OR BY UWC. FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE GRANTS AT A MEETING

OR BY UWC, THE COMPANYS LEGAL STAFF WOULD PREPARE A SECRETARYS CERTIFICATE

CERTIFYING THE RATIFICATION OF THE GRANTS. BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

DESCRIBED BELOW, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE RECIPIENTS AND TERMS OF

CERTAIN GRANTS WERE FIXED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES BEFORE RATIFICATION PURSUANT

TO PARAMETERS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

THROUGH THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN AND THE FOCAL PROCESS. AS FURTHER DISCUSSED

BELOW, WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS, MANAGEMENT HAD THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE

RECIPIENTS AND TERMS FOR EACH GRANT. THUS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE

MEASUREMENT DATES FOR THESE GRANTS OCCURRED WHEN MANAGEMENTS PROCESS FOR

ALLOCATING THESE GRANTS WAS COMPLETED AND THE GRANTS WERE READY FOR

RATIFICATION, WHICH WAS CONSIDERED PERFUNCTORY. WITH REGARD TO ALL OTHER

GRANTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE GRANTS WERE FINALIZED AND THE

MEASUREMENT DATES OCCURRED WHEN THE GRANTS WERE RATIFIED. FOR MANY GRANTS,

HOWEVER, THE DATES OF RATIFICATION CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED BECAUSE THE DATES THE UWCS

WERE EXECUTED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR RECEIVED BY THE

COMPANY ARE NOT AVAILABLE. FOR SUCH GRANTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE

DATE OF THE PREPARATION OF THE SECRETARYS CERTIFICATE IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE

FOR DETERMINING THE ACTUAL DATE OF RATIFICATION.

AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS DETERMINED

THAT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES FOR 6,428 GRANTS ON 42 DATES ARE NOT

THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. ACCORDINGLY, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR FORFEITURES,

THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $105 MILLION ON

A PRE-TAX BASIS OVER THE RESPECTIVE AWARDS VESTING TERMS. NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE

REQUIRED FOR THE REMAINING 35,649 GRANTS. THE ADJUSTMENTS WERE DETERMINED BY

CATEGORY AS FOLLOWS.

DIRECTOR GRANTSSEVENTEEN DIRECTOR GRANTS WERE MADE

DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. TWO DIRECTOR GRANTS WERE MADE PURSUANT TO A 1997

PLAN THAT DATED THE GRANTS ON THE ENACTMENT OF THE PLAN. THE REMAINING FIFTEEN

GRANTS WERE AUTOMATICALLY MADE UNDER THE DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN 1998, ON THE DATE

OF A DIRECTORS ELECTION OR APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD AND ON SUBSEQUENT

ANNIVERSARIES, BEGINNING ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY. ACCORDINGLY, THE ANALYSIS

DETERMINED THAT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATE FOR EACH DIRECTOR GRANT IS

THE MEASUREMENT DATE, AND NO ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS ARE REQUIRED.

86

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2RESTATEMENT

OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

MONDAY/TUESDAY GRANTSBEGINNING IN DECEMBER 1998,

3,892 NEW HIRE GRANTS AND GRANTS FOR PROMOTION AND RETENTION PURPOSES (PROMOTION/RETENTION

GRANTS) WERE MADE DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD UNDER THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN. UNDER

THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN, NEW HIRE GRANTS MADE WITHIN PRE-ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES

APPROVED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WERE DATED ON THE MONDAY THAT

THE RECIPIENT STARTED WORK (OR THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, IF THE RECIPIENT STARTED

ON ANOTHER DAY). THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS SHOWED THIS PROCESS TO BE RELIABLE WITH

VERY LOW ERROR RATES. PROMOTION/RETENTION GRANTS, ALSO BASED ON PRE-ESTABLISHED

GUIDELINES, WERE MADE GENERALLY ON THE FIRST TUESDAY OF EACH MONTH. THE COMPANY

HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION/RETENTION GRANTS MADE PURSUANT TO

THE MONDAY/TUESDAY PLAN WITHIN PRE-ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES DO NOT REQUIRE

ADJUSTMENT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SIX GRANTS THAT WERE ERRONEOUSLY DATED BEFORE

THE EMPLOYEES START DATES. FOR 120 NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION/RETENTION GRANTS

MADE OUTSIDE THE GUIDELINES, HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE

MEASUREMENT DATES ARE THE DATES OF RATIFICATION BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE RATHER THAN THE DATES USED FOR GRANTS WITHIN GUIDELINES. ACCORDINGLY,

BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $6 MILLION FROM 126 GRANTS.

FOCAL GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, 27,096 FOCAL

GRANTS WERE MADE TO EMPLOYEES TYPICALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS PART OF AN

EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT REQUIRED SEVERAL MONTHS TO COMPLETE. PURSUANT TO LIMITS,

GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE,

MANAGERS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRANTS TO

EMPLOYEES IN THEIR AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY. AFTER SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAD

DETERMINED THAT THE GRANTS WERE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE ESTABLISHED

LIMITS, GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES, MANAGEMENT TREATED THE GRANTS AS FINAL WHEN

THEY WERE SUBMITTED TO THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FOR RATIFICATION. THE

COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT FOR 5,595 GRANTS ON FIVE DATES, THE ORIGINALLY

ASSIGNED GRANT DATES ARE NOT THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. FOR THESE GRANTS,

MANAGEMENTS PROCESS FOR FINALIZING THE GRANTS WAS COMPLETED AFTER THE ORIGINALLY

ASSIGNED GRANT DATES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED $29 MILLION OF

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. FOR TWO OF THE FIVE GRANT DATES COMPRISING

3,744 GRANTS, THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE GRANTS WERE FINALIZED AND THE

MEASUREMENT DATE OCCURRED ONE DAY AFTER THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES. THE

GRANTS ON THESE TWO DATES REPRESENT MORE THAN $16 MILLION OF THE TOTAL $29

MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM FOCAL GRANTS.

OTHER MEETING GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD,

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WERE HELD TO RATIFY 9,988

GRANTS THAT ARE NOT MONDAY/TUESDAY, FOCAL OR CEO GRANTS. THE GRANT DATES AND

MEASUREMENT DATES FOR THESE GRANTS ARE THE MEETING DATES WHEN THE GRANTS WERE

RATIFIED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 46 GRANTS. FORTY-TWO OF THESE 46 GRANTS ARE

DATED CONCURRENT WITH A MEETING THAT CONSIDERED AND APPROVED CERTAIN GRANTS,

BUT THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ALL OF THE GRANTS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FINALIZED

UNTIL A LATER DATE. ONE OF THE 46 GRANTS WAS APPROVED AND DATED AT ANOTHER

MEETING, BUT THE RECIPIENT, WHO WAS BECOMING EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY AS PART OF

A CORPORATE ACQUISITION, DID NOT START UNTIL A LATER DATE. TWO OTHER GRANTS

WERE APPROVED BEFORE THE EMPLOYEES START DATES. ANOTHER GRANT WAS MISTAKENLY

CANCELLED AND SUBSEQUENTLY REINSTATED, REQUIRING AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT.

THUS, FOR THESE 46 GRANTS THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED

GRANT DATES ARE NOT THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS

RECOGNIZED $2 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

OTHER UWC GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, 1,082

GRANTS WERE APPROVED BY UWCS FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING EXECUTIVE

RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, PROMOTION AND NEW HIRES OUTSIDE THE MONDAY/TUESDAY

PROCESS. THESE GRANTS WERE NOT MADE PURSUANT TO PRE-ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES

ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS

CONCLUDED THAT THESE GRANTS WERE

87

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2RESTATEMENT

OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOT FINALIZED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES UNTIL

RATIFICATION BY THE BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. ACCORDINGLY, FOR 660

GRANTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED GRANT DATES ARE

NOT THE PROPER MEASUREMENT DATES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED $48

MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

CEO GRANTSDURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, THE COMPANY

MADE TWO GRANTS TO CEO STEVE JOBS. THE FIRST GRANT, DATED JANUARY 12,

2000, WAS FOR 10 MILLION OPTION SHARES. THE SECOND GRANT, DATED OCTOBER 19,

2001, WAS FOR 7.5 MILLION OPTION SHARES. BOTH GRANTS WERE CANCELLED IN MARCH 2003

PRIOR TO BEING EXERCISED, WHEN MR. JOBS RECEIVED 5 MILLION SHARES OF

RESTRICTED STOCK.

WITH RESPECT TO THE GRANT DATED JANUARY 12, 2000,

THE BOARD ON DECEMBER 2, 1999, AUTHORIZED A SPECIAL CEO COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE TO GRANT MR. JOBS UP TO 15 MILLION SHARES. THE EVIDENCE

INDICATES THAT THE CEO COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FINALIZED THE TERMS OF THE GRANT

ON JANUARY 12, 2000, ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEES ACTION WAS MEMORIALIZED IN A

UWC TRANSMITTED ON JANUARY 18, 2000. BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE ORIGINALLY

ASSIGNED GRANT DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED ANY STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THIS GRANT. IF THE COMPANY HAD DETERMINED THAT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE WAS THE DATE WHEN THE UWC WAS EXECUTED OR RECEIVED, THEN

ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED.

THE GRANT DATED OCTOBER 19, 2001 WAS ORIGINALLY

APPROVED AT A BOARD MEETING ON AUGUST 29, 2001, WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$17.83. THE TERMS OF THE GRANT, HOWEVER, WERE NOT FINALIZED UNTIL DECEMBER 18,

2001. THE GRANT WAS DATED OCTOBER 19, 2001, WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$18.30. THE APPROVAL FOR THE GRANT WAS IMPROPERLY RECORDED AS OCCURRING AT A

SPECIAL BOARD MEETING ON OCTOBER 19, 2001. SUCH A SPECIAL BOARD MEETING

DID NOT OCCUR. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, THAT ANY CURRENT MEMBER OF

MANAGEMENT WAS AWARE OF THIS IRREGULARITY. THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED $20

MILLION IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THIS GRANT, REFLECTING THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF $18.30 AND THE SHARE PRICE ON DECEMBER 18,

2001 OF $21.01.

THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS DURING 2006 IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND DURING

2005 IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES, AND FOREIGN

SECURITIES WERE CAUSED PRIMARILY BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES WITH LOW PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT.

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS TO BE RATED SINGLE-A OR

BETTER. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE DECLINES TO BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THE INVESTMENTS TO

BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

MARKET VALUES WERE

DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHEN

EVALUATING THE INVESTMENTS FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY

REVIEWS FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS

BEEN BELOW COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS

ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, WHICH MAY BE

SUFFICIENT FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE.

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION,

CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK. IN ADDITION, WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY

DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE

FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA AND BY

ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS

AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANYS DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE

CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING

COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME

ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL,

THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE

COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR

MORE THAN 10% OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 OR SEPTEMBER 24,

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE

OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE

SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

PURCHASES THESE RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. THESE

NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN

OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, TOTALED $1.6 BILLION AND $417 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REFLECT

THE SALE OF THESE COMPONENTS IN NET SALES AND DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PROFITS ON

THESE SALES UNTIL THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH TO THE END CUSTOMER AT WHICH

TIME THE PROFIT IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION OF COST OF SALES.

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS

BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION

CONTRACTS ARE USED TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON CERTAIN EXISTING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUE AND COST OF SALES. FROM TIME TO

TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY THE

INTEREST RATE PROFILE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DEBT. THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING

POLICIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THE INSTRUMENTS ARE

DESIGNATED AS HEDGE OR NON-HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ALL

DERIVATIVES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AS OF

YEAR-END, AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT

OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE

COMPANYS GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON THESE TRANSACTIONS IF

ALL COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT,

BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE.

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS A

FUNCTION OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR

VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS AND PREVAILING

FINANCIAL MARKET INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24,

2005. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, FAIR VALUE, AND

CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT

REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY

REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET

CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY

COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY

OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO

IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, OR

LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

TO HELP PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANYS U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE, AND THE

COMPANYS NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES SELLING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES

HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE

SUBSIDIARIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

94

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 3FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED SALES

ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES

IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED

COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE AND INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER

A TIME HORIZON OF UP TO 6 MONTHS.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES

MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED HEDGED

TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A

SUBSEQUENT 2 MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE

IMMEDIATELY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY

SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO

REFLECTED IN CURRENT EARNINGS UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NET GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $421,000 IN

2006 AND NET LOSSES OF $1.6 MILLION AND $2.8 MILLION IN 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE

DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES AND DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET

CONDITIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED GAIN

ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION, NET OF TAXES,

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS BY THE

END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007.

THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE IS INCLUDED IN THE

CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006

AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD NET GAINS OF $7.4 MILLION AND

$673,000, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT.

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER

INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES RECORDED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES. DUE TO CURRENCY MARKET MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE CAN

LEAD TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

YEARS AND 5.5 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY SOLD CERTAIN ASSETS RELATED

TO ITS POWERSCHOOL WEB-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM OPERATIONS. IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS SALE, THE COMPANY REDUCED GOODWILL BY $31 MILLION FOR THE

OUTSTANDING BALANCE FROM THE ACQUISITION OF POWERSCHOOL, INC. IN 2001 AND

RECOGNIZED A $4 MILLION PRE-TAX GAIN, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN ADJUSTMENT OF

APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION TO GOODWILL RELATING TO A REDUCTION OF VALUATION

ALLOWANCES THAT WERE RECORDED AT THE TIME CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS (NOLS) WERE ACQUIRED IN PREVIOUS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. DURING

2005, THESE NOLS WERE DEEMED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED AND

ACCORDINGLY THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE REVERSED AGAINST THE RELATED GOODWILL

THAT WAS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITIONS.

THE FOREIGN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON

FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION, $922 MILLION, AND $384

MILLION IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006,

NOTE 7INCOME

TAXES

(CONTINUED)

APPROXIMATELY $4.1 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES

AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD

BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON

REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PROVIDE FOR ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE

FROM UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES

THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $823 MILLION

OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY

THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION

ACT OF 2004 (AJCA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE AJCA INCLUDED A PROVISION FOR THE

DEDUCTION OF 85% OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WERE REPATRIATED, AS DEFINED

IN THE AJCA, WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME FRAME. AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS, DIVIDENDS

QUALIFYING FOR THE 85% DEDUCTION MUST BE REINVESTED IN THE UNITED STATES IN

CERTAIN QUALIFIED INVESTMENTS PURSUANT TO A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN APPROVED

BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS. DURING 2006, THE

COMPANY REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. OF THE

EARNINGS REPATRIATED, $755 MILLION IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE REDUCED TAX RATE

PROVIDED BY THE AJCA. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX CHARGE OF $51

MILLION RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF

THE AJCA. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $71 MILLION

RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES TO RECOGNIZE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY NOT RECOGNIZABLE WITHIN CERTAIN

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE

EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS, AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF

EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED

USING ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH

THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

AND CREDITS DO NOT EXPIRE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX

ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF STATE OPERATING LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME

THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER

WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

THE INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE (IRS) HAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANYS

FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2003 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN

ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTEST CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS

THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS

PRIOR TO 2002 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX

EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH

CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED

IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE

REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION

OCCURS. IN 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $20 MILLION DUE TO

THE SETTLEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR TAX AUDITS IN THE U.S.

NOTE 8SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANY HAS FIVE

MILLION SHARES OF AUTHORIZED PREFERRED STOCK, NONE OF WHICH IS OUTSTANDING.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPANYS RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS IS AUTHORIZED TO DETERMINE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES,

PRIVILEGES, AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE COMPANYS AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES OF

PREFERRED STOCK.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS GRANTED

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO MEMBERS OF THE COMPANYS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM,

EXCLUDING ITS CEO. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GENERALLY VEST OVER FOUR YEARS

EITHER AT THE END OF THE FOUR-YEAR SERVICE PERIOD, IN TWO EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON

THE SECOND AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT, OR IN EQUAL

INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE FIRST THROUGH FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT

DATE. UPON VESTING, THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WILL CONVERT INTO AN EQUIVALENT

NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE AMOUNTS OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

EXPENSED BY THE COMPANY ARE BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER THE FOUR-YEAR REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS HAVE

BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE UTILIZING THE

TREASURY STOCK METHOD.

2.47 MILLION PREVIOUSLY

GRANTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VESTED DURING 2006. A MAJORITY OF THESE VESTED

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE NET-SHARE SETTLED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY WITHHELD

SHARES WITH VALUE EQUIVALENT TO THE EMPLOYEES MINIMUM STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR

THE APPLICABLE INCOME AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE

APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES WITHHELD OF 985,833 FOR 2006

WAS BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ON THEIR VESTING DATE AS

DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CLOSING STOCK PRICE. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE

EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS TO THE TAXING AUTHORITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $59 MILLION.

THESE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENTS HAD THE EFFECT OF SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY

AS THEY REDUCED AND RETIRED THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN

ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THE VESTING AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE

COMPANY.

CEO RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD

ON MARCH 19, 2003,

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS GRANTED 10 MILLION SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK

TO THE COMPANYS CEO THAT VESTED ON MARCH 19, 2006. THE AMOUNT OF THE

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD EXPENSED BY THE COMPANY WAS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET

PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND WAS AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE THREE-YEAR REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

SHARES WITH VALUE EQUIVALENT TO THE CEOS MINIMUM STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR THE

APPLICABLE INCOME AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE

APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES WITHHELD OF 4.6 MILLION WAS

BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD ON THE VESTING DATE AS

DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CLOSING STOCK PRICE OF $64.66. THE REMAINING SHARES

NET OF THOSE WITHHELD WERE DELIVERED TO THE COMPANYS CEO. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR

THE CEOS TAX OBLIGATIONS TO THE TAXING AUTHORITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $296

MILLION. THE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENT HAD THE EFFECT OF SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE

COMPANY AS IT REDUCED AND RETIRED THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND DID NOT

REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY.

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE

COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP

TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE

COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY

SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANY HAS REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 13.1 MILLION

SHARES AT A COST OF $217 MILLION UNDER THIS PLAN AND WAS AUTHORIZED TO

REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS: NET

INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO

REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS, AND LOSSES THAT UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY BUT

ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME. THE COMPANYS OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS

OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING

THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND NET DEFERRED GAINS

RESPECTIVELY. AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 WAS $262.5 MILLION. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT VESTED DURING 2006 TOTALED

2.47 MILLION AND HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $148.5 MILLION AS OF THE VESTING DATE. GRANTED

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED FROM THE SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT

UNDER THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION PLANS.

ACCRUED WARRANTY

AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR

WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE

PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE

COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO

REPAIR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE

ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER ITS BASIC LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTIES

AT THE TIME RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING

APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE

INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, HISTORICAL AND

PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND

KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS

TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING

WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY PROVIDES UPDATES TO ITS

APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO MAINTAIN THE SOFTWARES COMPLIANCE WITH

SPECIFICATIONS. THE ESTIMATED COST TO DEVELOP SUCH UPDATES IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS

WARRANTY COSTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME RELATED SOFTWARE REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS RELATED TO

SUCH UPDATES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF UNITS DELIVERED, THE NUMBER OF UPDATES

EXPECTED TO OCCUR, AND THE HISTORICAL COST AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COST OF THE

RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THESE UPDATES.

THE

COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND

APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES

THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE

COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY

COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM

AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT

BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN

INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND,

IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO

UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT

COSTS AS OF EITHER SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 OR SEPTEMBER 24, 2005.

CONCENTRATIONS IN

THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS

ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC

INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ASICS)) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM

SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE

AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME

COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY,

AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM

COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED

WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF

THE SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE

DELAYED OR CURTAILED, OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS

SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO SHIP

RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE

COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS CPUS,

LOGIC BOARDS, AND ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING

PARTNERS, PRIMARILY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS

CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE

UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION OBLIGATIONS.

LONG-TERM SUPPLY

AGREEMENTS

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX SEMICONDUCTOR, INC.,

INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD.,

AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR

YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY PREPAID $1.25 BILLION FOR

FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS DURING 2006. THESE PREPAYMENTS WILL BE APPLIED TO

INVENTORY PURCHASES MADE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH RESPECTIVE AGREEMENT.

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND

HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND

CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

108

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 10COMMITMENTS

AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE

PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE

LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR

REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF

ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR

RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED

IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS

EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE

BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

NOTE 11SEGMENT

INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

,

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH. THE

MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR

MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANYS

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC

BASIS. THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE

AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND JAPAN REPORTABLE

SEGMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE AMERICAS

SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE RETAIL SEGMENT

OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, AND THE U.K. OTHER

OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE ASIA-PACIFIC, WHICH INCLUDES AUSTRALIA AND ASIA

EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY, FILEMAKER, INC. EACH

REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES, AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS

SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING

SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES. THE RETAIL SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE IS ALSO EVALUATED

BASED ON OPERATING INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT

INCLUDES NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, RELATED COST OF SALES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES

DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT

EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT ARE MANAGED OUTSIDE

THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE

VARIOUS CORPORATE EXPENSES SUCH AS MANUFACTURING COSTS AND VARIANCES NOT

INCLUDED IN STANDARD COSTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CORPORATE MARKETING

EXPENSES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, VARIOUS NONRECURRING

CHARGES, AND OTHER SEPARATELY MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

INCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORT OF THE RETAIL

SEGMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS

FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. SEGMENT ASSETS EXCLUDE CORPORATE ASSETS.

CORPORATE ASSETS INCLUDE CASH, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS,

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, GOODWILL AND

OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND RETAIL STORE CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS

THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION. EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL

109

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 11SEGMENT

INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

(CONTINUED)

EXPENDITURES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT REPORTED TO

MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $200

MILLION, $132 MILLION, AND $104 MILLION FOR 2006, 2005, AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY.OPERATING INCOME FOR ALL SEGMENTS, EXCEPT RETAIL, INCLUDES COST OF

SALES AT MANUFACTURING STANDARD COST, OTHER COST OF SALES, RELATED SALES AND

MARKETING COSTS, AND CERTAIN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THIS MEASURE OF

OPERATING INCOME, WHICH INCLUDES MANUFACTURING PROFIT, PROVIDES A COMPARABLE

BASIS FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE COMPANYS VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. CERTAIN

MANUFACTURING EXPENSES AND RELATED ADJUSTMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN SEGMENT COST OF

SALES, INCLUDING VARIANCES BETWEEN STANDARD AND ACTUAL MANUFACTURING COSTS AND

THE MARK-UP ABOVE STANDARD COST FOR PRODUCT SUPPLIED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT, ARE

INCLUDED IN CORPORATE EXPENSES.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE

RETAIL SEGMENT DIFFERENTLY THAN IT ASSESSES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANYS GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME

IS INTENDED TO DEPICT A MEASURE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR

CHANNEL PARTNERS IN THE U.S. OPERATING RETAIL STORES SO THE COMPANY CAN

EVALUATE THE RETAIL SEGMENT PERFORMANCE AS IF IT WERE A CHANNEL PARTNER.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY MAKES THREE SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RETAIL

SEGMENT FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS

OF THE COMPANYS OTHER SEGMENTS.

FIRST, THE RETAIL SEGMENTS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES

COST OF SALES FOR APPLE PRODUCTS AT AN AMOUNT NORMALLY CHARGED TO MAJOR CHANNEL

PARTNERS IN THE U.S. OPERATING RETAIL STORES, LESS THE COST OF SALES PROGRAMS

AND INCENTIVES PROVIDED TO THOSE CHANNEL PARTNERS AND THE COMPANYS COST TO

SUPPORT THOSE PARTNERS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF

ADDITIONAL COST OF SALES ABOVE STANDARD COST BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND AN

OFFSETTING BENEFIT TO CORPORATE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $663 MILLION, $435

MILLION, AND $213 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SECOND, THE COMPANYS SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS

ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AT THE SAME COST AS THAT CHARGED TO THE

COMPANYS MAJOR RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS IN THE U.S., RESULTING IN A MEASURE OF

REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN FOR THOSE ITEMS THAT IS COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE COMPANYS

RETAIL STORES AND THOSE RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT RECOGNIZES

THE FULL AMOUNT OF REVENUE AND COST OF SALES OF THE COMPANYS SERVICE AND

SUPPORT CONTRACTS AT THE TIME OF SALE. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EARNED

THE REVENUE OR INCURRED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THESE CONTRACTS,

AN OFFSET TO THESE AMOUNTS IS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS NET SALES

AND COST OF SALES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THIS RESULTED IN

THE RECOGNITION OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WITH

CORRESPONDING OFFSETS IN OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS, OF $159 MILLION AND $109

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THIS

RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL

SEGMENT OF $92 MILLION AND $64 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 25,

2004, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE

RETAIL SEGMENT OF $54 MILLION AND $37 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THIRD, THE COMPANY HAD OPENED A TOTAL OF EIGHT

HIGH-PROFILE STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THESE HIGH-PROFILE STORES

ARE LARGER THAN THE COMPANYS TYPICAL RETAIL STORES AND WERE DESIGNED TO

FURTHER PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND PROVIDE A VENUE FOR CERTAIN CORPORATE SALES

AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CORPORATE BRIEFINGS. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY

ALLOCATES CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE STORES TO CORPORATE

MARKETING EXPENSE TO REFLECT THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT REALIZED COMPANY-WIDE. THE

ALLOCATION OF THESE OPERATING COSTS IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT INCURRED FOR A HIGH-PROFILE

STORE IN EXCESS OF THAT INCURRED BY A MORE TYPICAL COMPANY RETAIL LOCATION.

EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE MARKETING RESULTING

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

APPLE COMPUTER, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS OF APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL

POSITION OF THE COMPANY AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE

YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, IN CONFORMITY

WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005

AND FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005

HAVE BEEN RESTATED.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 25, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE

PROVISION OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123 (REVISED

2004),

WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

APPLE COMPUTER, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, THAT APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, BASED

ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). APPLE COMPUTER, INC.S MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE APPLE COMPUTER, INC.S

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY

OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT APPLE

COMPUTER, INC. MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY COSO. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION,

APPLE COMPUTER, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, BASED

ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY COSO.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, AND THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR

EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND

OUR REPORT DATED DECEMBER 29, 2006 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON

THOSE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE

REVIEW INTO STOCK OPTION GRANT PRACTICES AND RESTATEMENT

AS DISCUSSED IN THE EXPLANATORY NOTE PRECEDING PART I

AND IN NOTE 2 IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K,

THE COMPANY ON JUNE 29,

2006, ANNOUNCED THAT AN INTERNAL REVIEW HAD DISCOVERED IRREGULARITIES RELATED

TO THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTS, INCLUDING A GRANT TO ITS

CEO STEVE JOBS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF OUTSIDE

DIRECTORS (SPECIAL COMMITTEE) HAD BEEN FORMED AND HAD HIRED INDEPENDENT

COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION

GRANTING PRACTICES. AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL REVIEW AND THE INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, AND THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AGREES, THAT INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES WERE USED FOR

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE IN PRIOR

PERIODS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ADDITIONAL NON-CASH STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS WITH REGARD TO PAST STOCK OPTION

GRANTS, AND THE COMPANY IS RESTATING PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

THIS FORM 10-K.

THE INTERNAL REVIEW

AND THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF

OCCASIONS BETWEEN OCTOBER 1996 AND JANUARY 2003 (THE RELEVANT PERIOD)

WHEN THE COMPANY USED INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION ALSO FOUND THAT DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD.

·

PROCEDURES

FOR GRANTING, ACCOUNTING, AND REPORTING OF STOCK OPTION GRANTS DID NOT INCLUDE

SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT MANIPULATION

·

THE

GRANT DATES FOR A NUMBER OF GRANTS WERE INTENTIONALLY SELECTED IN ORDER TO

OBTAIN FAVORABLE EXERCISE PRICES

·

·

STEVE JOBS WAS AWARE OR RECOMMENDED THE SELECTION OF SOME FAVORABLE GRANT

DATES, BUT HE DID NOT RECEIVE OR FINANCIALLY BENEFIT FROM THESE GRANTS OR

APPRECIATE THE ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS

FROM 2003 THROUGH

2005, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED IMPROVEMENTS TO PROCEDURES, PROCESSES, AND

SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS AND GREATER INTERNAL CONTROL OVER THE

STOCK OPTION GRANTING AND ADMINISTRATION FUNCTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT (SOX) AND EVOLVING ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THESE IMPROVEMENTS

INCLUDED.

·

·

THE INTERNAL REVIEW AND THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION

DISCOVERED NO STOCK OPTION GRANT AFTER JANUARY 2003 THAT REQUIRED

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS.

IN COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COMPANYS

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE IMPACT OF THE RESTATEMENT TO THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THIS AREA AS OF

THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED 2006 AND 2005. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, THEREFORE, THAT

CONTROL DEFICIENCIES RESULTING IN THE RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DID NOT CONSTITUTE A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, OR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006.

IN ADDITION TO THE

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED BETWEEN 2003 AND 2005 DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE

COMPANY WILL ADOPT OTHER MEASURES IDENTIFIED BY THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE AND

MANAGEMENT TO ENHANCE THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STOCK OPTION GRANTING AND

ADMINISTRATION FUNCTION AND THE REVIEW AND PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

INCLUDING.

·

THE

COMPANY WILL ENGAGE EXPERIENCED GENERAL COUNSEL, INCREASE THE RESOURCES OF THE

CORPORATE LEGAL DEPARTMENT, AND REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROCEDURES AND

PRACTICES

·

THE

CFO WILL ARRANGE FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO UNDERTAKE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING TO

ENHANCE AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES FOR ACCOUNTING

AND FINANCIAL REPORTING, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELEVANT TO STOCK OPTIONS

·

THE

COMPANY WILL REVIEW ALL CURRENT POLICIES, PRACTICES, AND CONTROLS RELATED TO

THE GRANTING OF STOCK OPTIONS AND PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO THOSE WHO

IMPLEMENT THOSE POLICIES AND PROCESSES, AS NEEDED

·

THE

COMPANY WILL ESTABLISH IMPROVED PROCEDURES FOR REGULAR COMMUNICATION AMONG THE

GENERAL COUNSEL, THE CFO, AND STOCK ADMINISTRATORS TO IMPROVE MONITORING OF ALL

COMPANY PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS, INCLUDING FORMAL WRITTEN

CONFIRMATION THAT ALL GRANT DATES CORRESPOND PRECISELY WITH THE DATES

AUTHORIZED

·

THE COMPANY WILL ALSO

ESTABLISH IMPROVED PROCEDURES FOR THE REVIEW OF THE PREPARATION AND

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT

EVALUATION OF

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON AN EVALUATION

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT,

THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE

CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND

15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

(EXCHANGE ACT) WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 TO ENSURE THAT

INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR

SUBMITS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS (I) RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND

REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION RULES AND FORMS AND (II) ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

121

INHERENT

LIMITATIONS OVER INTERNAL CONTROLS

THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

(I)

PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS;

(II)

PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT THE COMPANYS RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS;

AND

(III)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS CEO AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS

WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER

HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE,

ASSURANCE THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM ARE MET. FURTHER, THE

DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE

CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR

COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO

EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT ALL CONTROL

ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. ALSO, ANY EVALUATION

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS IN FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT

THOSE INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN BUSINESS

CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES

MAY DETERIORATE.

POLICY ON AUDIT

COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES PERFORMED BY THE

INDEPENDENT

AUDITORS

PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

OF 2002 (THE 

ACT

), THE COMPANY ADOPTED AN

AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE POLICY THAT BANNED ITS AUDITORS FROM PERFORMING

NON-FINANCIAL CONSULTING SERVICES, SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING

AND INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES. THIS AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE POLICY ALSO MANDATES

THAT THE AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES AND RELATED BUDGET BE APPROVED BY THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE IN ADVANCE, AND THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE BE PROVIDED WITH

QUARTERLY REPORTING ON ACTUAL SPENDING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY, ALL

SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED BY KPMG WERE PRE-APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT, THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE MET WITH KPMG TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS OF THAT ACT AS IT

RELATES TO AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE. KPMG PREVIOUSLY ROTATED THE LEAD AUDIT PARTNER

IN FISCAL YEAR 2005, ROTATED OTHER PARTNERS IN 2006, AND WILL ROTATE ADDITIONAL

PARTNERS AS APPROPRIATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE WILL

CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY KPMG TO COMPLY WITH THE ACT.
